FADE IN:

EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes
small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth
playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights.

On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a
tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise
in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods
of the   foothills.

EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY

Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and
parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out
a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.

INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor
collides with the debris of a recent party.

She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and
house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses.

Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding
glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool.

A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water
onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer.

He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the
vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.

INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY

The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE
LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.

OWNER
I've got the five stores here and
then two in Rio Rancho.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       2.

JOE
That's fantastic. See, if we're
talking that kind of volume I can
absolutely massage the numbers a
little. Seriously, you're not gonna
be able to keep it on the shelf.

Joe pulls out some order forms.

OWNER
Yeah, I'd need to look at some
things before I can place an order.

The owner looks at Joe's business card.

OWNER
How about I give you a call if I
decide to--

JOE
I'll call you. Not a problem. No
problem at all. Even better, I'll
swing by. You're on my route. How
`bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.

OWNER
Yeah, tomorrow's not good.

JOE
Thursday then. That's better
anyway. That'll give you a chance
to take a look see on those other
stores. We'll put everything on one
order and get you a good price
break.

The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.

JOE
My advice to you - weed out some of
this weaker product to make more
space for the corn. Like this...

Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.

JOE
Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright
idea was it to stock that? I mean
come on, what self respecting kid
asks his mom for apricot fruit
leather?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     2A.

The owner is not amused.

EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY

Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters
to his rusted Monte Carlo.

EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY

Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH
LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with
MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the
exchange with amusement.

Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits
the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and
joins the fray.

MR. KIM
You are fired.

NORAH
I so don't care.

Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she
continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might
not have been the best decision ever.

NORAH
Fuck.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        3.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY

A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and
kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down
the drain. Gone.

Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill
onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the
empty hall.

INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR - SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY

A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove
compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath
freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY

The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a
shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his
attention to another customer.

The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin.

A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the
businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to
horrible anticipation. He braces for the...

CUT TO:

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER

Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish
man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt,
talks to the STORE OWNER.

CARL
Yep, these shotgun cases are a real
pain in the ass. What we call a
wide field of contamination.
(MORE)

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     4.
CARL (cont'd)
Guy's all over the place and every
little glob of him's a biohazard.

The owner rubs his temples.

CARL
Gonna lose some inventory.

OWNER
Selfish bastard.

CARL
Trust me, you do not want some lady
suing you cuz she found this guy's
tooth in her brand new fanny pack.

A ABOVE AND BEYOND WORKER in a polo shirt waves his arm to
get Carl's attention.

CLEAN SWEEP WORKER
He's over here in fishing too.

CARL
Yep, a real pain in the ass.

Carl walks over to his assistant. Detective, `MAC' MACDOWELL,
approaches the owner.

MAC
We're wrapping it up.

OWNER
Three grand just to have the
asshole wiped up off the floor. Can
you believe that?

Mac and another DETECTIVE walk toward the entrance.

MAC
Hey, can you handle the report
tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do.

DETECTIVE
A blonde thing or a brunette thing?

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp
features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her
confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life
peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     5.

A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong.
You are powerful. You can do anything. You are a winner.'

Rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face.

ROSE
I am strong. I am powerful. I can
do anything. I am a winner.

She doesn't look like she believes it.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged
pop-can-pipe.

NORAH
The fact that we have sex, real
coitus sex, means I'm under no
obligation to blow you.

Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to
RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's.

RANDY
I think you're scared of it.

The phone RINGS.

Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing
the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one.

NORAH
(Holding in the smoke)
I'm not scared of it.

RANDY
Uncomfortable then. You just need
to get better acquainted.

Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The
phone RINGS again.

NORAH
(yelling)
Dad, get the phone.

RANDY
There's absolutely no pressure
here.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     6.

Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah
ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers.
She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear.

The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks
up the receiver.

RANDY
You can touch it if you want.

NORAH
(into phone)
Hello.

ROSE (O.S.)
(through receiver)
You haven't left yet? Damn it
Norah, my class starts in fifteen
minutes.

NORAH
(into phone)
I know, I know.

As Norah holds the phone her eyes slide from Randy's face to
his off screen penis. She takes the pencil from behind her
ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead
or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.

14   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                        14 *

Joe sits in the living room, busily putting stickers on cans         *
of Fancy Corn. Norah and Randy enter from Norah's room.              *

JOE                                           *
Doesn't Rose have her thing                             *

I'm going. I need to borrow your                        *

Here. Take some corn.                                   *

Norah leaves. Randy and Joe share an awkward silence.                *

RANDY                                         *
I'm really nuts about your                              *
daughter, Mr. Lorkowski.                                *

That's nice. Give me a hand with                          *
this.                                                     *

They put stickers on popcorn cans.                                     *

RANDY                                           *
I see they sold that house across                         *

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Randy pulls up to a small house and stops. Norah gets out,
collects the canister from back and heads inside.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Norah enters the tidy two bedroom house with a barrel of
Fancy Corn under her arm.

NORAH
Sorry.

ROSE
I'm gonna be so late.

Oscar runs from the bedroom and flings himself onto Norah.
Pale and skinny, Oscar is the kind of kid easily picked off
in slaughter-ball.

NORAH
I brought fancy corn!

ROSE
(Looking for her purse)
How can you eat that stuff?

Norah and Oscar both jam a handful into their mouths.

ROSE
He'll be hyper all night.

Rose finds her purse and quickly puts on lipstick. She leans
down and gives Oscar a kiss on the forehead.

ROSE
Be good.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     8.

She turns to Norah.

ROSE
And no lobsterman stories. He had
nightmares all week.
(opening the door)
Just use some common sense.

NORAH
You're welcome.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Rose lies on her back being fucked. Her head nearly hits the
headboard with each thrust.

ROSE
You want me?

Rose closes her eyes. Her head starts to thump the headboard.

MAC
(Rhythmically)
Yeah... baby... I want... Oh...

Mac comes.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Oscar and Norah lie in Oscar's little bed. Oscar holds the
covers tight under his chin. Norah drinks a beer. There's a
half eaten canister of `Fancy Corn' between them.

NORAH
He's slowly freezing to death and
he knows lobsterman is out there...
somewhere... coming for him. And
he's totally screwed because his
tongue is stuck to the mailbox.

OSCAR
Why did he lick the mailbox?

NORAH
I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and
he was obsessed with licking
mailboxes.

OSCAR
Why wasn't he in school?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     9.

NORAH
Are you gonna let me tell the
story?

Oscar nods.

NORAH
An then, he hears a horrible sound.
Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag.
Lobsterman is coming.

OSCAR
Maybe he didn't go to school
because he had the ACD.

Norah looks at Oscar.

OSCAR
Sorry.

Norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down
next to another empty.

NORAH
He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the
skin off his tongue and make a run
for it lobsterman will tear him to
pieces with his razor sharp claws.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Curtains drawn in the cheap hotel room. Rose gets out of bed
and pulls on her clothes. Mac watches for a moment, then
rolls out of bed. He stops. Grimaces.

ROSE
Still sore?

Mac shakes his head and pretends not to be.

ROSE
I don't know why you did that.

MAC
You should hear the way he goes on
about his lean body mass index
bullshit. Drinking that
antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme
crap all the time.

Mac limps over to his clothes hanging over a chair.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        10.

ROSE
When was the last time you even
played basketball?

MAC
He needed to be brought down a peg
or two.

ROSE
I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle
humbled him.

Rose smiles and Mac pretends to be offended.

MAC
I should introduce him to your
sister.

ROSE
Norah and a cop? That would happen.

Mac shrugs and steps into his slacks.

MAC
We were working a scene today where
this guy offs himself in a sporting
goods store. So they had this
cleaning crew out there, right?
You would not believe how much
money they charge for that shit.
It's ridiculous.

ROSE
With the dead body there?

MAC
Naw, the body's gone, it's just the
blood and stuff.

ROSE
Sounds horrible.

Rose peels the backing off a nicotine patch and carefully
sticks it on her arm.

MAC
You ask me it's a racket. You
should get into that.

Rose slips on her blouse looks at Mac.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        11.

ROSE
You think that's all I can do?
Clean other people's shit?

MAC
(He sighs)
Come here.

Rose steps toward him and eyes Mac as he buttons her blouse.

MAC
You know that's not what I think.

ROSE
I am gonna be a real estate agent.

Rose rubs the nicotine patch on her arm. Mac nods and smiles.

MAC
I know. With business cards.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy
TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans
out the window and exhales, takes another toke.

The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub
out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.

NORAH
It's about time. I thought your
class got over at 9:30.

Rose looks at Oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch.

ROSE
Why isn't he in bed?

NORAH
Said he was scared. I think he was
fakin' it though.

Rose fumbles in her purse and pulls out a ten-dollar bill.

NORAH
I'm not taking money.

ROSE
It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad
told me about you getting fired.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   12.

Norah makes a face like `great, here it comes.'

ROSE
What happened?

NORAH
Nothing.

ROSE
What, were you stoned or something?

Norah waves her hand dismissively.

NORAH
It was just Mr. Kim being a dick
head.

ROSE
I thought you liked Mr. Kim.

NORAH
Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started
working there. Now he's a full on
gym teacher, I swear to God.

ROSE
When are you going to grow up and
start taking responsibility for--

NORAH
Oh please, you love it when I fuck
up. Love it. Me screwing up gives
you the hugest woody.

ROSE
Shut up and take the ten.

Norah takes the ten. Rose looks at the TV.

NORAH
There was a diner scene earlier.
With a waitress.

Rose looks at Norah.

ROSE
Any pie?

Norah smiles and opens the door to leave.

NORAH
Completely pie free.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        13.

INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Rose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another MOLLY MAID
wipes down the last window.

Through the window, a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks
toward the house with shopping bags in hand.

MOLLY MAID
The lady's here.

Rose nods and heads downstairs.

INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

PAULA DATZMAN-MEAD sets her bags down on the table and fishes
a checkbook from her purse. Rose enters with the vacuum
cleaner in tow.

ROSE
We're all finished. Since it's our
first visit we did the blinds and
appliances but normally we'll
alternate those weekly. Nobody
mentioned anything to us about
laundry so we didn't bother with
that but if you want laundry
included there is an extra...

PAULA
Rose? Rose Lorkowski?

Startled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time.

PAULA
It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading
squad junior year.

Recognition punches Rose in the face.

ROSE
Paula Datzman. Wow.

Awkward silence.

ROSE
How are you?

PAULA
Great! I'm Paula Datzman-Mead now.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        14.

ROSE
Congratulations.

PAULA
Thanks. We're expecting our second
in a couple of months.

Paula pats her swollen belly and Rose forces a smile.

PAULA
How are you? You look just the
same.

ROSE
I'm good. Really good!

PAULA
God, I always envied you so much.
Head cheerleader... dating the
quarterback... So did you and Mac end
up getting married?

ROSE
Nope. No.
(Awkward silence)
I'm not sure...I think he ended up
marrying Heather Volkman.

PAULA
Wow. Well it's so good to see you.
Let me get your info so I can send
you an invite to the baby shower.

Paula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to Rose.

PAULA
It'll be like a big reunion. The
whole gang from high school will be
there.

Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper.

PAULA
So what are you doing now?

Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question.

ROSE
I... I've just gotten my real estate
license, and so...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        15.

PAULA
Real estate?

ROSE
Yeah, this... this is just kind of a
temporary thing and I'm about to
just really phase over into the
real estate full time.

PAULA
You're kidding, I'm in real estate!

Paula pulls a business card from her purse and hands it to
Rose. The card has a picture of Paula's smiling face.

PAULA
With Long and Foster. Who are you
with?

ROSE
Me? Um. You know, I haven't really
decided yet. I might check out Long
and Foster.

Paula nods. Uncomfortable.

PAULA
Maybe you'll just be independent.

ROSE
Yeah. Maybe.

They grasp for something to say. They fail.

PAULA
What was that about the laundry?

EXT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - DAY

Rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies
out to a rusted Nissan Sentra with a Molly Maid door magnet.
She throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch, starts to
close it, then stops.

Rose walks to the side of the car, peels off the Molly Maid
magnet and throws that in as well. She looks at the Datzman-
Mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame.

She gets into the car and cries. Her cell phone rings. She
digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        16.

ROSE
Hello.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Oscar sits outside the counselor's office on a bench. He
cranes his neck to watch the secretary typing forms.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rose sits nervously across from the school COUNSELOR, a
serious man in his mid forties and a TEACHER with cotton
candy hair. The man speaks first.

COUNSELOR
It's not just this incident. There
have been several episodes over the
past year where Oscar has... has
engaged in disruptive behavior.

Rose shifts her eyes from the counselor to the teacher and
back to the counselor.

COUNSELOR
There was the incident in gym
class.

ROSE
I did pay the damages for that.

COUNSELOR
And the chalk thing.

Rose bites a fingernail.

COUNSELOR
And the time he locked Jeremy
Johnston in the--

ROSE
Okay. What did he do this time?

COUNSELOR
Now it's... licking.

Rose looks confused.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   17.

TEACHER
I will not tolerate it. I will not
tolerate that behavior in my
classroom.

COUNSELOR
Oscar has started licking things in
the classroom.

Rose looks even more confused.

TEACHER
First it was the pencil sharpener.
Then the aquarium.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The secretary stops typing and offers a sympathetic glance to
Oscar. He capitalizes on the moment by licking the wall.

COUNSELOR (O.S.)
It's unsanitary. And it's
disturbing to the other children.

The secretary recoils and returns to her typing.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The counselor leans forward with genuine concern.

COUNSELOR
We think Oscar might benefit from
an environment where he could
receive more specialized attention.

TEACHER
He licked my leg.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     18-19.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Oscar finds Joe asleep on the Lazy Boy. He snores in that
scary sleep apnea way ­ holding his breath between snores.

Oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf
of a book case. He pulls up a chair to investigate.

The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. Behind it,
dusty books about birds. Oscar grabs the binoculars and
climbs down.

Oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too
far apart. Oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking
through only one lens. He focuses on his grandpa's nose hair.

Joe wakes.

JOE
Where'd you get those?

OSCAR
Up there.

Oscar points to the book shelf. Something sad stirs in Joe.

JOE
Come here.

Oscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars
and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's
small face. Better.

JOE
Those were your grandma's. She'd
watch birds with those.

Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and
clunks them against a lamp in the process.

JOE
Hey, hey. Careful.

Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars.

JOE
Why don't we put those away.

Oscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow.
Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       19A.

OSCAR
Why can't I play with them?

JOE
Because it's not a toy. It's a
scientific instrument.

Oscar's disappointed.

JOE
You can play with them when I'm
around to supervise.

OSCAR
You're around now.

JOE
I'm tired now.

Joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them
back on the shelf.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Rose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish.

ROSE
Well I'm not putting him in special
ed. I'll figure out a way to put
him in private school before I do
that.

NORAH
Rose, you buy generic cigarettes
with couch change. How are you
gonna pay for private school?

JOE
Who's going to private school?

Rose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way.

ROSE
Nobody dad, we're just talking.

JOE
Oscar get suspended again?

Yes, that's it.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       19B.

JOE
The kid's a little strange. What?
That's against the law now? It's
not like he's out killing kittens
or any damn thing. I swear
everyone's so damn uptight these
days.

29A   INT. FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY                                       29A

Oscar rides a mechanical horse.

Rose pushes a cart down the isle and dials her cell phone.
She grabs a box of cereal and tosses it in her cart.

INT. MAC'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Mac sits at the table with a cup of coffee and reads the
paper. A young girl holds out the telephone.

MAC
Hello.

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

ROSE
Mac, it's me.

MAC
What are you doing calling here?

ROSE
I know, I'm sorry.

MAC
Heather could have easily--

ROSE
I thought she had yoga on
Saturdays.

MAC
Still, it's not cool.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       19C.

ROSE
I know, I'm sorry. I just needed to
ask you... you know the other day...
you said that... about the
specialized cleaning guys making so
much money...

30B   EXT. FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY                                           30B

Rose and Oscar walk to the car with the groceries.

INT. FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Lorkowski family dines in style.

ROSE (O.S.)
Are you even listening?

Norah turns to face Rose at the other side of the table.

NORAH
No thanks.

ROSE
What do you mean `no thanks'? What
else do you have to do? You don't
have a job. You don't go to school.
What, are you going to live with
Dad the rest of your life?

NORAH
I don't think you're in any
position to feel superior.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        20.

JOE
Girls, come on. Lets have a nice
dinner.

ROSE
It's just until I get my real
estate license.

The staff sings a BIRTHDAY SONG at a table nearby.

OSCAR
I want to have my birthday at
Hinkle's.

JOE
The hell with Hinkle's, I'm taking
us to Disney Land!

Oscar's eyes light up as he smiles at Joe.

ROSE
Dad don't.

OSCAR
Why? I think Disney Land is a great
idea!

Rose gives Joe a sharp look.

JOE
Yeah, what's wrong with Disney
Land? And I think it'd be great if
you girls worked together.

NORAH
You are so out of touch.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

A large bellied SUPERINTENDENT leads Rose and Norah up a
flight of stairs. Beads of sweat drip from his doughy face.

SUPER
Some sorta domestic disturbance
kind of a deal. It was the lady who
got the last word I guess. Course
she's in jail now, so... Heard one
bullet completely shot off his ring
finger. How long you gals been
doin' this kind a work?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       20A.

ROSE
A while.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        21.

SUPER
(Checking out Rose)
You know Mac pretty well?

Norah shoots Rose a look. Rose doesn't answer. They arrive at
the door of the apartment. The super unlocks the door.

SUPER
Just swing by the office when
you're done and we'll settle up.

INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - DAY

Rose and Norah step into the apartment littered with dirty
dishes and clothes.

Rose walks down the hall while Norah examines a plastic bird
with top hat. It tips down and drinks from the glass.

ROSE (O.S.)
Found it.

INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Norah and Rose stand frozen at the threshold. They are awe
struck by the horrible scene in front of them.

Blooms of splattered blood dry on tile walls. It gathers in
sticky brown lines around grout. The mirror is broken. The
shower curtain hangs half torn.

NORAH
Think they loved each other?

ROSE
Yeah.

INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER

Hands pull on yellow cleaning gloves.

Pinkish foam slides down Norah's glove as she scrubs bloody
grout with a toothbrush.

Metal shower rings CLINK against the metal bar as Rose pulls
down the shower curtain.

A rag is wrung out in a bucket of reddish water.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        22.

Rose and Norah clean in silence. Reverent but detached. The
way you would act at a stranger's funeral.

INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Norah puts blood spattered towels into a washing machine.

She spots a dish on the dryer filled with pennies and buttons
and other odds and ends. She fishes out a PINK CANDY HEART.
It reads, `Luv U 4 ever'.

Norah pockets the candy.

INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Rose and Norah gather their cleaning supplies and stand back
to admire their handiwork.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Norah hangs back while the super hands Rose a check.

SUPER
You gals did a real nice job.

As Rose turns to leave she flashes the check to Norah. Five
hundred bucks. Rose raises an eyebrow. Cha-ching.

EXT. BAR - DAY

Joe walks though a low rent part of town carrying a barrel of
Fancy Corn. He ducks into the neighborhood bar.

INT. BAR - DAY

Joe enters a dingy little corner bar where everyone's a
regular. A couple of old guys slump over the bar. The
BARTENDER smiles.

BARTENDER
Hey Joe, what you got for me?

JOE
World's finest corn snack.

Joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a
stool. The bartender pours him a beer.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        23.

BARTENDER
See where old Miller's house sold?

Joe nods. A grizzled REGULAR nearby looks over at Joe.

REGULAR
Bet you could get a chunk of change
for your place. You should cash out
now before the market turns sour.

Joe shakes his head.

JOE
I'm not selling my house. No way. I
don't care how much those idiots
would shell out for it. I got
history in that house. You think
they understand about history?

REGULAR
Still... How much commission you
get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta
sell a lot of corn to-

JOE
Hey, the corn's good. Really good.
Not like the pet food but that was
a phenomenon.

The bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space
between Joe and the grizzled regular.

JOE
It'll get there. Takes time to get
to know the market. Develop a
relationship with the buyers. But
it'll get there. Who doesn't like
popcorn for Christ's sake.

REGULAR
My brother-in-law's in sales.

The regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn.

REGULAR
Last year he buys a cow.

JOE
Why would you buy a cow?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07         24.

REGULAR
Not a live cow. A whole butchered
cow from a rancher. On the hoof
they call it.

JOE
Mm hmm.

Joe looks at him with renewed interest.

REGULAR
He sells off the parts of this cow
to a bunch of restaurants. Direct.
Made a killing.

The grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers.

JOE
What'd he do with the brains and
intestines?

Regular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning.

JOE
So he cuts out the middle man. Not
a bad idea.

Joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over.

JOE
Course it'd be smarter to do that
with something that didn't have bad
parts. Like... shrimp.

EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - SIX DAYS LATER - MORNING

Another day in paradise.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Norah sleeps in her clothes and makeup from the previous
night. Knocking wakes her.

JOE
(though the door)
Rose is on the phone. Norah?

NORAH
I'm sleeping.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        25.

JOE
She says it's important.

With great effort Norah picks up the receiver.

NORAH
What do you want?

ROSE
Mac got us another gig.

NORAH
I'm sleeping.

ROSE
I'll pick you up in an hour.

NORAH
No.

EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

Rose's Nissan rolls down a rough looking Albuquerque street
toward a trailer park.

INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY

Rose sips her 7-11 coffee. Norah stares blank and blood-shot.

NORAH
You suck.

ROSE
Money.

NORAH
You still suck.

ROSE
Apparently some crazy bag lady
squatter person died and--

NORAH
You didn't get me coffee?

ROSE
I didn't know you wanted any.

NORAH
Of course I...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        26.

Norah shakes her head in frustration.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rose turns into the trailer park, heads past a row of
trailers, and parks.

Rose and Norah get out of the car and approach a particularly
run down trailer.

NORAH
How long is this gonna take?

ROSE
All we have to do is go in and
throw everything away. Cake.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rose and Norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of
decayed flesh splashes them in the face. They lift their T-
shirts up over their noses and walk inside.

Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean
like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates.

Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ. She
darts to another room and retches.

ROSE
Great, now we're gonna have to
clean that up too.

Rose walks into the bedroom, blanches and stifles a gag
reflex. Norah storms past Rose and out the door.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rose chases after Norah and grabs her arm.

ROSE
Where are you going?

NORAH
There is no way.

Norah shakes off Rose and walks down the row of trailers.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       26A.

ROSE
You said you would help me.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        27.

NORAH
(without turning)
Maybe if you'd gotten me a coffee.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that
only her eyes are exposed.

She strains to open a window that's been painted shut. She
bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge.

Rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of
the window in an attempt to break the seal. Rose grows more
desperate with each failed effort.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Norah watches Rose struggle with the window.

Pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick.
Birdseed tumbles on to her shoe. She turns.

A weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and
tosses birdseed to the pigeons.

NORAH
I'm standing here.

Norah looks back up to Rose still struggling with the window.
Finally, Rose muscles it open and throws Norah an angry look
of triumph. There!

49A   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE STREET - DAY                                      49A

Joe and Oscar drive to a potential sale.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Norah ties a shirt around her face as she enters.

They turn their attention to the discolored mattress
attracting flies in the corner.

NORAH
What do we do with that?

Rose shrugs. Looks around.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   27A.

ROSE
Dumpster?

Rose and Norah lift the mattress and drag it to the door.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        28.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

Rose and Norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to
the dumpster. It is a clumsy process. The thing tips and
falls on Norah.

INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY

Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business.
Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families.

Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to
Joe and the MANAGER.

MANAGER
You're telling me this Fancy Corn
stuff is some kind of health food?

JOE
Well, it's a candy... and a health
food. Absolutely. Absolutely.

MANAGER
Yeah, I don't know. We don't have
much more shelf space.

Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about
five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients
off a Twizzler package.

JOE
Glycerol monostearate? What is
that? I can't even read that.

Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the
ingredients.

JOE
Read that.

The manager leans close.

MANAGER
High fructose--

JOE
No. The first thing listed. The
number one ingredient.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       28A.

MANAGER
Corn.

JOE
Exactly. Corn. Can you think of
anything more wholesome? It's all
American for Christ's sake.

The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions
himself next to the girl.

OSCAR
Do you know if they sell fancy corn
here?

The girl looks at him suspiciously.

OSCAR
Do you even know what fancy corn
is?

GIRL
Yes.

OSCAR
Well, do they sell it here?

GIRL
I dunno.

She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar.

OSCAR
I heard that the strawberry fancy
corn gives you bionic strength.

GIRL
That's stupid.

OSCAR
It's true. Some kind of chemical in
the strawberry flavoring. If you
eat a whole lot of it, it gives you
bionic strength.

The girl gives Oscar a long stare.

GIRL
I don't believe you.

OSCAR
I don't care if you do or not.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       28B.

The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and
tugs her mother's shirt.

JOE
I read where these chemicals are
getting into the streams, making
hermaphrodidic frogs! You think
mothers want to expose their kids
to that stuff? No way. More and
more people are looking for healthy
alternatives which is why the
demand for this product is so huge
right now.

MANAGER
Like I said, I already put in all
the orders I want for this year.

Just then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager.

GIRL'S MOTHER
Excuse me. Do you carry something
called fancy corn?

Joe looks at Oscar. Oscar smiles.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      29-30.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

Much progress has been made on the trailer. Rose and Norah
work on the last remaining piles of trash.

NORAH
It seems wrong though doesn't it...
to throw everything away.

Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the
garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it.

Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the
ID looks street-worn and crazy.

NORAH
I bet this is her.

Rose sweeps. Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls
out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon.

Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school
photos. Each photo is of a different grade. Norah flips
through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.

NORAH
Wow, look at this.

Norah holds the senior photo next to the ID. The resemblance
between the two is clear.

NORAH
Think it's her daughter?

Rose looks. Shrugs.

NORAH
Shouldn't we do something? Try to
find her or something?

ROSE
That's none of your business,
Norah.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        31.

Rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers.
She screams and drops the bag. A giant ball of maggots
writhes at her feet.

ROSE
(pointing)
Hand me that.

Norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to Rose.

NORAH
What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't
you want to know if this was mom?

Norah looks closely at the I.D. as Rose deposits trash and
maggots into the garbage bin. The comparison angers Rose.

ROSE
Mom was never like this. Mom would
never have been like this.

Norah thinks about that and looks back at the I.D.

NORAH
I wonder how she died?

ROSE
Damnit Norah, we still have a lot
of shit to do here. Are you just
gonna talk?

EXT. CANDY STORE - DAY

Joe and Oscar roll a handcart strapped with Fancy Corn
canisters through the parking lot to the car.

JOE
That was real good. You're a
natural. You got the timing, you
got the nerve. You're a real sharp
cookie, you know that?

OSCAR
No I'm not. I'm stupid.

JOE
You're not stupid. What are you
saying? You're not stupid.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   32.

OSCAR
Yes I am. They want to put me in
retard classes.

JOE
Don't say that.

OSCAR
What?

JOE
It's those teachers who are
retarded. You're probably just too
advanced for those classes. You're
bored. Do you get bored in class?

OSCAR
Yeah.

JOE
See. You're too smart! And those
teachers just don't know how to
handle you. You're probably a
goddamn genius.

OSCAR
You think so?

JOE
I know so!

EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - DAY

Weeds grow in the yard of the small house.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY

Norah empties the contents of the fanny pack onto her bed.
She examines the photos and picks up what appears to be a
senior photo. She turns it over and sees, written on the
back, LYNN WISEMAN - 1998.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Rose's Sentra is again parked next to the blue Camry.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        33.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Same room as before. Same curtains drawn. Mac unzips Rose's
skirt and kisses her neck.

ROSE
It was so disgusting. I mean the
smell, you would not believe.

Mac's in the sex zone. He unbuttons his shirt and tunes out
all those distracting words tumbling from Rose's mouth.

Rose, animated, slips her skirt off and tosses it aside.

ROSE
There were flies everywhere and,
really, the smell. I can't even
describe it.

Mac's shoes hit the floor with a thud. He sets his belt and
gun on the dresser.

MAC
Shhhh.

Rose pulls her shirt over her head. Mac kisses her belly.

ROSE
But, after we finished... you woulda
never even known. We took all that
away... made it right.

Mac pulls off his pants. Rose hangs her bra on the back of
the chair and slips off her undies.

MAC
I can't believe you... I mean, I feel
like I got you into this mess.

Her sense of pride wilts. Her hand instinctively reaches up
to massage the nicotine patch on her arm.

ROSE
No, I--

MAC
Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real
estate classes. Okay?

Rose looks at Mac. Shrugs. Mac smiles.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        34.

MAC
We'll get you your license and then
get you a little photo in the real
estate section. You can drive
people around all day and talk
about... Gosh, what would you talk
about?
(Suddenly very serious)
Crown molding?

Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke.

ROSE
Oh yeah, definitely talk about
crown molding.

The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac.

ROSE
Property easements, square footage,
appliances...

Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk.
He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow.

MAC
You're holding out on me.

Rose rolls her eyes and laughs.

ROSE
Freak.

MAC
Say it. Come on. One time.

She smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents.

ROSE
Curb appeal.

Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose
laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck.

He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand.
It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where
his wedding ring isn't.

Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring.

ROSE
Why'd you pick her?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        35.

Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades.

MAC
You know it wasn't like that.

ROSE
How was it like?

He takes a step back.

MAC
Are you going to do that?

ROSE
No.

MAC
If this is going to get all heavy--

ROSE
No.

Rose turns around and kisses Mac. One of those soft, teasing
kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear.

EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY

Rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area
and double checks the address on a scrap of paper.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY

Rose and Norah enter this no frills operation. Cinder block
walls and concrete floors. A small TV on the front counter
offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up.

As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the
counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees
searching for something small and lost.

ROSE
Winston?

WINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full
lips, looks up.

ROSE
I spoke with you on the phone. I'm
Rose Lorkowski.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        36.

Rose sticks out her right hand.

Winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He
clumsily shakes her hand with his left.

ROSE
So, our situation is...

On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and
Norah both turn and look at the TV.

The waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word.
Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues.

ROSE
We're doing some postmortem kind of
um... specialized cleaning stuff and
we had this really difficult...

NORAH
Smelly.

Rose looks at Norah and nods.

ROSE
Really smelly job where the lady
had died and they didn't find her
for a while and it was really...

NORAH
Stinky.

ROSE
The odor was really strong.

WINSTON
A decomp.

Rose smiles a little too enthusiastically.

ROSE
Yeah, a decomp!

Winston motions them to follow him through the store. He
indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice.

WINSTON
General purpose cleaners,
extraction cleaners, odor control.
We carry both the Winzyme and the
DR 450. Disinfectants, stain
removers and shampoos.
(MORE)

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        37.
WINSTON (cont'd)
Steamers, buffers, foggers, that
kinda stuff's in there, for rent or
purchase. Quick absorbing sawdust,
good for vomit.

The tour ends at the back corner where respirators, safety
glasses, gloves and Tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves.

WINSTON
And you've got your personal
protective gear back here.

The door BEEPS as it opens. CARL SWANSON walks in wearing his
`Above and Beyond' polo shirt. Winston returns to the
counter.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY

Carl grabs a case of disinfectant and sets it on the counter.
Winston pulls out some paperwork.

CARL
You hear there're a couple of
amateurs poaching jobs?

Winston shakes his head.

Rose and Norah make their way to the counter with arms full
of supplies and stand within earshot of Carl and Winston.

CARL
Bruce said they took a decomp for
five hundred bucks. What do you
wanna bet they threw all that shit
right in the dumpster.

Norah nudges Rose. Carl pays and Rose and Norah watch him
leave. They step up and set their supplies on the counter.

As Winston rings them up, Rose notices the shellacked puzzle
picture of a big white cat on the wall.

ROSE
Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a
hard one. I think I got lost in the
white and gave up.

Rose flashes a `captain of the cheerleading squad' smile.

WINSTON
Fifty-eight twenty-four.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        38.

ROSE
You like cats?

Winston looks squarely at Rose and steps into the back room.

NORAH
Great. You freaked him out.

ROSE
I asked him if he liked cats.

Winston returns with several books and pamphlets. Hazmat
Guidelines, Biohazard Recovery and Disposal, etc.

WINSTON
Bring these back.

INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY

Rose drives while Norah scans one of the books.

NORAH
Turns out it's against the law to
throw bio hazards in the dumpster.
Who knew?

Rose processes the visit.

NORAH
How perfect was he with the one
arm?

ROSE
Hmm?

NORAH
The creepy guy. Do you think he was
born like that?

ROSE
I didn't think he was creepy.

NORAH
Dude, he has one arm.

ROSE
They think we're just a couple of
hacks.

NORAH
We are a couple of hacks.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   39.

Norah looks out the window.

NORAH
Stop here.

ROSE
Why?

NORAH
I gotta thing. Just drop me off
here.

Rose looks confused but pulls over.

EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Norah opens the door and slides out.

ROSE
I'll drop Oscar by around seven.

NORAH
(sarcastically)
You have class tonight?

Rose smiles uncomfortably.

ROSE
Mortgage lenders and financing.

Norah shakes her head in disgust.

NORAH
Heather's pregnant again. Did you
know that? He's never going to
leave her.

Rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering
wheel. Norah gets out of the car.

NORAH
God, you're pathetic.

Norah slams the door and watches Rose drive off.

Norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number
listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN.

Just then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door
and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        40.

FOLLOWING THROUGH STREETS

They walk several blocks, Norah keeping a safe distance
behind Lynn.

EXT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY

Lynn opens the door to the building and disappears inside.
Norah follows.

INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY

Lynn steps into an elevator. Norah does too.

INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

The doors close. Lynn slaps the `stop elevator' button.
Norah emits a small yelp.

LYNN
Who are you?

NORAH
What?

LYNN
Why are you following me?

NORAH
I'm not following you.

LYNN
You are following me!

Lynn freezes for a moment. It seems she isn't even breathing.
Her anger twists into fear.

LYNN
Aren't you?

Norah remains silent. Lynn paces back and forth.

LYNN
Oh no.

NORAH
What?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        41.

LYNN
Shit! This is not happening.

Norah is uncomfortable. Lynn spins around to face Norah.

LYNN
Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I
thought you were following me.

NORAH
That's all right.

Lynn steps closer.

LYNN
You think I'm crazy.

NORAH
No. No I don't.

LYNN
I'm not crazy.

NORAH
It was a mistake. No big deal.

Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens.

LYNN
It's not moving.

NORAH
Let's press the alarm button.

Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud
quick ring. They wait for something to happen.

An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another
quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the
ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises.

Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick
sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small,
illustrated hands before her.

LYNN
Go to the university?

NORAH
Me? No.

Lynn leans close and checks out the book.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        42.

NORAH
Hobby...

Lynn sizes Norah up.

NORAH
There's this gorilla who knows sign
language and I've always thought
that would have to be the most
amazing thing ever. You know? To
actually talk to a gorilla.

LYNN
I think I've seen something on--

Norah nods.

NORAH
KoKo.

LYNN
Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.

Norah offers a sad nod.

NORAH
Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's
fault. She was heartbroken.

A KNOCKING sound reverberates through the elevator.

LYNN
Kind of weird, don't you think?
Teaching a gorilla to talk.
Probably, gorillas aren't supposed
to talk.

NORAH
That's what's so cool about it.

Lynn takes a long bold look at Norah. Norah sweats. The
elevator moves.

LYNN
I'm sorry again about the...

NORAH
No, don't... it's fine.

Lynn lightly touches the crook of Norah's arm.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        43.

LYNN
You've got nice veins.

Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a
familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood
Services."

LYNN
You should give blood.

Lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a
rack. She glances back with a smile just as the doors close.

EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is dark except for a TV in the living room and a
light in Norah's bedroom window.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf
next to the candy heart. Then, she drops to the floor and
pulls the LUNCH BOX from under her bed.

She surveys the contents: lipstick tipped cigarette butts, an
eyelash curler, a Blue Jay feather, an old photo.

In the photo two girls, twelve and five, stand with their
mom. A cigarette dangles from the mother's ruby red mouth.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

This time Rose's Sentra sits alone. No blue Camry in sight.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Rose lies in bed and listens to cars go by on the highway.
She checks her watch, picks up the phone and dials.

ROSE
Hi. Could you tell me what time you
have? Okay. Thanks.

Rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed, feet dangling off
the edge. She stares at the ceiling and whispers.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   44.

ROSE
I am strong. I am powerful. I am a
winner.
(pause)
I'm a fucking idiot.

71A   INT. MOTEL HALLWAY- NIGHT                                       71A

Rose stands in the motel's glass enclosed hallway watching
the world go by.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe clears the dinner table while Oscar occupies himself with
markers, construction paper, and a creative impulse.

Rose walks in defeated.

JOE
You're back early.

ROSE
I'm quitting real estate.

JOE
What are you talking about? You
can't quit real estate. You're
gonna be great at real estate. You
got the whole look and besides,
that's where everything's headed.
Hell, it's what I should have done
forty years ago.

ROSE
Shut up.

Rose sits at the table next to Oscar. She looks miserable.
Oscar looks at his mom.

OSCAR
Want me to make you something
happy?

Rose can't help but smile.

ROSE
Yeah. I'd like that.

JOE
Make me something happy too.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       44A.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY

Rose hands Winston a canister of Fancy Corn and a business
card. Rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a
style of a child's drawing. It reads, "Sunshine Cleaning."

WINSTON
Sunshine Cleaning. Nice.

ROSE
Thought we'd put a positive spin on
things. My son drew the design.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        45.

Oscar stares at Winston's empty sleeve.

WINSTON
That's a nice job you did there.

OSCAR
Where's your arm?

ROSE
Oscar!

WINSTON
That's all right.

ROSE
I was thinking maybe I could set a
few out by the register?

WINSTON
Yeah sure.

Rose hands Winston a stack of cards. He places them in an owl
business card holder in front of several Clean Sweep business
cards.

WINSTON
This is great but you guys should
really get out there and market
yourselves.

Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns
it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should
turn it off. He does.

ROSE

So, marketing? Like...?

WINSTON
Funeral Homes, property managers...
What you really want is to get in
with the insurance companies. They
can throw you a ton of work.

Oscar walks into the back room.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

The room is jammed with model planes, cars and boats in
various stages of construction. A hobbyist's fantasy land.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        46.

Oscar's mouth drops open.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY

Winston puffs up a bit with `manly know how'.

WINSTON
Do you guys have your B.B.P.
certification?

ROSE
B.B. who?

Winston smiles.

WINSTON
Blood Born Pathogens. The big money
jobs... they'll expect you to be
certified. I can register you for
the next seminar if you want.

EXT. LAWSON'S USED CAR LOT - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY

Rose, Norah, Oscar and Joe follow SHERM LAWSON across the car
lot. Rose shoots an irritated look to her dad.

ROSE
(whispering to Norah)
Did you ask him to come.

NORAH
Not exactly.

Joe positions himself next to Rose.

JOE
(Quietly to Rose)
Now Sherm's gonna say he's against
the wall but don't you believe him.
There's always some wiggle room.

ROSE
I can handle it.

The troop comes to a stop in front of a large blue van.

SHERM
I think you're gonna like this
Econoline.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       46A.

Sherm opens the back doors. Rose, Joe and Sherm stick their
heads inside. Rose nods.

JOE
The girls have started up their own
specialized cleaning business.
Crime scene and trauma clean-up.

ROSE
It's a real growth industry.

SHERM
Sounds kinda gory.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        47.

ROSE
Can be. Can be.

Rose surveys the interior space.

ROSE
We gotta take any contaminated
materials to the incinerators. So
we'll need lots of space back here.

OSCAR
For the bloody stuff.

ROSE
So, how much is this?

SHERM
Nineteen Ninety-nine.

JOE
What's the play on that?

SHERM
Oh, that's the floor right there.
I'm actually taking a loss on this
to make room for some new product.

ROSE
Well, I could pay cash.

SHERM
Cash is good.

Sherm walks around and unlocks the driver's side door.

JOE
(whispering to Rose)
Ask him about the bumper.

ROSE
What?

JOE
The dented bumper.

Rose approaches Sherm with a smile.

ROSE
I noticed the bumper's kind of
banged up.

Sherm smiles.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       47A.

SHERM
Character.

JOE
We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas
earlier. They got a nice looking
Chevy G series for eighteen.

SHERM
Power steering?

Joe nods.

Oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look. He
sees the CB mounted on the ceiling and tugs Norah's sleeve.

OSCAR
What's that?

NORAH
Oh, excellent.

ROSE
God, do people even use those
anymore?

OSCAR
What is it?

Sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate.

SHERM
It's a CB. You talk into this thing
and hold this thing down and it
turns your voice into radio waves
and sends it into the heavens.

OSCAR
Heaven?

Sherm tosses the keys to Rose.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      48.

SHERM
Why don't you take it for a test
drive.

Rose, Norah and Oscar pile into the van. Joe hangs back with
Sherm.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Econo van rumbles by.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        49.

INT. VAN - DAY

Rose drives. Norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a
70s era porno. Oscar kneels between them staring at the CB.

NORAH
Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?

ROSE
No.

OSCAR
Try the CB!

Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She
adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest
hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static.

Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed.
She clicks the CB off.

ROSE
Antenna's probably broke.

Norah points out the window.

NORAH
Ice Cream Hut!

EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY

Rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the
picnic table where Norah and Oscar wait.

Norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building
across the street. A big bosomed woman sits on the porch with
a rabbit in her lap.

NORAH
How cool to live across from the
Ice Cream Hut.

Rose distributes the melty goods.

ROSE
You should rent it. Seriously,
you're making money now.

Norah assesses the building. The RABBIT LADY sees them
staring. She waves. Rose and Norah turn around amused.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        50.

NORAH
Yeah well, what about Dad?

ROSE
Oh please, Dad would survive just
fine. You should do it.

As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of
chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and
on to Norah's leg.

NORAH
Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure
the perimeter.
(To Rose)
Don't you teach this kid anything?

Norah demonstrates proper technique. She extends her tongue
out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the
cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate.

LYNN (O.S.)
It's the gorilla girl.

Norah looks up to see Lynn with a milk shake in hand. An
involuntary smile breaks across Norah.

LYNN
You never came to donate.

NORAH
Yeah.

Lynn looks at Rose. An awkward moment passes.

NORAH
My sister.

Rose smiles, nods a hi. Something familiar about the girl
nags at Rose. She searches to connect a face out of context.

Lynn eyes Norah. Chemistry.

LYNN
We have snacks you know. Juice
boxes.

NORAH
Had I known about the juice
boxes...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        51.

Rose makes the connection - her smile drops. Lynn picks up on
the tension between the two.

LYNN
Okay. Well, see you around.

Lynn leaves. Rose slaps Norah with an accusing look.

EXT. LAWSON'S USED CAR LOT - DAY

Joe stands with Sherm and waits for the girls to return. He
looks at his watch.

SHERM
You still selling that luggage?

JOE
No, no. That was a whole big mess.

SHERM
Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it?

Sherm smiles. Joe's smile disappears.

JOE
Yeah, that's been a while now.
Dropped the luggage around the time
your other lot when out of
business.

Touche. Sherm's smile dissolves.

SHERM
I could maybe drop it to nineteen
even.

Joe holds out for more.

SHERM
And toss in some wiper fluid.

Joe smiles.

EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY

Rose, Norah and Oscar walk back to the van. Everyone's
slightly stickier. Rose clenches her jaw.

ROSE
What the hell?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       51A.

NORAH
I just wanted to give her the
pictures.

ROSE
You took the pictures? Why would
you do that? We could get in a lot
of trouble for that.

NORAH
Relax, I didn't give them to her.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ONE WEEK LATER -
EVENING

Joe sits in his Lazy Boy as Norah hauls a box from her room.

NORAH
It's just three blocks away.

JOE
I know.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        52.

NORAH
It's not like I'm never gonna see
you.

JOE
Hey, I think you should have done
this a long time ago.

Joe strains to be cavalier but he can't look at Norah.

EXT. HOTEL - NEXT DAY - DAY

A marquee welcomes the conference attendees.

INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

Rose sits on a folding chair and takes notes. The thirty or
so people listening to the SPEAKER appear to be mostly
hospital staff and EMT workers. A placard near the door
reads: SEMINAR FOR BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS.

CARL SWANSON leans forward from his chair and looks down the
row to Rose.

SPEAKER
OK. Let's take a quick break before
we move on to potential pathogens
suspended in excrement.

INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM ­ FOOD TABLE - DAY

Rose stands by a display of medical waste pamphlets and
munches on a sandwich. As she takes a bite, Carl walks up.

CARL
Food's better at the bar.
(holding out his hand)
Carl Swanson, Above and Beyond.

Flustered, Rose brushes crumbs off her face and inadvertently
deposits a blob of mustard on her cheek. They shake hands.

ROSE
Rose-
(swallow)
Rose Lorkowski. Nice to meet you.

CARL
I hear you're my new competition.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        53.

ROSE
We're hardly competition for you.

CARL
(smiles)
I'm glad to see you're doing a
little homework. A lot of people,
you know, they think they can just
jump in to this, make lots of
money. But, they don't know what
they're doing. No idea. They're not
professional and that makes us all
look bad.

ROSE
Well, we're not like that. I just
have to complete this seminar and
we're certified.

CARL
You're not certified?

ROSE
Not yet. Probably by the end of the
month.

Carl smiles, dips a napkin in his cup of water and wipes the
smudge of mustard from Rose's cheek.

CARL
You had a...

Attendees file back to their chairs.

ROSE
I think it's starting.

CARL
Sure I can't buy you a drink?

INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY

Rose and Carl sit at the bar nursing drinks.

CARL
If you spray the enzyme at that
point it'll just turn back to
liquid which is a pain in the ass.
The key is to bag it when it's kind
of Jell-o-ee.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        54.

ROSE
That makes total sense. Why didn't
I think of that?

CARL
You just figure all this shit out
as you go. Experience.

Rose chews on her cocktail straw.

ROSE
It's not how I thought it'd be. I
thought it'd be gross.

Rose stops. Reflects. Turns to Carl.

ROSE
Sometimes it's gross. The maggots
are gross. The maggots kind of
freak me.

CARL
Yeah.

ROSE
The sound. The munching sound.

CARL
And it's so hard to kill the little
fuckers.

ROSE
Tell me about it. You pour
industrial bleach right on
`em...nothing.

Carl offers a knowing nod.

CARL
Just roll their eyes and call you a
pussy.

Rose laughs and takes another sip of her drink.

INT. HOTEL ROOM ­ DAY

The door to the bathroom is open. Carl hums a happy tune in
the shower.

Rose shimmies back into her clothes with an expression of
self-loathing.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        55.

ROSE
I am strong. I am powerful.

INT. VAN - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY

Rose drives and Norah holds a long list of funeral homes and
other establishments. They're all crossed off. Oscar sits
bored in the back.

OSCAR
What's a bastard?

Rose looks at Norah with concern.

OSCAR
Jeremy said I was a bastard. What
does that mean?

Rose has no idea how to respond. Norah turns to face Oscar.

NORAH
It just means your mom wasn't
married when she had you. It's no
big deal. In a couple of years
you're gonna find it's a free pass
to cool. You'll probably start a
band called Bastard Son. Use it to
impress the chicks. Trust me, the
whole bastard thing... it's working
for you.

Oscar looks to Rose and then back to Norah.

Rose's phone rings. She answers it, relieved for the
distraction

ROSE
Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well,
I'm glad you liked the Fancy
Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah.

Rose grabs a pen, hands it to Norah and motions for her to
write something down.

ROSE
Okay... 2327 Grove Avenue. Got
it... Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

Rose hangs up.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        56.

NORAH
What was that?

ROSE
A suicide!

EXT. BRICK RANCHER - DAY

Rose pulls the van up to the house and sees the old lady
sitting out front. MRS. DAVIS.

ROSE
Oh, man.

Rose and Norah exchange a look and then Rose turns to Oscar.

ROSE
OK. Stay in the van. You want a
soda or anything?

Oscar shakes his head.

ROSE
We won't be long.

As Rose and Norah get out and unload supplies the old lady
stands to greet them. She's dressed up in the way old ladies
are when they expect company.

ROSE
Mrs. Davis?

The woman nods. She is dazed with grief.

ROSE
We're the cleaning service.

MRS. DAVIS
Yes, yes. I... I wanted to give you
the keys.

The old woman holds out a shaky hand. Rose gently takes the
keys. Norah hangs back.

MRS. DAVIS
In the sunroom. That's where my
husband... I had bridge and...

She blinks twice, slowly, then snaps back.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        57.

MRS. DAVIS
Do you need me to show you?

ROSE
No, no. I think we can find it.

MRS. DAVIS
Oh. Okay. That's good then.

Rose and Norah gather their things and head up the stairs.

MRS. DAVIS
My son-in-law's coming to take me
to lunch at the Howard Johnson's.
They have such nice rolls there.

Rose hands Norah the key and motions for her to go ahead.

ROSE
Would you like to sit for a moment,
Mrs. Davis?

MRS. DAVIS
Yes dear, I think I would.

Rose sits down on the steps with Mrs. Davis and Norah quietly
enters the house.

From the van Oscar watches Rose and the old woman sit side by
side on the front step. Rose's hand rests lightly on the
woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.

INT. BRICK RANCHER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture
of antiques and things that are simply old.

Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches,
etc. Each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn
off light' or `watch news at 6:00'.

Norah walks past family photos that line the hall.

INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - DAY

Norah enters the red splattered room. A walker lies on its
side next to a blood-soaked rug. Golden sunlight pours
through the windows.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        58.

A yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee
table. The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in
a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'.

Norah slips a Tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. A car
pull up to the curb. Norah stops and watches her sister walk
Mrs. Davis to the car before starting her work.

INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Rose enters quietly, in a fog. The stillness of grief is
contagious.

NORAH
She okay?

Rose nods and picks up the photo of a younger Mr and Mrs
Davis. She then steps into her Tyvec coveralls and zips up.

INT. VAN - DUSK

Norah drives. Rose holds Oscar in her lap, arms clasped tight
around him.

OSCAR
That lady seemed really sad.

ROSE
Her husband died.

Oscar thinks about this a moment.

OSCAR
So he's in heaven?

Rose nods.

OSCAR
Maybe we could let her use our CB
and she could talk to him.

Rose looks confused. Oscar presses on.

OSCAR
Maybe he would hear her.

Rose smiles. Doesn't seem like the moment to correct him.

ROSE
Maybe.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        59.

They ride the rest of the way home in silence.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NEXT DAY - DAY

Joe's Monte Carlo sits out front.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Oscar and Joe scratch game cards.

OSCAR
I won a million dollars!

JOE
Let me see that.

Oscar hands the ticket over.

JOE
You gotta get two hydrants with a
matching amount. See? None of your
fire hydrants match.

Oscar looks at the Lucky Dog card with defeat.

JOE
And three zeros is a thousand
dollars. You woulda won a thousand
dollars but it doesn't match
anything.

OSCAR
What happens if it doesn't match
anything?

JOE
You toss it and try the next one.

Oscar moves on to his next ticket. He scratches the coating
away and tentatively lifts his game card

OSCAR
I think I won five hundred dollars.

Joe looks at the card. He looks at Oscar and grins.

OSCAR
I'm gonna buy a trampoline and a
karaoke player and some chocolate
honey dipped donuts.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       59A.

JOE
Whoa now. Hold up there kiddo.
That's not your money. That's my
money.

OSCAR
I scratched it.

JOE
Yes you did. You scratched the
ticket that I bought.

Oscar follows his grampa over to the pay phone.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        60.

JOE
And we're not going to spend the
money. We're going to invest the
money.

Joe plunks in some quarters, dials, waits while it rings.

JOE
See, that's the difference between
a regular person and somebody with
business acumen. That's a good word
for you to know. A-cu-men. Means
smarts.

Oscar nods and sips his Coke.

JOE
(into the receiver)
Bobby! Joe Lorkowski here.
(laughs)
I told you I'd call.
(pause)
Yeah well, I got the money and
we're in. But you gotta throw in
twenty bags of ice.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose pays bills at the kitchen table. Oscar bounces a super
ball.

OSCAR
We're gonna make the money grow
because that's the smart way. It's
capital and you don't spend that.
You invest it. That way you can get
the SP250 and have money left over.

ROSE
What are you talking about?

Oscar races out of the kitchen and then races back in with a
pamphlet showcasing the amazingly sleek SP250 binoculars. He
hands the pamphlet to Rose.

OSCAR
The binoculars that grampa's gonna
get me for my birthday.
(MORE)

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       60A.
OSCAR (cont'd)
They've got an internal stabilizer
thingy that's electronic so if
you're in a speed boat or something
it won't matter and...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        61.

ROSE
Oh honey, come here.

Rose pulls out a chair for Oscar. Oscar sits down and crosses
his arms in front of himself.

ROSE
Sometimes your grampa promises
things that he really wants to
happen.

OSCAR
No, he's really gonna get `em. He's
got a plan.

ROSE
Okay. If you say so.

Rose goes back to the bills.

INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ DAY

Lynn wears a white coat. Norah sits in one of the reclining
chairs scattered about the room.

NORAH
You made it seem so fun.

LYNN
Oh it is fun. Would you like a
refreshment?

Norah smiles and shakes her head.

LYNN
No?

Norah watches Lynn's hands push up her sleeve. Lynn rubs
iodine in expanding circles on the inside of Norah's arm.

Lynn puts plastic gloves on and ties a tourniquet around
Norah's arm. She puts a rubber ball in Norah's hand.

LYNN
Can you squeeze that for me?

Norah squeezes the ball and Lynn touches the plump vein.

LYNN
That's good. One more time.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        62.

Lynn takes the needle and draws it close to Norah's arm.

NORAH
Oh my God, is that the needle? It's
a fucking cocktail straw.

Norah looks nervous. Lynn smiles reassuringly.

LYNN
Trust me, I'm very good at this.
Squeeze again.

Norah squeezes, Lynn touches the soft blue stripe of blood
beneath Norah's skin and slides the needle into the vein.

LYNN
Wasn't that fun?

NORAH
You might have oversold it.

Lynn smiles.

LYNN
Kind of twirl the ball around in
your hand. Good. It doesn't hurt,
does it?

NORAH
(shakes her head)
Feels hot.

LYNN
That's a good sign.

Norah self-consciously nods and smiles. Lynn turns and
jostles the bag of blood.

NORAH
My friend's having a thing tonight.

Lynn switches her attention from the blood back to Norah.

NORAH
Never mind.

LYNN
What?

NORAH
Nothing it's...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        63.

LYNN
What?

NORAH
You wouldn't like it.

LYNN
I might like it.

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Music and party-goers spill from the student ghetto house.

INT. PARTY HOUSE ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Norah and Lynn sit on a ratty couch in a crowded smoke filled
room. Next to them, a flannel wearing burn-out rocks to
headphones. Norah wears a candy necklace. Debauchery plays
out around them.

NORAH
I knew you wouldn't have any fun
here.

LYNN
I am having fun.

Norah takes a tug on the joint and passes it to Lynn.

LYNN
No thanks.

NORAH
Lambs breath.

LYNN
Yeah, no thanks.

NORAH
Straight edge?

LYNN
(Shakes head)
Just kind of superstitious.

Norah nods and passes the joint across Lynn to the burn-out.
The burn-out tugs and passes it back to Lynn. Lynn waves it
off a second time.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        64.

NORAH
She's Mormon.

LYNN
I'm not Mormon. I just... You're
gonna think it's weird.

NORAH
What?

LYNN
Sometimes I think that when you get
high or drink or alter your
consciousness like that--

NORAH
You don't drink?

Lynn shakes her head.

LYNN
I think it weakens you psychically...
like it creates these cracks and
then bad things can seep in and
maybe never go away.

Norah stares at Lynn with great blood-shot concentration.

NORAH
All right, you're kind of freakin
me out.

LYNN
Sorry.

NORAH
You should just tell people you're
Mormon.

LYNN
I think your boyfriend is winning.

Two women gnaw at Randy's neck. His necklace is almost empty.

NORAH
Yes. Yes, he is.

Lynn lightly tugs on Norah's candy necklace. She leans in
close and takes a bite of the candy. Norah catches her
breath. Paralyzed.

Lynn smiles, pleased by Norah's reaction.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        65.

LYNN
(whisper)
Breathe.

Norah snaps back.

NORAH
I need more beer.

Norah pulls herself off the couch and starts for the keg. She
stops. Turns.

NORAH
Um. Can I get you anything?

LYNN
I'm good.

Norah offers a nervous smile.

INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Norah and Randy lie on a thread bare couch. Their bodies rock
to the motion of sex. Norah's thoughts are elsewhere.

A small TV sits next to Norah's growing collection of found
trinkets. It spills blue light into the smoke tinged air.

On the TV, a REPORTER stands outside Quicky Lube. Norah turns
her attention to the TV while Randy pumps and grinds. She
grabs the remote.

REPORTER
(on TV)
Tragedy today when an out of
control driver crashed his car into
a south side Quicky Lube killing
one employee.

RANDY
What are you doing?

NORAH
Shh.

Norah turns up the volume. Randy grinds to a halt.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        66.

REPORTER
The driver of the automobile,
apparently suffered a heart attack
at the wheel and is currently in
critical condition.

The phone rings. Randy glares at Norah. Norah answers.

NORAH
Hello.

RANDY
Unbelievable.

NORAH
(into phone)
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

EXT. ROAD ­ NIGHT

A van zooms past with a SUNSHINE CLEANING MAGNET on the door.

EXT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ NIGHT

Randy steps out onto the porch where the big bosomed RABBIT
LADY strokes her rabbit. He closes the door behind him.

RANDY
Hey.

RABBIT LADY
Hey.

Randy starts down the steps feeling dejected.

RABBIT LADY
You like rabbits?

Randy stops and turns.

EXT. QUICKY LUBE ­ NIGHT

The large glass panel that made up the front of the store is
shattered. Shards dangle from red tipped edges. Blood and
glass mingle on the linoleum floor and plastic chairs.

Outside, Mac motions a stunned crowd to disperse. Rose and
Norah walk confidently past Mac into the lobby where a man
wearing a Quick Lube shirt stands off to the side and cries.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   67.

Mac watches as Rose goes back inside and greets the officer.

INT. QUICKY LUBE - NIGHT

The OFFICER points to the shattered glass.

OFFICER
Nut job goes through the window
there.
(he stops, turns)
You guys are BBP Certified, right?

ROSE
Legally, it's not really necessary.

NORAH
We are.

ROSE
We're in the process.

NORAH
You went to that thing.

ROSE
We adhere to all the proper
procedures when dealing with a
potentially hazardous situation. We
are very professional.

NORAH
Wait. I thought you went to that
thing.

Rose scans the area.

ROSE
Are you guys all finished?

OFFICER
It's all yours.

Rose and Norah slip into their Tyvecs.

ROSE
Why don't you grab the wet-vac and
I'll start bagging the loose stuff.

The officer walks past Mac who continues to stare at Rose.
She looks beautiful and strong.

EXT. QUICKY LUBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rose and Norah pull supplies from the van and ready
themselves for the Quicky Lube job.

NORAH
I thought you went to the thing.

ROSE
I did. I mean, I went to part of
it. Most of it.

NORAH
What do you mean you went to part
of it? It was a one day thing.

ROSE
I got side tracked.

NORAH
Side tracked?

ROSE
That Above and Beyond guy was
there. Carl. We got talking shop
and--

NORAH
Oh my God, you humped Carl!

Rose can't deny it. Norah shakes her head.

ROSE
I'm already registered for the next
one.

NORAH
That's disgusting.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY

Joe and Oscar sit in the car pulled off to the side of a
lonely highway intersection.

JOE
You got twenty bucks and you want
three pizza's. They cost five
dollars each and you have a coupon
for two dollars off.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        69.
JOE (cont'd)
You figure you'll tip the delivery
guy a couple bucks but the
delivery guy turns out to be a
lady. Real sizzler. So you give her
a crisp five. How much do you have
left?

Oscar thinks.

Joe assumes there's no way the kid's getting this and turns
his attention outside. A truck appear on the horizon.

OSCAR
Two dollars?

JOE
Hey, how'd you come up with that?

OSCAR
Math.

The truck slows down as it reaches the intersection, pulls
off the road, and stops. Joe gets out and walks over.

Oscar watches the trucker hop down from the cab and shake
Joe's hand like they're old friends.

CUT TO

The trunk of the Monte Carlo brims with shrimp and ice. Joe
slams it closed, climbs in the car and gives Oscar a wink.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Monte Carlo slices through a vast empty landscape.

INT. JOE'S CAR - DAY

Joe beams with excitement.

JOE
The thing is Oscar...and this is
important to learn early...life is
sales. Buying and selling. It's the
core of social interaction. And
human beings are social beings.

Smoke starts to seep out from under the hood. Joe eyes the
temperature gauge.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       69A.

JOE
No, no, no, no, no.

EXT. ADOBE HOUSE - DAY

Norah loads equipment into the van, gets in and waits for
Rose to finish the transaction.

A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN opens the door. She's angry.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07   70.

ROSE
I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother
you. I just wanted to let you know
that we're all finished up and--

The woman glares at Rose.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
Oh, you want to get paid.

ROSE
We can come back later if that's
better.

The woman shakes her head and holds out a check.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
I can't believe I have to deal with
this now. My son just died for
Christ's sake.

The woman looks away.

ROSE
I'm so sorry for your loss.

Rose starts to leave.

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
Thank you.

Rose stops. Turns

MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
For what you did. Thank you.

Rose nods and continues on to the van.

INT. VAN - DAY

They ride down an Albuquerque street in silence.

ROSE
You want a Coke?

NORAH
Sure.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        71.

INT. GAS STATION FOODMART - DAY

Rose fills a cup at the soda fountain. Through the window she
sees Mac and family pull up on the other side of the store.

Mac gets out and pumps gas. The woman, HEATHER, laughs with
the little girl in the back seat. They look happy.

Rose's fountain drink overflows.

ROSE
Dammit.

Rose grabs for a napkin which clumps and tears.

The door BEEPS. Rose jumps behind the candy rack and peeks
around. All clear. She turns and smacks into Heather. Heather
glares at Rose.

HEATHER
You think I don't know?

Heather trembles with anger. Rose stands frozen.

HEATHER
You may have been hot shit in high
school but what are you now?
Nothing. A waste of space.

Heather reaches out and gives Rose a little push. Ten years
of anger culminating in this one anti climactic gesture.

Rose watches Heather walk away and knows every word is true.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

A stream of water leaks from the trunk. Joe gets out cursing
under his breath. He kicks the car and a hub cap falls off.
It's an unbearable insult.

JOE
Stupid shit heap!

Fifty years of failures result in an explosion of
frustration. Joe stomps on the hub cap, picks it up and
throws it as far as he can.

Joe gathers himself and leans in the window. He forces a
smile at Oscar. Oscar looks nervous.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        72.

JOE
It's alright. Everything's okay.

Joe opens the trunk and checks on the shrimp. A car zooms by.
Joe tries to wave it down. No good. Another zooms by.

JOE
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Joe struggles to wave down a car. No luck. Joe has an idea.

JOE
Make like you're crying.

Oscar turns on the tears. A car stops.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Rose walks in. Oscar and Joe feign casualness.

Joe looks at the bathroom door which stands open. Inside the
tub brims with shrimp and ice.

ROSE
What did you guys do today?

OSCAR
Nothing.

Rose turns to Joe who shrugs.

ROSE
How's it without Norah here?

JOE
Weird.

Joe walks over and casually shuts the bathroom door.

EXT. DOGHOUSE WEINER HUT ­ NIGHT

Randy stuffs his face with a hotdog while Norah glares,
annoyed.

RANDY
I'm sorry. I know it was stupid.

NORAH
On so many levels.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        73.

RANDY
I'm really sorry. I swear it won't
happen again. It's just... you
weren't around and...

Norah shakes her head. Randy doesn't know what to say.

NORAH
Listen, Randy I think we should
stop hanging out.

RANDY
You're breaking up with me over the
rabbit lady?

Norah doesn't respond.

RANDY
I don't know, the way you act, I
didn't even think that you'd care
that much.

NORAH
Yeah, I don't. I should, but I
don't. And you're a really great
guy. But...I don't care if you have
sex with the rabbit lady... and I
mean, it seems like I should care
about that.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose opens a stack of neglected mail. She is interrupted by a
light knock on the door. Rose peeks out the peep hole.

ROSE
Shit.

Rose hesitates, then opens the door just a crack.

MAC
Rose.

ROSE
What are you doing here?

MAC
Can we talk a minute?

ROSE
Oscar's asleep.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        74.

Rose stands her ground for a moment before stepping outside.

MAC
It was great seeing you last night.
You looked so professional and
confident. Your own business...

Mac touches her lightly on the arm.

ROSE
How's the baby?

Mac looks away.

MAC
I just wanted to congratulate you
on the business. Seems like things
are really going great for you.

Rose and Mac's eyes meet.      Rose smiles.

ROSE
They are. If we keep going at this
rate I can hire a couple of
employees soon, put a little more
in marketing, give those Clean
Sweep guys a run for their money.

Rose glows.

ROSE
I'm a business woman.

MAC
(nodding)
You're a business woman.

EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Norah stands disheveled, six pack in hand. Lynn opens the

NORAH
Ever been trestling?

EXT NOB HILL RESTAURANT ROW - NIGHT

Shrimp jiggles in Joe's hand cart as he makes his way toward
the row of upscale restaurants.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        75.

A couple of upscale hipsters stare curiously at the hand cart
as they pass Joe.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sounds of sex seep through thin walls. Oscar sits up in bed.

After a moment he crawls out of bed, he grabs a flashlight
from his shelf and exits his room.

118A   INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                    118A

The mattress squeaks slightly as Mac and Rose have sex.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

In pajamas and bare feet, Oscar steps into the night. He
flicks on the flashlight.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Norah leads Lynn through a wooded area toward a train
trestle. Norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack.

LYNN
Are the bodies there?

NORAH
No. The person is gone. It's weird
`cuz we're connected to them in
this strangely intimate way... but
we never actually meet them. It's
just kind of weird.

Norah steps over a discarded tire.

NORAH
I have seen a dead body once
though.

LYNN
Yeah?

NORAH
My mom.

Lynn follows Norah, not knowing how to respond. It's awkward.
Norah tries to lighten things.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       75A.

NORAH
She was in a movie of the week
once, ya know.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        76.

LYNN
Your mom?

Norah nods.

NORAH
A bunch of Hollywood people were
filming down in Old Town. They
thought my mom was so beautiful and
so talented that they gave her a
speaking part. You want to hear it?

Lynn nods.

NORAH
`I recommend the pecan pie.'

Norah looks back at Lynn for applause.

LYNN
I recommend the pecan pie?

Norah nods.

NORAH
That was her line. It was on TV and
everything.

LYNN
That's pretty cool.

NORAH
Me and Rose, we didn't actually see
it but Rose says mom talked about
it all the time. I don't remember.

Norah shrugs.

NORAH
I don't remember her much at all. I
have this box of her stuff though,
little things she touched. When it
seems like she never even really
existed... it's proof.

The two reach the bottom of a train trestle.

NORAH
All right. This is where we climb.

LYNN
What?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        77.

NORAH
Up to that girder.

Norah points to a rusted girder about eight feet from the
underbelly of the track.

LYNN
I'm not climbing up there.

NORAH
Best place to be when it comes.

LYNN
Uh-uh.

Norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the
six pack and starts to climb.

NORAH
You're gonna miss the best part.

LYNN
I accept that.

The two cans of beer dangle from Norah's arm like a giant
charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs.

NORAH
It's like... it's like this big
pissed off God up in your face just
screaming at you. So close you can
smell the metal on his breath.

LYNN
Sounds great.

NORAH
It is. I'm telling you.

Norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her
fingers against the rusted girder. After a moment she leans
out and looks down toward Lynn.

NORAH
I didn't mean to bum you out with
the whole mom stuff. I just thought
you would... I don't know, I guess
I thought...

LYNN
What?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        78.

The trestle starts to shake.

NORAH
He's coming.

The thunder gets louder. Lynn covers her ears. Norah pops
open a beer and laughs as the train approaches.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Oscar walks along the sidewalk alone. He stops at the van,
opens the door and gets in.

He looks very small in the driver's seat. He lifts the
handset to the CB.

INTERCUT DIALOGUE WITH FOLLOWING SEQUENCE

OSCAR
What was I before I was born? What
happens when we die? Do animals go
to the same place as we go after we
die? Is heaven really crowded? When
somebody gets an arm chopped off
does it go to heaven? Is Jesus
another name for you or are you two
separate people? Were you born?
Will you die? If you already live
in heaven where do you go when you
die?

EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT

The train careens above Norah. Sparks fly from the blur of
wheels. The sky flashes between each of the cars. Stars and
grease and metal and night collide. Norah closes her eyes.

The sound of the train merges with the loud static of a CB.

EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1987 - DAY

The sky is an electric blue. The kind that lives in memories
and dreams. Rose (10) and Norah (5) play in a parked car.

Rose pretends to drive and smoke a cigarette while Norah
makes faces in the rearview mirror.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07    78A.

Rose gets out of the car and races toward the house. Norah
chases after.

NORAH
Rose, wait for me.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        79.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 1987 - DAY

A giggling Rose stumbles in. She stops. The bathroom door is
open slightly. She walks over peeks through the opening.

There's a dress crumpled on the floor. A woman slumps
motionless in the tub. Her delicate hand hangs over the edge.
Scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain.

Norah enters the front door. She smiles, unburdened by the
knowledge. She runs towards Rose. Rose quickly pushes her
back and closes the door.

Norah senses something's wrong. She struggles to see what's
behind the door but Rose won't let go.

EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT

The static mixes back into the roar of the train. The roar
grows distant and is replaced by Norah's laughter.

Still laughing, Norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on
a beam next to her. The beer falls. Norah tries to catch it,
loses her balance and falls with a thud.

Lynn catches her breath.

LYNN
Oh, shit.

Lynn runs over to find Norah on her back, eyes closed. Norah
opens her eyes and laughs.

LYNN
You idiot.

Norah grabs the beer that she had been chasing. There's not
much left but she downs the remainder.

NORAH
Sneaky fucker.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        80.

LYNN
That was really stupid.

NORAH
I think I broke my hand.

LYNN
Really?

Lynn leans close with real concern.

NORAH
No. But it hurts like a mother.

Lynn pops the top on the remaining beer and takes a huge gulp
before handing it to Norah.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Oscar walks down the sidewalk alone. His flashlight provides
small circle of light on the cement in front of him.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose stands in her T-shirt and undies. Mac shuts the door.
Rose leans her head against the door and exhales deeply. She
turns as if something is calling her.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Rose stands on tip toes and feels around on top of the
refrigerator until she finds what she's looking for...
emergency cigarettes.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose sits down on the couch and lights her cigarette. The
nicotine patch is still clearly visible on her arm.

Rose looks at the stack of unopened mail. Something grabs her
attention. An envelope bearing the return address of Paula
Datzman-Mead. Rose rips opens the envelope.

Rose stares at an invitation to Paula's baby shower. A smile
creeps across her face.

The front door opens and Oscar walks in.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        81.

ROSE
Oscar?

Brow furrowed, he walks past Rose without acknowledging her.
He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.

INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty
Styrofoam cups.

LYNN
How's the hand?

Norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts
gnawing on the side. Lynn takes Norah's hand and examines it.

NORAH
Ow!

LYNN
Sorry.

Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips. Smiles. Looks at
Norah. Norah's a deer in headlights. Lynn kisses Norah's
hand. Everything is still and tense.

LYNN
Better?

Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks
up to   Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester
kiss.   Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on
Lynn.   All is good.

Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed
enjoying the moment.

Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly
across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures.
Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes.

Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.

LYNN
Is that?

Lynn pulls away.

LYNN
Are those...

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        82.

Lynn tries to suss it out, shakes her head, looks at Norah.

LYNN
How do you have my school pictures?

NORAH
I just... I found them. I was gonna
tell you.

Lynn shakes her head disbelieving.

LYNN
Where would you find old pictures
of me?

NORAH
At work.

LYNN
What?

NORAH
We did this job a while back. This
woman...

Lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf.
Her eyes focus on the photo ID. Her mother. Her face goes
completely blank. Shock.

LYNN
My mom.

Norah bites her lip and nods.

LYNN
My mom is dead.

A hazy mix of shame, sadness and guilt seeps into the void.

NORAH
I wanted to tell you... that first
day. That's why I--

LYNN
You knew this whole time?

NORAH
I think... You know, I think
there's a reason that I found them.
The pictures. Because that lead me
to you, right?
(MORE)

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        83.
NORAH (cont'd)
And I don't know exactly what went
on between you and your mom... what
the situation was... but it just
seems like... You know, of anybody,
I would understand.

Lynn's hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp.
Anger. She looks at Norah with disgust.

LYNN
You would understand?

Lynn turns to leave.

NORAH
Wait. Please. Don't...I--

Lynn opens the door. Norah reaches out but Lynn stops her
with an icy look.

LYNN
You're sick, you know that? There's
something wrong with you.

Lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap.

Norah sinks down onto the couch. Just Norah now. The
emptiness crowds around her.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

The afternoon sun beats against the weathered paint.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

The baby shower invitation looms large on the makeup table.

Rose wears a slip and unusually big hair. She grabs several
outfits from her closet. Oscar watches.

ROSE
The blue or the flowery?

OSCAR
The blue.

ROSE
Good call.

Rose slips on the dress and sits to apply mascara. Oscar
shuffles out of the bedroom.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        84.

Rose's cell phone rings. She picks up the phone while
applying lipstick.

ROSE

Yes! Hi. What can I do for you?

INSURANCE GUY
(over phone)
We've got a house we need to turn
around and our regular guys are
busy in Santa Fe today. Thought I'd
give you all a call.

Rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs
a pen and writes down the info.

ROSE
Great. No problem.

Rose hangs up.

ROSE
Shit, shit, shit.

Rose pulls on some panty hose and wrestles with her shoes.

ROSE
Honey, call grampa.

Oscar dials.

OSCAR
It's busy.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        85.

Rose grabs her purse. Rose and Oscar rush out. A baby shower
gift sits forgotten by the door.

INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Norah cradles a phone to her ear and shoves clothes from a

NORAH
Blow off the shower.

Rose drives the van and talks on her cell phone. Oscar looks
tiny in the passenger seat.

ROSE
I can't I... I RSVPed.

INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

NORAH
So tell him we can't do it.

ROSE
It's an insurance company. They
could throw us a ton of work. This

NORAH
So, don't go to the damn baby
shower. It's not like you ever even
liked Paula.

ROSE
I promise I'll come straight after
the shower and help finish up.

EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - DAY

Rose and Oscar walk up to the house. Rose tries the door but
it's locked. She knocks. No answer. An uneasy tension shoots
through her.

She fumbles for her keys to unlock the door and is hit with a
horrible familiar smell. Oscar pinches his nose.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       85A.

OSCAR
Pee-ew.

ROSE
Stay out here.

OSCAR
Why do I--

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        86.

Because I said so.

Angry, Oscar sits down on the steps.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The phone next to Joe's Lazy Boy is off the hook.

Rose walks briskly through the house. Urgency mounts with
each step.

ROSE
Dad! Daddy!

Rose throws the bathroom door open in a panic.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy
corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can.

Rose recoils at the intense smell.

JOE
I'm busy here.

He tries to swing the door shut but Rose stops it. Steps in.

ROSE
Damn it dad, you scared me.

Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and
avoids looking at Rose.

JOE
Those snotty restaurant fucks
wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some
bullshit about health codes or
whatever. I don't believe that shit
for a second.

ROSE
God, dad what were you--

He holds up a finger.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        87.

JOE
Don't. Don't start with me.
(Pause)
Bastards completely shut me out.
They got their own little cartel.
Little restaurant mafia. I bet they
screwed with my car too. I wouldn't
put it past `em. Bunch of shady
mother fuckers.

Rose leans against the door and watches her father. A wet
slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage.

ROSE
I need you to watch Oscar.

Another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage.

JOE
I can't.

ROSE
What do you mean you can't?

JOE
I can't watch Oscar today Rose.

ROSE
I'm in a real bind here.

JOE
Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it?

his attention to the model plane before him.

Rose and Oscar enter.

WINSTON
You look nice.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       87A.

ROSE
Thanks.

Winston finishes gluing the piece and looks up.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        88.

ROSE
I was wondering if Oscar could hang
out here for a little while.

Winston looks nervous. He looks at Oscar.

ROSE
I've got this baby shower to go to
and Norah's working a job and my
dad's incapacitated... Do you mind?

WINSTON
I guess not.

ROSE
You're a lifesaver.

WINSTON
You did your hair different.

ROSE
You like it?

Winston nods.

ROSE
All right. Be good. I'll pick him
up in a few hours when I'm done.

Rose leaves. Oscar and Winston are left on their own. Winston
forces a smile. Oscar does not reciprocate. Winston turns and
walks to the back room.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

Winston glues a tiny piece to the model plane. Oscar inches
his way over.

OSCAR
What's that?

WINSTON
This is a World War Two Mitchell
Cannon Nose Bomber.

Oscar leans in closer to examine all the tiny pieces.

OSCAR
You make all these models?

Winston nods and points to a teeny plastic strut.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        89.

WINSTON
Dab the end of that in the glue.
Just a little bit.

Oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue
and hands it to Winston.

OSCAR
What's that piece for?

WINSTON
It's a strut.

With delicate precision, Winston attaches the piece.

OSCAR
What's a strut?

WINSTON
Supports the wing.

Oscar examines one of the many completed models.

OSCAR
Seems like it'd be hard to build
models with just one hand.

WINSTON
It is.

EXT. ISOLATED ROAD - AFTERNOON

Norah drives the van down a desert road.

140A   EXT. DATZMAN-MEAD DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON                               140A

EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Norah pulls supplies from the van and lugs them to the house.

INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Norah grabs a bottle of OJ from the fridge, checks the

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       89A.

Norah examines a snapshot on the fridge. A chubby middle-aged
woman surrounded by cats. The woman is bald and smiling.

Norah spots some incense. She holds a stick to her nose.

INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Norah lights the incense stick and sets it on the dresser
next to a little statue of the laughing Buddha. A collection
of cat whiskers sits in the Buddha's lap.

Evidence of death soils the bed. Books crowd the night stand.

Norah rolls out plastic sheeting and prepares the room.

INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON

The room titters with wannabe country clubbers. They nibble
appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts.

Rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. She's flanked by Paula
and a MOUSEY WOMAN in a pink dress and matching pink pumps.

MOUSEY
So Rose, what are you doing? Are
you still cleaning houses?

PAULA
Rose has gone into real estate.

MOUSEY
Really?

ROSE
Actually, I own my own business.

MOUSEY
A real estate business?

ROSE
No. It's a biohazard removal and
crime scene clean up service. It's
a growth niche industry right now ­
highly technical and competitive.

MOUSEY
What does that mean ­ biohazard
removal whatever?

ROSE
A lot of times, when somebody dies,
it can be kind of, you know, messy.
So, we go in and clean up all that
left over mess. Make sure that the
area is clean and sanitary.

Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.

ROSE
People just don't understand the
health and safety risks involved in
disposing of biological material
like blood and body fluids.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        91.

PAULA
Oh my God.

highly technical and professional
operation with a whole complicated,
you know... methodology behind it.

Pleased with herself, Rose grabs another cheese puff.

ROSE
Real growth industry.

MOUSEY
I can't imagine. You like doing it?

ROSE
Yeah.

Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.

ROSE
I do. We come into the lives of
people who have just experienced
something so sad and profound.
They've lost somebody. The
circumstances are different but
that's the same.

As Rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. Relaxes. That
brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.

ROSE
And we help them. In this one small
way... we help.

Rose is lost in her thoughts. Something profound is shifting.

MOUSEY
Sounds horrible to me.

PAULA
I believe I'd vomit.

INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Norah stuffs bedding in biohazard bags and wraps the mattress
in plastic sheeting. A fan clanks at the window.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        92.

Norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door.
It tips and Norah bangs her hand against the door frame.

NORAH
Shit.

The incense falls from the dresser. Norah finally muscles the
mattress through the doorway.

EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Norah drags the mattress to the driveway. A wisp of smoke
curls from the window behind her.

As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW
rise from the bushes. She investigates.

A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges
looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.

NORAH
Oh my God, you're the cutest thing
ever. Did you get left behind?

The kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for
a meow. Norah is powerless to resist.

NORAH
It's okay.

As Norah leans down to pick up the kitten, it darts from the
bushes and heads toward the road.

NORAH
No, no, no.

Norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and
disappears behind a house.

After a moment, Norah emerges from behind the house. She coos
at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An
expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her.

Norah runs toward the house.

INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON

A PEPPY WOMAN with the enthusiasm of a game show contestant
stands on a stool and waves her arms.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        93.

PEPPY
Okay, ladies. For our first game
we've taken five different kinds of
candy bars and melted them in these
diapers.

MOUSEY
Oh I love this game.

PEPPY
You all can--

Somewhere a cell phone rings. The peppy woman stops and looks
at Rose. Rose digs into her purse and pulls out the offending
phone. She checks caller ID. It's Norah. She cuts it off.

ROSE
Sorry.

Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start
distributing the diapers.

PEPPY
You can look, smell and taste. The
first to identify all five
correctly wins!

INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Flames shoot up around the dresser and gobble a curtain.
Norah slaps a towel at the flames with one hand and holds a
phone with the other.

ROSE
(over the phone)
Hello, you've reached Sunshine
Cleaning. You're call is very
important to us so...

NORAH
FUCK!

Norah snaps the phone shut and continues slapping back the
flames.

INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON

Rose watches with a detached expression as Floral clad women
stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        94.

It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first
time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula.

ROSE
You know what? I... uh...Actually,
there's somewhere I need to be.

PAULA
Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're
just starting the games.

ROSE
Yeah. Well...
(smiles and nods)
Yeah.

Rose stands and weaves her way through the throng of Stepford
moms. Relief sweeps across her face as she nears the door.

INT. ROSE'S CAR - EVENING

Rose drives as the sun sinks into the desert landscape.

EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - NIGHT

Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering
house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror.

Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she
sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones
on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps
on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door
and slides out of the van.

NORAH
It was an accident.

Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable
consequences of the scene before her.

ROSE
Oh my God, what have you done?

NORAH
It was an accident.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        95.

ROSE
How does this happen? Huh? How do
you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus
fucking Christ!

NORAH
Jesus Rose, Calm down.

Rose throws her keys at Norah.

Norah turns to shield the kitten. The keys thump her arm.
Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be.

NORAH
Well, if you had been here to help
me but no, you're off desperately
trying to impress stupid high
school people who don't even
matter. Prove to your old
cheerleading squad that you're not
this huge loser. If you had been
here doing your job it wouldn't
have happened. So don't try to put
all this on me.

Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose.

ROSE
This is on you. You did this. You
set a fucking house on fire! You.

NORAH
Oh, go ahead and play the martyr.
It's like your favorite thing.

ROSE
I can't believe I was so stupid to
think that you could handle a
little bit of responsibility.

NORAH
I am   so sick of all your holier
than   thou bullshit. Why don't you
take   a look at you're own life,
huh?   You're a real inspiration.

ROSE
Well maybe if I didn't have to take
care of everybody in this family.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        96.

NORAH
Fuck you. I'm done being your
excuse.

Norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from Rose, the
fire and everything. The kitten clings to her shirt.

ROSE
Oh that's great. Turn everything to
shit and then walk away.

Without turning or breaking her stride, Norah flips off Rose.

Rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches
the firemen hose down the house.

EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT

Rose, looking worse for wear, tries to open the door but the
store is closed and the door is locked.

ROSE
Great.

She bangs on the glass doors.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT

Winston walks from the back room and opens the door.

WINSTON
Long baby shower.

ROSE
I'm sorry, I... everything's
horrible.

Rose is about to break.

WINSTON
Oscar's asleep in back.

ROSE
Norah's ruined everything. She
burnt down a house. A client's
house.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        97.

WINSTON
Yeah.

ROSE
You know?

WINSTON
Carl told me.

ROSE
How does he...?

Realization slaps.

ROSE
That's just great. We burnt down a
client's house. How do you get
around that?

WINSTON
Insurance?

Rose shrugs.

ROSE
I figured we'd wait and get the
better rate once I got certified.

WINSTON
Didn't you go to that?

Rose doesn't respond. She slowly blinks and lets her new
reality ooze over her.

ROSE
There's not a lot I'm really good
at, you know.

Winston looks at Rose.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      98.

ROSE
Really. I'm good at getting guys to
want me. Not date or marry me. But
want me. I've always been good at
that.

Winston looks away.

ROSE
And cheering. I was pretty good at
that too.

WINSTON
Cheering is good.

ROSE
Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd
think.

Winston smiles.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray.

Rose looks up to see Oscar in his PJs, one arm tucked in his
shirt, the sleeve dangling empty. Rose musters a smile.

ROSE
You brush your teeth?

Oscar nods, kisses her good night. Rose watches him walk to
his room and takes a drag from her cigarette.

There's a knock at the door.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose looks through the peep hole and sees Mac fidgeting
outside. She takes a step from the door and freezes.

Mac knocks again.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation. He shifts
his weight and jangles some change in his pocket.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07        99.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.

MAC (O.S.)
Rose?

She takes a breath, opens her eyes, then opens the door.

MAC
Hey beautiful.

Mac smiles for the both of them.

MAC
I was starting to think you were on
a date or something.

Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.

MAC
You okay?

Rose nods.

ROSE
Long day.

MAC
Can I come in?

ROSE
It's not really a good time.

Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.

MAC
I got you something.

Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to
Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.

MAC
It's for your business cards. You
put `em in there and, I don't
know... impress people.

He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.

ROSE
It's beautiful.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       100.

Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.

MAC
You don't like it?

ROSE
No, I like it very much.

Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.

ROSE
It's just this thing we're doing.

MAC
Come on, let's not do that.

But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.

ROSE
I don't want this anymore.

Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.

MAC
So that's it?

Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to
ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.

MAC
That's it then.

Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he
nods and Rose watches him walk away.

INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ ONE WEEK LATER - DAY

Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past
her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn.

Lynn sees Norah and looks away.

GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.)
Is this your first time donating?

Norah turns to the GUY IN THE WHITE COAT addressing her. He
holds a clipboard.

NORAH
No.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       101.

GUY IN WHITE COAT
Can I get your name?

NORAH
I need to talk to Lynn.

Lynn approaches.

LYNN
She can't donate. You can't donate.

She points to a sign indicating how often people can donate.

LYNN
Forty-eight days. It's not been
forty-eight days.

NORAH
Why are you acting like this? Why
haven't you called me back.

LYNN
Listen, I just, don't think you're
the kind of person I need to be
hanging out with right now.

NORAH
What's that supposed to mean?

LYNN
Do I really need to spell it out?

Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of
photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn.

NORAH
Here.

Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining
blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can.

A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an
`I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.

EXT. TINGLEY PARK- DAY

Joe sits on a bench near the pond with his feet propped up on
a canister of Fancy Corn. He reaches into the open canister
next to him and pulls out a handful of gourmet corn.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      101A.

A few pieces land in his mouth, the remainder he tosses to a
flotilla of ducks. Joe smiles as the greedy little bastards
squabble over his offering.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       102.

EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY

Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the
van. Other equipment litters pavement around the van.

Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard.

WINSTON
I'm sure I can turn this stuff
around pretty quick.

ROSE
Thanks. For everything.

OSCAR
Are you coming to my party?

Awkward moment. Rose looks from Oscar to Winston.

ROSE
We're going to Hinkle's Saturday
for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great
if you came.

WINSTON
Sounds like a blast.

Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel.
As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation
note and tosses it in the trash.

INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY

Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like
restaurant. Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular
case. He beams with anticipation.

Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair
of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.

JOE
That other pair we looked at, full
of gadgets and gimmicks.
(MORE)

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       103.
JOE (cont'd)
They just didn't have the heft you
want in a pair of lenses. No
weight. No history.

Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.

JOE
These here are the real deal. I
want you to have them.

Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't
see this coming. But still.

ROSE
Dad, you promised him those others.
From the store. He's been talking
about it for weeks.

Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.

JOE
No Rose, I want to him to have
these.

Winston eyes the binoculars.

WINSTON
Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

Joe nods.

WINSTON
Porro prism?

Joe nods full of pride.

JOE
Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks
on the objectives. Perfect bloom.

Winston looks at Oscar.

WINSTON
You got yourself some classic
binoculars there.

Norah walks in.

NORAH
Sorry I'm late.

Norah noogies Oscar and drops a gift in front of him.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      103A.

NORAH
(to Winston)
Hey.

Norah kisses Joe on the cheek and ignores Rose. Rose gets up.

JOE
Where are you going?

Rose walks to the bathroom.

INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - DAY

Rose splashes water on her face. Norah walks in and leans
against the counter. Rose makes no sign of acknowledgement.

Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.

NORAH
Winston cleans up pretty good.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       104.

Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans
past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.

NORAH
I read somewhere that beauty is
really all about symmetry. Like
having eyes the same size and all
that.
(pause)
So, you know, when you factor that
in he's like, hot.

Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah
walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.

NORAH
Listen, I know I fucked up, okay?
Like really huge and I know that
and I'm sorry, okay?

It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just
the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.

ROSE
God, that drives me crazy! That
whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a
big fuck up' routine. Like that's a
legitimate excuse.

Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards
Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.

NORAH
I really am sorry. But it really
isn't all my fault, Rose.

ROSE
I think there's something wrong
with you. The way your brain works.
I mean, what the hell? It's like
you can't be trusted with anything.
You just screw around all the time
like it's all a big fucking game.
It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not
all just here for your amusement.
You should have been paying
attention. You should have been
focused on the job.

Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She
grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07      104A.

NORAH
You finished?

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       105.

ROSE
I know. I should have been there.

NORAH
What are you going to do now?

ROSE
I got some ideas. I was thinking
maybe we could--

Norah shakes her head.

NORAH
I've got my own ideas.

Rose nods. As they exit, she turns to Norah.

ROSE
So, you really think he's hot?

NORAH
Winston? No.

INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Rose and Norah return from the bathroom. Joe eyeballs the
girls in silent appraisal of the situation. Seems okay.

NORAH
You gonna open my present?

Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos.

OSCAR
Cool.

NORAH
The guy said that if you're careful
they'll last a whole month. And
these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns
and shit. They're all based on
classic biker designs.

Oscar picks up one of the tattoos.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       106.

OSCAR
Cool.

ROSE
What's that say?

NORAH
Li'l bastard.

Rose looks at Norah.

ROSE
Cool.

Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt
and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's
ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve.

NORAH
I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

JOE
Where?

Shrug.

ROSE
How?

NORAH
Haven't worked it all out yet. I
was thinking I could maybe take the
van.

Rose shakes her head.

ROSE
I'm selling the van.

JOE
Don't sell the van.

ROSE
Have to. Can't afford the payment.

JOE
No, listen... just don't sell the
van.

Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza. She can't watch
her father cling to another impotent dream.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       107.

JOE
Just don't sell the van yet. Okay?

Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm
he lifts the binoculars to his face.

JOE
Rose tells me you make models.

WINSTON
Yeah.

JOE
Any money in that?

WINSTON
Not really.

The wait staff begins to sing a birthday song.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rose quietly kisses Oscar's forehead and pulls up the covers.
She turns and steals another look before shutting the door.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills. She opens one,
sighs, sets it aside. She moves on to the next one.

The TV flickers blue light into the room. Rose stops and
looks at the TV.

INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The phone wakes Norah. She fumbles for the receiver.

NORAH
What?

ROSE
(over the phone)
Turn your TV on. Channel sixty-
five.

Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS
hands menus to two hard nosed detectives. One of the TV
DETECITVES looks up and smiles.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     108.

TV DETECTIVE
What's good?

TV WAITRESS/MOTHER
I recommend the pecan pie.

Norah focuses on the flicker light of the TV.

INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As if in a dream Rose watches the image of her mother
disappear off screen. She smiles.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with
each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine
Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag.

She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and
candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at
her. She looks up to see the CB on.

Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment
before taking the handset.

ROSE
Hello? Mom?

Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming.

ROSE
Oscar turned eight today. We had
this whole big thing at Hinkle's.
Winston came. After dinner Oscar
and Norah got a high score on
Centipede and put in ASS as their
initials and got in trouble by the
manager.
(Pause)
I don't know if you're in heaven or
what. But you're not here and
that's too bad for you `cuz you've
missed out. You've missed out on
some really great stuff.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       109.

EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - TWO MONTHS LATER - DAY

Rose pulls up in her Sentra. The Molly Maid magnet is back on
the door and she's in her Molly Maid uniform. She gets out
and sees Joe sitting on the steps to her house.

ROSE
Dad?

JOE
There's something I wanted to talk
to you about.

Rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car.

ROSE
Okay.

JOE
Well, I was wondering if I could
move in with you and Oscar.

ROSE
What?

JOE
Just temporarily - until I find a
place.

ROSE
You lost the house. Oh my god, you
lost the house. Dad how could you
lose the house?

JOE
I didn't lose the house. I sold the
house. There's this business
opportunity--

ROSE
Not shrimp I hope.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07       110.

JOE
It's not just some get rich quick
scheme. And I got a partner who has
experience. I'd learn from her.

Rose's edge softens slightly. She's listening now. Joe points
to where the newly painted Econo van is parked.

In bold cursive: LORKOWSKI CLEANING. Underneath in smaller
letters: SPECIALIZING IN BIOHAZARD REMOVAL SINCE 1963.

ROSE
Nineteen sixty-three?

JOE
Don't make a big deal out of it.

ROSE
Dad.

JOE
It's a business lie, not a real
lie.

ROSE
I can live with that.

JOE
And you'd be the boss.

ROSE
Thank you.

EXT. OPEN ROAD - MONTE CARLO - DAY

With windows down, Norah drives across an open landscape. She
glances at a wind battered map. A highlighted route cuts
across the country. Destination - California.

Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. She
holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind.

EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Oscar, in a Catholic school uniform, holds binoculars to his
face. He watches a scrawny girl across the school yard.

GREEN REVISION 3/5/07     111.

The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the
invisible strand over a pencil. She glances over to Oscar.
Oscar doesn't flinch.

With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls.
It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting.

Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal
the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.

INT. GORILLA FOUNDATION - ONE MONTH LATER - DAY

Norah walks down a corridor. The kitten clings to her. She
turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what
looks to be a play room.

Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground.
Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black
gorilla. KOKO. She turns her massive head and looks at Norah.

KOKO
(captions)
I have a tooth ache.

KoKo responds with thick hands.

NORAH
(captions)
Me too.

Norah smiles.

EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

The Lorkowski Cleaning van merges on the freeway interchange
and spirals up the tangle of rust and turquoise ramps.

FADE OUT.
