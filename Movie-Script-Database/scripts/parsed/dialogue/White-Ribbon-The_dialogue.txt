TRACKING SHOT:=>Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly dressed woman in her late thirties hurries along the village street.
SILENCE.=>MARIE : Please forgive us. MARTIN : Please forgive us. SILENCE. Then the pastor speaks very quietly, without turning to the two children:
PAUSE.=>RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?
PAUSE.=>XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long time ago. Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark in the kitchen. Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. The plate shatters on the floor. At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts to sob, but tries to hide it from her brother.
INT/NIGHT=>The steward and his children Liesl , Georg and Ferdinand ] are waiting for something. Then the door opens and the midwife comes out. She tells them to come into the other room. NARRATOR: That night, the wife of the steward gave birth to her fourth and last child at the age of 42. The children want to follow their father. At least Liesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain, can't wait to go in. But the midwife tells them to be patient, and only the father is let through. LIESL : What is it? MIDWIFE : Well, what do you think? LIESL : I don't know. MIDWIFE: It's a boy. FERDINAN
FRANZ: I...=>FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with your scythe. Sure, that'll bring your mother back to life. He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking. The others follow. After a few steps FRANZ : I think our father loved our mother. Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost crying with fury and despair: FARMER: Shut up! CLOSE ANGLE: Paul. He was listening carefully the whole time. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes. NARRATOR: After these two days in July, life in the village returned to what it had always been...
EXT/DAY=>A bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both wearing their white ribbons, the pastor's other
LAUGHTER.=>FIRST FARMHAN
BACK TO THE SCENE.=>The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Here and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate the cleaning up. Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast courtyard. Half way across he screams: BARON: BrÃ¤ker!! The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the barn. He walks toward the Baron. BARON. Have you seen my son? STEWARD : No. BARON : Could you please ask your boys. Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole bunch of kids. STEWAR
IN THE COURTYARD.=>Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches. The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by the narrator's voice.
IN THE COURTYARD.=>The men come in with a stretcher. ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher, lying on his belly.
BACK TO THE SCENE.=>The people are leaving the church, groups are forming. As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they're shunned. Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA follows. NARRATOR: ...His threat about loosing the peace of the community couldn't mean anything good. At the same time the mysterious character of what were obviously criminal deeds fed the mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since time immemorial.
BACK TO THE SCENE. STAIRWELL.=>DOCTOR : Rudi? He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xenia shrugs her shoulders, clueless:
LIVING ROOM=>There's nobody. They go into the kitchen KITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, in the pantry. Nobody.
PAUSE:=>I heard you even wanted to visit me at the hospital. And now you lock yourself in? PAUSE. The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carrying the luggage upstairs. Then he keeps on talking to Rudolph: All right. Then, I don't want to see you either. I'm going away now. You can stay in the toilet, if you want. He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits a moment and then leaves the house.
PAUSE.=>DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you? XENIA: Yes. PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia: DOCTOR: How old are you now? XENIA: Fourteen. The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his head. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while he says: DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your mother. Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers:
PAUSE.=>MIDWIFE: It was difficult with the children, without you. DOCTOR: I know. MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me. DOCTOR: Who? MIDWIFE: Rudi. DOCTOR : He's at a difficult age. MIDWIFE: Actually not. PAUSE. Then: They're always at a difficult age. DOCTOR : Yes.
LONG PAUSE.=>MIDWIFE: You didn't miss me. DOCTOR: Come on. What are you saying?! MIDWIFE: Nothing. I said it because it's the truth.
PAUSE.=>DOCTOR: There's nothing like a nice dose of self-hate. MIDWIFE: What? DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it.
ROOM.=>How long has the window been open? STEWAR
PAUSE.=>LIESL : When did you go down to see Father? Down in his office. FERDINAN
PAUSE.=>Well. And why are you so focused on that girl? She's almost still a child. You could almost be her father. SCHOOLTEACHER : I'm thirty-one. FATHER : Well, you can still handle what matters. MOTHER : Father! Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look. FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether she's willing to get married. She's still a child. She hasn't seen anything of the world. To Eva: Say something. Do you want him? Eva wishes the earth would engulf her. FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He walked all the way over through the fresh snow. MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone. Of course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?! FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut! Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears out of shame. The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly at the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran out. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite toward the father. The father says calmly:
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...? EVA: Yes.
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you?
PAUSE.=>EVA: Is that all right with you, sir? SCHOOLTEACHER : Don't be so formal with me. Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his hand in her hand. They remain seated without saying a word.
ESTABLISHING SHOT.=>A big barn is blazing fiercely. SOUNDS of the FIRE. Against it we see, as silhouettes, the Baron, the steward and his wife, the pastor, and all those, who are vainly trying to save thing.
PAUSE.=>MIDWIFE : Why did this only occur to you now? DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have occurred to me? At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome you were. One grows sentimental when one's in pain.
PAUSE.=>DOCTOR : Get out. Why don't you get out. Don't you have any pride? MIDWIFE : There's no room for any with you. DOCTOR: That's true. MIDWIFE: Aren't you afraid that I might do something silly? DOCTOR : Go ahead. At least that would surprise me. But be careful: it might be painful. MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't care anyway. DOCTOR: Well... She looks at him.
CLASSROOMS.=>The children are going wild. Brawling, sponge and chalk are flying through the air. Some are packing up their belongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short, the way children behave once the lesson is over. Marie stands at the classroom door. She watches her classmates. The she looks through the door into the
CORRIDOR.=>It's empty. She comes back to the CLASSROOM, but stays at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the corridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as a lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a teacher. The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on. Suddenly, Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDOR with her father. The two are having an animated conversation. Marie bursts into the CLASSROOM and closes the door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to her classmates: MARIE: Watch out, he's coming! But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn't heard by all of the pupils. The noise dies down, some of them stop misbehaving. Somebody picks up the sponge, and
QUIET!!!!=>At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes in with the schoolteacher. Almost instantly, the room becomes QUIET. Without saying a word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by the ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. The pupils remain silent, embarrassed. While the pastor goes back to the black board, putting his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the lack of discipline of his classroom, says: SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on here? Why are you still here? You know that there's a confirmation class now! Get out! The children disappear quickly. To the first child who tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says: How about saying good-bye? Immediately all the CHILDREN rushing out say: Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor! Finally, all the children have left the classroom, except eight candidates for confirmation, among them Paul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to the wall. The schoolteacher turns to the pastor: SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm sorry, Pastor. It won't happen again. The pastor answers with a reserved nod. In an icy silence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils to leave. As the schoolteacher notices that there will be no further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly to him and says: Good-bye, Pastor. PASTOR: Good-bye. The schoolteacher leaves the room. The pastor turns to the candidates for confirmation: Let us pray. They say the LORD'S PRAYER together. Then the pastor says: Sit down.
STAIRWELL.=>The only light comes in from the living room. Rudolph comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt. RUDOLPH : Xeni? He goes into the LIVING ROOM. It's empty. RUDOLPH : Xeni? Where are you? He goes into the KITCHEN. It's also empty. Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry. Finally, he goes back to the STAIRWELL and goes up the stairs to his room. On the stairway, he notices light coming from under the door of the practice. He goes back down the stairs down again and opens the door of the PRACTICE. In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, are the doctor and Xenia. The doctor has his back to Rudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first. She sits on
PAUSE.=>LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl became ill, I dreamt that my brother put him beside the open window, so that he'd die. And the day the window was open and he caught a chill and he almost died.
PASTOR:=>Accept and drink! This is the blood of the New Testament, Shed for the forgiveness of your sins.
CORRIDOR.=>Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of other children are waiting at the classroom door. They remain silent. They're listening.
THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.=>Georg stands at the window and looks down at the
THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.=>Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table, doing his homework. We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then the father's hasty STEPS on the stairs. Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out of breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly STEWAR
SCREAMS OF PAIN=>After a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs after her husband, and we now hear her trying in vain trying to control her husband. EMMA: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don't kill him...!
PAUSE.=>BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that? BARONESS : I don't know yet. But in any case, we're leaving this place. BARON : We. Look of the Baroness . BARONESS: Yes. The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leads to a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to the window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, she looks at the Baroness inquiringly:
PAUSE.=>BARONESS : Do you think that will help us solve the problem? BARON: What? BARONESS: Your sarcasm. BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to be solved? The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to leave the room. BARON : You stay here!! She turns around, looks at him. BARON : You only leave this room if I tell you to do so. She looks at him. BARONESS: Fine. She goes back to her chair and sits down. BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you force me to do it: During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in a financial matter. He courted me and was also very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to him. Despite all this, we came back. Because I feel committed to you. But I can't stand this place any longer. Not so much for me personally, though I can't say that life with you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age. But if I leave this place, it's because I don't
PAUSE.=>BARON: Did you sleep with him? BARONESS : You don't understand anything. BARON: Did you sleep with him?
PAUSE.=>BARONESS : No. I didn't sleep with him.
PAUSE.=>BARON: You're lying, aren't you? The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about to leave the room again. At the same moment, somebody KNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation BARON : Come in! The steward appears. STEWAR
DINING ROOM=>opens again. The Baron comes back inside. He looks distressed. The Baroness doesn't know whether this is the result of her conversation, or of the message brought by the steward. The Baron paces a few steps, pondering, then glances at his wife. Finally, she asks BARONESS: What's going on?
PAUSE.=>Please! Lend me the bicycle. SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on? After hesitating a while MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I now know who committed all these crimes. SCHOOLTEACHER : Who? MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle? SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me? MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the police. I won't let them insult me : As you just saw. SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his horse? MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride. The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she doesn't respond, and says:
TRACKING SHOT.=>NARRATOR: With each step I took from the estate back to the school, I felt more foolish for having given away the bicycle. As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind the fence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes, Marie and a few other children. The shutters of the house are closed. As I passed the midwife's house, I saw Marie, Martin, and a few other children in the garden. The schoolteacher stops, watches the children. After a few moments, they notice that somebody is watching them. MARIE: Good evening, Sir. SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening, Marie. CHILDREN: Good evening, Sir. SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you doing here? MARIE: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing.
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't you see that the shutters are closed. PAUSE.
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you could come in here. The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate in the fence, and go out into the street. They're visibly embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when they were doing something wrong. Some avoid the schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. The schoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of the garden door, he says: SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now, hurry. Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again she greets him politely. MARIE: Good evening, Teacher. SCHOOLTEACHER : Good evening. The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on his way. After a few steps he turns around and looks at the children, then walks on.
STAIRWELL.=>The pastor's wife and the schoolteacher stand before the closed front door. PASTOR'S WIFE: His daughter? Wasn't she with you at your school? SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was. PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say anything? The schoolteacher shakes his head. They both remain silent and pensive.
PAUSE.=>THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down? SCHOOLTEACHER : Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure. They sit down. The children sit opposite the schoolteacher. PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? , : A cup of coffee? Like during the piano lessons First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone with the children. SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very kind of you. PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute. The schoolteacher turns to the children: SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was leaving Eichwald? Short PAUSE. MARIE: No. SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at my question. MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch us. SCHOOLTEACHER: And Xenia didn't tell you anything about it? MARIE: No. She looks at Martin who confirms it: MARTIN: No. SCHOOLTEACHER : Not a word? It's very unusual for a child not to tell his classmates before going away on a trip. MARIE : Xenia never talks much about home. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely different?!
PAUSE.=>MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him a visit. The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further this way. SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who could have treated Hansi that way? PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds: And Sigi?
PAUSE.=>And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden? And who set fire to the barn? Well?!
PAUSE.=>MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered. SCHOOLTEACHER: Well? MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it must be a sick person. PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on. SCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi.
PAUSE.=>MARIE: I don't understand. With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders. SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you? MARIE : Who?
PAUSE.=>Why do you ask us?
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER: You're an intelligent girl, Marie. Don't try and play dumb.
PAUSE.=>MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should talk with Father about this or with Mother. Shall I go get her?
PAUSE.=>SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's son... the last time he had been seen, he was with the children. The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face slowly freezes to a mask of refusal: PASTOR: What are you getting at? Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. But he has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSE he goes on: SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly, she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it to her? LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few steps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to the schoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardly speak: PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're saying that your pupils, my children included, committed these crimes. Is that right? The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful gesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role. Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues: Do you realize what you're saying? PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control his emotions. Do you know...
HIGH ANGLE SHOT:=>The villagers are about to take their seats. The smaller children are sitting with their parents on the pews. All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia are in uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitement reigns everywhere. Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and their son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the front row.
CLOSE-UPS:=>Of all the adult leading characters of the film, aside from the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and her father.
MORE CLOSE-UPS.=>The schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands and cues them to begin. They start SINGING. We see them one after the other. At the end we see Marie: she wears the white ribbon in her hair.
