LOGAN=>Wake up...come on, Logan-6.
FRANCIS=>You should've seen me take my last Runner...perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated...his hand... So now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep?
FRANCIS=>Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
FRANCIS=>Okay...you really want to wake him up?
LOGAN=>Hey, cut that out !
LOGAN=>Now you've done it...
VOICE=>Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
LOGAN=>Logan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
VOICE=>Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
VOICE=>Sleep time...go to sleep. Sleeping time, little ones.
FRANCIS=>You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate... your alert successor...Logan-6.
LOGAN=>Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
FRANCIS=>Not in my time...
LOGAN=>just wondered...what happens?
LOGAN=>but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says. One for one. One for one."
FRANCIS=>Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea?
FRANCIS=>Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman
MAN=>Well? How do you like it?
MAN=>Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
WOMAN=>Too little.
MAN=>Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me.
LOGAN=>Did you ever see Francis-8?
FRANCIS=>I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
FRANCIS=>and that's my friend, Logan. We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along?
FRANCIS=>You're thirty -- already? I always thought I was older than you - Well, give it a good try.
WOMAN=>That's all right. Happy turn.
2ND WOMAN=>You'll renew. I've got a feeling.
2ND WOMAN=>I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.
WOMAN=>Um-huh.
FRANCIS=>I guess you never had her?
FRANCIS=>You missed something special.
LOGAN=>Well...you can't have them all.
LOGAN AND FRANCIS=>But you can try.
FRANCIS=>The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
LOGAN=>You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him -
FRANCIS=>Damn! That's right. Just when I feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade .
LOGAN=>Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anyway
LOGAN=>Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
FRANCIS=>Only a few? You're just not trying.
CROWD=>Renew!
CROWD=>Renew!
CROWD'S CHANT=>Renew!
LOGAN AND FRANCIS=>Renew!
CROWD'S CHANT=>Re...
LOGAN=>Looks like I'm working.
LOGAN=>Who invited you?
FRANCIS=>I'm in my party mood.
59X12-=>63X1 OUT
LOGAN=>Runner terminated 0:31 Ready for cleanup.
LOGAN=>That was a great shot you made.
FRANCIS=>Yes. But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
FRANCIS=>...Well I think you're getting stale. You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out...
FRANCIS=>I'll look for you here when I'm off--
63X19 LOGAN=>Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit.
LOGAN=>What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA=>Please . . .No.
LOGAN=>Please . . . no ? You mean "not here"--that's it? You're a private Available but particular, Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
JESSICA=>No. Just no.
LOGAN=>You prefer women?
JESSICA=>No.
LOGAN=>Well then...?
JESSICA=>Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN=>Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA=>A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN=>Yes...probably he was renewed?
JESSICA=>He was killed
LOGAN=>Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA=>Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
LOGAN=>I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners Who brought you?
JESSICA=>Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit.
LOGAN=>You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA=>Jessica.
LOGAN=>You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA=>No.
LOGAN=>Later.
JESSICA=>No.
LOGAN=>But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA=>I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN=>And?
JESSICA=>I changed my mind
LOGAN=>And now?
JESSICA=>Curious.
LOGAN=>About what?
JESSICA=>How a Sandman lives.
LOGAN=>Let's have sex. I thought you were curious.
JESSICA=>Not about that.
LOGAN=>I'm listening.
JESSICA=>I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN=>I'm not armed. Well?
JESSICA=>Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN=>You shouldn't even think such things... And you picked a strange person to say them to -
JESSICA=>I suppose. But what if you want to live?
LOGAN=>So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
LOGAN=>When this turns black...that's it. If for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...Carrousel.
JESSICA=>Six. I go red next year.
LOGAN=>You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to try?
LOGAN=>What Quad do you live in?
JESSICA=>K.
LOGAN=>It's nice to know you can nod.
LOGAN=>It's nice co know you can do that, too.
FRANCIS=>These are for me -- you've got your own. She must have been something--?
LOGAN=>What happened to you?
LOGAN=>How come?
SANDMAN=>Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. One of them cut me bad... all the way down.
FRANCIS=>CUBS!
LOGAN=>Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now.
64AX1-=>64BX1 OUT
LOGAN=>I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
FRANCIS=>You? Why? You're already beautiful.
LOGAN=>No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
CLEAR=>FRANCIS-7
FRANCIS=>See you in the hydrotoner!

LOGAN=>My Lifeclock... Question: My Life--
LOGAN=>Question: Am I still six Red?
FRANCIS=>What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN=>Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS=>I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
LOGAN=>Did you?
FRANCIS=>Of course.
LOGAN=>Anybody we know?
FRANCIS=>Look....why don't you get into the water....you need it....more than I do.
LOGAN=>I'm fine.... See you....
FRANCIS=>At Carousel tonight?
LOGAN=>Location...female Green Six... name Jessica...living in Quad K.
LOGAN=>She has.
JESSICA=>You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN=>But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA=>Here I am. Shall I come in?
LOGAN=>I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA=>I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN=>Maybe...sure....
JESSICA=>Thanks...but I have the choice.
LOGAN=>Of course.
JESSICA=>Then it's still no.
JESSICA=>You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN=>You know
JESSICA=>I don't believe you. There has to be more.
LOGAN=>All right.
JESSICA=>Why show me?
LOGAN=>I'm going to run.
LOGAN=>You know something.
JESSICA=>About running, dying what?
LOGAN=>Both...running's what I'm interested in.
JESSICA=>I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN=>It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA=>How can I?
JESSICA=>Where did you get that?
LOGAN=>A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA=>And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN=>I let him go...believe me.
JESSICA=>I don't..
JESSICA=>Please? What friends?
LOGAN=>I don't have much time.
JESSICA=>I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . .
LOGAN=>What can I do to make you believe me?
SECOND MAN=>He's blinking...so what? Sandmen get old, too.
FIRST MAN=>But what if he's telling the truth?
THIRD MAN=>I say no. It's not worth the risk.
WOMAN=>I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings.
JESSICA=>He was born a Sandman. He had no choice.
WOMAN=>Neither do we.
1ST SANDMAN=>Thanks, Francis.
1ST SANDMAN=>Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run.
JESSICA=>Why Arcade Station?
JESSICA=>Right at the station itself?
MAN=>No - just there - on the first level. Don't look for us. We'll see you.
THIRD MAN=>Tonight?
WOMAN=>I think you can. Don't you?
WOMAN=>I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary -- and that makes him dangerous to all of us.
SECOND MAN=>We're counting on you.
LOGAN=>Are you here to help me?
JESSICA=>What do you need?
JESSICA=>What're you going to do?
LOGAN=>That's tomorrow.
JESSICA=>I wish I could help you.
LOGAN=>Maybe you'll chink of something...
JESSICA=>I wish I knew what you think I know.
LOGAN=>If you did know, you'd tell me.
JESSICA=>Of course--
LOGAN=>Tell me, Jessica.
RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2=>...LOGAN-5
1ST SANDMAN=>Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight-- why don't you--
LOGAN=>A Runner...Cathedral. A woman.
JESSICA=>You're not going, are you?
LOGAN=>Have you ever been through Cathedral?
LOGAN=>They're like beasts. Wild.
JESSICA=>Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
JESSICA=>Some people say children need human mothering.
LOGAN=>Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
JESSICA=>I'm only telling you what I've heard... Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
LOGAN=>Uh-uh.
JESSICA=>I have.
LOGAN=>When did you begin to question Lastday?
JESSICA=>I don't remember exactly...except I was a Green. What would you like to relive, Logan?
VOICE=>Attention passengers. Cathedral Station is a personal risk area. Persons with business are warned to be careful.
JESSICA=>I've never been in this quadrant. Is that Arcade off there?
LOGAN=>Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside there--to rush you when it opens...
LOGAN=>Quickly now--
JESSICA=>Muscle? I don't know that one.
LOGAN=>It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you to pieces--speeds everything up to a blur-- you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on muscle--splat!
JESSICA=>What's your name?
MARY=>I'm Mary 2.
JESSICA=>Where do you live, Mary?
MARY=>Here.
JESSICA=>Why aren't you in Nursery?
MARY=>I'm very smart.
JESSICA=>When do you go up?
MARY=>I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
LOGAN=>Not here. Might be a decoy.
LOGAN=>Runner!
BILLY=>Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner!
A VOICE=>We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?!
LOGAN=>I'm a Sandman!
BILLY=>I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him...but I cut him up good, I did.
BILLY=>For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman!
LOGAN=>No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
LOGAN=>Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
LOGAN=>No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
BILLY=>Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
ANOTHER VOICE=>Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!!
A VOICE=>Give him some Muscle!!
ANOTHER VOICE=>Shake him to death!!
A VOICE=>Kill him!
BILLY=>We can rush him...we can take can take him again, we can!!
LOGAN=>All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?!
LOGAN=>Come on, Billy...come on...you cut a Sandman, didn't you?!
LOGAN=>Come on, Billy...cut me...Come on
LOGAN=>They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here?
WOMAN=>I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!!
LOGAN=>Sanctuary? Anything?
LOGAN=>If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away...It's blind gas.
SECOND MAN=>I almost believed her.
JESSICA=>I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
LOGAN=>Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
JESSICA=>Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
LOGAN=>Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain
JESSICA=>No. Not that either.
LOGAN=>All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.
SANDMAN=>What happened?!
FRANCIS=>Can you beat it....I've got the damn wrong bag.
SANDMAN=>You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, Francis.
RECEPTIONIST=>Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN=>Hello.
RECEPTIONIST=>Do you want to see Doc?
RECEPTIONIST=>We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
LOGAN=>It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST=>My name's Holly...Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN=>No - Look, I'm in a hurry.
HOLLY=>Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman.
WOMAN CUSTOMER=>Is this your first time?
WOMAN CUSTOMER=>No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?
LOGAN=>Just one.
HOLLY=>Doc's ready, Sandman.
DOC=>It's a real privilege, Sandman.
LOGAN=>Thanks. I thought you'd be older. I ex- pected a Red.
LOGAN=>Your own work?
DOC=>I designed it myself. What'll it be ...a face job or a full-body job?
LOGAN=>Just the face.
DOC=>Fine....Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
DOC=>Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table... and other things. I'll be back in a minute.
HOLLY=>He's going to sterilize himself.
LOGAN=>Do I have to undress?
HOLLY=>Not for your face.
DOC=>You shouldn't have brought him here.
JESSICA;=>I didn't bring him -- what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run.
DOC=>Run!? He's a Sandman.
JESSICA=>I tell you he's running. I know.
DOC=>Maybe...Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else. All right. He gets a face.
HOLLY=>I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair.
DOC'S VOICE=>All set?
HOLLY=>Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else.
DOC=>Why not?
DOC=>Do you have anything special in mind?
LOGAN=>I don't care...Just get it over with.
LOGAN=>Holly'd like dark hair.
DOC=>Holly'd like a lot of things. We can start by narrowing the cheekbones.
DOC=>Hello Yes Yes, they are. Done.
DOC=>Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine.
DOC=>With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one...watch now...
DOC=>But here's the improvement. Instant healing---before you feel a thing. Watch now...
DOC=>Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath-- absolute precision. Watch now
DOC=>Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.
HOLLY=>No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
DOC=>Damn right! It was a trap. They know!
LOGAN=>No - I'm Running!
LOGAN=>It has nothing to do with you.
FRANCIS=>What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go? I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
JESSICA=>Follow me, Logan. Stay close.
WANTON=>I have an empty one, Sandman
LOGAN=>Are you taking me to them?
JESSICA=>Yes. I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. Why do you keep running from your--
LOGAN=>Because he's my friend - and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone.
JESSICA=>He's good, isn't he?
LOGAN=>Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now...
LOGAN=>I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis.
JESSICA=>They won¹t listen.
JESSICA=>We'll convince them.
JESSICA=>Yes, Logan. I'm glad they didn't change your face.
VOICE=>Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are.
2ND VOICE=>Is she the one?
LOGAN=>I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me.
VOICE=>He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.
2ND VOICE=>You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life. -
LOGAN=>Yes I have. Now it's my turn. And I want to live.
HOLLY=>Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...
HOLLY=>It's him! The first Sandman. He killed...Doc.
JESSICA=>No, Holly--wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
JESSICA=>Holly. Holly! Please...The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after--
LOGAN=>May we move?
VOICE=>I saw we pass them through. Somebody help Holly.
VOICE=>You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key.
LOGAN=>I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
VOICE=>It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN=>I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
VOICE=>Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
LOGAN=>No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
JESSICA=>Why?- No...no...I'm going with you.
VOICE1=>Only to the lock. After that there's no way back.
LOGAN=>Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
LOGAN=>Come on then--they'll be here any minute!
FRANCIS=>Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done...gone crazy over a Runner? Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest. Logan...you're a Sandman! Logan...now...now...Logan...
VOICE=>Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again...use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary.
LOGAN=>Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner.
JESSICA=>There's no turning back, is there?
JESSICA=>How do we know this is the right way?
LOGAN=>It's the only way.
JESSICA=>What do you suppose this was...?
LOGAN=>Some kind of breeding pens...I suppose...They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything To eat, of course.
JESSICA=>Ycch. To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
JESSICA=>It's Francis, isn't it?
LOGAN=>It's brighter there...besides, we can't go back.
JESSICA=>Wait.
LOGAN=>It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA=>You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN=>You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?
LOGAN=>I had to. I did kill...for the first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA=>Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
LOGAN=>I guess so...I know I felt something I never felt before...and I didn't like it...not a bit. I'll tell you one thing...Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
JESSICA=>For us.
VOICE=>Overwhelming, isn't it?
BOX=>Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken? I'm neither machine nor man...but a perfect fusion of the two...and better than either. No human sculptor could match this greatness...don't you agree?
LOGAN=>All right - what are you?
JESSICA=>It's incredibly beautiful.
BOX=>Ah, but wait for the winds. Then my birds sing. My walrus breathes. My palace chimes and bells. And the deep grottoes whisper my name...Box Box...Bahhhhxxxxsss...
BOX=>Anything to eat?
LOGAN=>This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?
BOX=>You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
BOX=>From? From? From?
LOGAN=>We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
LOGAN=>Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!!
BOX=>Is that the wind? Not yet... You must hear my birds sing.
LOGAN=>You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
BOX=>Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
LOGAN=>Where do you send them?
BOX=>You're a beautiful pair.
JESSICA=>Please.
BOX=>I've never seen humans whom I thought worthy of being here... I'd like to sculpt you. Where would I put you? I know...you'd be the base of the column. You'd hold up my world!
BOX=>Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years...or thirty thousand years...but thirty thousand thousand years...and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll...Ages. And you'll be here...the two of you... eternally frozen...frozen...beautiful.
LOGAN=>That's better. How do you want us?
BOX=>Nude. Imagine, a pair.
BOX=>Up there.
LOGAN=>How do you want us?
BOX=>Enchanting. Is that what humans do?
BOX'S VOICE=>Superb!
BOX'S VOICE=>Done...Done...Done...
LOGAN=>All right. Now you keep your bargain.
BOX=>Regular storage procedure...the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
LOGAN=>What other food?
BOX=>Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea...And then it stopped coming and they came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea
LOGAN=>Tell us how to get out...or I¹ll destroy you..I'll kill you!
JESSICA=>Is there something on fire!!
LOGAN=>It seems to be moving away. Come on...
LOGAN=>It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
LOGAN=>Jessica -- we must be outside!
277-287X1=>OUT
288XA1 FRANCIS=>Coming out through the fissure in the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica did.
JESSICA=>Don't!
LOGAN=>Sooner or later, we'll have to try something
LOGAN=>They're good.
JESSICA=>It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
LOGAN=>Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
JESSICA=>Where do you think that heat-ball went?
JESSICA=>Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
LOGAN=>I doubt it.
JESSICA=>Don't ever let go.
LOGAN=>I won't.
LOGAN=>It all seemed to make sense until Box.
JESSICA=>Do you think he was telling the Truth?
LOGAN=>You're right...it must be near now. We'll find it.
288X6-=>288X8 TRACKING SHOTS WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA
JESSICA=>Logan!!!Look!! No...your palm...look!!!
LOGAN=>Of course.
JESSICA=>Then the answer's Yes...
LOGAN=>I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
LOGAN=>They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
JESSICA=>"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
JESSICA=>Francis?
LOGAN=>How old are you?
MAN=>As old as I am I suppose...who knows ?
LOGAN=>Your hair is white.
MAN=>It wasn't always. I remember when it wasn't. But it wasn't your color either. ...or yours. I have my color somewhere.
JESSICA=>Those cracks in your face...do they hurt?
MAN=>Oh, no...
JESSICA=>Could I touch them?
MAN=>Oh, my...please try.
JESSICA=>What's your name?
MAN=>I've forgotten. It's been so long since I've used it.
MAN=>But all of my cats have names.
LOGAN=>Is that what they're called-- cats?
OLD MAN=>Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
JESSICA=>But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
OLD MAN=>Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE
DIFFERENT NAMES."=>An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
LOGAN=>How long have you been living here?
OLD MAN=>For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN=>What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN=>Just a place, I suppose...who knows?
LOGAN=>How did you get here?
OLD MAN=>I have always been here...
LOGAN=>Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN=>Gracious...no.
LOGAN=>Have any other people ever passed through?
OLD MAN=>But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN=>What makes you think so?
OLD MAN=>My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
JESSICA=>And...and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
OLD MAN=>Yes...
JESSICA=>Are you sure?
OLD MAN=>Mother and Father said so... you know?
LOGAN=>Where are they?
OLD MAN=>Dead...they're dead...and buried.
OLD MAN=>May I see your hand again?
OLD MAN=>They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
LOGAN=>No--I'm sorry. It's not possible.
LOGAN=>I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
JESSICA=>Here you can have this.
OLD MAN=>What kind of jewel is this?
JESSICA=>I don't know.
OLD MAN=>You're both full of secrets like Macavity. Did you steal this?
JESSICA=>No.
OLD MAN=>"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
LOGAN=>What's beyond this place - do you know?
OLD MAN=>No, no, no
LOGAN=>Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
OLD MAN=>Never, never, ever. Nothing.
LOGAN=>May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
OLD MAN=>Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
JESSICA=>What belongs to the people?
OLD MAN=>All this. All of it.
JESSICA=>What people?
OLD MAN=>I don't know...but it does.
OLD MAN=>I'll be right back. Oh, yes...about the cats... one rule is true: "Don't speak till you are spoken to."
LOGAN=>That sweet madman -- how could he Come to exist?
JESSICA=>He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
LOGAN=>One in a million, I suppose
LOGAN=>There's nothing to go on to, Jessica.
JESSICA=>There's a Sanctuary...there is!
LOGAN=>You want there to be one...that Doesn't...
OLD MAN=>Oh, my don't cry.
LOGAN=>That's the same fellow who's outside. If he was so important - why isn't he first?
FRANCIS=>What did you do to him?
FRANCIS=>Why? Why you? Do you know you ruined him? Do you know that? Can you tell me why? Why you? And now you've killed him, you know...
FRANCIS' VOICE=>Here!!!!
LOGAN=>Look at your palm, Francis.... look! It's clear. Clear!
FRANCIS=>Why did you do that??!!
LOGAN=>I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that....
FRANCIS=>Logan! You renewed!
OLD MAN=>Oh, my...he died...
OLD MAN=>We¹ll have to bury him.
JESSICA=>What¹s that?
OLD MAN=>They¹re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
OLD MAN=>I¹ll make the arrangements.
OLD MAN=>Are you ready to put him in?
LOGAN=>Not yet.
OLD MAN=>All right.
OLD MAN'S VOICE=>"Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night."
OLD MAN=>Of course...that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA=>We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
LOGAN=>What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
JESSICA=>He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
JESSICA=>To what?
LOGAN=>I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and--
LOGAN=>Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
JESSICA=>Things won't change...you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
JESSICA=>You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!!
JESSICA=>I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
LOGAN=>I know...I know...
LOGAN=>We're leaving.
OLD MAN=>What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
JESSICA=>Come with us.
OLD MAN=>Where are you going?
LOGAN=>To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
OLD MAN=>Alive?
OLD MAN=>Thousands and thousands...as many as my cats?
LOGAN=>More...many more.
OLD MAN=>And all alive you say?
OLD MAN=>Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey?
LOGAN=>I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light.
OLD MAN=>That's better than gold when it's cold.
LOGAN=>Thank you. Tell me - what do those words mean? "Beloved husband²...²Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"'...
OLD MAN=>My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used - to stay together.
LOGAN=>Stay? They lived together all their years?
OLD MAN=>Oh, yes...I think...
JESSICA=>And Sanctuary?
LOGAN=>Sanctuary is the right to live.... nothing more. But nothing less, either....
JESSICA=>What does that water do?
LOGAN=>It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
JESSICA=>Is it inside the city?
LOGAN=>Of course. I don't know where... I Just took them for granted. It's our only chance.
LOGAN=>I'm sorry.
OLD MAN=>Yes...
LOGAN=>Can you make it back?
OLD MAN=>Oh my...I'll try.
OLD MAN=>Oh, my...
LOGAN'S VOICE=>No!! Don't go in there !!
LOGAN=>You don't have to die!! No one has to die at thirty!!! You don't have to blink out on Lastday. There's no renewal on Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old... I've seen it. She's seen it!! Believe me!!
