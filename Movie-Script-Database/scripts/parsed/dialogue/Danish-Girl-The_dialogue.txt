OLDER WOMAN=>Don't you wish you could paint like that?
GERDA=>I'm sorry...?
OLDER WOMAN=>I said, don't you wish you could paint like your husband? Really - you must be so proud...
RASMUSSEN=>They're all Veijle, where he grew up.
ULLA=>It's going very well.
GERDA=>Oh yes. He'll be impossible.
GERDA=>And Rasmussen...
EINAR=>Oh, come on. Be kind. At least he agreed to see your work.
GERDA=>Only because he was drunk!
EINAR=>I know.
GERDA=>You were loving it!
EINAR=>I was not.
GERDA=>"I don't say my client is the best landscape artist in Denmark..."
EINAR=>"But..."
GERDA=>"He is in the top one!"
MAN AT WINDOW=>Hey - people are sleeping!
GERDA=>Do you know what time it is?
EINAR=>Time you came back to bed?
GERDA=>No - I'm ready to start work.
EINAR=>Draw down the blinds.
GERDA=>I told you, I...
EINAR=>Gerda...
GERDA=>What?
EINAR=>Do you want to resist me?
GERDA=>No. But I'd like you to ask nicely so I don't feel such a pushover...
EINAR=>Gerda Wegener - my life, my wife...
EINAR=>Thorbjorn.
STAGE DOORMAN=>Mr Wegener.
ULLA=>Tighter!
EINAR=>My guilty secret's out.
ULLA=>So - when are you two going to breed me a godchild?
EINAR=>You're an atheist.
ULLA=>I'll reconsider.
EINAR=>We're trying.
ULLA=>Try harder. I've been waiting an eternity. Have you tried drinking raw eggs?
EINAR=>No.
ULLA=>Do it. For my sake.
EINAR=>I wanted to check on the scrim for the storm scene. And give Gerda some space.
ULLA=>Ah - she's got a shy one.
EINAR=>So I heard.
ULLA=>I won't be shy.
EINAR=>I should imagine not.
ULLA=>Good God, she'll need all her colours for me!
FONNESBECH=>I wanted to say... I appreciate our being alone today. I hope your husband doesn't mind.
GERDA=>Not at all. I could see his being here made you uncomfortable.
FONNESBECH=>It wasn't personal.
GERDA=>It's not uncommon.
FONNESBECH=>Ah.
GERDA=>It's hard for a man to be looked at by a woman. Women are used to it, of course, but for a man...
GERDA=>Well?
EINAR=>Perfect. Almost.
RASMUSSEN=>All portraits...
GERDA=>Is that bad?
RASMUSSEN=>Not per se, but... this kind of work is not really my...
EINAR=>How was it?
GERDA=>Fine.
EINAR=>I finally mixed the right colour for the snow.
GERDA=>Another view of Vejle. I don't know how you can paint the same thing over and over.
EINAR=>I suppose I just haven't finished with it yet.
GERDA=>Could you please not speak to Rasmussen about me again... My work is my business. Stay out of it.
GERDA=>I have my period.
EINAR=>I'm sorry.
GERDA=>Are you?
EINAR=>Of course I am... You know I am.
GERDA=>Could you help me with something?
EINAR=>Anything.
GERDA=>Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled again. Would you try on her stockings and shoes?
EINAR=>I'll do it. It's fine.
GERDA=>Hvappe...
EINAR=>I saw these in the window of Fonnesbech's...
GERDA=>Smart aren't they?
EINAR=>I don't think they'll fit...
GERDA=>Well just do what you can.
EINAR=>Gerda, I'm not putting it on.
GERDA=>I haven't asked you to.
ULLA=>Well hello, there!
GERDA=>Such concentration. Sometimes when you're working, I think you're going to slip through the surface of the painting and vanish.
EINAR=>Hans. It was Hans' kite I crashed.
GERDA=>He's probably still sitting on a rock, sobbing his heart out.
EINAR=>He's a dealer in Paris, peddling Old Masters to rich Americans.
GERDA=>Oh. So we don't need to worry about Hans.
EINAR=>No we don't.
GERDA=>I didn't mean to disturb you.
EINAR=>That's okay. I've finished.
GERDA=>What?
EINAR=>Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?
GERDA=>You're very observant.
EINAR=>Leave it on...
GERDA=>I might let you borrow it.
EINAR=>I might enjoy that.
GERDA=>Oh really...? Is there something you'd like to tell me?
EINAR=>Why...? Is there something you'd like to know...?
GERDA=>No... I'm your wife. I know everything.
GERDA=>Both of them...?
ULLA=>And at the same time!
EINAR=>We just pretend to be shocked because it encourages you.
ULLA=>I know. That's why you're the only couple in my party for the Artists Ball...
EINAR=>Out of the question.
ULLA=>Oh, I know Einar hates it, but he'll have to bear with us.
EINAR=>She can go without me.
ULLA=>Gerda without an escort? It would be a scandal.
EINAR=>Gerda loves a scandal.
GERDA=>You've had too much champagne.
EINAR=>Look at the way she dresses, flaunting her ankles. An invitation to corruption.
GERDA=>I don't think anyone is likely to be corrupted by seeing my ankles.
EINAR=>I was.
ELSA=>Is that true?!
GERDA=>It was a dare. But when I said hello to him, he actually blushed! He was so shy! So I asked him out.
ULLA=>And you said yes -
EINAR=>She made me. She seemed so sure.
GERDA=>I was sure. I still am.
NIELS=>Oh please - enough!
ELSA=>No - what was it about him?
GERDA=>I don't know...
ULLA=>Well these two won't be staying much longer...
EINAR=>Unmarried people are so delightfully easy to shock.
GERDA=>Turn it back on.
EINAR=>You were shameless.
GERDA=>I still am.
EINAR=>Beautiful shameless Gerda...
GERDA=>Did I wake you?
EINAR=>Why?
GERDA=>Wondering about things.
EINAR=>What things?
GERDA=>Wondering if we made a baby last night.
EINAR=>What d'you think?
GERDA=>Wondering when you got so pretty.
EINAR=>Oh, I was always pretty, you just never noticed.
GERDA=>Hello...?
EINAR=>In here...
GERDA=>Do you think?
EINAR=>You should go, you enjoy it.
GERDA=>With you I enjoy it.
EINAR=>Look - it's good to be seen at those things. I understand that.
GERDA=>And that's why you hate them.
EINAR=>I feel as though I'm performing myself.
GERDA=>Giving them your Einar Wegener.
EINAR=>Did you have someone in particular in mind?
GERDA=>You'd be very convincing... You might even enjoy it...
GERDA=>You'll have to shave closer.
EINAR=>Here...
GERDA=>Better than I ever manage.
EINAR=>Come on, Hvap!
GERDA=>Knee over... head up.. Look at those hands... relax...
EINAR=>It's your fault, you excite her.
GERDA=>Why, Miss Lili, you are forward...
EINAR=>You have no idea...
EINAR=>Morning, Thorbjorn...
STAGE DOORMAN=>Good morning.
EINAR=>I wondered where you were, it's getting late.
GERDA=>We have plenty of time. I bought these...
GERDA=>What is it...?
EINAR=>Am I pretty enough?
GERDA=>Of course you are...
EINAR=>I'll never be as pretty as you.
ULLA=>My darling!
GERDA=>Ulla, let me introduce...
ULLA=>It's Lili...!
GERDA=>That's right. Einar's cousin from Vejle...
ULLA=>My dear, you're exquisite...
EINAR/LILI=>You won't leave me, will you...?
GERDA=>No. No, never.
EINAR/LILI=>People are looking.
GERDA=>Well you're a pretty girl, you'll have to get used to that.
ELSA=>Gerda - !
EINAR/LILI=>Go and talk to her...
GERDA=>No, I'll stay with you...
EINAR/LILI=>Go. I'll be fine. Go before she comes over here...
HENRIK=>Are you a reporter?
EINAR/LILI=>No.
HENRIK=>A poetess...?
EINAR/LILI=>Mm...?
HENRIK=>They say if you eat its acorns you can make a wish and become anyone you want for a day.
EINAR/LILI=>Why would they say that...?
HENRIK=>Henrik Sandahl. At your disposal.
EINAR/LILI=>Lili...
HENRIK=>Are you here with someone, Lili?
EINAR/LILI=>Yes - my cousin's wife.
HENRIK=>Who's your cousin?
EINAR/LILI=>Einar Wegener. He's a painter.
HENRIK=>Rather a good one. Better than most people think.
EINAR/LILI=>Is that right?
HENRIK=>Most people our age at any rate.
EINAR/LILI=>Well....
HENRIK=>Don't go back in. It's cooler here. Besides, I'm a romantic.
EINAR/LILI=>Oh really...
HENRIK=>I prefer the shadows and...
GERDA=>Have you seen Einar? I can't find him.
ULLA=>Of course you can't, he isn't here!
HENRIK=>You're different from other girls.
EINAR/LILI=>That's not a very original line.
HENRIK=>It's true. You're old fashioned.
EINAR/LILI=>Provincial. I'm new to the city.
HENRIK=>No, it's more than that. I feel I'd need to ask permission before I kissed you.
EINAR/LILI=>I probably ought to find Gerda.
HENRIK=>Why don't you tell her I'll walk you home...?
EINAR/LILI=>She wouldn't like that...
HENRIK=>Lili...
EINAR/LILI=>Einar might be waiting up... he wouldn't like this...
HENRIK=>Wouldn't he...?
EINAR/LILI=>No...
HENRIK=>Lili...
EINAR/LILI=>You didn't ask permission...
HENRIK=>I couldn't risk you saying no.
GERDA=>Quickly, lean on me...
GERDA=>How are you...?
EINAR=>You were late home last night, I thought I'd let you sleep. How was it? Did Lili have fun?
GERDA=>I think it would be better if Lili didn't come here again.
EINAR=>Fine. I understand.
GERDA=>You know what I would like to understand?
EINAR=>Nothing.
GERDA=>Did he know it was you?
EINAR=>It wasn't as simple as that. It's hard to explain...
GERDA=>I watched him kiss you, Einar, so could you please make an effort?!
EINAR=>He may have known who I was. But I wasn't always... me. There was a moment when I was... just Lili. And I think he could see that. Do you see?
GERDA=>But Lili doesn't exist. We made her up.
EINAR=>I know...
GERDA=>We were playing a game!
EINAR=>I know we were... but then it changed... 26/11/15
GERDA=>This is absurd. We need to stop. Make it stop Einar.
EINAR=>I'm going to try...
GERDA=>Another headache?
EINAR=>It's nothing...
GERDA=>Can I get you something?
EINAR=>I'm fine.
GERDA=>Maybe you should see a doctor.
EINAR=>Gerda... I'm fine.
HENRIK=>I didn't think you'd come.
EINAR/LILI=>No. Nor did I.
GERDA=>I thought you might not come back.
EINAR=>That's absurd...
GERDA=>Is it?
THIN YOUNG MAN=>He won't be much longer.
RASMUSSEN=>I just... I don't know...
GERDA=>Einar's cousin.
RASMUSSEN=>Yes, the resemblance is...
GERDA=>A series back at the studio.
RASMUSSEN=>These are different... For these, I don't know... there may be a market.
GERDA=>You're taking them.
RASMUSSEN=>Well, yes...
HENRIK=>Come in...
LILI=>I don't have long... Gerda's seeing Rasmussen.
HENRIK=>I don't like all these lies.
LILI=>She's very protective.
HENRIK=>Why don't you just tell her about us?
LILI=>I couldn't do that...
HENRIK=>Sorry - I don't want to upset you.
LILI=>No... Henrik...
HENRIK=>Yes...
LILI=>No...
HENRIK=>Einar...
LILI=>What...?
HENRIK=>Come on... it's alright...
LILI=>I'm sorry, I don't understand...
HENRIK=>Einar... please...
LILI=>I don't know what you mean... I don't know what you want...
HENRIK=>I want you!
LILI=>No...
HENRIK=>Yes... wait... Wait! Lili... Lili, come back...
GERDA=>Are you alright...?
EINAR/LILI=>No...
EINAR=>I thought perhaps you knew.
GERDA=>No.
EINAR=>You always seemed to know everything.
GERDA=>Not this.
EINAR=>No - I love you, Gerda, only you. But Lili...
GERDA=>Why can't you just be honest about this!
EINAR=>I'm trying! Gerda... please... I need you to believe me. You of all people to understand.
GERDA=>Okay, I need you to tell me... when Henrik and `Lili' are together, they what...? They kiss - we know that...
EINAR=>No... No, Lili's never gone further than that with a man. She... she wouldn't...
GERDA=>There have been other men?
EINAR=>There was another, but it was a long time ago.
GERDA=>I don't know what to say.
EINAR=>I'm so sorry...
GERDA=>Einar... what is this? What's happening...
HEXLER=>So, you saw Dr Andersen after a bout of severe nosebleeds, which you have come to believe coincide 26/11/15 HEXLER with your stomach cramps, and on a monthly basis.
EINAR=>Six years.
HEXLER=>Children?
EINAR=>No.
HEXLER=>Is there regular copulation?
EINAR=>Yes. Perhaps less now than...
HEXLER=>Than before you started to dress as a woman?
EINAR=>Inside me.
HEXLER=>You know the most likely explanation for all this is a chemical imbalance?
EINAR=>Really...?
HEXLER=>Onto the bed.
EINAR=>I don't need to do this... There's nothing wrong with me..
GERDA=>Einar, that's not true.
EINAR=>This can't be right...
HEXLER=>Radiation is a miracle, Mr Wegener: it destroys the bad and saves the good.
GERDA=>He says it will be over very quickly...
HEXLER=>Lie still, Mr Wegener...
HEXLER=>Mr Wegener...?
EINAR=>You've hurt Lili...
HEXLER=>I'm afraid your husband's aberrant thinking persists. Do you keep a lock on your wardrobe?
GERDA=>Of course not.
HEXLER=>Mrs Wegener, you haven't been encouraging this delusion? You do understand that your husband's insane?
GERDA=>No, that's not true...
GERDA=>I won't be long.
EINAR=>Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
RASMUSSEN=>Gerda! Where have you been?
GERDA=>Away. Why, what's wrong?
RASMUSSEN=>I sold the Lili portraits!
GERDA=>Well that's wonderful...
RASMUSSEN=>And there's more - I had a call from the Etienne Dufour Gallery - they would like to represent you in Paris.
GERDA=>In Paris...?
RASMUSSEN=>You should go and see them.
GERDA=>Oh - I can't travel just now...
RASMUSSEN=>Gerda, this is your moment. You've waited 26/11/15 RASMUSSEN long enough... And these dealers can be fickle.
EINAR=>What are you doing?
GERDA=>I've been asked to exhibit in Paris...
EINAR=>That's wonderful...
GERDA=>Yes. We have to go. Rasmussen said it would make all the difference...
EINAR=>I'm not sure I can do that...
GERDA=>You can. I'll take care of you...
EINAR=>But surely there's no rush...
GERDA=>Can't you just do this one thing for me?
EINAR=>Gerda, what's happening?
GERDA=>I had a letter from Hexler...
EINAR=>He wants to lock me up.
GERDA=>But he won't. Everything will work out for us. Really - I know it. You just have to trust me...
EINAR=>I do...
GERDA=>So. Is there anything to take care of before we go? Anyone you need to tell?
EINAR=>No.
GERDA=>Einar's a painter too...
MAN IN GROUP=>Oh? Do you exhibit in Paris?
EINAR=>I think my work is a little... introspective for French taste.
ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN=>Excuse me - is the model here?
GERDA=>No, she stayed behind in Denmark.
ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN=>Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.
EINAR=>Gerda... please... I can't.
GERDA=>Will you sit for me? Just as you are. We haven't done that since art school. You enjoyed it then...
EINAR=>I... I can't just now. I'm sorry. 26/11/15
GERDA=>I miss you. I miss you working beside me.
EINAR=>I can't remember the landscape any more. I can't remember Vejle.
GERDA=>Well you could help me with this background. What does it need...?
EINAR=>Gerda...
HANS=>Hey, he's playing with us! He knows the price...
HANS=>Hans Axgil..
GERDA=>Thank you so much for...
HANS=>Don't thank me yet - I can't represent you. I don't handle any contemp...
GERDA=>Of course, no, I know that...
HANS=>The reviews for your show were terrific, but your work is way out of my...
GERDA=>Perhaps if you let me speak, things would be clearer...?
HANS=>Let you speak?
HANS=>Well, I don't know why Rasmussen gave you my number, but I'm happy he did...
GERDA=>I asked him, I wanted to meet you, put a face to a name...
HANS=>You have a husband?
HANS=>A bottle of the Mersault...
GERDA=>I'm married to Einar Wegener.
HANS=>To Einar?
GERDA=>You remember him?
HANS=>Of course I remember him. My God - we were such friends. How is he?
GERDA=>He told me that you kissed him once.
HANS=>I what...??
GERDA=>He doesn't know I'm here. I don't think he'd like me asking for help.
GERDA=>Einar...?
EINAR=>I don't want a new dealer. It doesn't make sense for me. I'm hardly working anyway.
GERDA=>That might change.
EINAR=>I don't think so. I'm happy helping you.
GERDA=>It's Hans Axgil.
GERDA=>You know, Einar's still stricken with guilt about crashing your kite.
HANS=>It was handmade, and I've had it since I was four! I'm glad you reminded me. I'll tease him about that.
GERDA=>No - it's too cruel.
HANS=>If he ever gets here. Perhaps he doesn't want to see me?
GERDA=>No - no, it's not that. We should order without him.
HANS=>Does he abandon you often?
GERDA=>Of course not!
HANS=>I was joking.
HANS=>I can come back another time, if you think Einar would prefer it...
GERDA=>Really. He's expecting you... and it will do him good...
HANS=>I know this... the fjord at Vejle... not far from our houses!
GERDA=>Yes, Einar painted it just before we left...
LILI=>You can't imagine how happy I am.
GERDA=>Can I take your coat Hans?
HANS=>Of course...
LILI=>A digestif, Hans? It's so chilly all of a sudden. I feel the cold these days. I don't know why...
HANS=>Thank you.
LILI=>I'm so sorry Einar couldn't be here. He told me: in Vejle you were his great friend. Both always plotting to getting away!
HANS=>That's true...
LILI=>Such a tedious place! He said you'd sit and look out together, beyond the fjord.. to the sea... to the future.
HANS=>Oh, we had big dreams...
LILI=>And you were the only one who let him paint in peace, who told him it was alright to be a painter.
HANS=>He... used to sketch my portrait. Take a stone and draw me on the rocks at the side of the road.
GERDA=>I didn't know that.
LILI=>Oh yes.
GERDA=>Would you like to see more of Einar's work...?
LILI=>Do we have any?
GERDA=>Yes, of course, Lili...
LILI=>Oh, but couldn't we see it another time? I so want to hear more from Hans... Hans, are you married?
HANS=>No...
LILI=>Why not?
HANS=>I've... been on my own a long time now. I'm too set in my ways.
LILI=>I think marriage is the single thing we should all hope for in life.
HANS=>Really?
LILI=>It creates someone else, more than just the two of you. It would be terrible never to know that...
GERDA=>Lili...
LILI=>Excuse me.
GERDA=>You... you ought to go...
HANS=>No - let me help...
GERDA=>Please - please - I'm sorry...
HANS=>Goodnight Lili...
LILI=>Goodnight...
GERDA=>I don't know...
LILI=>No, I think I got out just in time.
GERDA=>Sleep now. We'll talk more tomorrow.
LILI=>Can I borrow a nightdress?
GERDA=>No... we've never done that. Lili's never spent the night...
LILI=>It doesn't matter what I wear. When I dream, they're Lili's dreams...
GERDA=>A new dress...
LILI=>And this. Do you like it?
GERDA=>Yes. It's perfect for you...
LILI=>I know, but now I'm back, I can sit for you again, can't I...? That worked well before, Gerda, didn't it...?
HANS=>It's a good crowd.
GERDA=>She's a popular girl. Thank you for coming.
HANS=>Thank you for asking me. I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
GERDA=>We've been busy.
HANS=>Is Einar here?
GERDA=>Einar hates this kind of thing.
HANS=>That's a shame. For you, I mean.
GERDA=>I don't mind.
HANS=>Is he well...?
GERDA=>He's excited. We have an old friend coming to town: Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer. Do you know her?
HANS=>I don't think so. Could I take you to dinner? To celebrate? Someone ought to.
GERDA=>No. Thank you.
HANS=>Gerda, have I offended you?
GERDA=>No.
HANS=>Gerda...
GERDA=>I am still Einar's wife.
MAN=>Hans!
GALLERY EMPLOYEE=>At least take an umbrella...
GERDA=>I'm fine, honestly...
GALLERY EMPLOYEE=>If you just wait a minute someone will drive you...
LILI=>Gerda...? Oh - you're wet through.
GERDA=>You'd know if you'd been there.
LILI=>I've made us a supper...
GERDA=>You should have come.
LILI=>A little sort of celebration...
GERDA=>This is not how it goes! We do these things together!
LILI=>That's you and Einar.
GERDA=>Stop playing that stupid, stupid game!
LILI=>Don't you say this is a game!
GERDA=>You should have been there!
LILI=>How could I be? Look at me!
GERDA=>Not everything's about you!
LILI=>Let me help...
GERDA=>I need my husband. Just get him!
LILI=>I can't...
GERDA=>I want to talk to my husband. I want to hold my husband. I need him. Can you get him? Can you at least try?
HANS=>Gerda... what is it?
GERDA=>I can't...
HANS=>Wait...
HANS=>Will you be alright?
GERDA=>I'm always alright.
HANS=>For God's sake. Take some kindness where you can.
GERDA=>Einar always comes back in the end. He always has...
HANS=>Maybe this time... he just can't.
GERDA=>I'm sorry.
EINAR/LILI=>I don't think I can give you what you want...
GERDA=>No.
ULLA=>He needs to see someone.
GERDA=>You know what happened with Hexler.
ULLA=>But he's so thin, Gerda...? There's something wrong with him.
GERDA=>Lili watches her figure...
ULLA=>Look, there's a doctor - he runs the Women's Clinic in Dresden. 26/11/15
GERDA=>Oh good... you're awake... how do you feel?
EINAR=>I can't - I have somewhere to go...
GERDA=>Where?
EINAR=>I know. But I love you and I'm going to find an answer.
YOUNGER MAN=>Lesbian...
HANS=>But I'm worried that will be too late. I can't hold the buyers much longer...
EINAR=>You're good at this.
HANS=>I boxed for a while.
EINAR=>Shame you weren't with me earlier.
HANS=>That's alright. You're here now.
EINAR=>I couldn't let Gerda see me this way. She has enough to put up with.
HANS=>Let me know if you feel light-headed.
EINAR=>I'm permanently light-headed.
HANS=>God, Einar, what's happened to you? I don't understand...
EINAR=>Ha - nor do I. But I don't think it's anything new... Even in Vejle...
HANS=>What?
EINAR=>Well I was different.
HANS=>It didn't take much to be different in Vejle! Surely, that's why we became friends?
EINAR=>I wanted to thank you for looking after Gerda. 26/11/15
HANS=>It's no great hardship.
EINAR=>I've let her down.
HANS=>She doesn't think that.
EINAR=>Every morning I promise myself I'll spend the whole day as Einar. But there's so little Einar left.
HANS=>You need building up...
EINAR=>No. I think Lili's thoughts. All the time. Even here, now, I'm having to work so hard just to... to be me. To be this.
HANS=>You think these things because you're exhausted...
EINAR=>I think sometimes about killing Einar. It's only the thought that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.
HANS=>You need to see someone. A doctor.
EINAR=>No doctors.
HANS=>Yes, Einar. You have to try.
BUSON=>A confused state of identity.
MCBRIDE=>I've listened carefully and I'm afraid it's not good news.
EINAR=>Well, I don't really know what kind of help I need, but I can't go on living without knowing who I am.
DR MAI=>Mm... very good...
MAI=>Please excuse me a moment...
EINAR=>Do you think I'm insane?
GERDA=>Did a doctor say that?
EINAR=>I'm sorry, I know we agreed no more... but look at me.
GERDA=>You're not insane.
EINAR=>What...?
GERDA=>Sometimes I think if it hadn't been for the paintings...
EINAR=>Oh no... no, no. You helped bring Lili to life, but she was always... she was waiting...
GERDA=>But now she's making you ill.
EINAR=>I don't know what to do. The doctors can't help me.
GERDA=>Do you want to try one more...?
WARNEKROS=>So what do you think would explain what you've been experiencing Mr Wegener?
EINAR=>Professor Warnekros... the fact is... I * believe I am a woman inside.
GERDA=>And I believe it too.
EINAR=>You probably think I'm insane. That we both are...
WARNEKROS=>Well, there are people who think that I'm insane. But I think you're probably right.
EINAR=>Is that really possible?
GERDA=>What happened to the man? Was the operation successful?
WARNEKROS=>It never took place. On the morning of the first operation, he ran away. He was too frightened.
EINAR=>I wouldn't do that.
WARNEKROS=>Perhaps he was the smart one. The surgery has never been attempted before.
EINAR=>It's my only hope. *
WARNEKROS=>I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.
EINAR=>I feel strange going dressed like this.
GERDA=>It's important. Hans says the Germans will check your papers.
HANS=>Don't take any chances. You're nearly there.
EINAR=>I won't be seeing you again.
HANS=>You know, I've only really liked a handful of people in my life and you've been two of them.
GERDA=>I wish you'd let me come with you.
EINAR=>I can't. You love Einar. And I have to let him go.
GERDA=>Here, take this...
HANS=>Gerda...? Let me give you a lift.
GERDA=>I'm going to walk.
GUARD=>Next stop, Dresden. Dresden is the next stop...
RECEPTIONIST=>Hello...?
LILI=>Yes, my name is Lili, I'm here to see Professor Warnekros. *
RECEPTIONIST=>Lili what?
LILI=>Oh... Lili Elbe. Yes. Like the river.
RECEPTIONIST=>Please take a seat...
LILI=>Must I really wait?
WARNEKROS=>It's only a week, We need you to rest and gain some weight. We can't risk an infection.
URSULA=>Do you think Spring will come early?
LILI=>Oh - yes. You're having a baby.
URSULA=>And you? 26/11/15
LILI=>No - I'm ill inside. But Professor * Warnekros's going to make me better. He's operating tomorrow.
URSULA=>Will you be able to have children after?
LILI=>I don't know.
URSULA=>I hope so.
NURSE=>To help you sleep tonight.
HANS=>Rasmussen called. The Dufour people want you in their group show. I like the idea.
GERDA=>I'm sorry?
HANS=>The Dufour Gallery?
GERDA=>He asked me not to.
HANS=>He wanted to protect you. You should be there. I'll go with you.
GERDA=>No. If I go, it'll be alone.
HANS=>Now you're sounding like Einar.
GERDA=>I am like Einar.
HANS=>What do you want me to do Gerda?
GERDA=>I want you to go away.
HANS=>Really?
GERDA=>No, I'm sorry...
WARNEKROS=>She only regained consciousness very * briefly. We're having to give her a great deal of morphine, of course, so that's to be expected.
NURSE=>You mustn't move Lili. It only makes it worse...
GERDA=>My God...
NURSE=>Excuse me...
GERDA=>I'll do that. I'm here now. Don't worry, I'm here...
LILI=>I can feel I'm getting better when I listen to your pencil.
GERDA=>Have I...?
LILI=>What you draw, I become. You made me more beautiful, now you're making me strong. Such power in you.
GERDA=>Lili! Lili, you're late...
LILI=>Every two hours. And I have to eat something first. I have a few macaroons in my bag all ready.
GERDA=>And these, only if you need them.
MANAGERESS=>And remember, making a purchase at Fonnesbech's is not merely shopping. It's an experience! You lived in Paris, yes?
LILI=>Oh yes... 26/11/15
MANAGERESS=>Let everyone know! The store is a stage - we are here to perform.
LILI=>And in Paris, a lady would never dream of spraying the scent directly onto herself.
GIRL=>It's so unfair - you've got the sweetest tooth and the narrowest hips in the whole store...
LILI=>Oh, the trick is to eat nothing else...
GIRL=>See you tomorrow!
GERDA=>You know one night last week, I had the strangest dream.
LILI=>What...?
GERDA=>I dreamed you were getting married.
LILI=>Do you think I ever will...?
GERDA=>Who knows? So many strange things have happened. *
LILI=>You and Einar.
GERDA=>I know it was Einar. But really it was you and me. 26/11/15
GERDA=>You're going to need a new notebook if you carry on like this.
LILI=>When Professor Warnekros suggested * I keep a diary... well, I thought I'd never have anything to write. But it helps, to make sense of things.
GERDA=>Perhaps I should try it.
LILI=>I want to be a woman, not a painter.
GERDA=>Well, people have been known to do both. I'd be curious to see what you painted, that's all. Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your...
LILI=>Gerda, I know what I'm doing.
GERDA=>I didn't. But I promised Einar I'd take care of you.
LILI=>For goodness' sake, Gerda - Einar is dead. We both have to accept that. You took care of me, now I have to take care of myself. I have to have a life of my own. And you need to do the same.
RECEPTIONIST=>Yes, in London... Is it urgent? Should I could ask him to..?
GERDA=>Oh, no that's fine. Just tell him... just say...
LILI=>It's not what you think. Henrik is * homosexual. There's nothing between us. But I should have told you I'd * seen him.
GERDA=>No you shouldn't... *
LILI=>He's just a friend, Gerda. Someone to talk to.
LILI=>About some things, no. *
GERDA=>It's too soon.
LILI=>No, it's time. I need to finish what I started.
GERDA=>You're not strong enough...
LILI=>Professor Warnekros thinks I am... *
GERDA=>Warnekros...? He hasn't seen you.
LILI=>I've made up my mind.
GERDA=>It could kill you.
LILI=>I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?
GERDA=>I won't help you to hurt yourself.
LILI=>Gerda, will you come...?
LILI=>You're still angry with me.
GERDA=>I'm not angry with you, I'm worried about you.
LILI=>You heard my wish Gerda. When no one else could hear me, you did.
GERDA=>Come. We both need our rest. I can sleep in the chair, there...
LILI=>Off to your little hotel.
GERDA=>I don't mind... 26/11/15
LILI=>Are there chocolates on the pillow?
GERDA=>Cigarette burns.
LILI=>Take this... There's a chill in the air.
GERDA=>You keep it. For now.
LILI=>I'm going to be fine.
GERDA=>Yes.
LILI=>Sleep well.
GERDA=>Goodnight.
GERDA=>Room 9.
HANS=>It's alright.
GERDA=>Yes.
HANS=>Everything will be alright.
WARNEKROS=>Good luck, everybody.
RECEPTIONIST=>Professor Warnekros would like a * word...
WARNEKROS=>She lost a lot of blood. Now we're struggling to keep the fever down. There's a chance it will burn itself out, but... 26/11/15
GERDA=>Go away... thank you. Leave us * alone.
GERDA=>Lili...?
HANS=>Oh, Lili. How are you?
LILI=>I am... entirely myself.
HANS=>I'll tell Warnekros she's awake.
GERDA=>You know you had us worried...
LILI=>Can I go outside, Gerda? Into the garden?
GERDA=>I think you should rest...
LILI=>Please...
LILI=>You mustn't worry about me any more, Gerda.
GERDA=>It's an old habit. I'm slow to change.
LILI=>How have I ever deserved such love?
GERDA=>No.
LILI=>You know, last night, I had the most beautiful dream... I dreamed I was a baby in my mother's arms... and she looked down at me... and called me Lili...
GERDA=>Lili...
GERDA=>No - leave it..! Leave it..
GERDA=>Let it fly...
