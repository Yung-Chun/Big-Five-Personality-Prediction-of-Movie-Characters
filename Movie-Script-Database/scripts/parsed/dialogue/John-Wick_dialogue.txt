JOHN=>This is John.
JOHN=>Ok.
JOHN=>...it had to be you... ...be seein' ya'...
JOHN=>Be seein' you.
DELIVERY WOMAN=>John Wick?
JOHN=>Yes?
DELIVERY WOMAN=>Sign here, please.
DELIVERY WOMAN=>And the pen?
JOHN=>Oh. Sorry.
DELIVERY WOMAN=>Here you go!
DELIVERY WOMAN=>Have a good day.
NORMA=>Dear, John. If you have received this, then I have not survived the surgery. I am so, so sorry.
NORMA=>But you've still got a life ahead of you, and I intend for you to live it. You may think you've hidden things from me, but you haven't. I know you. And should this reach you in time -which I pray it has- I beg you, I implore you, to stop. To think. To live. I love you, John. With all my heart. Our years were good. The best, in fact. But I'd rather see you later... than sooner... your best friend... Norma.
JOHN=>Well played, Norma.
JOHN=>Well played.
JOHN=>So... you gotta' name?
JOHN=>Moose. Seriously?
JOHN=>All right, then... ...Moose, it is.
JOHN=>I'm up, I'm up.
JOHN=>That oughta' do it. Wanna' try it out?
JOHN=>Good girl, Moose. Good girl.
IOSEF=>Nice ride.
JOHN=>Thanks.
IOSEF=>How much?
JOHN=>It ain't for sale, kid.
IOSEF=>Everything's got a fucking price.
JOHN=>Maybe so... but I don't.
JOHN=>Come on, then.
JOHN=>Good night, Moose.
JOHN=>Do you need to go out?
JOHN=>So could I, it would seem...
JOHN=>What's gotten into y-
JOHN=>Moose!
IOSEF=>I'm glad you didn't wanna' sell, old man. I enjoyed this.
JOHN=>...Moose...
JOHN=>Moose...
IOSEF=>Shit, dude!
IOSEF=>I'ma gonna' keep this muthafucker! Hey, where's Aurelio at?
AURELIO=>Where'd you get that?
IOSEF=>I gots my ways, yo! Now, it's hot as shit, so I wanna paint job, papers, fuckin-
AURELIO=>I said, where... did you get that?
IOSEF=>Some old fuck.
AURELIO=>I know this car.
IOSEF=>What the fuck are you sayin'?
AURELIO=>Fuck... me.
IOSEF=>What?
AURELIO=>Out. Now.
IOSEF=>What the fuck are you talking about?
AURELIO=>I'm talkin' about you takin' this fuckin' car and gettin' the fuck outta' my shop.
IOSEF=>Did you lose your shit, Aurelio? We own you. You do what we say.
AURELIO=>The fuck you do. Tell me...
AURELIO=>...did you kill him?
IOSEF=>No. But I sure as hell fucked up his dog.
AURELIO=>You pull a gun? On me? In my house?
AURELIO=>Flick off the safety.
AURELIO=>Pull back the hammer.
AURELIO=>Now, either shoot me... ...OR FUCK OFF!
VIKTOR=>The old man ain't gonna' like this.
AURELIO=>Maybe not. But he'll understand.
IOSEF=>...the fuck jus' happened...?
AURELIO=>Hello, John.
JOHN=>Hello, Aurelio.
JOHN=>Have you seen my car?
AURELIO=>I have, but it's not here.
JOHN=>Where is it?
AURELIO=>If I turn down the work, the Russians turn to Takeshi and his crew. You'll find them down on Third and Main.
JOHN=>Thank you.
JOHN=>Aurelio...
AURELIO=>Yes, John?
JOHN=>...they killed my dog.
AURELIO=>I know, John. I know... but "they"... ..."they" are extremely dangerous people.
JOHN=>Aren't "they" always...
JOHN=>Where can I find Iosef Tarasov?
DRIVER=>I don't know.
DRIVER=>Don't! Please! Iosef! His father! He owns a club in Manhattan! The Red Circle! The Red Circle!
JOHN=>Thanks.
DRIVER=>Fuck.
AURELIO=>This is Aurelio.
VIGGO=>I hear you've struck my son.
AURELIO=>Yes, sir. I did.
VIGGO=>Might I ask why?
AURELIO=>Because he stole John Wick's car.
VIGGO=>Oh.
AURELIO=>And Viggo?
VIGGO=>Yes?
AURELIO=>Your son killed his dog.
VIGGO=>Good evening, Aurelio.
VIGGO=>Close the door.
IOSEF=>Poor me a double, aye?
VIGGO=>Aye.
VIGGO=>Clean that up.
VIGGO=>You should know by now that I live by one simple rule... Should a whelp snap at your fingers, you crush it's fucking skull.
IOSEF=>What'd I do?
VIGGO=>You fucked up.
IOSEF=>I don't know what y-
VIGGO=>Yes. You do.
IOSEF=>So I stole a fucking car! So fucking what?
VIGGO=>Use that tone with me again...
VIGGO=>...and I'll serve your eye to you in your martini.
VIGGO=>Am I understood?
IOSEF=>Yes... father.
VIGGO=>It wasn't the "what you did", Iosef, which draws my ire, but "who you did it to".
IOSEF=>What? The old man?
VIGGO=>Careful, son... that old man happens to be three years younger than I.
VIGGO=>His name is John Wick... ...and when he was fifteen, he lied his way into the marines and headed off to Vietnam. He specialized in force-oriented reconnaissance, meaning he often crossed over into enemy territory to both collect information and -should the opportunity present itself- fuck with the enemy in whatever way that he saw fit.
VIGGO=>John earned four hundred and seventeen confirmed kills over the course of his five tours. The majority of those were done by hand, by blade, and by small caliber... which is unheard of.
VIGGO=>It got to him, though. Hell... How could it not? Even though he won every military distinction on record, including the Medal of HONOR-
VIGGO=>-John was eventually discharged - with high honors, of course- and found himself in the city...
VIGGO=>...lookin' for work.
IOSEF=>What kind of work?
VIGGO=>What kind do you think?
IOSEF=>Oh.
VIGGO=>John was the goddamned boogeyman; give him a name, request a method, and he'd get it done. Come hell or high water, by God... he'd get it done.
VIGGO=>Then one day, he fell in love and left the game. The years scrolled past, age set in, and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die. Suddenly alone, with no family to speak of, John deserved to live -and die- in peace. Instead...
VIGGO=>You went and killed his fucking dog.
VIGGO=>Until I say otherwise, you are under house arrest. Am I understood?
IOSEF=>Yes, sir.
VIGGO=>John Wick. Good God...
VIGGO=>Sweet dreams.
CARLO=>Let's see here...
CARLO=>...a black, 1969 Ford Mustang registered to one John Wick. Age... ...61.
EDWARDO=>Yeah, I'm thinkin' he's the one.
ROBERTO=>Should we even bother?
EDWARDO=>Protocol's protocol. Stay put. I'll make this quick.
EDWARDO=>Evenin', John.
JOHN=>Evenin', Ed.
EDWARDO=>You workin' again?
JOHN=>No...just sorting out a few things with the Russian mob.
EDWARDO=>Ah. Well, then... sort that out however you see fit. I'll cover your ass on my side of the fence as best I can.
JOHN=>Thanks, Ed... but you still owe me.
EDWARDO=>That, I do. Good night, John.
JOHN=>Good night, Ed.
EDWARDO=>Earlier today, there was an incident involving a `69 Mustang-
JOHN=>Yeah, that was me.
EDWARDO=>Oh. Well, then... I'd recommend you find yourself a new ride for the time being. The heat on that make ain't gonna' die down for quite some time.
ROBERTO=>Well?
EDWARDO=>He ain't our fuckin' guy. Who's next on the list?
JOHN=>This is Wick. John Wick, that's right. Yeah, it has been awhile. I'd like to make a reservation for four.
JOHN=>Ten o'clock? Perfect. Thanks.
CHARLIE=>Good to see you, John.
JOHN=>You, too, Charlie.
CHARLIE=>I was sorry to hear about Norma.
JOHN=>Thanks.
CHARLIE=>She was always kind to me. So, what have you been doing to pass the time?
JOHN=>I got me a hobby or two.
CHARLIE=>I can see that. Tell me, John... are we back in the game, now?
JOHN=>Sorry, Charlie, but no. I'm on my own nowadays.
CHARLIE=>That is a pity. I find the new breed of your ilk unstable, ill- wrought, and tiresome. The overused adage holds true: they don't make `em like they used to, John.
JOHN=>No, they don't.
CHARLIE=>Excellent.
JOHN=>Thanks.
CHARLIE=>My pleasure, John... and might I be expecting more such visitations?
JOHN=>I make no promises on that.
CHARLIE=>Well said.
CHARLIE=>Be seein' you, John.
JOHN=>See ya', Charlie.
VIGGO=>Yes?
VIGGO=>Of course he did. Put the word out. Two million to the man who kills John Wick. Three million to the man who delivers him intact.
MARCUS=>Yes? Why, hello, Viggo. What's it been? Seven years? Seven years... Life?
MARCUS=>Life is good.
VIGGO=>Good, good. I've a favor to ask. One that pays quite well.
MARCUS=>As I keep telling those -like you- who keep calling, Viggo... I'm retired.
MARCUS=>Come again? John Wick? Consider it done.
MARCUS=>Sorry, Cesca... but I've an old friend to attend to.
EVAN=>Pockets.
EVAN=>Good day, sir.
MANAGER=>Hello, sir. How may I help you today?
JOHN=>I called ahead. Reservation for John Wick.
MANAGER=>Ah, yes. I have you for two nights.
JOHN=>Depending on business, it may be more.
MANAGER=>That's not a problem, sir. We're only at sixty percent capacity.
MANAGER=>Just let me know should you choose to extend your stay.
JOHN=>Y'know, I haven't been here in years. When did the old girl get a facelift?
MANAGER=>About twelve years ago.
JOHN=>Same owner?
MANAGER=>Same owner.
JOHN=>Is she still singin'?
MANAGER=>She is. Daily, in fact. Round about midnight.
JOHN=>That's good to hear.
MANAGER=>Floor seven, room nine. Would you like help with your bags?
JOHN=>No, thanks.
MANAGER=>Will there be anything else then, sir?
JOHN=>Can you send me up a hamburger - rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and fries?
MANAGER=>Yes, sir. And to drink?
JOHN=>A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion.
MANAGER=>Yes, sir. I have one in mind. It'll be up in a half-hour.
JOHN=>Thank you.
BOUNCER=>Name?
JOHN=>Guest.
BOUNCER=>Welcome.
JOHN=>Thanks.
JOHN=>Thanks.
BARTENDER=>What can I get you?
JOHN=>A table.
BARTENDER=>This way.
BARTENDER=>Enjoy.
WAITRESS=>This way, sir.
WAITRESS=>Will this do?
JOHN=>Yes, thank you.
WAITRESS=>What would you like to drink?
JOHN=>Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it.
JOHN=>And start me up a tab.
WAITRESS=>Yes, sir. I've got a ten-year Michael Collins.
JOHN=>Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate?
WAITRESS=>I do. Anything else?
JOHN=>No. Thank you.
VIKTOR=>Another bottle of the Goose, love!
VIKTOR=>Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like my old man.
VIKTOR=>Hello?
VIKTOR=>What the fuck d-
JOHN=>My name is John Wick. You took my car. You killed my dog. Where... is Iosef?
VIKTOR=>Fuck you, old m-
VIKTOR=>VIGGO! HIS FATHER! HE'S WITH VIGGO!
JOHN=>And where is Viggo?
VIKTOR=>He moves about... from one place to the next... he's put Iosef under his thumb... wherever Viggo goes, so does Iosef.
JOHN=>Where... is... Viggo?
VIKTOR=>Please... I don't know... please...
JOHN=>Please close out my tab.
WAITRESS=>Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
JOHN=>Good evening.
WAITRESS=>Good evening, sir.
IOSEF=>Hey, Vik.
JOHN=>Viktor is dead.
JOHN=>As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye. No... no, better yet, Genesis.
JOHN=>Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.
JOHN=>Make your peace with God, Iosef... ...for the Devil shall see you soon.
MANAGER=>Good evenin', sir.
JOHN=>Evenin'. Is the doctor in?
MANAGER=>Yes, sir. Twenty-four/seven.
JOHN=>Send him up, please.
MANAGER=>Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?
JOHN=>Depends. How good's your laundry?
MANAGER=>The best, sir, however, I'm sorry to say that... ...no one's that good.
JOHN=>No, I thought not. Send me up a beer, too, will you?
MANAGER=>Yes, sir. What do you favor?
JOHN=>Anything cold.
JOHN=>Did she chip off?
DOCTOR=>Lucky for you, no. It looks to be a sub-sonic.
JOHN=>Good to hear.
JOHN=>What sort of movement am I lookin' at?
DOCTOR=>If you're lookin' to heal right quick, then keep it marginal. However, if you've still... ...got a bit a' business to attend to...
DOCTOR=>...take two of these beforehand. You will rip open, you will bleed, but you will have full function.
JOHN=>And after?
DOCTOR=>It'll hurt like hell, son... but come the long run, you'll be fine.
JOHN=>Thanks, doc.
DOCTOR=>It's what I do. Evenin', John.
JOHN=>Evenin'.
EDDIE=>I don't know you.
JOHN=>Maybe not... but I know this place.
EDDIE=>You carryin'?
JOHN=>No. Wait...
JOHN=>Sorry.
EDDIE=>You gotta' name?
JOHN=>John Wick.
EDDIE=>Oh.
JOHN=>How about you?
EDDIE=>What about me?
JOHN=>You gotta' name?
EDDIE=>They call me Eddie.
JOHN=>Pleased to meet you, Eddie.
EDDIE=>Same goes for me, Mr. Wick.
JOHN=>Please... call me, John.
JOHN=>Hello, Winston.
WINSTON=>Hello, Jonathan. It's been awhile.
JOHN=>That, it has. I'm glad to see the old place still up and runnin'.
WINSTON=>I could say the same for you.
JIMMY=>Ho... lee... shit.
JOHN=>Hey, Jimmy.
JIMMY=>John, my God, it's been... what?
JOHN=>I'm no good with time, but... it's been awhile.
JIMMY=>That, it has. We we're all broken up over Norma, y'know.
JOHN=>She got the card, the flowers... she knows you -all of you- loved her. And thanks, Jimmy. It meant a lot to me as well.
JIMMY=>Well, shit, it's good to see you, John. What can I get you?
JOHN=>I'd love a martini.
JIMMY=>Gin, dry, and onions?
JOHN=>Good man.
JIMMY=>Go on and take a seat. I'll be with you in a moment.
JOHN=>Thanks, Jimmy.
JIMMY=>All good, John... and seriously... it's good to see you.
JENNY=>John Wick in the flesh... my, oh, my... will wonders never cease.
JOHN=>Hey, Jenny.
JENNY=>Where've you been keepin' yourself?
JOHN=>I'm not quite sure, but with that said... here I am.
JENNY=>Here you are, indeed. My, oh, my...
JENNY=>I miss her, too, y'know...
JOHN=>I know.
JENNY=>And I haven't... I mean, not since the last time... Would you mind... if I sang it? You can say, "no".
JOHN=>No, no, Jenny... go right ahead. In fact... please do. I'd like to hear it, too.
JENNY=>Will do.
JENNY=>This visit of yours ain't no passin' fancy, is it?
JOHN=>No, ma'am.
JENNY=>Well, then... you be safe, you hear?
JOHN=>I hear.
JIMMY=>Enjoy.
JENNY=>It's been awhile, but... here's to the past... may it influence our future.
DAVID=>...please...
JOHN=>Do you know where Iosef is?
DAVID=>No, sir.
JOHN=>Do you know where Viggo is?
DAVID=>N-no, sir.
JOHN=>Do you know anythin' worth knowin'?
JOHN=>Just because I'm good at killin'... doesn't mean I like it all that much. Give me something.
DAVID=>Wait, wait! Little Russia. There's a small bank near Cannon Court...
JOHN=>What about it?
DAVID=>Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps his money. Every dollar of business he does clears through that building.
JOHN=>That'll do.
HARRY=>Do I know you?
JOHN=>I'm thinkin' so.
HARRY=>Oh. Hey, John.
JOHN=>Hey, Harry.
HARRY=>Good night, John.
JOHN=>Night, Harry. Hey, Harry.
HARRY=>Yeah, John?
JOHN=>You keen on earnin' a coin?
HARRY=>Times bein' as they are? Yeah, John... I am.
JOHN=>Do you mind babysittin' the breathin' one for, I dunno... ...the next six hours or so?
HARRY=>Catch and release?
JOHN=>Catch and release.
HARRY=>Can do.
JOHN=>Good night, Harry.
HARRY=>Good night, John.
MANAGER=>Good evening, Mr. Wick. I'm sorry to be calling you at this hour, but we've received a number of noise complaints from your floor.
JOHN=>You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon.
MANAGER=>Have you any need of -say- a dinner reservation, perhaps?
JOHN=>Yes, in fact. For four.
MANAGER=>Six o'clock?
JOHN=>Perfect. Oh, and... Do you cater? Excellent. I'll need a car, and... well... something a bit less trivial.
JOHN=>You willin' to put a bullet in my back, Marcus?
MARCUS=>I owe you, John.
JOHN=>Been awhile, Marcus.
MARCUS=>Too long, I'd argue.
JOHN=>Why'd you take the job then?
MARCUS=>Because if not for me, it would have been someone who'd have just now pulled the trigger and simply walked away, leaving you to gasp your last.
JOHN=>Much appreciated, then.
MARCUS=>Besides, we're the last of our kind; an endangered species of a sort. And I find comfort in knowing that there's someone like me still out there.
JOHN=>What am I doing, Marcus? I mean... it is just a... was a... dog, but...
MARCUS=>It's always "just" something, John.
MARCUS=>Just" a wife, "just" a son, "just" a friend, "just" a house, "just" a car... "just" a dog... or "just" a cat. Each of these I've lost in no particular order, and each time the pain I felt was quite real. And my chosen reciprocity to each was no more -and no less- brutal than any other.
JOHN=>This isn't like me.
MARCUS=>Maybe not, but for the rare man of our ilk -those who survived an arguably unsurvivable life- the few things we find time to care for... pass long before we do...
MARCUS=>Good night, John.
JOHN=>Good night, Marcus.
VIGGO=>Wait in the car.
VIGGO=>Is that really necessary?
VIGGO=>So be it.
WAITRESS=>Cream or sugar?
VIGGO=>No, thank you.
VIGGO=>It's been what? 30 years?
JOHN=>Yeah, that's about right.
VIGGO=>Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that. Kids?
JOHN=>No.
VIGGO=>Lucky bastard.
JOHN=>We tried, but... wasn't in the cards.
VIGGO=>I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it... He's still my son.
JOHN=>I figured as much.
VIGGO=>Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love.
JOHN=>Imagine what one would do if they did.
VIGGO=>Goodbye, John.
JOHN=>Goodbye, Viggo.
VIGGO=>Kill him.
VIGGO=>DRIVE!
VIGGO=>People don't change. Do they, John? SHUT... THE FUCK... UP!
KIRILL=>Babushka.
KIRILL=>Then shit... let the fuckin' babushka fade away and let's get the fuck outta' here.
WAITRESS=>What can I get you?
JOHN=>Americano, please. And a bear claw.
WAITRESS=>On it.
JOHN=>Oh, and the bathroom?
WAITRESS=>Down the hall to the left.
JOHN=>Thanks.
JOHN EVERYBODY OUT!=>NOW!!!!
JOHN=>Not you.
BANK MANAGER=>But... why not... me?
JOHN=>Take me to Viggo's stash.
BANK MANAGER=>Wha... what?
JOHN=>His stash. Personal Holdings. Piggy "fucking" Bank.
BANK MANAGER=>What?!? I can't just-
BANK MANAGER=>This way.
JOHN=>Open it.
BANK MANAGER=>I can't.
JOHN=>Open it.
BANK MANAGER=>He'll kill me!
JOHN=>So will I.
BANK MANAGER=>Now, p-
BANK MANAGER=>...fuck... me...
WAITRESS=>Anything else?
JOHN=>That'll do. Thank you.
JOHN=>No cops. That's new.
WAITRESS=>We good, hon?
JOHN=>Yeah. Yeah, we're good. Thanks.
WAITRESS=>Anytime.
VIGGO=>Where's the manager?
VIGGO=>I'd run, too. What a shame... what a fucking... ...shame...
VIGGO=>Iosef... my son... is worth less than this... far less... treasures reduced to ash... ...ash...
GUNMEN=>GET IN! NOW!
NO! NO!=>...no...
VIGGO=>Tell me, John... and please... be honest... am I dying here?
JOHN=>Unless I complete the call, then... yes.
VIGGO=>For me to die like this...
...BECAUSE OF HIM...=>...would be unfortunate.
VIGGO=>I was sending Iosef to a safe house in Moscow. I arranged for transport via... a grain ship... out of Newark...
VIGGO=>...please...
HARRY=>Housekeepin'll find ya'.
HARRY=>But son? You done a bit a' business on the Continental grounds...
HARRY=>...and management, well...
HARRY=>...they don't take kindly to that sort a' thing.
WORKER=>FILL HER UP!
IOSEF=>How the fuck long do I have to stay down here?
CAPTAIN=>Until we are at sea, and even then, your access up top will be limited.
CAPTAIN=>Yes?
CAPTAIN=>I'll let him know. Proceed as scheduled.
CAPTAIN=>Your father...
IOSEF=>What about him?
CAPTAIN=>He is dead.
IOSEF=>What?
CAPTAIN=>I'm sorry. He was k-
CAPTAIN=>Come again?
OPERATOR=>We're taking fire, sir!
OPERATOR=>Someone's shooting at u-
CAPTAIN=>Until you hear otherwise... stay.
SNIPER=>This is Alpha. I don't-
SNIPER=>Where the fuck is he?
SNIPER=>The old cannery. Southeast of my position.
GUNMEN=>RUN!
CAPTAIN=>My... God.
CAPTAIN=>I-
CREWMAN=>Captain... he's coming.
CAPTAIN=>Open the door, goddammit!
CAPTAIN=>Do you know how to use that?
IOSEF=>Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN=>Good. Follow me. And if you shoot me in the back, I'll be the one to fuckin' kill you.
CAPTAIN=>You piece of shit, motherfucker!
IOSEF=>Well, come on, muthafucka! LET'S DANCE! YOU AND ME!
IOSEF=>You missed, bitch!
JOHN=>No. I didn't.
JOHN=>For Moose.
IOSEF=>NO! HELP ME! NO! N...
JOHN=>Through and through... through and through...
JOHN=>Buried deep. Fuck.
JOHN=>Miko, huh?
JOHN=>That's quite the name.
JOHN=>Are you coming or not?
JOHN=>That's what I thought.
JOHN=>Come on. Let's go home.
WINSTON=>Mr. Perkins...
WINSTON=>...your membership to the Continental has been -by thine own hand- revoked.
JOHN=>Good girl, Miko... good girl.
