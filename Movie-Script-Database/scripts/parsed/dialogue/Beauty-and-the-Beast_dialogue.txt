NARRATOR=>Once upon a time in the hidden heart of France, a handsome young Prince lived in a beautiful castle...
NARRATOR=>Although he had everything his heart desired, the Prince was selfish and unkind.
NARRATOR=>He taxed the village to fill his castle with the most beautiful objects...
MAID=>Poof poof...
MAJORDOMO=>Master, it's time.
FOOTMAN=>Oui, maître.
NARRATOR=>... and his parties with the most beautiful people.
DIVA=>Oh how divine Glamour, music and magic combine See the maidens so anxious to shine Look for a sign that enhances Chances She'll be his special one
DIVA=>What a display! What a breathtaking thrilling array Every prince, every dog has his day Let us sing with passion, gusto Fit to bust - oh Not a care in the world
NARRATOR=>Then, one night, an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle, seeking shelter from the bitter storm. As a gift, she offered the Prince a single rose.
NARRATOR=>Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the Prince turned the woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within.
NARRATOR=>And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's outward appearance melted away to reveal...
NARRATOR=>...a beautiful Enchantress.
NARRATOR=>The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
NARRATOR=>As punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast...
BOY'S MOTHER=>Chip! Chip! Oh my...
NARRATOR=>... and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.
NARRATOR=>As days bled into years, the Prince and his servants were forgotten by the world. For the Enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved.
NARRATOR=>But the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose. If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.
NARRATOR=>As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope. For who could ever learn to love a beast?
BELLE=>Little town, it's a quiet village Every day like the one before Little town full of little people Waking up to say...
VILLAGERS=>Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour.

BELLE=>Two cities in Northern Italy. I didn't want to come back.
BELLE=>Have you got any new places to go?
PERE ROBERT=>I'm afraid not. But you may reread any of the old ones that you'd like.
BELLE=>Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big.
PERE ROBERT=>Bon voyage.
APOTHECARY=>I wonder if she's feeling well
CHEESE SELLERS=>With a dreamy far-off look And her nose stuck in a book What a puzzle to the rest of us Is Belle
BELLE=>Oh... isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him `Til chapter three
VILLAGE LASSES' MOTHER=>Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty" Her looks have got no parallel
VILLAGE LASSES' MOTHER=>Very different from the rest of us
VILLAGE LASSES=>She's nothing like the rest of us Yes, different from the rest of us
VILLAGERS=>Is Belle
GASTON=>Look at her, LeFou. My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best.
LEFOU=>But she's so well-read, and you're so... Athletically inclined.
GASTON=>I know. Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful.
LEFOU=>Exactly, who needs her, when you've got us!
GASTON=>Yes, but ever since the war I've been missing something. And she's the only girl I've met who gives me that sense of...
LEFOU=>Je ne sais quoi?
GASTON=>I don't know what that means.
GASTON=>Right from the moment when I met her, saw her I said she's gorgeous and I fell Here in town there's only she Who is beautiful as me So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

BELLE=>You've read it?
GASTON=>Well, not that one. But, you know. Books. For your dinner table. Shall I join you this evening?
BELLE=>Sorry, not tonight.
GASTON=>Busy?
BELLE=>No.
LEFOU=>So. Moving on?
GASTON=>No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey.
GASTON=>That's what makes Belle so appealing. She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor. What would you call that?
LEFOU=>Dignity?
GASTON=>It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?
MAURICE=>How does a moment last forever? How can a story never die? It is love we must hold on to Never easy -- but we try
MAURICE=>Sometimes our happiness is captured Somehow a time and place stand still Love lives on inside our hearts And always will Oh, good, Belle, you're back. Can you please hand me the --
MAURICE=>And the --
MAURICE=>No no I don't need --
MAURICE=>Actually yes, that's exactly what I need.
BELLE=>Papa, do you think I'm odd?
MAURICE=>My daughter? Odd? Where did you get an idea like that?
BELLE=>I don't know. People talk.
MAURICE=>Oh. People. This village may be small, small-minded even, but small also means safe.
MAURICE=>Even back in Paris, I knew a girl who was so different, so daring, so ahead of her time that people mocked her until the day they found themselves imitating her.
BELLE=>Just tell me one more thing about her.
MAURICE=>Your mother was... fearless. Fearless.
MAURICE=>What would you like me to bring you from the market?
BELLE=>A rose like the one in the painting.
MAURICE=>You ask for that every year.
BELLE=>And every year, you bring it.
MAURICE=>Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. Come on, Philippe!
BELLE=>I'll see you tomorrow!
MAURICE=>Tomorrow! With the rose!
BELLE=>Stay safe...
WASHER GIRL=>What are you doing?
BELLE=>The laundry.
BELLE=>Come!
WASHER GIRL=>The blue bird flies...
BELLE=>...over the dark wood.
NASTY HEADMASTER=>What on earth are you doing?
NASTY HEADMASTER=>Teaching another girl to read? Isn't one enough?
CLOTHILDE=>We have to do something.
GASTON=>You are the wildest, most beautiful thing I've ever seen. No one deserves you, but at least I know our children will be beautiful.
LEFOU=>Am I catching you at a bad time?
GASTON=>What is it, LeFou?
LEFOU=>A certain damsel is in distress.
GASTON=>Oh well. It's hero time. I'm not done with you yet.
LEFOU=>Me neither.
GASTON=>Belle! Heard you had a little trouble with the headmaster. He never liked me, either. Can I give you a little advice about the villagers, though? They're never going to trust the kind of change we're trying to bring.
BELLE=>All I wanted was to teach a child to read.
GASTON=>The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own.
BELLE=>I'm not ready to have children.
GASTON=>Maybe you haven't met the right man.
BELLE=>It's a small village, Gaston. I've met them all.
GASTON=>Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed.
BELLE=>Gaston, we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much.
GASTON=>Belle, do you know what happens to spinsters in our village after their fathers die?
GASTON=>They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better.
BELLE=>I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston.
BELLE=>Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...
BELLE=>Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee it
BELLE=>I want much more than this Provincial life...
BELLE=>I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned
MAURICE=>The woods are lovely, aren't they Philippe...? I only wish I recognized them. Do you know where we are? Because I don't.
MAURICE=>Whoa!
MAURICE=>Hmm... yes, we can go this way. Walk on! One path closes, another one opens.
MAURICE=>It's all right boy, it's just a bit of snow... in June.
MAURICE=>Go, Philippe! Hurry!
MAURICE=>Philippe!
MAURICE=>Go! Go!
MAURICE=>Oh Philippe, you saved my life... They'll have to get their dinner somewhere else.
MAURICE=>Water, fresh hay. Looks like you're set, old friend. Rest here...
MAURICE=>While I pay my respects to our unwitting host... whoever that may be...
MAURICE=>Hm.
MAURICE=>Hello? Anyone home?
MAURICE=>Forgive me, I don't mean to intrude. I need shelter from the storm. Hello?
LUMIÈRE=>Must have lost his way in the woods...
COGSWORTH=>Shut up, you idiot.
MAURICE=>Mm... extraordinary.
MAURICE=>This is beautiful...
LUMIÈRE=>A man of taste.
COGSWORTH=>He was talking about me.
CADENZA=>Oops!
MAURICE=>Wherever you are, I'm just going to warm myself by the fire...
MAURICE=>That's better. Oh, much better...
MAURICE=>Oh, thank you!
CHIP=>Mom said I wasn't supposed to move because it might be scary. Sorry.
MAURICE=>It's all right.
MAURICE=>Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality... ... And kindness.
MAURICE=>Roses! Yes...
MAURICE=>Can't go home empty handed... I promised Belle a rose, didn't I? I think it's safe...
MAURICE=>Ow!
BELLE=>Philippe?
BELLE=>What happened? Where is Papa?!
BELLE=>Take me to him!
LUMIÈRE=>Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl.
COGSWORTH=>I can see it's a girl. I lost my hands, not my eyes.
LUMIÈRE=>But what if she is the one? The one who will break the spell?
BELLE=>Who said that? Who's there?
BELLE=>Papa!? Is that you?
MAURICE=>Belle? How did you find me!?
BELLE=>Oh, your hands are ice. We need to get you home.
MAURICE=>Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you!
BELLE=>Who?!
BELLE=>Who's there? Who are you?
THE BEAST=>Who are you?
BELLE=>I've come for my father.
THE BEAST=>Your father is a thief.
BELLE=>Liar!
THE BEAST=>HE STOLE A ROSE.
BELLE=>I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him!
MAURICE=>No, he means forever. Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower.
BELLE=>A life sentence for a rose?
THE BEAST=>I received eternal damnation for one. I'm merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father's place?
BELLE=>Come into the light.
THE BEAST=>CHOOSE!
MAURICE=>Belle, I won't let you do this. I lost your mother. I won't lose you too. Now go!
BELLE=>Alright, Papa. I will leave. I need a minute alone with him.
BELLE=>Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? Forever can spare a minute!
THE BEAST=>When this door closes, it will not open again.
BELLE=>I should have been with you.
MAURICE=>Belle, listen to me. It's all right. Live your life. Forget me.
BELLE=>Forget you? Everything I am is because of you.
MAURICE=>I love you, Belle. Don't be afraid.
BELLE=>I love you too, Papa...
BELLE=>I'm not afraid. And I will escape, I promise.
MAURICE=>What?!
THE BEAST=>You took his place.
BELLE=>He is my father.
THE BEAST=>He's a fool. So are you.
BELLE=>Don't hurt him!
MAURICE=>Belle! I'll come back! I promise!
LUMIÈRE=>Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room.
BELLE=>My room? But I thought --
LUMIÈRE=>What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic.
LUMIÈRE=>`Allo.
BELLE=>AHHH!
LUMIÈRE=>Oh, you are very strong. That's a great quality!
BELLE=>What are you?
LUMIÈRE=>I am Lumière.
BELLE=>And you can talk.
COGSWORTH=>Of course he can talk, it's all he ever does! Now Lumiere, as head of the household, I demand that you put her back in the cell at once!
LUMIÈRE=>What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock?
LUMIÈRE=>Ready, miss? Trust me.
LUMIÈRE=>You must forgive first impressions, I hope you are not too startled.
BELLE=>Why would I be startled? I'm talking to a candle.
LUMIÈRE=>Candelabra, please. Enormous difference. But consider me at your service. The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like --
COGSWORTH=>Except the west wing!
COGSWORTH=>Which we do not have.
BELLE=>Why, what's in the west wing?
LUMIÈRE=>Uh... nothing. Storage space. That's it.
LUMIÈRE=>This way, please!
COGSWORTH=>To the east wing.
LUMIÈRE=>Or as I like to call it, the only wing! Watch your step s'il vous plait.
LUMIÈRE=>Welcome to your new home. It's modest, but comfortable...
BELLE=>It's... beautiful.
LUMIÈRE=>Of course. Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
LUMIÈRE=>Oh dear! We were not expecting guests.
PLUMETTE=>Enchanté, Mademoiselle! Don't worry, I'll have this room spotless in no time!
PLUMETTE=>This plan of yours is... dangerous.
LUMIÈRE=>I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.
PLUMETTE=>No, my love. I've been burned by you before. We must be strong.
LUMIÈRE=>How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
BELLE=>Is everything here alive? Hello, what's your name?
COGSWORTH=>Um... that's a hair brush.
LUMIÈRE=>Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer.
COGSWORTH=>When she can stay awake.
GARDEROBE=>Cogsworth! A diva needs her beauty rrr-
LUMIÈRE=>Ah, stay with us, Madame! We have someone for you to dress!
GARDEROBE=>Finally. A woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess.
BELLE=>But I'm not a princess.
GARDEROBE=>Nonsense! Now, let's see what I've got in my drawers.
GARDEROBE=>Oh, how embarrassing.
GARDEROBE=>Come here, Froufrou. Come help mama!
GARDEROBE=>Perfetta!
LUMIÈRE=>Mm. Subtle. Understated. I love it!
GARDEROBE=>Froufrou, send my love to the maestro!
GASTON=>Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? "I will never marry you, Gaston."
LEFOU=>You know, there are other girls.
GASTON=>A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.
LEFOU=>Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why
LEFOU=>No one's slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on!
TOM/DICK/STANLEY=>Who plays darts like Gaston? Who breaks hearts like Gaston?
LEFOU=>Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston?
GASTON=>As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating
LEFOU/VILLAGERS=>My what a guy, that Gaston!
GASTON=>I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou
LEFOU=>Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you!
LEFOU=>Too much?
GASTON=>Yep.
VILLAGERS=>No one fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston!
LEFOU=>In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!
GASTON=>When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver And beasts of the field say a prayer First I carefully aim for the liver Then I shoot from behind!
LEFOU=>Is that fair?
GASTON=>I don't care
VILLAGERS=>No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston
LEFOU=>In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
GASTON=>I'M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT EXPECTORATING!
VILLAGERS=>Ten points for Gaston!
GASTON=>When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Ev'ry morning to help me get large
GASTON=>And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size of a barge!
LEFOU=>Who has brains like Gaston? Entertains like Gaston?
GASTON=>Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston?
GASTON=>I use antlers in all of my decorating!
ALL=>Say it again - who's a man among men? And let's say it once more Who's that hero next door? Who's a super success? Don't you know? Can't you guess? Ask his fans and his five hangers-on There's just one guy in town Who's got all of it down...
LEFOU=>And his name's `G-A-S-T... ' Uh, I believe there's another `T' in there, it just occurred to me that I'm illiterate and I've never actually had to spell it out loud before... Gaston!
GASTON=>Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet?
LEFOU=>I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it...
MAURICE=>Help! Somebody help me! We have to go... not a minute to lose...
TAVERN KEEPER=>Whoa. Slow down, Maurice.
MAURICE=>He's got Belle... locked in a dungeon!
TAVERN KEEPER=>Who's got her?
MAURICE=>A beast... a horrible monstrous beast!
MAURICE=>My daughter's life is in danger, why do you laugh!? His castle is hidden in the woods. It's already winter there!
JEAN=>Winter in June?
CLOTHILDE=>Crazy old Maurice.
MAURICE=>The beast is real! Do you understand?! Will no one help me?!
GASTON=>I'll help you, Maurice!
LEFOU=>You will?
GASTON=>Everyone! Stop making fun of this man at once!
MAURICE=>Thank you, Captain. Thank you.
GASTON=>Don't thank me, Maurice. Lead us to the beast.
LEFOU=>Ohhh.
CHIP=>Mama, there's a girl in the castle!
MRS. POTTS=>Yes, Chip. We know. Slow down.
CHIP=>Is she pretty? Is she nice? What kind of tea does she like?
MRS. POTTS=>We'll find out soon enough. Slow down before you break your handle!
CUISINIÈR=>Heads up, Mrs. Potts!
THE BEAST=>LUMIÈRE!
LUMIÈRE=>Be calm, let me do the talking.
THE BEAST=>YOU'RE MAKING HER DINNER!?
LUMIÈRE=>We thought you might appreciate the company.
COGSWORTH=>Master, I can assure you that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her a suite in the east wing --
THE BEAST=>YOU GAVE HER A BEDROOM!?
COGSWORTH=>No no, he gave her a bedroom.
LUMIÈRE=>That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. Good thinking, Cogsworth!
COGSWORTH=>What?!
THE BEAST=>That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! "Charm the prisoner."
LUMIÈRE=>You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human.
THE BEAST=>She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her?
MRS. POTTS=>Oh, you can't judge people by who their father is, now can you?
THE BEAST=>You will join me for dinner! That's not a request.
MRS. POTTS=>Gently, master. The girl lost her father and her freedom in one day.
LUMIÈRE=>Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death.
MRS. POTTS=>Exactly.
BELLE=>Just a minute.
LUMIÈRE=>You see, there she is. Now, master, remember. Be gentle.
MRS. POTTS=>...kind...
PLUMETTE=>...charming...
COGSWORTH=>...sweet...
LUMIÈRE=>And when she opens the door, give her a dashing debonair smile. Come come -- show me the smile.
LUMIÈRE=>Oh mon dieu.
THE BEAST=>Will you join me for dinner?
BELLE=>You've taken me prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane?
PLUMETTE=>He's losing it...
THE BEAST=>I told you to come down to dinner.
BELLE=>And I told you no!
GARDEROBE=>WHAT!? WHAT TIME IS IT!?
BELLE=>I'd starve before I ever ate with you!
THE BEAST=>Well be my guest! Go ahead and starve! If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
THE BEAST=>Idiots!
COGSWORTH=>You can't talk to us like that! I forbid it! I... I... Am I too late? Shame. I was really going to tell him off this time.
LUMIÈRE=>Oh master, you've returned!
COGSWORTH=>Oh, very funny.
LUMIÈRE=>Eh, I got you there!
THE BEAST=>Show me the girl.
LUMIÈRE=>Another petal fell...
PLUMETTE=>Lumière, I grew three more feathers! And I just plucked yesterday.
LUMIÈRE=>I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day.
COGSWORTH=>Oh, no! It's -- tick tock! -- happening again -- cuckoo! Pardon me.
MRS. POTTS=>Everyone, calm yourselves. We still have time.
CHIP=>Mama, am I ever going to be a boy again?
MRS. POTTS=>Yes, Chip. You'll have your days in the sun again. You just leave it to me.
BELLE=>I told you to go away.
MRS. POTTS=>Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs. Potts.
MRS. POTTS=>Oh, aren't you a vision! How lovely to make your acquaintance.
MRS. POTTS=>It's a very long journey. Let me fix you up before you go. I have found that most troubles seem less troubling after a bracing cup o' tea.
MRS. POTTS=>Slowly now, Chip.
CHIP=>Pleased to meet you! Want to see me do a trick?
MRS. POTTS=>Chip. That was a very brave thing you did for your father, dear.
GARDEROBE=>Yes. We all think so.
BELLE=>I'm so worried about him. He's never been on his own.
MRS. POTTS=>Cheer up, my poppet. Things will turn out in the end. You'll feel a lot better after dinner.
BELLE=>But he said, "If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all."
MRS. POTTS=>People say a lot of things in anger. It is our choice whether or not to listen. Coming?
GARDEROBE=>Go.
LUMIÈRE=>They're coming! Final checks, everyone, tout de suite!
COGSWORTH=>No, you don't! If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her, he will blame me.
LUMIÈRE=>Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room. Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot!
COGSWORTH=>You know she will never love him.
LUMIÈRE=>A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times.
LUMIÈRE=>Stand up straight! It's time to sparkle!
LUMIÈRE=>I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite.
CUISINIÈR=>Off! Off me while I work! Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg!
COGSWORTH=>Not so loud! Keep it down!
LUMIÈRE=>Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music?
COGSWORTH=>Music?!
LUMIÈRE=>Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?
CADENZA=>It has been so long since I've performed! I can barely even remember how...
CADENZA=>Another cavity.
LUMIÈRE=>Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse.
CADENZA=>Then, I shall play through the dental pain!
COGSWORTH=>But Maestro. Play quietly. Please.
CADENZA=>Quietly? Sotto voce? Of course. Are there any other tasteless demands you wish to make upon my artistry?
COGSWORTH=>No, that's it.
MRS. POTTS=>There you are, dear.
LUMIÈRE=>Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax.
LUMIÈRE=>Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents...
LUMIÈRE=>... your dinner. Be our guest, be our guest
LUMIÈRE=>Put our service to the test Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest!
LUMIÈRE=>Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
LUMIÈRE=>Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
LUMIÈRE=>They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France!
LUMIÈRE=>And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu
LUMIÈRE AND COGSWORTH=>Be our guest!
LUMIÈRE=>Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flambé!
LUMIÈRE=>We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret!
LUMIÈRE=>You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared!
LUMIÈRE=>No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining!
LUMIÈRE=>We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks
CHANDELIER CANDLESTICKS=>And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet!
LUMIÈRE=>Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest.
LUMIÈRE=>Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest!
LUMIÈRE=>Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving
LUMIÈRE=>He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon
LUMIÈRE=>Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone
LUMIÈRE=>Too long we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills
LUMIÈRE=>Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy
LUMIÈRE=>You walked in, and oops-a-daisie!
MRS. POTTS=>It's a guest, it's a guest! Sakes alive, and I'll be blessed! Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had more napkins freshly pressed!
MRS. POTTS=>With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear, that's fine with me! While the cups do their soft shoeing, I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing!
MRS. POTTS=>I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sake, is that a spot?
MRS. POTTS=>Clean it up, we want the company impressed!
MRS. POTTS=>We've got a lot to do -- Is it one lump or two? For you our guest!
LUMIÈRE=>She's our guest!
MRS. POTTS=>She's our guest!
COGSWORTH, LUMIÈRE, MRS. POTTS=>She's our guest!
ALL=>Be our guest! Be our guest! Our command is your request! It's years since we had anybody Here and we're obsessed!
ALL=>With your meal, with your ease, Yes indeed, we aim to please
ALL=>While the candlelight's still glowing, Let us help you, we'll keep going -- Course by... COURSE! One by one! Til you shout "Enough, I'm done!" Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now let's eat up... Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! Please! Be our guest!!
LUMIÈRE=>Pudding?!
BELLE=>Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape?
MRS. POTTS=>The master's not as terrible as he appears. Somewhere deep in his soul, there's a prince of a fellow, just waiting to be set free.
BELLE=>Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing...
MRS. POTTS=>Never you mind about that. Off to bed with you, poppet.
BELLE=>Good night.
MRS. POTTS=>Nighty-night. Straight to bed!
THE BEAST=>WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT!?
BELLE=>Nothing.
THE BEAST=>DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL! GET OUT! GO!
LUMIÈRE=>Checkmate. Again.
COGSWORTH=>Because you cheated. Again.
LUMIÈRE=>Mademoiselle... what are you doing?
BELLE=>Getting out of here!
COGSWORTH=>Stop!
LUMIÈRE=>Go go, Froufrou!
COGSWORTH=>Yes Froufrou, stop her!
MRS. POTTS=>You don't want to go out there!
MRS. POTTS=>Stop her!
COGSWORTH=>Who's a good dog?
COGSWORTH=>What? No, it's not playtime! Bad dog! Bad dog!
MRS. POTTS=>What part of `stop her' don't you understand, dog?!
LUMIÈRE=>Please, don't go! It's dangerous!
MRS. POTTS=>Oh my...
BELLE=>You have to help me... you have to stand...
MAURICE=>No! I'm sure this is the way! Do you hear those wolves? That means we're getting very close to the castle.
GASTON=>Look, enough is enough. We have to turn back.
MAURICE=>Stop! That's it!
MAURICE=>That's the tree. I'm sure of it. Of course, it was downed by lightning at the time, but now it's been restored to an upright position, through some sort of... magic. Or other.
LEFOU=>You really want to marry into this family?
MAURICE=>So that means the castle is definitely that way!
GASTON=>I'm done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle?
MAURICE=>The beast took her!
GASTON=>There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation.
LEFOU=>Deep breaths, Gaston. Deep breaths.
GASTON=>So why don't we just turn around go back to Villeneuve? I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner...
MAURICE=>If you think I've made all this up, then why did you offer to help?
GASTON=>Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let's go home.
MAURICE=>Belle is not at home! She's with the --
GASTON=>IF YOU SAY BEAST ONE MORE TIME, I WILL FEED YOU TO THE WOLVES!
LEFOU=>GASTON! STOP! Breathe. Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war. Blood, explosions, countless widows...
GASTON=>Widows...
LEFOU=>Yes, yes, that's it, that's it...
GASTON=>Please, forgive me, old bean. That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it?
MAURICE=>Future father-in-law...? You will never marry my daughter.
LEFOU=>I saw that coming...
GASTON=>If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me.
LEFOU=>For the sake of exhausting all of our options, do we maybe want to consider a less gruesome alternative?
GASTON=>Are you coming?
THE BEAST=>ROOOOAARRRR! Ow! That hurts!
BELLE=>If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.
THE BEAST=>If you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened.
BELLE=>Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.
THE BEAST=>Well you shouldn't have been in the west wing.
BELLE=>Well you should learn to control your temper.
BELLE=>Try to get some rest.
MRS. POTTS=>Thank you, Miss.
LUMIÈRE=>We are eternally grateful.
BELLE=>Why do you care so much about him?
MRS. POTTS=>We've looked after him all his life.
BELLE=>But he has cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing.
MRS. POTTS=>You're quite right there, dear. You see, when the master lost his mother, and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad and twisted him up to be just like him... we did nothing.
LUMIÈRE=>Let him sleep.
YOUNG PRINCE=>Days in the sun When my life has barely begun
YOUNG PRINCE=>Not until my own life is done Will I ever leave you
CADENZA=>Will I tremble again To my dear one's gorgeous refrain?
MRS. POTTS=>Oh those days in the sun What I'd give to relive just one Undo what's done And bring back the light
GARDEROBE=>O I could sing Of the pain these dark days bring The spell we're under Still it's the wonder of us I sing of tonight
BELLE=>How in the midst of all this sorrow Can so much hope and love endure? I was innocent and certain Now I'm wiser but unsure
BELLE GARDEROBE=>I can't go back into my Days in the past childhood Ah those precious days One that my father made couldn't last secure Oh - hold me closer I can feel the change in me
ALL=>Days in the sun Will return - we must believe As lovers do That days in the sun Will come shining through
BELLE=>What happens when the last petal falls?
LUMIÈRE=>The master remains a beast forever. And the rest of us become...
MRS. POTTS=>Antiques.
LUMIÈRE=>Knickknacks.
PLUMETTE=>Lightly used houseware.
COGSWORTH=>Rubbish. We become rubbish.
BELLE=>I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse.
COGSWORTH=>Well, there is one --
MRS. POTTS=>It's not for you to worry about, lamb. We've made our bed and we must lie in it.
AGATHE=>Drink.
MAURICE=>Thank you... Agathe.
BELLE=>Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore --
THE BEAST=>And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
BELLE=>So you know Shakespeare?
THE BEAST=>I had an expensive education.
BELLE=>Actually, "Romeo and Juliet" is my favorite play.
THE BEAST=>Why is that not a surprise?
BELLE=>Sorry?
THE BEAST=>All that heartache and pining and -- There are so many better things to read.
BELLE=>Like what?
THE BEAST=>Should be something here you can start with...
BELLE=>It's wonderful.
THE BEAST=>Oh. Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.
BELLE=>Have you really read every one of these books?
THE BEAST=>Not all of them. Some are in Greek.
BELLE=>Was that a joke? Are you making jokes now?
THE BEAST=>Maybe.
BELLE=>The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled
BELLE=>Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass
BEAST=>I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time.
BEAST=>Is there more?
BELLE=>But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: "Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be."
BELLE=>There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
BELLE=>And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before
THE BEAST=>She glanced this way I thought I saw And when we touched She didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked at me that way before
BELLE=>New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
BELLE=>True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see!
PLUMETTE=>Well, who'd have thought?
MRS. POTTS=>Well, bless my soul!
COGSWORTH=>Well, who'd have known?
LUMIÈRE=>Well, who indeed?
LUMIÈRE=>And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
MRS. POTTS=>It's so peculiar, wait and see.
ALL=>We'll wait and see! A few days more
ALL=>There may be something there that wasn't there before.
COGSWORTH=>You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.
CHIP=>What, mama?
MRS. POTTS=>There may be something there that wasn't there before.
CHIP=>What is it, what's there?
MRS. POTTS=>I'll tell you when you're older.
CHIP=>Okay, I'm older!
MRS. POTTS=>Oh Chip, you are a one!
BELLE=>What are you reading?
THE BEAST=>Nothing.
BELLE=>Guinevere and Lancelot.
THE BEAST=>Well actually, King Arthur and the Round Table. Knights, and men, and swords and things...
BELLE=>But still... it's a romance.
THE BEAST=>All right. I felt like a change.
BELLE=>I never thanked you for saving my life.
THE BEAST=>Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.
BELLE=>They know how to have a good time.
THE BEAST=>Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies.
BELLE=>Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a "funny girl," but I don't think they mean it as a compliment.
THE BEAST=>I'm sorry. Your village sounds terrible.
BELLE=>Almost as lonely as your castle.
THE BEAST=>What do you say we run away?
THE BEAST=>Another little "gift" from the Enchantress...
THE BEAST=>A book that truly allows you to escape.
BELLE=>How amazing.
THE BEAST=>It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you.
THE BEAST=>Think of the place you've most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind's eye. Now feel it in your heart.
THE BEAST=>Where did you take us?
BELLE=>Paris.
THE BEAST=>Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs- Elysées? No? Too touristy?
BELLE=>It's so much smaller than I imagined.
BELLE=>This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived
BELLE=>Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone
THE BEAST=>What happened to your mother?
BELLE=>That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask...
THE BEAST=>Plague.
DOCTOR=>You must leave. Now.
BELLE'S MOTHER=>Quickly... before it takes her too...
THE BEAST=>I am sorry I ever called your father a thief.
BELLE=>Let's go home.
LEFOU=>Wow, this is some storm. At least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere, right? You know it's not too late, we could just go get him...
LEFOU=>It's just, every time I close my eyes, I picture Maurice stranded out there. And then when I open them, he's --
LEFOU=>Maurice!
TAVERN KEEPER=>Gaston, did you try to kill Maurice?
GASTON=>Oh, Maurice! Thank heavens. I've spent the last five days trying to find you.
MAURICE=>No! You tried to kill me! You left me for the wolves!
GASTON=>Maurice, it's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder.
JEAN=>Maurice, do you have any proof of what you're saying?
MAURICE=>Ask Agathe! She rescued me!
GASTON=>Agathe? You'd hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag? No offense, Agathe.
MAURICE=>Monsieur LeFou! He was there. He saw it all.
LEFOU=>Me?
GASTON=>You're right. Don't take my word for it.
GASTON=>LeFou, my dearest companion, did I, your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot, try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved?
LEFOU=>It's a complicated question on a number of accounts, but... no. No, he did not.
GASTON=>Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind.
GASTON=>Everything's going to be fine.
BEAST=>I saw her in the ballroom, and I said, well, you're making this so beautiful, we should have a dance tonight. I never thought she'd actually say yes! What was I thinking?!
LUMIÈRE=>No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel.
THE BEAST=>I feel like a fool. She will never love me.
LUMIÈRE=>Do not be discouraged.
LUMIÈRE=>She is the one.
THE BEAST=>I wish you'd stop saying that!
THE BEAST=>There is no one.
LUMIÈRE=>You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight...
PLUMETTE=>Yes, and when the moment's just right...
THE BEAST=>But how will I know?
COGSWORTH=>You will feel slightly nauseous.
LUMIÈRE=>Don't worry, master, you'll do fine.
MRS. POTTS=>Just stop being a coward and tell Belle how you feel. And if you don't, I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your life.
LUMIÈRE=>In the dark.
PLUMETTE=>Covered in dust.
LUMIÈRE=>Dark and very very dusty.
89A=>bad makeover.
LUMIÈRE=>Start with the hair! Women love nice hair.
MRS. POTTS=>I'll take the fingers and toes!
COGSWORTH=>Chapeau, brush those teeth!
LUMIÈRE=>Dip dip, snip snip...
PLUMETTE=>Eyes closed, poof poof!
LUMIÈRE=>And the pièce de résistance...
LUMIÈRE=>OK, I can fix this!
GARDEROBE=>Beautiful. But something is missing.
GARDEROBE=>Ahh, yes. The finishing touch.
MRS. POTTS=>Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends unexpectedly
MRS. POTTS=>Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the Beast
MRS. POTTS=>Ever just the same Ever a surprise Ever as before Ever just as sure As the sun will rise Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bittersweet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong
MRS. POTTS=>Certain as the sun Rising in the East Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast
MRS. POTTS=>Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast
THE BEAST=>I haven't danced in years. I'd almost forgotten the feeling.
THE BEAST=>It's foolish, I suppose, for a creature like me to hope that one day he might earn your affection.
BELLE=>I don't know...
THE BEAST=>Really? So you think you could be happy here?
BELLE=>Could anyone be happy if they're not free?
BELLE=>My father taught me to dance. I used to step on his toes a lot.
THE BEAST=>You must miss him.
BELLE=>Very much.
THE BEAST=>Would you like to see him?
BELLE=>I'd like to see my father.
BELLE=>Papa! What are they doing to him?!
THE BEAST=>You must go to him.
BELLE=>What did you say?
THE BEAST=>You must go to him. No time to waste.
THE BEAST=>No. Keep it with you. And you'll always have a way to look back on me.
BELLE=>Thank you.
COGSWORTH=>Well, master, I may have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork. True love really does win the day!
THE BEAST=>I let her go.
COGSWORTH=>You... WHAT!?
LUMIÈRE=>Master... how could you do that?
THE BEAST=>I had to.
COGSWORTH=>But why?
MRS. POTTS=>Because he loves her.
LUMIÈRE=>Then why are we not human?
COGSWORTH=>Because she doesn't love him! And now, it's too late.
PLUMETTE=>But she might still come back --
THE BEAST=>No. I've set her free. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
THE BEAST=>Now go. Our time is almost past.
THE BEAST=>I was the one who had it all I was the master of my fate I never needed anybody in my life I learned the truth too late
THE BEAST=>I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear
THE BEAST=>Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she runs away She will still torment me, calm me, hurt me, move me come what may
THE BEAST=>Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And be with me for evermore
THE BEAST=>I rage against the trials of love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She will still torment me, be part of everything I do Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And as the long long nights begin I'll think of all that might have been Waiting here for evermore
GASTON=>Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free.
MAURICE=>Never.
GASTON=>Take him away!
BELLE=>STOP!
VILLAGERS=>"Belle..." "Where did she come from?" "Is that Belle..." "Look at that dress..."
MAURICE=>Belle? I thought I'd lost you!
BELLE=>Open this door! He's hurt!
MONSIEUR D'ARQUE=>I'm afraid we can't do that, miss. But we'll take very good care of him.
BELLE=>My father's not crazy! Gaston... Tell him!
GASTON=>Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims.
JEAN=>It's true, Belle. He's been raving about a beast in a castle.
BELLE=>I have just come from the castle and there is a beast!
GASTON=>We all admire your devotion to your father, but you'd say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof.
BELLE=>You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST!
BELLE=>There is your proof!
GASTON=>This is sorcery!
GASTON=>Look at this beast. Look at his fangs, his claws.
BELLE=>No, don't be afraid. He is gentle and kind.
GASTON=>The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him.
BELLE=>He's not a monster, Gaston. You are. The beast would never hurt anyone.
GASTON=>I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence!
GASTON=>We can't have her running off to warn the beast. Lock her up too.
BELLE=>This isn't over Gaston, you'll see!
LEFOU=>Gaston, with all due respect --
GASTON=>DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? Fetch my horse.
GASTON=>That creature will curse us all if we don't stop him! Well, I say we KILL THE BEAST!
TOM=>We're not safe until he's dead
DICK=>He'll come stalking us at night
JEAN=>Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite!
CLOTHILDE=>He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free!
GASTON=>So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me!
GASTON=>Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
GASTON=>Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST!
MOB=>Light your torch, mount your horse!
GASTON=>Screw your courage to the sticking place
MOB=>We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
GASTON=>Call it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I say
LEFOU=>There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released
MOB=>Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go!
GASTON=>Show me the castle!
LUMIÈRE=>At least he has finally learned to love.
COGSWORTH=>A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return.
MRS. POTTS=>No. This is the first time I've had any real hope she would.
CHIP=>Did you hear that, mama? Is it her!? Is she coming back?!
LUMIÈRE=>Could it be?
LUMIÈRE=>Sacrebleu! Invaders.
MRS. POTTS=>Ruffians!
COGSWORTH=>Well, there you go. So much for true love. Man the barricades, and hold fast!
CASTLE STAFF=>Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle -- Unafraid although the danger just increased
CADENZA=>Move aside!
MOB=>Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast!
COGSWORTH=>We need help!
BELLE=>I have to warn the beast --
MAURICE=>Warn him? How did you get away from him?
BELLE=>He let me go, papa. He sent me back to you.
MAURICE=>I don't understand.
BELLE=>He took me there. I know what happened to maman.
MAURICE=>Then you know I had to leave her there. I had to protect you. I've always tried to protect you... too much, perhaps...
BELLE=>I understand.
BELLE=>Will you help me now?
MAURICE=>It's dangerous.
BELLE=>Yes. Yes it is.
MAURICE=>Of course I could try to pick the lock. After all, it's only gears and springs. But I would need something long and sharp --
MAURICE=>Like that. Perfect.
COGSWORTH=>Pardon me, master. I'm sorry to disturb you, but --
THE BEAST=>She's not coming back.
COGSWORTH=>No... the castle is under attack!
THE BEAST=>It doesn't matter now. Just let them come.
MOB=>Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
MRS. POTTS=>This isn't working!
LUMIÈRE=>I know what to do.
MOB=>Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
MOB=>Kill the beast! Kill the beast!
LEFOU=>Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted?
GASTON=>Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.
JEAN=>This place seems familiar... like I've been here before...
LEFOU=>You must be the talking teacup. And you must be his grandmother.
MRS. POTTS=>Grand-mother? ATTACK!
LEFOU=>Gaston!
LEFOU=>Gaston... help...
GASTON=>Sorry, old friend. It's hero time.
MAURICE=>Hello. Oh, I believe this is yours.
MAURICE=>She's very headstrong. Do you have children?
PLUMETTE=>No one to protect you now, eh?!
CHIP=>One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
COGSWORTH=>Good show, Chip my boy!
COGSWORTH=>Excellent! The infantry's arrived. Now go and teach them a lesson!
COGSWORTH=>Yes, those are called books, you third- rate musketeers!
COGSWORTH=>Oh, I'm off!
COGSWORTH=>Ah, terribly sorry, pardon me, I'm just a clock!
GARDEROBE=>Yes, that's it... put it on... pretty little boys!
GARDEROBE=>Go! Be free! Be free! Be FREE!
MRS. POTTS=>How do you take your tea?! Piping hot?! Or boiling?!
MRS. POTTS=>Mister Potts?!
CHIP=>Mama!
MRS. POTTS=>Oh! Thank you.
MRS. POTTS=>Nicely handled!
LEFOU=>Well I used to be on Gaston's side, but we're in a bad place right now.
MRS. POTTS=>You're too good for him anyway...
MRS. POTTS=>Shall we get back to it, then?!
CADENZA=>Such sweet music! Ha ha, I'll play you like a concerto!
CLOTHILDE=>Silence that harpsichord!
GARDEROBE=>Maestro!
CADENZA=>Darling! At last!
GARDEROBE=>I'm coming, my love! That's it! The fat lady is singing!
CADENZA=>Bravissima!
LUMIÈRE=>Watch your toes!
LUMIÈRE=>Bon voyage! Safe trip home!
COGSWORTH=>And stay out!
GASTON=>Hello, beast. I am Gaston. Belle sent me.
GASTON=>Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she'd want you?
GASTON=>Belle?
BELLE=>Where is he?!
GASTON=>When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall!
BELLE=>NEVER.
GASTON=>I'm coming for you, beast!
BELLE=>NO!
THE BEAST=>Belle?
THE BEAST=>BELLE! You came back!
BELLE=>I tried to stop them!
THE BEAST=>Stay there! I'm coming!
BELLE=>Stop! Gaston, no!
GASTON=>No. Don't let me go. Please. Don't hurt me, beast. I'll do anything.
THE BEAST=>I AM NOT A BEAST.
THE BEAST=>Go. Get out.
BELLE=>No! It's too far!
THE BEAST=>You came back.
BELLE=>Of course I came back. I'll never leave you again.
THE BEAST=>I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.
BELLE=>We're together now. It's going to be fine. You'll see.
THE BEAST=>At least I got to see you one last time.
BELLE=>No... please, no...
LUMIÈRE=>We did it, Plumette. Victory is ours.
LUMIÈRE=>Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette...
GARDEROBE=>Oh, maestro! You were so brave! Goodbye, my love...
CADENZA=>Darling! No, don't leave me!
MRS. POTTS=>CHIP! CHIP! Have you seen Chip!? He ran off! Oh, where is my little boy --
CHIP=>Mama!
COGSWORTH=>Oh no.
COGSWORTH=>Lumière... I... TICK... can't... CHIME... speak...
LUMIÈRE=>It's all right, Cogsworth.
COGSWORTH=>I... can't... TICK... Lumière, my friend... TOCK... it was an honor to serve with you.
LUMIÈRE=>The honor was mine.
BELLE=>Please, don't leave me. Come back.
BELLE=>I love you.
PRINCE=>Belle...
MAESTRO=>Oh, Madame.
DIVA=>Oh, Maestro.
COGSWORTH=>Lumière!
LUMIÈRE=>Cogsworth, we beat the clock!
COGSWORTH=>Mon ami.
LUMIÈRE=>Plumette... mon amour...
MRS. POTTS=>Oh, Chip! What did I tell you? Look at you -- you're a little boy again! Oh you smell so good!
JEAN=>Darling!?
MRS. POTTS=>Mr. Potts!
JEAN=>Beatrice! Chip! I remember! I do!
CLOTHILDE=>Henry?
COGSWORTH=>Oh. DEAR!
CLOTHILDE=>I've been so lonely.
COGSWORTH=>Turn back into a clock... turn back into a clock...
PLUMETTE=>Lumière, look!
LUMIÈRE=>Oh, my Prince!
THE PRINCE=>Hello, old friend.
LUMIÈRE=>It's so good to see you!
PLUMETTE=>You saved our lives, mademoiselle.
CHIP=>Belle, it's me! It's Chip!
GARDEROBE=>Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bittersweet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong
MRS. POTTS=>Winter turns to spring Famine turns to feast Nature points the way Nothing left to say Beauty and the Beast
BELLE=>How would you feel about growing a beard?
ALL=>Certain as the sun Rising in the East Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast
