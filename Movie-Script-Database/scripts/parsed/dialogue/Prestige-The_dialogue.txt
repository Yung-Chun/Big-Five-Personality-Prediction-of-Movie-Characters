BORDEN=>Are you watching closely? A SECOND BLACK CAT races into frame, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the woods beyond and we-
ORDINARY-=>Cutter moves to a small ORNATE CAGE resting on a prop table.
STAGEHAND=>Where'd you think you're going?!
BEARDED MAN=>I'm part of the act, you fool!
DEFENDER=>How large was this tank?
DEFENDER=>How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
JUDGE=>Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament but we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
JUDGE=>If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.
CAPTAIN=>I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
CAPTAIN=>Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape.
CAPTAIN=>I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates.
OWENS=>My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
OWENS=>I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic-
BORDEN=>How much?
OWENS=>Lord Caldlow is interested in-
OWENS=>Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN=>Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him.
OWENS=>I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man.
BORDEN=>I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
OWENS=>Even for your daughter? Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive.
OWENS=>If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after
BORDEN=>Fallon can take care of-
OWENS=>Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his "care". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house... Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs.
OWENS=>It's better than this. Borden looks at Owens, hard. The Warders unlock Borden.
OWENS=>I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. Think it over.
OWENS=>Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather
BOUND JOURNAL)=>As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest.
OWENS=>Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick...
BORDEN=>Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS=>Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even...
OWENS=>I want your secret, Mr.Borden...
ANGIER=>A cypher. An enigma...
ANGIER=>...Borden's cypher is simple- unraveled by a single word. Now it takes only patience. And a passion to know his mind.
VOICE=>Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado Springs.
ANGIER=>Quit a reception.
MANAGER=>You're our first guest of the season, Mr.Angier. Your telegram didn't indicate how long you would be staying with us.
ANGIER=>As long as it takes.
MANAGER=>The peak is closed, sit. For scientific experimentation.
DRIVER=>You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid, sir.
SHOTGUN=>I'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
ANGIER=>Not the welcome I was expecting.
SHOTGUN=>I know you. You're that magician-the Great Danton. I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN London. Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets. Angier leans on his cane and gently brushes off the dirt.
ALLEY=>I'm sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
ANGIER=>I've come to see Tesla.
ALLEY=>Why?
ANGIER=>He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him? I've come a very long way.
ALLEY=>Impossible, I'm afraid.
ANGIER=>I've brought a lot of money. Beat.
ALLEY=>I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't help you. Alley pulls the fence closed.
ANGIER=>I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely. Alley watches Angier walk away. He pulls something from his pocket.
ALLEY=>What am I holding? Angier doesn't look back.
ANGIER=>Your watch.
ANGIER=>April 3rd, 1893... a few days after he first met me...
BORDEN=>We were too young men at the start of a great career...
BORDEN=>Two young man devoted to an illusion...
BORDEN=>Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.
MILTON=>Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman...
MILTON=>Are either of you two gentlemen gailors?
MILTON=>Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot...
STOPWATCH.=>JULIA looks down at Angier. They smile at each other. Julia DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank...
BORDEN=>Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
BORDEN=>What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-
ANGIER=>He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA=>There'd be no seats left for the punters.
BORDEN=>Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-
ANGIER=>Actually, I do.
BORDEN=>No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER=>I could.
BORDEN=>You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER=>Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
ANGIER=>Why?
ANGIER=>Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN=>Tickets are pricey.
ANGIER=>Which is?
JULIA=>Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN=>The most powerful theatrical agent in London.
JULIA=>I think I had my wrist turned-
JULIA=>I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN=>We've been practiced it-
ANGIER=>Where's he from?
ANGIER=>He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
ANGIER=>How do you know?
ANGIER=>I don't know if I trust him.
JULIA=>I think he's alright. Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
ANGIER=>You think everyone's alright.
JULIA=>Even you. Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
BORDEN=>Look- he's all right. He's fine.
BORDEN=>Sharp lad, your son.
BORDEN=>You're the lucky one tonight. Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE. Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart. A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below. Borden SLAPS the cage. And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out and SPLASHES into the bucket.
BORDEN=>Are you watching closely? Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin. The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
BORDEN=>Look closer.
BOY=>It's got two heads. Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
BORDEN=>Never. Show. Anyone.
BORDEN=>They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything.
BORDEN=>Where do you two live?
SARAH=>He lives with Mum.
BORDEN=>And you?
BORDEN=>Enough to keep me out?
SARAH=>I think so. Wil I see you again?
ANGIER=>You're wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN=>It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER=>but look at the man!
BORDEN=>Total devotion to his art... Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this.
ANGIER=>I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.
ANGIER=>Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
ANGIER=>Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else.
JULIA=>You're pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER=>I don't think changing your name compares.
JULIA=>Not just your name- who you are, where you're from...
ANGIER=>I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors. Angier cuddles up to Julia.
JULIA=>I came up with a name for you... "The Great Danton"
ANGIER=>It's French.
SARAH=>Alfred?!
BORDEN=>We have our routine for Ackerman!
BORDEN=>Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
SARAH=>Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN=>Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH=>I need talk to you.
SARAH=>We can't afford to pay him-
BORDEN=>We'll start making money once we have our audience-
SARAH=>And until then? What I earn is barely enough for us.
SARAH=>You're already going to be sharing it with someone else.
BORDEN=>You're...?
SARAH=>Having a baby.
SARAH=>What's this?
BORDEN=>The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.
SARAH=>Your great trick? The "masterpiece that will make our fortunes"?
BORDEN=>No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet. Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun. Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
BORDEN=>This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch- Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
SARAH=>I'm not letting you get shot. Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD and hands the pistol to Sarah.
BORDEN=>It's perfectly safe. Shoot me. Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him. BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to "catch" the bullet. The mirror is intact. Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in his hand.
SARAH=>Show me. Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred. Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places it on the bureau.
BORDEN=>The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod. He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which disappears.
AND VOILS-=>He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of the HOLLOW TIP.
BORDEN=>The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
SARAH=>Once you know it's so obvious.
BORDEN=>Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it.
SARAH=>How?
BORDEN=>Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.
SARAH=>Such as?
BORDEN=>A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet. But don't fret-
BORDEN=>I'm not letting anything happen- I love you too much.
SARAH=>Say it again.
BORDEN=>I love you.
BORDEN=>What?
ANGIER=>Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic...
ANGIER=>...but what does he know of self- sacrifice more than the rest of us?
BORDEN=>Bloody fool.
JUDGE=>What's in there?
JUDGE=>You built this, Mr.Cutter?
JUDGE=>They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.
JUDGE=>Why ever not?
JUDGE=>I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick.
JUDGE=>This is the tank Angier drowned in?
JUDGE=>A standard magical apparatus for escapes?
JUDGE=>What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths?
JUDGE=>Even without and audience?
MILTON=>Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman?
BORDEN=>How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure-
ANGIER=>How can be not know?!
ANGIER=>He must know what he did. He must.
BORDEN=>"How can be not know?!"
PRISONER=>Shit it, Professor, or I'll shut it for you.
BORDEN=>How could I not know? How can you read my story and not understand?
JUDGE=>Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
BORDEN=>They took her away?
BORDEN=>Tell him I've reconsidered.
VOICE=>Mind if I join you?
ALLEY=>Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton.
ALLEY=>Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr. Angier? It matches the scenery nicely.
ANGIER=>Why are you here?
ALLEY=>The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret.
ALLEY=>A cypher?
ANGIER=>My profession also deals in secrets.
ANGIER=>It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword.
ALLEY=>Which is?
ANGIER=>We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY=>You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER=>Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY=>Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER=>It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.
ALLEY=>You're hoping to find a great secretin there?
ANGIER=>I've already found it. That's why I'm here.
ANGIER=>Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY=>Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER=>Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY=>Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it.
ANGIER=>I understand discretion. I just want the machine.
ALLEY=>Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER=>I thought it was a secret.
ALLEY=>We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
ALLEY=>Not long now.
ALLEY=>Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.
ANGIER=>Where are the wires?
ALLEY=>Exactly.
ANGIER=>Where's the generator?
ALLEY=>You saw it last week.
ANGIER=>But that must be ten miles from here.
ALLEY=>Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier.
VOICE=>Get out your gun, Professor!
BORDEN=>A volunteer.
BORDEN=>Are you man enought, sir?
ANGIER=>Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
ANGIER=>Who?
ANGIER=>You got me a booking? Why?
ANGIER=>Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
ANGIER=>To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming...
ANGIER=>Which knot did Borden tie that night?
ANGIER=>Wouldn't say?!
ANGIER=>We should see about an assistant.
ANGIER=>Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
ANGIER=>No. It's sophisticated.
OLIVIA=>What's so hard about this? Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.
SARAH=>I don't understand, Alfred. How can it be bleeding again?
SARAH=>What have you been doing to it? It looks as had as the day it happened. We need to get the doctot back-
SARAH=>You've woken her.
BORDEN=>I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.
SARAH=>Alfred, you have to face things. What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury?
BORDEN=>Some of the card pulls, prop tricks... And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for.
ANGIER=>The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.
ANGIER=>And I don't want to kill doves.
ANGIER=>You sound like him.
ANGIER=>I need a volunteer.
MERRIT=>You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER=>Of course not.
ANGIER=>And one, two... THREE!
ANGIER=>Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
ANGIER=>Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
MERRIT=>Very nice. Very nice indeed.
MERRIT=>A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER=>Don't worry.
MERRIT=>You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape.
ANGIER=>You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?
MAN=>This isn't mine.
ANGIER=>Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.
OLIVIA=>I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes. Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat...
ANGIER=>The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter. Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms...
ANGIER=>Wish us luc, Cutter.
ANGIER=>You've seen this one before?
HECKLER=>Seen 'em all before, mate! Laughter.
ANGIER=>Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?
ANGIER=>Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me...
ANGIER=>I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or by any other audience anywhere in the worth...
ANGIER=>Any magician can make this cage disappear... that's why I'll ask this good lady and fine gentleman to place their hands firmly on the cage...
ANGIER=>...to ensure that no trickery whatsover is employed.
ANGIER=>I should've spotted him.
ANGIER=>Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.
ANGIER=>So what's the climax of our show?
MERRIT=>Show? You don't have a show.
ANGIER=>Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
MERRIT=>To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer's fingers! Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.
MERRIT=>It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians, which should indicate the may I felel about your friend's future as a stage magician.
ANGIER=>The name stays.
TICKET HAWKER=>Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved.
TESLA=>With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
TESLA=>Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices-
BORDEN=>I love you.
SARAH=>See? Today, it's true.
ANGIER=>I saw hapiness...
ANGIER=>...hapiness that should have been mine. But I was wrong.
ANGIER=>Reading his account I realize that he never had the life I envied.
ANGIER=>The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one...
ANGIER=>His soul restless. His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature...
BORDEN=>Guard! Guard!!
GUARD=>What do want, Professor?
BORDEN=>Paper and pencil. Please.
SULLEN=>Let me see?
SULLEN=>I'm going to know all of the Professor's secrets.
SULLEN=>Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here-
)=>Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor?
BORDEN=>Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
HAND-=>Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face. Sullen stares.
BORDEN=>-get you attention. Then quietly
SULLEN=>How'd you get so famous, then? Borden STANDS.
BORDEN=>Magic. Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
SULLEN=>Oi, Borden, get back here! Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON. Sullen, now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs.
OLIVIA=>I don't really.... have anywhere to go. Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
ANGIER=>You've been sleeping here?
OLIVIA=>Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking.
ANGIER=>Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA=>You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet.
OLIVIA=>Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can-
ANGIER=>Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again.
OLIVIA=>Us. Olivia moves towards him.
OLIVIA=>You're going to need a better disguise. Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.
BORDEN=>I need a volunteer. Angier takes a few steps towards the stage. Borden produces a RUBBER BALL. he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
BORDEN=>As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all. Angier examines the ball. Hands it back to Borden who shows no sign of recognizing Angier.
BORDEN=>Thank you. Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing twenty feet apart on the stage.
BORDEN=>It's a magic ball. Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor. The audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
OLIVIA=>What happened?
OLIVIA=>What happened, Robert?
ANGIER=>He had a new trick.
OLIVIA=>Was it good?
ANGIER=>It was the greatest magic trick I have ever seen. Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way. At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves the door open. He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across the stage... Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door. With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height... Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE happens.
CATCHING THE BALL.=>Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden. The audience is BEMUSED. Finally, a trickle of applause.
ANGIER=>Did they applaud when you saw it?
ANGIER=>He's a dreadful magician.
ANGIER=>How does he do it?
ANGIER=>I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
ANGIER=>The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.
OLIVIA=>It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia.
OLIVIA=>He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell. Angier looks at Cutter.
ANGIER=>He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do.
ANGIER=>The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.
ANGIER=>He doesn't use a double-
ANGIER=>Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.
ALLEY=>It's perfectly safe.
TESLA=>So this is the Great Danton.
TESLA=>Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets?
ANGIER=>I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
ANGIER=>What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA=>Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy.
TESLA=>Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
TESLA=>Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
ANGIER=>I need something impossible.
TESLA=>You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?
TESLA=>It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society. Tesla looks out at the mountains.
TESLA=>The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. Enjoying "retirement". Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
TESLA=>Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER=>If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering.
TESLA=>Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER=>Price is not an object.
TESLA=>Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
ANGIER=>I'm noit sure I follow.
TESLA=>I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice...
ANGIER=>Have your obsessions done you no good?
TESLA=>At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me. Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
ANGIER=>if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.
ANGIER=>Will you build it?
TESLA=>I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time. Tesla disappears into the lab.
OLIVIA=>Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
ROOT=>A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
ANGIER=>He's out of his mind.
OLIVIA=>He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.
ANGIER=>I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.
BORDEN=>Would you like to see a magic trick?
SARAH=>What is this for?
SARAH=>When I asked last week you said we couldn't afford.
BORDEN=>You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH=>But you want through all the-
BORDEN=>Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work.
OLIVIA=>You walk through this one- then...?
OLIVIA=>Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?
OLIVIA=>And Root goes up through there?
OLIVIA=>It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER=>It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.
OLIVIA=>You went and saw his show again?
OLIVIA=>You becoming obsessed, Robert.
ANGIER=>All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.
ROOT=>You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do.
ROOT=>Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?'
ROOT=>I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing. Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
ANGIER=>No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods.
ANGIER=>Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform.
ANGIER=>Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
ANGIER=>At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA=>I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
ANGIER=>Thank you.
ROOT=>of course I can. I'm the Great Danton. They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
ANGIER=>I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA=>Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
OLIVIA=>We've worked hard for this, and we need to celebrate properly.
OLIVIA=>What's wrong?
ANGIER=>The trick isn't good enough.
OLIVIA=>Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER=>No.
OLIVIA=>Well, they loved it.
ANGIER=>It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA=>Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-
ANGIER=>He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.
ANGIER=>I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA=>Why?
ANGIER=>So that I can do it better. Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
ANGIER=>I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA=>Work for him? Are you joking
ANGIER=>You'll be my spy.
ANGIER=>It's how we advance. Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
ANGIER=>Think of it, Olivia... we've got people excited about Cutter's version of the trick- imagine what we could do with the real illusion. We'll have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
ANGIER=>Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.
OLIVIA=>Why would he trust me? Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
ANGIER=>Because you're going to tell him the truth.
TESLA=>You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
TESLA=>Fitting that you should be here for the maiden voyage.
TESLA=>Your hat.
ALLEY=>You might want to stand back.
TESLA=>No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed.
ANGIER=>I don't understand-
ALLEY=>Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week?
BORDEN=>We make do.
OLIVIA=>My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN=>I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
OLIVIA=>No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.
BORDEN=>And what might that be?
OLIVIA=>Me.
OLIVIA=>I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there.
OLIVIA=>I know you have no reason to trust
BORDEN=>Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.
OLIVIA=>Mr.Borden-
BORDEN=>Alfred.
OLIVIA=>Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.
BORDEN=>Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA=>I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.
BORDEN=>What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
BORDEN=>Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA=>No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN=>He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN=>And this is the truth?
ROOT=>No.
ROOT=>We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
ANGIER=>We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:
ANGIER=>He'll be perfoming right across the street.
ANGIER=>Don't tell me he fell over again.
ANGIER=>He's blackmailing us?
ANGIER=>How much does he want?
ANGIER=>What's the point?
ANGIER=>Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out.
ANGIER=>Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.
ANGIER=>We paid him enough to keep him in beer- you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat. Today I learned Borden's view on the episode...
ANGIER=>...and his account suggests a reason.
ROOT=>To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN=>You are the Great Danton, aren't you?
ROOT=>Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans. And who might you be?
BORDEN=>Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.
ROOT=>Ah, very good. Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
BORDEN=>Another?
ROOT=>If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.
BORDEN=>You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT=>Bloody good idea.
BORDEN=>Have it.
ROOT=>Thanks. A new pint arrives. Root sips.
BORDEN=>Actually, there's something I might warn you about.
ROOT=>Oh?
BORDEN=>Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,
WHISPERING)=>...a double.
ROOT=>Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN=>At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me.
ROOT=>Complete power, you say?
ROOT=>Thanks for the warning.
ANGIER=>...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
BORDEN=>Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!
BORDEN=>Pardon my intrusion!
ANGIER=>Well, he did.
ANGIER=>No. I don't.
ANGIER=>He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.
SCALPER=>Need tickets, sir?
ANGIER=>You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA=>I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said "afternoon".
ANGIER=>Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days...
ANGIER=>He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you.
OLIVIA=>What do you mean? You sent me to-
ANGIER=>I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
OLIVIA=>That's my job-!
ANGIER=>Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA=>You abandoned me to him!
OLIVIA=>I did everything you asked.
OLIVIA=>Cutter was right- it's a double.
ANGIER=>Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA=>He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage.
OLIVIA=>All the time? He doesn't know when
ANGIER=>All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?!
OLIVIA=>You thing you can see everything, don't you?
OLIVIA=>But the Great Danton, is a blind fool.
OLIVIA=>His notebook.
ANGIER=>You stole it?
OLIVIA=>I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-
ANGIER=>I can't.
ANGIER=>Olivia, no one could-
OLIVIA=>And without the keyword?
ANGIER=>Perhaps never. We'll see.
OLIVIA=>No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it.
ANGIER=>You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands.
OLIVIA=>He knows where I live!
ANGIER=>I need to know his method.
ANGIER=>I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!
ANGIER=>Look, I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in-
OLIVIA=>He'll know it was you-
ANGIER=>Yes, me, not you. Understand?
OLIVIA=>Robert? I have fallen in love with him. Angier looks at her, sympathetic.
ANGIER=>Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.
BORDEN=>Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary.
BORDEN=>Then he's just getting started.
BORDEN=>I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned.
BORDEN=>Let him come. I don't care. Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street. Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and pulls out a PISTOL. He checks that it's loaded and slips it into his own jacket. Then he sets off after Borden.
BORDEN=>I'm impressed.
ANGIER=>Why's that?
BORDEN=>You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
ANGIER=>The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want.
BORDEN=>Which is?
ANGIER=>Your secret.
BORDEN=>My secret?
ANGIER=>Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all.
ANGIER=>Useless without the keyword.
ANGIER=>Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full.
ANGIER=>I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook.
BORDEN=>The keyword is the method.
BORDEN=>Where is my ingeneur?
ANGIER=>How fast can you gid?
ANGIER=>How's the arm?
ANGIER=>Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this.
ANGIER=>Well, let's find out, shall we?
ANGIER=>Then the rest is up to me.
SARAH=>I didn't know we'd be joined for dinner.
BORDEN=>Absolutely. We're celebrating.
SARAH=>Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
BORDEN=>Champagne. Your finest
SARAH=>What are we celebrating, dear?
BORDEN=>Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA=>What trick, Freddy?
BORDEN=>Who are you to tell me what?!
SARAH=>Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore. I see no reason for the two of you to suffer as well.
OLIVIA=>Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy.
SARAH=>"Freddy"?
BORDEN=>It's my name.
SARAH=>Not at home.
BORDEN=>I'm not always at home.
SARAH=>Alfred, why are you being like this?
BORDEN=>Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me.
SARAH=>What?
SARAH=>I see. More secrets.
BORDEN=>Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life.
SARAH=>When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that.
ANGIER=>I thought I had the place to myself.
MANAGER=>Unexpected guests. Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government.
ANGIER=>No?
BORDEN=>Today, a most curious development...
BORDEN=>His assistent come to us with a proposition...
BORDEN=>Obviously Angier has sent her, and told her to admit as much...
BORDEN=>Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA=>No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN=>He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN=>This is the "truth" you spoke of?
OLIVIA=>No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat.
OLIVIA=>The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. I hate him for that. They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
BORDEN=>I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised.
OLIVIA=>You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand.
OLIVIA=>You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
OLIVIA=>Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes.
BORDEN=>I think she is telling the truth.
BORDEN=>I think we cannot trust her. But I love her. I need her. We need her.
BORDEN=>How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb. She smiles quietly at this.
OLIVIA=>Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this.
BORDEN=>Trust is not the point- love is the point... who have we ever trusted? To open myself to such a relationship,
BORDEN=>...to the dangers of such an affair... I need assurances of fidelity. Of love. Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance.
BORDEN=>But how to be sure when truth is layered like the skin of an onion? I know a way... she must help me rid ourselves of Angier. It is the only way to kow her mind.
BORDEN=>Today my mistress proves her truthfulness. Not to me, you understand.
BORDEN=>I have been convinced since she led me to Root... today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier.
BORDEN=>Yes, Angier. She gave you this noteboook at my request. Yes, she led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is merely the key to my dairy, not to my trick. Did you really think I would part with my secret so easily after so much? Good-bye, Angier, may you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in yout American home.
ANGIER=>I've veen played for a fool!
ALLEY=>Who by?
ANGIER=>Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
ALLEY=>We never said he had.
ANGIER=>You let me believe that he had, Alley!
ANGIER=>You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men-
ALLEY=>Where?
ANGIER=>In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-
TESLA=>That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
TESLA=>It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money...
ALLEY=>Sir, my cat?
ALLEY=>When I told you I could make your machine I spoke the simple truth. Science is just a name for the art of rendering the exotic mundane. It has no boundaries- its very purpose is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER=>Then why isn't the machine working?
TESLA=>Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination.
ANGIER=>Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY=>Nowhere.
ALLEY=>We've tried the damn thing a dozen times. And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA=>Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result. Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
TESLA=>You don't expect me to handle the thing myself? Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
ALLEY=>You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor. Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the generator. The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES. Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then sputters out. Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit. Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there, still tied to the hook. Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car. Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
ANGIER=>I'll go. Angier limps after the cat.
ANGIER=>Here, kitty, kitty.
ANGIER=>So the machine was working?
ALLEY=>I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved.
TESLA=>These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science.
TESLA=>We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
OUT THE-=>-problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready.
TESLA=>Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
ANGIER=>Which one is mine?
TESLA=>They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him.
JESS=>Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN=>Daddy's got some business this afternoon.
JESS=>But you promised.
BORDEN=>Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly.
BORDEN=>Then go to the zoo we shall. Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.
BORDEN=>Who's that? A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The Professor- England's premiere magician!
JESS=>That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands.
BORDEN=>Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready.
SARAH=>We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
BORDEN=>Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated.
SARAH=>You mean it today.
BORDEN=>Absolutely.
SARAH=>That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves.
BORDEN=>More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper.
BORDEN=>The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon,
PLEADING)=>Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please.
OLIVIA=>What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN=>Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong.
OLIVIA=>Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong.
BORDEN=>I'm trying, Olivia. Please.
OLIVIA=>I'll get dressed.
OLIVIA=>I saw Fallon hanging around my house again, after you left.
OLIVIA=>There's something about him I don't trust.
BORDEN=>You trust me? Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.
MANAGER=>We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.
MANAGER=>We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well. He was very good to Colorado Springs. A very generous man.
MANAGER=>Mr. Angier?
ANGIER=>What box?
MANAGER=>We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame.
TESLA=>My dear Angier, you will find what you were looking for in the box. I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye...
TESLA=>But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.
TESLA=>The extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll have more luck in your field, mystified. As to the use of the machine...
TESLA=>Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine-
TESLA=>-Destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.
TESLA=>Such thing will only bring you misery.
ANGIER=>Tesla's warning is as unheard as he knew it would be. Today I tested the machine...
ANGIER=>Taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation...
ANGIER=>...if it went wrong I would not want to live like that for long...
ANGIER=>But here, at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden...
ANGIER=>Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder.
OWENS=>Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN=>Angier's journal, the "gesture of good faith"? It's a fake.
BORDEN=>It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.
OWENS=>Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. What makes you think it's a fake?
BORDEN=>It doesn't matter.
BORDEN=>My tricks. All of them.
OWENS=>Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN=>No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.
OWENS=>Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless.
BORDEN=>You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.
BORDEN=>I want to say goodbye.
BORDEN=>Stop it! Just stop it!
SARAH=>Deny it all you want- I know!
BORDEN=>Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH=>I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred!
SARAH=>I'll do what I have to!
BORDEN=>Sarah, you can't talk like this!
SARAH=>I can't live like this!
SARAH=>Do you love me? Borden looks into her eyes. Sincere.
BORDEN=>Not today. Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless.
GENTLE CREAKING...=>PULL BACK past a hanging PAIR OF FEET, one shoe missing... wider shows up that it is SARAH, HANGING BY HER NECK FROM A BEAM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP. Gently swinging.
WHO'S THERE=>Cutter turns. A STAGEHAND. His eyes are solid white. The man is clearly BLIND.
ANGIER=>I heard about a booking... Cutter turns. Angier is behind him, leaning on his cane. Beside Angier is a SECOND BLIND STAGEHAND.
ANGIER=>Nice little theatre. Good up-and- coming magician.
ANGIER=>It's a good to see you, John. Cutter sizes Angier up. Looks around the theatre.
ANGIER=>I need your help, John. My last show. A limited engagement.
ANGIER=>A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. One thing left... The real Transported Man.
ANGIER=>i don't want you backstage, I need you front of house, managing.
ANGIER=>i need you calling in any favours and connections you have left to get us the right booking for the run.
ANGIER=>The sort that Borden can't ignore. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods.
DRIVER=>This is the address, sir.
ACKERMAN=>When you said you only wanted to show me one trick it piqued my interest.
ANGIER=>Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN=>Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?
ACKERMAN=>Very pretty.
ACKERMAN=>That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears? That's not a trick. He has to come back. There has to be a-
VOICE=>-a Prestige?
ACKERMAN=>Pardon me. It's very rare to see... real magic. it's been many years since I've seen...
ANGIER=>Are you interested in helping us?
ACKERMAN=>I have an act for your venue.
ACKERMAN=>Get rid of them. This is a magical act. An excellent one. I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago. The Great Danton.
MERRIT=>You really want me to- Ackerman stands.
MERRIT=>I'll do it. Of course. Ackerman picks up a pen and paper from Merrit's desk.
OLIVIA=>You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once.
BORDEN=>Who?
OLIVIA=>Don't be cruel.
BORDEN=>Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA=>Because she was part of your life and now she's gone.
OLIVIA=>She wanted to meet me the day before she killed herself. Said she had something to tell me about you.
BORDEN=>Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters.
OLIVIA=>You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold.
OLIVIA=>By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? The Great Danton.
BORDEN=>He's back?
OLIVIA=>After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen.
OLIVIA=>If you could see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him- you deserve each other. Olivia smiles at him and leaves.
ANGIER=>Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved.
ANGIER=>In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities. The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience. Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps into the machine. The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs. Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but, just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S
ANGIER=>Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION! The audience breaks into a MASSIVE STANDING OVATION.
BORDEN=>Why only 100 performances? Do his methods dictate it, or is it simply a publicity move? Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.
BORDEN=>Fifty yards in a second. And all I know is that he uses a trapdoor. What's going on under that stage?
BLIND STAGEHAND=>What do you want?
ANGIER=>You found him.
ANGIER=>I told you, John- I don't want you backstage on this one.
ANGIER=>Disposing of the Prestige materials.
ANGIER=>Do you really want to know? Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.
BORDEN=>They do this every night. After each performance? Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to a POSTER on the wall- "The Great Danton Perform THE REAL
BORDEN=>We're done. Let him have this trick. You're not to go back there. I don't need to know his secret. Leave him alone. Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.
BORDEN.=>A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed. Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down towards the stage... On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage. Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
STAGEHAND=>Where'd you think you're going?
BORDEN=>I'm part of the act, you fool!
JUDGE=>Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier...
JUDGE=>You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
OWENS=>Mr.Cutter?
OWENS=>Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-
OWENS=>You wnat to buy it instead.
OWENS=>This is the machine?
OWENS=>Out of the question, I'm afraid.
OWENS=>of course, I suppose... if, in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross... I can't stop you from speaking your mind.
BORDEN=>For now.
SULLEN=>Got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With a little girl.
BORDEN=>Jess, how are you?
BORDEN=>Are you alright?
BORDEN=>I've missed you. Fallon's missed you. We both have.
JESS=>Can I come in there, Daddy?
BORDEN=>Everything's going to be okay. It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER. He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow-
BORDEN=>You must be Lord- -who is ROBERT ANGIER. Risen from the dead.
BORDEN=>I saw you die. Angier just SMILES.
ANGIER=>They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball? Borden says nothing.
ANGIER=>All I wanted to do was prove that I was the better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone.
BORDEN=>You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at his
JESS)=>Not anymore.
ANGIER=>No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN=>You win. But don't take my little girl... Angier looks at Borden. Bitter
ANGIER=>I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away, don't I
ANGIER=>Borden? But you can't take her with you know, can you? She'll be looked after. Good-bye, Professor.
BORDEN=>Wait. Don't you want this? You paid for it.
ANGIER=>Your secret.
ANGIER=>You always were the better magician, Borden. We both know that. HE TEARS the envelope in half. Then again. And again...
ANGIER=>But whatever your secret was, you'll have to agree-
BORDEN=>Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.
JESS=>When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN=>Soon. I promise. Soon.
ANGIER=>For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN=>Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.
BORDEN=>I promise.
BORDEN=>You think this place can hold me, Angier?
BORDEN=>Angier!
HOUSEKEEPER=>Come here, love.
CAPTAIN=>Dead God.
ANGIER=>Hello, Cutter.
ANGIER=>I magician never reveals his secrets.
HOUSEKEEPER=>Go on, child.
ANGIER=>Good night, Jess.
ANGIER=>She needs looking after-
ANGIER=>You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again.
ANGIER=>My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials.
BORDEN=>We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you.
BORDEN=>You were right. I should've left him to his damned trick... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for so many things. For Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.
BORDEN=>Don't cry. Not for me. Go live your life in full. For both of us.
WORKMAN=>Where do you want it?
ANGIER=>Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's going to use the place. I own it.
ANGIER=>It's a good thing I retired early then. Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate and the two men heft ir off the platform.
ANGIER=>We'll put it down the end. Angier and Cutter move into the darkness with the crate. From the small pool of light afforded by the lattern, we can see that they are navigating their way through a large space filled with LARGE GLASS BOXES. They arrive at the end and set the crate down.
ANGIER=>Cutter, I tried not to involve you. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods. Then disappears into darkness.
WARDEN=>Alfred borden, on this day, in the name of the King and the high court of England, you will meet your end. Do you have anything to say for yourself. Borden saus nothing. The Warden gestures to the HANGMAn who begins to PULL the lever.
ANGIER=>A brother. A Twin.
ANGIER=>You were Fallon. The whole time... Fallon/Borden's face disappears as Cutter seals his coffin.
BORDEN=>We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.
ANGIER=>Were you the one who went into the
ANGIER=>-or the one who come back out?
BORDEN=>We took turns. The trick is where we would swap...
ANGIER=>Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple. Too easy.
BORDEN=>Simple, maybe. But not easy.
BORDEN=>Nothing easy about two men sharing one life. The second brother SWIGS from a gin bottle, then BITES down a padded stick as the first brother BRINGS DOWN THE HAMMER-
ANGIER=>What about Olivia? And your wife?
BORDEN=>We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them. Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes.
BORDEN=>Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick. Borden looks down at Angier with contempt.
BORDEN=>But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Angier is dying. He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him.
BORDEN=>It takes nothing to steal someone else's work.
ANGIER=>It takes everything.
VOICE=>Yes it did.
ANGIER=>It took courage to climb into that machine every night...
ANGIER=>Not knowing if I'd be the Prestige....
ANGIER=>Or the man in the box...
ANGIER=>Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this?
ANGIER=>It was the look on their faced.
