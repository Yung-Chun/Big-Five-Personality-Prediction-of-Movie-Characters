KWAN=>At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
YOUNG ADULT=>I guess not...
ANGLE ON KWAN=>As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and rearranges her hands.
KWAN=>Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger! He moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
STUDENT=>Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee...
KWAN=>Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de! This last he says looking at the empty door. MOTHER
KWAN=>Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the T'ang emporer. He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering his students around him.
KWAN=>Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez. During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky ... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.=>The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the spooky light, and , we see DREW
ANGLE ON KWAN=>Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW=>As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV. Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling . Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV screen.
DREW=>Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling the already hard wax off his chest.
DREW=>Practicing. I saw it in this movie... Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of him. KWAN
DREW=>I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right?
KWAN=>Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we had tapes, we would have watched them. Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.
KWAN=>"The warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win 100 times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you. All these years of one on one training ­ you're the best I've ever taught.
DREW=>Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I? BOB
DREW=>I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off. It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension in the room, and starts to say something. BOB
REACTION SHOT OF KWAN=>Closing his already opened mouth.
BOB=>You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!
DREW=>When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going to let you be part of my entourage...
KWAN=>I wish I had the chance...

ANGLE ON TEAM=>who are cheering Trevor on.
ANGLE ON TREVOR=>As he plays with the next fighter.
PFEELGUT=>Exactly! Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. As the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose and they start to fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and Trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group.
ANGLE ON PFEELGUT=>Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor. PFEELGUT
GET HIM! NOW!!=>Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up. ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off. INT. TREVOR HOUSE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure.

TREVOR=>Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't know... KIM
CHAUNCY=>Very good, sir.
TREVOR=>Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam. The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly.

DREW AGAIN=>Winning. The stage is set for the finals.
ANGLE ON THE RING=>Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish mosh of gear , while Trevor is decked out in designer, personalized gear.
KWAN=>You only lose if you give up.
ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER=>The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back on his padded stool, smiling. The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew, making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring
DREW=>No next time, Master. Maybe... ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it ­ I'm not getting any better!
KWAN=>Don't talk like that. At Shaolin... He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character.
KWAN=>The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed then and there to become like him, fight for right like the Shaolin. He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why he is telling him this story.
KWAN=>I never did, though. My family left China and ended up here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in
DREW=>You mean... all the stories...?
KWAN=>Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other people.
DREW=>Why are you telling me this? KWAN
DREW=>Never were?
KWAN=>No. Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.
KWAN=>What? DREW
DREW=>I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I will never lose like that again. Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's eyes.
KWAN=>He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold cloth. He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.
DREW=>Master...

DREW=>The Shaolin Temple? How hard can that be? Geez, doesn't anyone speak English here?
ANGLE ON ASHEMA=>As she pushes her way to the front of the group. She is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
ASHEMA=>I do. But wouldn't it make more sense for you to speak Chinese than to expect us to speak English?
ASHEMA=>Why do you want to find the temple?
DREW=>I am going to join the temple as a monk. Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts at martial arts movements.
ASHEMA=>I'm going that way ­ I can take you.
ASHEMA=>We are here. DREW STOPS THE BIKE AND LOOKS BACK AT HER. ASHEMA GESTURES TO THE TEMPLE FRONT, AND DREW TURNS IN AWE. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE TEMPLE. This is it ­ the temple he came halfway around the world to see. The Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts.
DREW=>Whoa! Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at his awe-struck face.
DREW=>What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple? Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you? Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter? He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed. He walks back into the chanting chamber. INT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more, moving with the beat, until they stop chanting. Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.
ADMISSIONS MONK=>That's not possible.
DREW=>What do you mean, sir?
ADMISSIONS MONK=>The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is no foreigners.
DREW=>I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.
ADMISSIONS MONK=>What people want and what they can have are often not the same.
DREW=>Not in this case.
MONK=>Oh, yes, especially in this case. DREW
DREW=>Hey! What about my...
ASHEMA=>You've had enough.
ASHEMA=>Maybe it's for the best, Drew. You belong in America. New
DREW=>I have to do this. I can't go home, not until I'm a monk. I'd be even more of a disgrace... The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in Chinese, motioning towards Drew.
ASHEMA=>Not now, Bau Bau.
DREW=>Bau Bau? ASHEMA
DREW=>How long?
ASHEMA=>A long time ­ through the worst weather. He just sat there, unmoving, through rain, sleet, snow.
DREW=>Did they let him in?
ASHEMA=>No. Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my
DREW=>Please tell your grandfather, your Bau Bau, he is a wise man. And that he tells a good story. The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.
ASHEMA=>What are you going to do? Are you going home? Drew shakes his head.
ASHEMA=>Give this up, Drew! Please?

SAN DE=>My head is shiny enough already, don't you think? Drew, in shock at his ability to speak English, sputters
DREW=>You... You speak English? I'm sorry, I was just goofing... I apologize, master. I didn't mean to make fun of you... San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted.
DREW=>It was at first. I was uncomfortable, in pain, actually, but as time went on, I got... into it, I guess. The sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what I mean?
DREW=>At first I was really bored, and very lonely. But then,
DREW=>It was an incredible experience ­ I said I'd do it, and I did it. San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.
SAN DE=>I wish you all the best. DREW
ASHEMA=>They are disciples. This is the last class for fighting monks at Shaolin. Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the temple doors. The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go through. The temple doors close.

DREW=>Yes, without pause. The Drill Sergeant nods his head. MONK
DREW=>Yes, without pause.
DREW=>I mean, no, of course not. Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again.
GAO=>Shut up!
DREW=>Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...
SAN DE=>Are they ready to begin their training?
DRILL SERGEANT=>They are. SAN DE
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES=>All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring at Drew. Drew, notices the stare.

THE COURTYARD.=>They are running their hands over their heads. Drew comes out of the building, his head shaved completely clean.
DREW=>What outside world? I don't want to be seen by anybody... He rubs his hand over his head, and then sees the others. Li is smiling.
D.S.=>We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk. GAO
LI=>I will switch with Disciple Gao.
D.S.=>Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training tomorrow. Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very secretively since the D.S. is watching.
DREW=>Jerk! Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling. DREW

ANGLE ON DREW=>As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it. As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as

The D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to himself.

Drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.

SAN DE=>I think I'd better...
DREW=>No, really, I want to... San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.
SAN DE=>Here at the temple, we use a period of intense physical labor to test your patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance. As you continue training, you will be given chores every day ­ remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping? Physical labor keeps us humble.
DREW=>Gentlemen, this calls for a party! He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll. Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad. The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic. Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines . Everyone is having a great time.

DREW=>Let's do it.
D.S.=>Attack me straight on... Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.
DREW=>I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.
D.S.=>I said that's enough.
DREW=>If you're getting too old for this kind of training, I understand.
D.S.=>Attack!
DREW=>I think I've got it now. Xie Xie! The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to Drew, who is still lying on the ground.

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.=>It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.
D.S.=>Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try to hold your stance. Li, you're first. Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes behind the thundering water. He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance. He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.
D.S.=>In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest lightly, and your partner tries to block. The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls back to the ground. The D.S. is there immediately.
D.S.=>Something wrong?
MONK=>Then do it that way... The Monk walks away, shaking his head.
DREW=>This sure beats sweeping...
ANGLE ON FRISBEE=>Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely missing them. Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center, right in the face. The statue starts to tip! Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips over and smashes on the ground. They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S. coming towards them. Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.
ANGLE ON DREW=>Who begins to sweep.
DREW=>The crowd is going wild. Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into Drew's unprotected stomach! Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee, and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach. Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor.
SAN DE=>Come with me...
SAN DE=>Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction we all have to fight against. San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.
SAN DE=>When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the ground. From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even the leaves look like eyelids. San De shows Drew a tea leaf.
DREW=>Master! Stop! No more will go in!
SAN DE=>Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first empty your cup? He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now pours into the empty cup.

ANGLE ON SAN DE=>Who nods his head and looks at Drew. SAN DE
GAO=>Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...
SAN DE=>I didn't think you were... The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other. Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger. Shake hands and let your emotions go.
GAO=>In your dreams... INT. DORM ROOM ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES GETTING READY TO GO OUT. They are dressed in "street" clothes and are just pulling on their hats. Drew, instead of wearing his temple-issue hat, pulls on a New York Yankees baseball cap!

DREW=>This is Gao. And this wild man is Li... Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired off, he motions to Ashema.
DREW=>Not now, Li... The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.
DREW=>What can I do for you? TOUGH
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES.=>They have noticed what is going on.

ANGLE ON DREW=>Who is staring down into the abyss. SAN DE
POLICE CAPTAIN=>This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight, where he will be held until he leaves the country. San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.
D.S.=>Master, may I? We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure. Can we do that?
D.S.=>Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from that which he so desperately needs? She is about to speak, but thinks better of it. San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.
SAN DE=>Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight
POLICE CAPTAIN=>I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
SAN DE=>You will not have to. The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes back to face Drew.
DREW=>Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen again.
GAO=>Why only you?
LI=>The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for what happens.
WU=>It's not fair.
DREW=>It doesn't have to be fair... DISSOLVE TO: ANGLE ON DREW LYING IN THE DARK Everyone else is asleep, but not Drew. He is staring at the ceiling.

SAN DE=>Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear failure.
GAO=>Are you staying?
DREW=>Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of trouble! They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell. Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound. LI
DREW=>What? Honest, it's happening! I...
GAO=>Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential is singled out for special training. We were wondering who it was... now, we know.
DREW=>Special training? You mean...?
ASHEMA=>Are they making you do this? She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to hear it.
DREW=>No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry... He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last long look at Ashema, walks away. EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY 103

ANGLE ON SAN DE=>Who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional receiver. He holds the ball and looks right at Drew, a very stern look on his face. ANGLE ON DREW

DREW=>I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please. Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but they land about 5 feet away from the lake edge. DREW
ANGLE ON DREW=>Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him. He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.
DREW=>Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream come true, I can't! He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.
DREW=>Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with you.

DREW=>Is this rope strong enough for both of us? No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go quicker. DREW
ANGLE ON THE MAN=>Screaming for help.
DREW=>Hold on... Drew hears the headmaster's voice.
SAN DE=>The scroll that is in this box is more precious than life. Guard it well. He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.

DREW=>Maybe he won't miss one little scroll... He shakes his head and starts for the front door.
DREW=>Master! I apologize, I did not see you. The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll. Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.
DREW=>I failed, Master. A person was in danger... The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.
DREW=>What is the meaning of life?
ARHAT=>What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat. He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.

SAN DE=>Your request is granted.

He turns to look at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes through. INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER. Drew pauses for a moment, examining the room. It is filled with wooden statues of monks, all in different fighting positions. The carvings are precise and incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open hands, fists and legs are fashioned out of hard wood, and they look very dangerous indeed.
DREW=>I can't do it. FLASHBACK TO D.S.
D.S.=>There is no can't, only won't. FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS
ANGLE ON DREW=>Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing it out in a breathing exercise.
DREW=>I am a Shaolin monk. He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. Drew, however, is prepared .

SAN DE=>Before you leave for American, can you help at an international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over the world ­ I'd like you to be there.
DREW=>No problem. Without pause.
SAN DE=>Now, a friend would like to see you.
DREW=>Did you think he would get into the finals?
SAN DE=>Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western countries, which is why I wanted you here.
DREW=>I'll help any way I can.
ANGLE ON THE CROWD=>As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of people, comes clear... it is Trevor!
TREVOR=>He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew. If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after this fight, 'Kay? He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her rear end.
TREVOR=>Wish me luck, huh? He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after
ANGLE ON THE RING=>As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins. It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter. Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool. INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his humiliation. ANGLE ON TREVOR
TREVOR=>I want the American Shaolin! ANGLE ON DREW
ANGLE ON TREVOR=>Pointing and yelling for Drew. ANGLE ON DREW
DREW=>I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again.
TREVOR=>So, let's see what you've learned.
DREW=>I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you.
ANGLE ON TREVOR=>Who is seething.
ANGLE ON DREW=>His face calm.
DREW=>No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego.
SAN DE=>You have learned much.
ANGLE ON TREVOR=>TREVOR
GAO=>Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of the temple. San De looks at Drew long and hard.
SAN DE=>There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
ANGLE ON DREW=>Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to smile slowly.
SAN DE=>It's your call. Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still standing, trying to get someone to fight him. Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and Li and together they high-five.
DREW=>For the temple... Drew climbs into the ring.
TREVOR=>Remember last time, punk?
DREW=>Nothing exists but the moment, and...
TREVOR=>Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight! And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry. Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this quickly. He goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that Trevor is completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will, and soon has Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of high kicks, takedowns, flips and punches. Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even bothering to defend himself. Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old- fashioned roundhouse punch.
ANGLE ON SAN DE=>Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace. They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest of his life shining in the b.g.
ANGLE ON ASHEMA=>Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the Great Wall.
