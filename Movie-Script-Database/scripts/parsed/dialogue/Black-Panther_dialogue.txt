SON=>Baba?
FATHER=>Yes, my son?
SON=>Tell me a story .
FATHER=>Which one?
SON=>The story of home . A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off in the distance.
FATHER=>Millions of years ago , a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it.
FATHER=>And when the time of man came , five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength , speed, and instincts.
FATHER=>The warrior became King and the first Black Panther , the protector of Wakanda .
FATHER=>Four tribes agreed to live under the King's rule , but the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains.
FATHER=>The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation , but as Wakanda thrived the world around it descended further into chaos.
FATHER=>To keep vibranium safe , the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight, keeping the truth of their power from the outside world.
SON=>And we still hide Baba?
FATHER=>Yes .
SON=>Why?
N'JOBU=>Hey look , if we get in and out quick won't be any worries . You in the van come in through from the west , come around the corner, land right here. Me and the twins pulling up right here , we leavin' this car behind , ok? We corning ...
N'JOBU=>Hide the straps.
JAMES=>Is it the Feds?
N'JOBU=>No.
JAMES=>It's two Grace Jones looking chicks .. they're holding spears . . .
N'JOBU=>Open it.
JAMES=>You serious?
N'JOBU=>They won't knock again .
N'JOBU=>Prince N'Jobu , son of Azzuri .
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>Leave us .
N'JOBU=>This is James . I trust him with my life . He stays , with your permission , King T'Chaka .
N'JOBU=>Glory to Bast . I am in good health. How is home? Young T'Chaka's mood darkens.
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>Not so good , baby brother. There has been an attack. Then , Young T'Chaka activates a simple looking beaded bracelet, KIMOYO BEADS that , project a hologram image of
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>This man , Ulysses Klaue , stole a quarter ton of vibraniurn from us and triggered a bomb at the border to escape . Many lives were lost . He knew where we hid the vibranium, and how to strike . N'Jobu takes the news in .
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>He had someone on the inside. Young T'Chaka waits for N' Jobu to come clean of the crime . He doesn't .
N'JOBU=>Why are you here?
YOUNGT'CHAKA=>Because I want you look me in the eyes and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda .
N' JOBU=>I did no such thing . Young T'Chaka snaps a look to James .
JAMES=>Zuri, Son of Badu .
N'JOBU=>What?
N'JOBU=>James, James you lied to me? I invite you into my home and you were Wakandan this whole time?
JAMES=>You betrayed Wakanda!
N'JOBU=>How could you lie to me like -
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here? Zuri walks to the wall and removes a duffle bag containing VIBRANIUMCANISTERS glowing blue . He shows one to Young
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>Prince N'Jobu, you will return home at once, where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes .
BBC ANCHOR=>The tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch , King T'Chaka. The beloved ruler was one of many confirmed dead after a terrorist attack at the United Nations a week ago . The Suspect has since been apprehended .
BBC ANCHOR=>Though it remains one of the poorest countries in the world, fortified by mountain ranges and an impenetrable rain forest, Wakanda does not engage in international trade or accept aid . The succession of the throne is expected to fall to the oldest of the King's two children , Prince T'Challa . Piloting the craft while seated in lotus position is OKOYE
OKOYE=>My Prince , coming up on them now.
AN=>sinister serpent through the surrounding wilderness. We pull back into the sky revealing the tip of a futuristic looking aircraft. This is the ROYALTALONFIGHTER .
T'CHALLA=>No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone . Okoye pauses, then returns her spear to the wall . T'Challa closes the model and steps to a marked circle in the floor.
OKOYE=>Just don't freeze when you see her .
T'CHALLA=>What are you talking about? I never freeze.
MILITANT LEADER=>Defense position ! The militant leader slips down a Night Vision MONOCULAR as the other MILITANTS echo the call and begin to fall in line .
DRESSED IN=>hijab sit, waiting. A CARGOTRUCKMILITANT sits amongst the women, RIFLE in hand, next to a YOUNGMILITANT, a child soldier no older than twelve. We find a WOMAN sitting in the back corner , her eyes observing the militants intensely. This is NAKIA . The CARGOTRUCKMILITANT stands up and cocks his rifle .
CARGOTRUCKMILITANT=>No games .
FROMTHE ROAD=>We hear a faint struggle, then a MILITANT'S BODYis hurled into the side of the pickup truck as the other militants look on in horror ! The . SO CAL GUNNERand all of the other men in the convoy BLINDLY OPEN FIRE into the trees .
ON PANTHER=>In a moment of desperation , the Young Militant rushes out , firing at Panther to no effect. Then , as Panther walks towards him, Nakia dives out , kicking the young militant's gun from his hand and grabs him in a neck-lock. Swinging around , Nakia kicks Panther in the chest, stopping his momentum. Caught off guard, Panther freezes .
NAKIA=>This one is just a boy . .. he got kidnapped as well. Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face , exposing his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well. Panther stares at her- for a beat too long ...
T'CHALLA=>Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...
OKOYE=>You froze . T'Challa removes his helmet , facing Nakia.
NAKIA=>Why are you here? Eesh, you ruined my mission !
T'CHALLA=>My father is dead , Nakia. The news devastates her .
NAKIA=>Carry yourselves home now , and take the boy . Get him to his people . The Nigerian Woman nods .
NIGERIAN WOMAN=>Thank you .
OKOYE=>You will speak nothing of this day . T 'Challa loo k s at the Young Militant for a beat before he , Nakia and Okoye disappear through the trees . The Nigerian Women and the Young Militant look up at the sky as the RTF takes off .
BORDER- BREAKINGDAWN=>The RTF comes out of stealth mode and becomes visible as it glides over a mountain range .
OKOYE=>Sister Nakia ... My Prince. We are home . Nakia approaches the front of the craft with T ' Challa. They loo k out .
T'CHALLA=>This never gets old .
NAKIA=>Queen Mother . . . Princess . My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA=>Thank you , Nakia. It is so good to have you back with us . Nakia nods.
AYO=>Yes, general . Ayo nods and walks off with Nakia while Shuri watches closely .
SHUR!=>Did he freeze?
OKOYE=>Like an antelope in headlights. Shuri laughs at this .
T' CHALLA=>Are you finished? Okoye slams her spear into the ground , signaling the rest of the Dora to follow her off . T'Challa turns to Shuri .
T'CHALLA=>So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day .
SHUR!=>You wish . I'm here for the EMP beads, I've developed an update.
T'CHALLA=>Update? No, it worked perfectly .
SHUR!=>How many times to I have to teach you, just because something works , doesn't mean that it cannot be improved .
T'CHALLA=>I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off .
RAMONDA=>Shuri! T'Challa smiles at this .
SHUR!=>Sorry mother . Ramonda turns to T'Challa .
T'CHALLA=>How are you feeling today, mama?
RAMONDA=>Proud ... your father and I would talk about this day all the time . He is with us , and it is your time to be King .
LATER=>We see a black man in high-end street wear , around 30 years old . A RING hangs on a gold chain around his neck . This is
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>Good morning ! How can I help you?
KILLMONGER=>I was just checking out these artifacts . They tell me you're the expert .
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>You could say that.
KILLMONGER=>They're beautiful . Killmonger points at one of the masks .
KILLMONGER=>Where's this one from?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>From the Bobo Ashanti Tribe , prese nt da y Ghana . 19th Century .
KILLMON GER=>For real? What about this one?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>That one's from the Edo people of Benin . 16th Century .
KILLMONGER=>Now, tell me about this one . Killmonger points to a MINING TOOL off to the side.
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>Also from Benin . 7th Century. Fula tribe I believe .
KILLMONGER=>Nah.
KILLMONGER=>It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it's from Wakanda and it's made out of vibranium . Don't trip, I'mma take it off your hands for you. She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy .
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>These items aren't for sale.
KILLMONGER=>How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it like they took everything else .
MUSEUM DIRECTOR=>Sir , I'm going to have to ask you to leave . The Museum Director subtly looks back at the security guards , then makes a face and touches her stomach -- indigestion . Killmonger smiles and leans over, whispering in her ear .
KILLMONGER=>You got all this security watching me ever since I walked in. But , you ain't checking for what you put in your body . The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a security guard walks up behind him .
SECURITY GUARD=>Alright, mate. Let's have it . Come on , mate.
KILLMONGER=>I think she might not be feelin' too good .
KILLMONGER=>Hey! Hey somebody get some help ! Come here! Call a doctor, please! Hey please, somebody come help ! The security guards quickly rush to the museum director's aid .
LINDA=>I'm gonna take a break. Preoccupied with the commotion, her co-worker nods and Linda walks out .
KLAUE=>Let's give the lady some space please .
LIMBANI=>Step back please, gents , step back please . Museum-goers quickly bee l ine for the exit as Klaue approaches the guards.
KLAUE=>Hey come here. Come here! It ' s ok. You can go , but just don't tell anyone , alright? The SECURITY GUARDlooks back at him unsure, then takes off . Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back . Killmonger looks on at him confused .
KILLMONGER=>Bro, why you 'aint just shoot h im right here?
KLAUE=>Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out . . . makes us look like amateurs . The LENS on a surveillance camera at the corner of the room looks on.
KLAUE=>Now... let's see if you know what you're talking about .. . Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand .
KLAUE=>That's just a taste . Klaue picks up the MINING HAMMER studying , it . The tool doesn't look like anything special . Klaue ' s hand SIZZLES BLUE and centuries of MUCKand GRUNGE drop off the hammer revealing that it's pure vibraniurn . Klaue smells it , and smiles.
KLAUE=>Whoo .. You 'r e gonna be rich , boy .
KILLMON GER=>You better sel l that quick .
KLAUE=>Oh it's already sold . Klaue waves Lirnbani over with the stretcher to load the hammer inside . He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLEoff the tool , taking only the vibranium head .
KILLMONGER=>Whatever you try , the Wakandans ' ll probably show up .
KLAUE=>That ' ll make my day . I can kill two birds with one stone . Lirnbani approaches Killmonger who eyes a third MASK e xpertly
KLAUE=>You're not tel l ing me that's vibranium too , eh?
KILLMONGER=>Nah , I'm just feeling it . Killmonger lays atop the gurney and Limbani places an oxygen mask over his face .
AND CLIMB=>in. Killmonger moves towards the front of the truck and gives Linda a kiss before she hits the SIREN and speeds off .
CROWD=>Ngu T'Challa Lo . T'Challa bows at Zuri's feet as the RTF lifts away .
ZURI=>I, Zuri , Son of Badu , give to you, Prince T'Challa , the Black Panther! The Elders watch as Zuri holds up A CEREMONIAL
VESSEL=>containing a mysterious concoction .
ZURI=>The Prince will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away . Zuri pours the solution into T'Challa's mouth . T'Challa reacts violently, choking on the red fluid. T'Challa spasms, his veins expanding and his muscles contracting as the poison spreads through him . But soon, he stops shaking and exhales easy . Zuri turns to the audience .
ZURI=>Damaku . ..
CROWD=>Damaku . . .
ZURI=>Victory in ritual combat comes by yield or death . If any tribe wishes to put forth a warrior, I now offer a path to the throne . The Merchant Tribe Warrior calls out .
TRIBE ELDER=>The Merchant Tribe will NOT challenge today. W'KABI, the head of the Border Tribe calls out.
BORDERTRIBE ELDER=>The Border tribe will NOT challenge today. Nakia calls out , representing the River Tribe .
RIVER TRIBE ELDER=>The River Tribe will NOT challenge today . The Mining Tribe Warrior calls out .
MINING TRIBE ELDER=>The Mining Tribe will NOT challenge today.
ZURI=>Is there any member of royal blood who wishes to challenge for the throne?
ON SHUR!=>As she raises her hand, and a collective gasp is heard amongst the entire gathering .
SHUR!=>This corset is really uncomfortable. So could we all just wrap it up and go home? Ramonda pinches her, as the ELDERS groan, and the YOUNG WAKANDANS be heard laughing .
BACK IN THE POOL=>T'Challa smiles and shakes his head . The sound of WOODEN DRUMSand loud chanting suddenly interrupts . Everyone looks to the mouth of the main CAVEwhere SIX JABARI WARRIORSand TWOJABARI DRUMMERS file out. Adorned in elaborate wooden armor, the warriors hold large wooden spears that look like javelins . The Kingsguard coil tightly as stunning the CROWD the
ON THE AUDIENCE=>Where W'Kabi and Nakia unsheathe their weapons and Okoye readies the Dora Milaje .
ON SHURI AND RAMONDA=>Shuri turns to her mother .
SHURI=>Are they Jabari?
RAMONDA=>Yes .
BACKIN THE POOL=>Zuri confronts M'Baku.
ZURI=>M'Baku . What are you doing here?!
M'BAKU=>It's challenge day .
M'BAKU=>We have watched and listened from the mountains . We have watched with disgust , as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child who scoffs at tradition . M'Baku points his spear at Shuri, who's eyes grow large . AYO steps in front of her .
M'BAKU=>And now ... you want to hand the nation over to this prince .. . (he steps nose to nose
WITH T'CHALLA)=>Who could not even keep his own father safe . Hmm? We will not have it . I said we will not have it !
M'BAKU=>Glory to Hanuman .
ZURI=>Let the challenge begin! The warriors CLASH, both with great skill . M'Baku with superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield. Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS BACKbut instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and counter with TWOFIERCE KICKS. M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they respond LOUDER! M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his assault , T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it to land another KICK. The two continue to battle, BLOCKINGand TRADINGBLUNT STRIKES, until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears. With the deadly spears at his back, T'Challa blocks COLOSSAL OVERHEAD BLOWSwith his shield, then M' Baku leans with all his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS. Clubbing M'Baku to his heels , T'Challa rushes forward for an aerial attack only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest , causing him to LOSE both his shield and spear!
M'BAKU=>Where is your God, now?! Defenseless, T'Challa DODGESSPEAR-SWIPES before M'Baku corrals him into a BEAR HUG and delivers a CRUSHINGHEADBUTT. M'Baku LAUGHSthrough his mask .
RAMONDA=>Show him who you are !
T'CHALLA=>I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SO OF King
SHUR!=>You can do this T'Challa !
POOL=>T'Challa wedges M'Baku ' s spear UNDERHIS FOOT and PULLS M'Baku to the pool , FLIPPING his body into a SERIES OF LEG
T'CHALLA=>Yield! Don't make me kill you .
M'BAKU=>I would rather die ! T'Challa TIGHTENS HIS GRIP and M'Baku begins to fade .
T'CHALLA=>What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further.
T'CHALLA=>You have fought with honor , now yield! Your people need you . M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors .
T'CHALLA=>Yield, man ! M' Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Cha l la lets him go and is barely ab l e to stand h i mself as Zuri steps forward . The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath , T'Challa proud l y lifts his ar m.
ZURI=>I now present to you , King T'Challa the Black Panther !!
T'CHALLA=>Zuri .
ZURI=>My King . Drums begin to play and people start to dance . T'Challa and Nakia stare into each other's eyes amidst the celebration as ..
T'CHALLA=>Wakanda forever !! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically .
ZURI=>Allow the Heart Shaped Herb to restore the powers of the Black Panther and take you to the Ancestral Plane .
ZURI=>T'Chaka , we call on you. Corne here to your son .
ZURI=>Darnaku . The children begin burying T'Challa in the red sand .
T'CHALLA=>Baba!
T'CHALLA=>I am sorry .
T'CHAKA=>Stand up! You are a King. T'Challa rises, and they begin to walk.
T'CHALLA=>That is not what I am talking about . I am not ready to be without you.
T'CHAKA=>A man who has not prepared his children for his own death has failed as a father.
T'CHALLA=>Never .
T'CHAKA=>You're going to struggle. So you need to surround yourself with people you trust . You're a good man with a good heart . And it's hard for a good man to be King .
ZURI=>Breathe , T'Challa. Breathe ! T'Challa breathes in deeply , coughing up dirt . His battle wounds have healed.
T'CHALLA=>He was there ! He was there . My father.
T'CHALLA=>Corne home , Nakia .
NAKIA=>I'm right here .
T'CHALLA=>Stay.
NAKIA=>I came to support you , and to honor your father. But I can't stay. It's just ... ! found my calling out there . I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye . I can't be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing . T'Challa thinks on this .
T'CHALLA=>What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .
NAKIA=>Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it ... other countries do it, we do it better.
T' CHALLA=>We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life.
NAKIA=>Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time . Nakia gives T'Challa a look .
T'CHALLA=>If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.
NAKIA=>I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn .
T' CHALLA=>Ah! So you admit it !
NAKIA=>. . if that's what I wanted !
T'CHALLA=>Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing?
W'KABI=>Of course.
W'KABI=>I see Nakia is back ... you guys going to work it out? T'Challa shakes his head and crosses in front of W'Kabi .
W'KABI=>T'Challa, what's wrong?
T'CHALLA=>Nakia thinks we should be doing more .
W'KABI=>More like what?
T'CHALLA=>Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head.
W'KABI=>You let refugees in , they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. T'Challa thinks on this.
W'KABI=>Now, if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world , then I'd be all for it.
T'CHALLA=>But waging war on other countries has never been our way . Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.
T' CHALLA=>You too, huh?
W' KABI=>Bast, are we in trouble? Their beads combine to project a display of Okoye .
OKOYE=>My King . My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar.
AN=>a golden pyramid, T' Challa , W'Kabi, Ramonda and ELDERS from each tribe except the Jabari sit in a circle as Okoye briefs them . W'Kabi and Ramonda flank T'Challa's throne .
OKOYE=>A misidentified Wakandan artifact was stolen yesterday from a British museum . We have learned Ulysses Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn to an American buyer in South Korea tomorrow night . There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue .
T'CHALLA=>Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret . I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial .
MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER=>Wakanda does not need a warrior right now . We need a King .
W'KABI=>My parents were killed when he attacked . Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us, from me.
OKOYE=>It's too great an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI=>Take me with you . We'll take him down together side by side, eh?
T'CHALLA=>I need you here protecting the border.
W'KABI=>Then I ask, you kill him where he stands , or you bring him back to us .
T'CHALLA=>You have my word I will bring him back.
A DRAGONFLYER=>lands outside the WAKANDAN
T'CHALLA=>Stop it. Stop it. Shuri laughs and they do a special handshake before walking down the spiral walkway into her sprawling, futuristic lab.
SHUR!=>I've already sent a car ahead to Busan for you .
T'CHALLA=>Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia .
SHURI=>You sure it's a good idea to take your e x on a mission?
T'CHALLA=>Yes . We'll be fine .
SHURI=>I have great things to show you , brother . Here are your communication devices for Korea . Unlimited range , also equipped with audio surveillance system . She walks him over to another table with WDGdisks on them .
SHURI=>Check these out . Remote access Kimoyo beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table . Curious , T'Chal l a notices a pair of SLEEK SHOES.
T'CHALLA=>And what are these?
SHURI=>The real question is what are those? Why do you have your toes out in my lab? Shuri points at T'Challa's traditional sandals . T'Challa smiles .
T'CHALLA=>What , you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day .
SHURI=>Yea I bet the elders loved that . Try them on .
SHURI=>Fully automated , like the old American movie Baba used to watch. And I made them completely sound absorbent . T'Challa stomps his foot down without a sound.
T'CHALLA=>Interesting .
SHURI=>Guess what I ca l l them . T'Challa thinks on this .
SHURI=>Sneakers ... T'Challa looks at her blankly .
SHURI=>Because you .. . never mind. Shuri walks T'Challa over to two mannequins . One wears T'Challa's CURRENTSUIT . The other , just a panther tooth
SHURI=>If you're going to take on Klaue you'll need the best the Design Group has to offer . Shuri points at T'Challa's current suit .
SHURI=>Exhibit A. Old tech .
T'CHALLA=>Old ... ?
T'CHALLA=>Enough .. .
SHUR!=>Now look at these . T'Challa spots a GAUDIERGOLDTOOTHNECKLACE. She notices .
SHUR!=>Do you like that one?
T'CHALLA=>Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one . Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.
SHUR!=>Now tell it to go on. T'Challa does, and without warning, MILLIONS of vibranium laced NANITES spill from the necklace and form a new BLACK PANTHERSUIT around the mannequin.
SHUR!=>Oooh! ! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace . Strike it .
T'CHALLA=>Anywhere?
SHUR!=>Mhm.
SHUR!=>Not that hard, genius!
T'CHALLA=>You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot .
SHUR!=>I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around .
T'CHALLA=>Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script .
T'CHALLA=>Wait a minute .
SHURI=>The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribu t ion .
T'CHALLA=>Very nice.
SHURI=>Now strike it again , in the same spot . T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her Kimoyo . T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously .
T'CHALLA=>You are recording?
SHUR!=>For research purposes . .. T'Challa loads up then BOOM He kicks the indigo spot and
LE=>of Shuri's gadgets . Shuri cracks up.
T'CHALLA=>Delete that footage ...
NA.KIA=>This way .
OKOYE=>Bast willing this goes quickly , and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head .
NA.KIA=>It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth .
OKOYE=>What? It's a disgrace . Looky - loos stare as Nakia leads them to an ELDERLYWOMAN , se ll ing fish i n front of an al l ey . Nakia greets her in perfect Korean.
T' CHALLA=>Spread out. The buyer is likely already here. Okoye heads for the BALCONY VANTAGE POINT while T'Challa and Nakia go down to the FIRST FLOOR.
T'CHALLA=>The woman outside -- what trouble was she referring to? She plays along, alluring .
NAKIA=>Ah, I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders . Made a bit of a mess .
T' CHALLA=>And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan heiress?
NAKIA=>Depends on how quickly we finish the mission ...
OKOYE=>Thank you .
NAKIA=>Eyes up . Americans . I count ... three . We see Nakia's POV as she makes out THREE CIA AGENTSon the first floor, spread out under the balcony.
OKOYE=>Five. How could you miss "Greased Lightning" there behind you . Standing over the balcony looking , Okoye spots TWOMORECIA agents, both with greasy hair. An elegant waitress carries a tray of drinks to a CRAPS TABLE where we find T'Challa . The woman places the drinks down as T'Challa peers across the gambling pit at someone he recognizes and starts that way.
T'CHALLA=>Agent Ross .
ROSS=>Your highness . Ross plays it cool .
T'CHALLA=>You are buying from Klaue ...
ROSS=>What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to , do me a favor and stay out of my way.
T'CHALLA=>I gave you Zemo.
ROSS=>And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I ' d say we were even . Ross places a Pass bet. T'Challa dumps a stack of chips on Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice.
ROSS=>You really need to leave, now. They watch the dice roll . They land on 3. The dea l er takes away Ross' bet , and slides T'Challa's massive payout over to him .
T' CHALLA=>Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned. T'Challa walks toward another craps table , leaving the pile of chips behind .
ROSS=>Hey, you won . Ross scratches his brow as a THIRSTY GAMBLER who was sitting next to T'Challa grabs them . Ross eyes the Thirsty Gambler who shrugs .
THIRSTY GAMBLER=>You know what, I think I'll just take these , bring 'em over here and hold on for safe keeping . He slides them all onto the DON'T PASS bet and Ross walks off in search of T'Challa .
ROSS=>Alright , vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person that I'm not actually saying I'm here to make a deal with but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles you and I can work something out .
T'CHALLA=>I am not here to make a deal . Ross rolls his eyes .
ON ROSS AND T'CHALLA=>At a stalemate. Then .. .
T' CHALLA=>General .
T'CHALLA=>And the vibranium.
ON NAKIA=>Who changes position from the bar to the CRAPS TABLE where T'Challa was initially standing .
NAKIA=>I don't see it yet .
ON OKOYE=>As TWOOF KLAUES TOUGHSpost ' up on either side of her on the balcony . She trie s to play it cool as they look around at the patrons s uspiciously .
OKOYE=>I thoug ht there were no weapons allo wed in here .
OKOYE=>Someone did not get the memo. Definitely armed .
ON KLAUE=>Klaue spots Ross and smiles as he heads down the stairs flanked by a couple of his TOUGHS.
ROSS=>Well that is quite the entourage . You got a mixtape coming out? Klaue cuts Ross a look .
KLAUE=>Yeah ! Yeah , actually there is one . Shocked , Ross is unsure if Kl aue is serious .
KLAUE=>Yea I'll send you the soundcloud link if you like . Klaue turns to one of his goons .
KLAUE=>Aye, Dave . Get him the link to the tape . The SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGHreaches into his pocket for his phone.
ROSS=>Please don't make me listen to your music . I just meant , you got a lot of people with yo u.
KLAUE=>Oh, you think they're for you? Klaue laughs at this .
KLAUE=>Don't worry . I can do a deal with you all by myself , thank you very much . He rubs Ross on the shoulder , hard , and for way too long . As several more SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGHScome pouring out of the VIP lounges .
KLAUE=>You got the diamonds? Klaue is still rubbing Ross' shoulder .
ROSS=>Ok, that's enough. A CIA AGENTwalks a FANCYSLIM BRIEFCASE towards Ross.
NAKIA=>We need to move on Klaue.
T'CHALLA=>Stand down . We can't afford a shoot- out.
BACKIN THE PIT=>Ross eyes Klaue as the CIA agent brings him the briefcase .
ROSS=>The vibranium? Klaue looks around , and reaches into his pants and pulls out a wrinkled, sweaty paper bag, with "FRAGILE" written on it with a sharpie . Ross looks at the bag.
KLAUE=>I was going to buy a fancy suitcase, but I thought I'd save myself some money .
NAKIA=>It's now or never . Nakia continues towards the CIA agent.
SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGH=>Hey. Okoye pretends she doesn't hear him.
SOUTHAFRICAN TOUGH=>Hey!
DOWNSTAIRS=>The arm-bar tough CRASHESDOWN onto a gaming table behind Klaue and startled patrons , scramble in every direction . Klaue spins toward the commotion as ... Klaue looks back to Ross and spots T'Challa. Producing a HANDGUN from his waist, Klaue opens fire on Ross and the CIA agent . Ross uses the SLIM SUITCASE as a shield as he ducks down below the craps table and . . . T'Challa leaps to action , KICKING and FLIPPING THE TABLE on its edge to block GUNFIRE from Klaue's other toughs. With bullets flying everywhere ... PANICKEDPEOPLE run for their lives . It's CHAOS. Surrounded by TOUGHS Klaue retreats , for the stairs .
KLAUE=>Get the diamonds, quick ! EVERYONE OF KLAUE'S TOUGHSunload, raining shells on the overturned craps table with Ross and T'Challa behind it . The TOUGHS move in only to have T'Challa leap from the table , staying low to FOOTSWEEP one onto his back . T'Challa kicks him back then disarms another TOUGHand kicks him into the bar . T'Challa then spins and kicks the next TOUGHover the roulette table and through the bar railing. Nakia grabs a goon in an ARMTWIST trying to relieve him of his gun . She takes off one shoe and knocks out another approaching gun. Swings the arm twisted goon to the floor, knocks him out, taking his gun and shooting up towards the balcony where Okoye is fighting .
ON OKOYE=>Okoye BATTLES TWOTOUGHSwith her full-length spear, dropping both with proficiency .
KLAUE=>You know, you look just like your old man. T'Challa snatches up a ROLLING CHANGECART TABLE just as Klaue fires the blaster at him . BOOOOM ! A COLOSSALSONIC BLAST hits the cart, !! blowing it to pieces and sending T'Challa FLYING THROUGH THE UPPER BALCONY RAILING back down into the pit . With money FLOATING in the air , T'Challa lands hard .
KLAUE=>I made it rain!
ON NAKIA AND OKOYE=>Nakia and Okoye make their way to the top of the stairs as . .
KLAUE=>That was awesome! That was awesome! Let's go ! Go, go , come on! Klaue jumps in the first of FOUR IDLING 4RUNNERS. The convoy instantly skids away as ... Nakia and Okoye emerge . Okoye throws an EMP bead from her pocket and it lands on a parked LEXUS LC.
NAKIA=>Do we just leave him?
OKOYE=>He'll catch up. Nakia starts the car and Okoye climbs in . T'Challa sprints out of casino .
T'CHALLA=>Shuri !
DESIGN GROUP- NIGHT=>Shuri stands in front of a rectangular VIBRANIUMCASING that lowers . The SAND inside FORMSinto the Lexus LC's cockpit.
SHURI=>Okay okay, calm down brother !
SHURI=>Wool Let's go !
KLAUE=>Put some music on ! What do you think this is a funeral?
NAKIA=>Which one is he in now?
OKOYE=>They're trying to lose us .
NA.KIA=>We'll take the right .
SHURI=>We'll take the other two ! I see a short cut .
SHURI=>We're not going to make it!
T'CHALLA=>Keep go in g ! Panther uses his claws to make a sharp turn and avoid the wreck .
SHURI=>Wool Brother !
SHURI=>Hey , what was that ! ?
T'CHALLA=>Don't worry about it . You're doing great . Panther leaps back onto the hood of the Lexus and they speed off . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER SPEAR STREET - NIGHT
OKOYE=>Guns . So primitive . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER, SPEAR STREET - NIGHT Klaue barks into his comm.
NAKIA=>What are you doing?
OKOYE=>Just drive .
NAKIA=>Eesh . Nakia drops back and weaves through traffic as Okoye , engages her SPEAR MECHANISM,then steadies herself and let's her long spear fly , launching the weapon like a javelin.
OF=>truck, SPIKING THE GROUND and bringing the SUV to a stop with the force of a head on collision !
WOOL=>I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER, SPEAR STREET - NIGHT
KLAUE=>Oh shoot.
SHURI=>Hey, look at your suit! You ' ve been taking bullets charging it up with kinetic energy ! Panther looks down at the GLOWINGGLYPHS of kinetic energy built into his suit as ...
T'CHALLA=>Pull around the truck .
DRIVER=>Where'd he go ! ? Then out of nowhere, PANTHERLANDSHARDon the hood of the
SUV.=>Looking inside , Panther doesn't see Klaue and launches off the 4Runner , distributing the kinetic energy from his suit with IMMENSECONCUSSIVEFORCE, causing both TRUCKSTO CRASH and FLIP down the bridge.
SHURI=>You show off.
NAKIA=>There he is ! Hold tight !
KLAUE=>Right, let's have some fun . Sitting on the windowsill, Klaue aims his SONIC DISRUPTER.
ON OKOYE=>As she twists through the air , her feet remain planted on a shredded piece of the cars' roof. She l ands on her feet, speed-skating to a stop .
ON NAKIA=>Nakia skids up next to Okoye on the driver's seat , still buckled in .
ROSS=>Hop in . Put that spear in the trunk .
T'CHALLA=>Faster , Shuri .
DESIGN GROUP- NIGHT=>Tracking Kla ue ' s SUV Shuri , drives in the sand cockpit .
SHURI=>I ' m going as fast as I can !
KLAUE=>Take a right , take a right !
SHUR!=>No no no no no no no !! And ... HIT . .. t he LEX LC SUDDENLY US GOES TO PI ECES.. . whole parts and panelling to a million fragments.
SHUR!=>Brother !
T'CHALLA=>Did you think we would forget !? Klaue laughs .
T'CHALLA=>Look at me murderer ! Where did you get this weapon?
KLAUE=>You savages didn ' t deserve it . T'Challa grabs him by the throat and slams him into the SUV.
T' CHALLA=>Every breath you take is mercy from me.
NG=>cellphones as SIRENS can be heard in the distance .
ROSS=>Come on guys , let's go huh? T'Challa eyes around. He has little choice and nods.
KLAUE=>Hello! I can see you ! I can , I can see you.
ROSS=>So, this is a big mess, huh? I figured we can go good cop bad cop . I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in -- Okoye turns to T'Challa .
T'CHALLA=>After your questioning , we will to take him back to Wakanda with us . Ross stares at T'Challa for a beat .
ROSS=>What? No. Look I like you, a lot. But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere . Listen , I 'm doing you a favor by letting you even be in here. Ross reaches out and touches T'Challa . Okoye steps in.
ROSS=>Does she speak English?
OKOYE=>When she wants to. Ross and Okoye eye each other for a long beat.
ROSS=>I'm going in . And when I'm done, you guys are up.
T'CHALLA=>--Agent Ross .
ROSS=>Yea. T'Challa puts his hand on Ross's shoulder .
T'CHALLA=>I do appreciate your help in Busan .
ROSS=>You see that? It's called diplomacy . You're welcome. Ross walks through the door, closing it behind him .
T'CHALLA=>Okoye! Play nice.
OKOYE=>Eh , Americans ...
KLAUE=>You know, you really shouldn ' t trust the Wakandans. I'm much more your speed.
ROSS=>I don't trust anybody, not in this job . But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there. Where'd you get that?
KLAUE=>It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like .
ROSS=>Why don't you give me the name of your supplier and I'll ask them.
KLAUE=>He's right outside , why don't you ask him yourself?
ROSS=>T' Challa? You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Klaue nods.
KLAUE=>Bingo .
KLAUE=>What do you actually know about Wakanda?
ROSS=>Shepherds . Textiles . Cool outfits. Ross stops as we notice a MICRO AUDIO BUG on his shoulder that T'Challa planted before he entered the room .
KLAUE=>It's all a front . Explorers searched for it for centuries . El Dorado : The Golden City . They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time . A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it . The gift . Vibranium ...
ROSS=>Vibranium yea . Strongest metal on Earth.
KLAUE=>It's not just a metal ... They sew it into their clothes , it powers their city, their tech, their weapons ...
ROSS=>Weapons?
KLAUE=>Oh yes . Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower .
ROSS=>That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium .
KLAUE=>All of it? I took a tiny piece of it . They have a mountain full of it. They've been mining it for thousands of years and still haven't scratched the surface .
KLAUE=>I'm the only outsider who's seen it , and got out of there alive.
ROSS=>Your father to l d the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had . But now he's telling me you have more?
T'CHALLA=>And you believe the word of an arms dealer , strapped to a chair. Ross hesitates , but doesn ' t bite .
ROSS=>How much more are you hiding? Then suddenly . . . Nakia SLAMSthrough the door . CIA AGENTS draw their weapons. Nakia is unfazed.
KLAUE=>I see you took your time didn't you ! Killmonger continues to FIRE as Lirnbani and Linda hop in and begin to pull off.
NAKIA=>He just jumped in front of me. Gravely wounded, Ross is barely conscious .
NAKIA=>I don't think he'll make it here, it hit his spine .
T'CHALLA=>Give me a Kimoyo bead . T'Challa looks at Nakia and motions towards her Kimoyo bead. She pulls one off and hands it to him . T'Challa inserts it into Ross' wound.
T'CHALLA=>This will stabilize him for now .
T'CHALLA=>Give him to us . We can save him.
OKOYE=>Our missions was to bring back Klaue . We failed . This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders?
NAKIA=>He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE=>That was his choice . T'Challa stiffens. Okoye has gone a little too far. Torn, Nakia stares off, thinking about the Nigerian women they didn't bring back to Wakanda and her culpability in Ross' injury .
NAKIA=>So now we are just supposed to let him die?
OKOYE=>Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as King, it is your duty to protect ours.
T'CHALLA=>I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.
AFTERNOON=>Shuri covertly l eads T'Challa , Okoye and Nakia inside , carrying Ross ' s body on a Maglev stretcher. She turns to T'Challa .
SHURI=>Great , another broken white boy for us to fi x. This is going to be fun. T' Challa cuts Shuri a look .
NOON=>Ros s is placed on a table surrounded by futuri s tic medical equipment . As Shuri works on him .
SHURI=>He will live . The security alarm on Shuri's Kimoyo bead GOES OFF.
SHURI=>W'Kabi is here . Shuri , Nakia and Okoye quickly hide . T'Challa hurries up the ramp. Hoping for good news, W' Kabi approaches T'Challa .
W'KABI=>What ' s going on , brother? Where is Klaue?
T'CHALLA=>He's not here . T'Challa's eyes lower regretfully .
T'CHALLA=>He slipped through our hands .
W' KABI=>Slipped? For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing . With you I thought it would be different . But it's more of the same . Deeply disappointed , W' Kabi can't muster words . He looks at T'Challa and wal ks out .
AIRFIELD/GARAGE, SOUTHKOREA- EVENING=>An airplane graveyard . The paint truck pulls to a stop on the airstrip . Killmonger, Klaue , Limbani and Linda hop out, and hump their gear to a FOUR SEATER ESCAPE PLANE parked on the
LIMBANI=>Let's get going, boss.
KILLMONGER=>You always sell to the CIA?
KLAUE=>I sell to the highest bidder . Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid.
KILLMONGER=>Oh I ain't worried about the money, bro . I know you're good for it . Klaue smiles.
KILLMONGER=>On our way back, just drop us of in Wakanda.
KLAUE=>You don't wanna go there, boy .
KILLMONGER=>Yea I do . Killmonger suddenly draws a HANDGUN and SHOOTSLIMBANI DEAD. Reacting to the shot , Klaue crowds Linda with a skilled GRAPPLINGMOVEand snatches her gun away before she can fire on him . Killmonger finds Klaue holding Linda's gun to her head, using her as his shield .
LINDA=>I'm sorry . I'm sorry , Erik .
KILLMONGER=>It's gonna be ok . Killmonger fires without hesitation . The BULLET TRAVELS THROUGH Linda , ki lli ng her while Klaue dives behind the plane , WOUNDED THE SHOULDER IN from the round . Killmonger moves to finish Klaue but he's gone . Following Klaue's blood trail , Killmonger STALKS Klaue through the
SCRAPYARD.=>Klaue fires at Killmonger , missing . Killmonger stops and turns, ducking between planes. Killmonger spots Klaue THROUGH THE GLASS of a cockpit window and FIRES . Sniped through the window with precision , Klaue falls , losing Linda's gun . Ki l lmonger approaches and Klaue rolls to his back to face him .
KLAUE=>... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages. Klaue shows his BRANDEDneck .
KLAUE=>This is what they do to people like us.
KILLMONGER=>I ain't worried about no brand . Check these out. Killmonger rolls up his sleeve , uncovering SEVERALAFRICAN SCARIFICATION MARKSon his forearm .
KILLMONGER=>Each one is for a kill .
KLAUE=>You can sca r yourself as much as you like . To them , you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there . Killmonger flips the inside of his bottom lip, revealing a glowing Wakandan TATTOO. Klaue can't believe his eyes .
KLAUE=>And to think I saw you as some crazy Am erican .
ZURI=>So your mission did not go as planned .
T'CHALLA=>What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared ... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one . Zuri turns back and T'Challa lifts his hand, showing his VIBRANIUMRING from CA: CW . zuri turns away uncomfortable.
ZURI=>That is not possible .
T' CHALLA=>He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring . My grandfather ' s ring . Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth .
ZURI=>Some truths are too much to bear , T'Challa.
T'CHALLA=>That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?
ZURI=>I promised the King to say nothing .
T'CHALLA=>I am your King now! Zuri looks up.
ZURI=>Your uncle took a War Dog assignment in America . Your father placed me there to observe unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child . The hardships he saw there radicalized your uncle.
N'JOBU=>I observed for as long as I could ! Their leaders have been assassinated , communities flooded with drugs and weapons , they are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the planet our people suffer because they don't have the tools to fight back. With vibranium weapons they could overthrow every country and Wakanda could rule them all , the right way . . .
ZURI=>He knew your father would not support this , so your uncle betrayed us.
T'CHALLA=>No . .
ZURI=>He helped Klaue steal the vibranium .
T'CHALLA=>No no no no no no . . .
YOUNG T'CHAKA=>You will return home at once , where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes . N'Jobu reaches into his waistband and pulls a HANDGUN,
AIMING=>it at James/Young Zuri's head, freezing him .
ZURI=>Your father killed his own brother . ..
ZURI=>To save my life .
YOUNGT'CHAKA=>Speak nothing of this .
T'CHALLA=>And the child ...
ZURI=>We left him .
FLASHBACK=>One of the young kids playing basketball, who is now revealed to be YOUNG KILLMONGER stands looking up at the sky where the mysterious lights flickered.
ZURI=>We had to maintain the lie . Gutted , T'Challa can't reconcile what he's just heard . He turns his back on Zuri .
W'KABI=>What is this?
KILLMONGER=>Just a 'lil gift . Killmonger opens his bag , revealing KLAUE'S CORPSE W'Kabi's
DESIGN GROUP- MORNING=>Ross suddenly opens his eyes and reaches for his gunshot wound finding it astonishingly almost fully healed. Shuri tinkers with the circuitry of a PAIR OF MASSIVE CLAWED VIBRANIUMGAUNTLETS across the room as Ross sits up.
ROSS=>Alright, where am I? Startled, Shuri spins .
SHURI=>Don't scare me like that, colonizer .
ROSS=>Colon-who? My name is Everett .
SHURI=>Yes , I know . Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA.
ROSS=>Right. Groggy, Ross gazes around at the completely unique technology .
ROSS=>Ok, is this Wakanda?
ROSS=>... How long ago was Korea?
SHUR!=>Yesterday .
ROSS=>I don't think so . Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.
SHUR!=>They do here. But not by magic , by technology.
MINE.=>Suddenly an AUTOMATED MINING CART whips between light panels, floating above a rail .
ROSS=>These train things ... that's magnetic levitation, right?
SHUR!=>Obviously.
ROSS=>Obviously ... but I've never seen it this efficient . The light panels, what are they?
SHUR!=>Sonic stabilizers .
ROSS=>Sonic what?
SHUR!=>In it's raw form , vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed , so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.
SHURI=>There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you. Ross tries to process this as a 3D PROJECTION OF OKOYE unexpectedly forms.
OKOYE'$ PROJECTION=>Where is T'Challa? His Kimoyo beads have been switched off . Ross, amazed , tries to touch the sand projection .
SHUR!=>Well we are not joined at the hip , Okoye .
OKOYE'$ PROJECTION=>A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue.
SHUR!=>What?
OKOYE'$ PROJECTION=>W'Kabi is transporting him as we speak to the pa l ace. We need to find your brother .
SHUR!=>An outsider?
OKOYE'$ PROJECTION=>No, a Wakandan . An IMAGE OF KILLMONGER from the border appears on Shuri's monitor . Then . . . Ross slowly walks into sight, staring at the screen .
ROSS=>He's not a Wakandan . He's one of ours.
T' CHALLA=>He killed his own brother ... and left a child behind with nothing . What kind of King . . what kind of man does that?
NAKIA=>No man is perfect . Not even your father.
T'CHALLA=>He didn ' t even give him a proper burial ... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us , but my father may have created something even worse .
NAKIA=>Hey . Look at me. You can't let your father ' s mistakes define who you are . You get to decide what kind of King you are going to be. They share a look as T'C ha l la's Kimoyo beads buzz .
SHURI'S PROJECTION=>Brother , you need to get here now. T' Chall a and Nakia look at each othe r.
ROSS=>Eric Stevens . Graduated Annapolis age 19 . MIT for grad school . Joined the SEALs and went to Afghanistan where he racked up confirmed kills like it was a video game . They him Killmonger . He
STARTED CALLING=>joined a JSOC ghost unit .
ROSS=>Now these guys are serious . They will drop off the grid so they can commit assassinations and take down governments .
T'CHALLA=>Did he reveal anything about his identity?
SHURI=>He has a War Dog tattoo but we have no record of him . T' Challa and Shuri share a look .
RIVER TRIBE ELDER=>Is this man Wakandan or not?
KILLMONGER)=>Speak .
KILLMONGER=>I'm standing in your house . Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people . Justice your King couldn't deliver. T'Challa walks close enough to Killmonger to be able to whisper to him .
T'CHALLA=>I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are ... now what do you want?
GER=>I want the throne . The entire room scoffs at this . Some ELDERS even hold their heads back and laugh .
KILLMONGER=>Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good . There's about 2 billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder , Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all .
T'CHALLA=>And what tools are those?
KILLMONGER=>Vibranium . Your weapons.
T'CHALLA=>Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world . It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own .
KILLMONGER=>Not your own? But didn't life start here , on this continent? So ain ' t all people your people?
T'CHALLA=>I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to see how T'Challa will respond . Then , Ramonda suddenly speaks .
RAMONDA=>Son , we have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request . Killmonger eyes the Elders with an amused grin .
KILLMON GER=>Oh, I ain't requesting nothing ! Ask who I am?
SHURI=>You are Eric Stevens. An American black operative . A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are .
T'CHALLA=>No.
GER=>Ask me.
T'CHALLA=>Take him away.
KILLMONGER=>I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest . You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer!
W'KABI=>I'm afraid not Queen Mother .
KILLMONGER=>Hey Auntie .
KILLMONGER=>I'm exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of King and Black Panther . Utter silence as all eyes turn to T'Challa . T'Challa desperately wants to refuse but knows that isn't possible .
RAMONDA=>Do not do this T'Challa.
BORDERTRIBE ELDER=>As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights .
RAMONDA=>He has no rights here.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER=>The challenge would take weeks to prepare .
KILLMONGER=>Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him ... and somebody to get me out of these chains.
RAMONDA=>T'Challa, what do you know of this?
T'CHALLA=>I accept your challenge. W'Kabi looks at T'Challa closely .
TO=>The Tribal Elders , W'Kabi , and the Dora look on from their respective places . Shuri watches with Ramonda , but the stands are entirely empty .
SHURI=>He will never beat T' Challa . He should have just come to t he first challenge and gotten it over with . Ramonda looks concerned . She ' s not so sure.
ZURI=>The King will now have the strength of the Black Pa nther stripped away . Staring T'Challa down, Killmonger suddenly turns to Zuri . They recognize each other. Zuri looks away ashamed.
IN THE SEATING AREA=>Nakia arrives through a tunnel and wal ks up to Okoye , who turns to her .
OKOYE=>Where is Agent Ross?
NAKIA=>I locked him in the office . He's not going anywhere.
POOL=>T' Challa holds his short spear and shield. He stares at his cousin .
T'CHALLA=>This is your last chance, thro w down your weapons and we can handle this another way.
KILLMON GER=>I lived my entire life waiting for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed, just to get here. He takes off his vest and tears at his shirt, revealing the SCARIFICATION MARKSthat go up his arm and across his entire back. They number in the hundreds .
KILLMONGER=>I killed in America, Afghanistan, Iraq . I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on the continent . And all this death , just so I can kill you . T'Challa looks to Zuri and nods .
T' CHALLA=>Yield ! Killrnonger FEROCIOUSLY BOBS INSIDE , but T'Challa lunges at Killrnonger, giving him a superficial SLASH ACROSS his cheek. Fueled by rage, Killmonger begins to overpower T'Challa . He slices T'Challa ' s thigh .
SHURI=>Snap out of it T'Challa!
POOL=>Wielding both blades , Killmonger slashes deep across T'Challa's stomach, then spins, CUTTING deep into his bicep.
NAKIA=>Get up .
POOL=>He continues to PUNCHT'CHALLA REPEATEDLYuntil he topples over.
KILLMONGER=>This is for my father . Killmonger walks swiftly toward T'Challa to deliver his deathblow .. . only to have a guilt-ridden Zuri STOP HIM with his SPEAR knocking his blade away .
T'CHALLA=>Zuri , no .
OKOYE=>Zuri .
RAMONDA=>Zuri don ' t !
ZURI=>I am the cause of your father's death. Not him . Take me . Regrouping, Killrnonger grabs Zuri's spear . T'Challa labors to get up but can't .
KILLMONGER=>I'll take you both , Uncle James ... Killmonger skewers Zuri with his spear. Killmonger drives the spear in further and GRABBINGTHE BLADE with both hands in death, Zuri falls with it to the shallow water as T'Challa watches in utter torment .
T'CHALLA=>Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo! Fueled by rage, T'Challa lifts back up to his feet. He charges Killmonger , who ducks his attacks, while talking to the audience .
KILLMONGER=>Is this your King? Huh? T'Challa swings his spear, Killmonger ducks .
KILLMONGER=>Is this your King? The Black Panther , who's supposed to lead you into the future .
SHUR!=>Come on brother! Nakia looks on, trying to hide her tears with Okoye and Ayo .
AYO=>Is there nothing that can be done?
KILLMONGER=>Him? He's supposed to protect you. Killmonger ducks another attack from T'Challa and scoops him onto his shoulders .
RAMONDA=>No.
NA.KIA=>No!
POOL=>Killmonger heaves T'Challa off the waterfall. Staggered, everyone watches T'Challa DISAPPEAR BELOWto his death . Ramonda screams .
KILLMONGER=>Nah . I'm your King .
ON NA.KIA=>Nakia shuttles Shuri and Ramonda into the caves while Okoye stays behind .
NA.KIA=>We have to go now ! Queen mother, let's go !
POOL=>Staggered , the new Shaman gives him the Panther necklace . Everyone slowly salutes Killmonger .
OKOYE=>The Queen Mother and Shuri ... they are safe? Nakia nods .
NA.KIA=>Yes .
NA.KIA=>We should get to them immediately .
NAKIA=>What ...
OKOYE=>Though my heart is with you .
NAKIA=>We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago .
OKOYE=>He is of royal blood.
NAKIA=>He killed T ' Challa .
OKOYE=>In ritual combat .
NAKIA=>Does that really matter? Okoye quiets .
NAKIA=>You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has . Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong . Okoye stares at Nakia in disbelief.
OKOYE=>Overthrow? ! Nakia , I am not a spy who can come and go as they so choose. I am loyal to the throne, no matter who sits upon it . What are you loyal to?
NAKIA=>I loved him. I love my country too .
OKOYE=>Then you serve your country.
NAKIA=>No. I save my country . Nakia takes off.
ROSS=>What's wrong? Nakia tosses the blanket to Ross.
NAKIA=>The King is dead . Come with me, unless you want to join him . Ross's heart sinks as . . .
SHUR!=>First Baba, and now my brother . Mama we didn't , even get to bury him . Ramonda doesn't have an answer. The women hear a rustle in the trees , Ramonda moves to protect Shuri, holding ONE OF NAKIA'S RINGBLADESas Nakia and Ross emerge from the foliage . Ramonda eyes Ross .
NAKIA=>It's me.
RAMONDA=>Nakia. Who is this man?
NAKIA=>He's a friend of T ' Challa's he saved my life . Ramonda studies Ross , then looks to Nakia.
RAMONDA=>Where is Okoye?
NAKIA=>Okoye is not corning . She and Dora Milaje will serve the new King.
RAMONDA=>What has happened to our Wakanda? Nakia turns and heads into an even thicker BATCHOF FOLIAGE.
SHAMAN=>Allow the Heart Shaped Herb to give you the powers of the Black Panther and take you to the Ancestral Plane.
N'JOBU=>What did I tell you about going into my things?
YOUNGKILLMONGER=>Your home .
N'JOBU=>I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday .
WAKANDAN=>Young Killmonger flips down his lip , touching his tattoo .
N'JOBU=>Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world . But I fear you still may not be welcome .
YOUNGKILLMONGER=>Why?
N'JOBU=>They will say you are lost .
YOUNGKILLMONGER=>But, I'm right here . doesn ' t have an answer for this .
N'JOBU=>No tears for me?
N'JOBU=>Well look at what I have done. I should have taken you back long ago . Young Killmonger has now been replaced by adult Killmonger, who sheds a tear .
N'JOBU=>Instead, we are both abandoned here.
KILLMONGER=>Well maybe your home is the one that's lost . That's why they can't find us. N'Jobu stares at his son , heartbroken .
SHAMAN=>Breathe, my King . Breathe !
KILLMONGER=>The Heart Shaped Herb did that? The shaman nods.
KILLMONGER=>This is all of it?
SHAMAN=>Yes . So when it comes time for another King, we will be ready .
KILLMONGER=>Another King .. . yea go ahead and burn all that . Alarmed , the shamans don't move, hoping Killmonger doesn't mean it ... but he does .
SHAMAN=>My King , we cannot do that . It is our tradition -- Killmonger smiles , the n quick l y grabs the Shaman by the throat .
KILLMONGER=>When I tell you to do something , I mean that shit . Burn it all ! He lets her go as she gasps for air . Shell-shocked , the shamans move into action .
ON NAKIA=>Nakia digs out a flawless Heart Shaped Herb and in an instant darts back for the catacombs , glancing back at Killmonger from the shadows .
KILLMONGER=>You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions , they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors . Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth . Already in place . Killmonger stands and walks looking each of them in the eye.
KILLMONGER=>I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them . We' re gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs . They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side . It ' s time they know the truth about us . We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top . Killmonger sits .
KILLMONGER=>The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire. Okoye looks to W'Kabi .
OKOYE=>Wakanda has survived for so long by fighting when only absolutely necessary.
W'KABI=>Wakanda has survived in the past this way , yes. But the world is changing , General . Elders , it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up and soon it will be the conquerors , or the conquered . I'd rather be the former .
KILLMONGER=>You heard your orders. Let's get to it. W'Kabi salutes while Okoye looks on .
ROSS=>So where are we going again?
NAKIA=>We're taking the Heart Shaped Herb to Jabariland .
ROSS=>Heart Shaped Herb , what is that?
SHURI=>It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities .
NAKIA=>It's what made T'Challa so strong . Ramonda stops in her tracks.
RAMONDA=>Nakia. I don't like this. The Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.
NAKIA=>I'm a spy with no army . I wouldn't stand a chance .
RAMONDA=>We'll go . They keep walking. Suddenly , they are surrounded by MEMBERS
NAKIA=>Stay calm .
RAMONDA=>My son was murdered in ritual combat .
M'BAKU=>Were the odds fair?
NAKIA=>Yes, but . . .
M'BAKU=>So, it was less a murder than a defeat? This irks Shuri.
SHURI=>Do not rub our noses in it --
M'BAKU=>Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl .
ROSS=>Look uh, your highness, the new King is a -- M'Baku drowns out Ross' voice with loud barks. The surrounding Jabari follow suit .
M'BAKU=>You cannot talk . One more word and I will feed you to my children . Ross looks petrified until M'Baku winks at Ramonda.
M'BAKU=>I'm kidding. We are vegetarians . Stepping in , Nakia pulls out the HEART SHAPEDHERB.
NAKIA=>Great Gorilla M'Baku. This is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider s i ts on our throne. Only you can help us stop him . M'Baku considers . His ego stroked. But .. .
M'BAKU=>Come with me.
NAKIA=>Impossible .
M' BAKU=>He is in a coma , barely clinging to life .
SHURI=>Why do you have him in the snow? !
M' BAKU=>It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors .
SHURI=>We need to get him to my lab! I can heal him there .
M'BAKU=>Take him. He ' ll be dead in seconds.
RAMONDA=>Nakia , the Herb . Ramonda takes the herb from Nakia and pushes past M'Baku who looks on.
RAMONDA=>I call upon the ancestors. I call upon Bast . I am here with my son T'Challa . Heal him . We must bury him .
NAKIA=>Wake up, T'Challa . Wake up .
T'CHAKA=>The time has come for you to come home and be reunited with me.
T'CHALLA=>Why, Baba?
T' CHAKA=>He ... he was the truth I chose to omit .
T'CHALLA=>You were wrong to abandon him .
T'CHAKA=>I chose my people . I chose Wakanda . Our future depended on --
T'CHALLA=>You were wrong ! All of you were wrong ! To turn your backs on the rest of the world . We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right . No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne . He is a monster of our own making . I must take the mantle back , I must. I must right these wrongs . T'Chaka looks at his son , his disappointment giving way to a proud smile .
T'CHALLA=>Do you have a blanket? They embrace. T'Challa turns to see Nakia and Shuri as well. The four of them embrace as M'Baku looks on .
NAKIA=>Killmonger has the full support of our military . And he burned the garden of the Heart Shaped Herb.
ROSS=>Of course he did . The T'Challa turns to Ross .
ROSS=>That's what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries .
ROSS '=>They would always strike at transitions of power ... like an election year or the death of a monarch. You get control of government, the military
T'CHALLA=>Our resources . The Great Mound.
SHURI=>Our vibranium . All of my designs .
T' CHALLA=>He will send our weapons all over the world . T' Challa turns to Nakia .
T'D)=>(motioning to Shuri and
RAMONDA)=>You must get them out of Wakanda safely .
RAMONDA=>What?
SHURI=>What about you?
T'CHALLA=>The challenge will have to continue .
RAMONDA=>T' Challa , we will not leave Wakanda.
T' CHALLA=>It is my duty to keep you safe .
SHURI=>If he gets control of our technology , no where will be safe . Shuri pulls T'Challa's PANTHERTOOTHNECKLACEfrom her pocket and places it on his neck . T'Challa smiles .
SHURI=>The Black Panther lives . And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda I will be right there beside him .
NAKIA=>As will I. T'Challa smiles he looks to Nakia and Ramonda who looks back at him with confidence .
ROSS=>I'm in too. The Wakandans cut Ross a look
ROSS=>What? You're gonna need all the help you can get. The Wakandans smile at Ross as M'Baku interrupts .
M'BAKU=>Are you done? Are you - are you done?
T'CHALLA=>Could you give me and Lord M' Baku a moment? Everyone exits and M'Baku gazes at T'Challa .
T'CHALLA=>Thank you.
M'BAKU=>I owed you a great debt. A life for a life. Consider it paid .
T'CHALLA=>Please allow my mother to stay here .
M'BAKU=>No harm wi l l come to her I give you my word.
T'CHALLA=>You know I could use an army as well.
T'CHALLA=>It is our cause . It is for all of us .
M'BAKU=>Us? You are the first King to come here in centuries . And now you speak of us?
T'CHALLA=>I cannot speak for past Kings . But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn . If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next? M'Baku sits .
M'BAKU=>We will not help you . T' Challa walks out , leaving M'Baku to think .
W'KABI=>Everything is on schedule.
KILLMONGER=>Have the spies been alerted?
W'KABI=>Yes. Some have been resistant to our new mission . But the W Dogs
AR=>in London , New York and Hong Kong are standing by .
KILLMON GER=>We'll strike there first . The others will come around . Killmonger picks up a Kingsguard spear.
KILLMONGER=>Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon powerful enough to stop a tank . Untraceable by metal detectors, and we got thousands of 'em. The world's gonna find out exactly who we are . Across from them, a TALONFIGHTER takes off, loaded with cargo . Killmonger watches, then turns to W'Kabi. As they smile the talon fighter EXPLODESin the air above them, startling Killmonger, W'Kabi, Okoye and the remaining Wakandans . They watch in shock as the debris rains down from the sky . Killmonger looks closely , trying to make something out.
OKOYE=>He lives . ..
ON PANTHER=>As he walks closer to the lip of the mound and retracts his mask .
T'CHALLA=>N'Jadakalll !
GER=>Wassup?
T'CHALLA=>I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead .
KILLMONGER=>All that challenge shit is over with . I'm the King now. Get those planes in the air ! Carry out the mission !
SHURI=>Go! Go go go go go ! Come on , Ross !
KILLMONGER=>W'Kabi , kill this clown .
OKOYE=>W'Kabi , the challenge is not complete .
BORDERTRIBE COMMANDER=>What will we do? The Border Tribe soldiers look on at T'Challa and grow visibly nervous.
W'KABI=>Border Tribe !
BORDERTRIBE=>Ay ! Ay 1
W'KABI=>Phambili ! W'Kabi pulls his sword and triggers the SONIC FIELD around it . He points it towards T'Challa and the Border Tribesmen line up in a battle formation and charge towards T ' Challa .
OKOYE=>You! Your heart is so full of hatred you are not fit to be a King . She slams her spear and the Dora fall in line behind her as Killmonger stares her down . Killmonger pulls his blades, and activates his PANTHERSUIT from his necklace as Talon Fighters take off in the background .
T'CHALLA=>W'Kabi stop this ! Stop this now ! W Kabi runs on top of a large ' rock to ga i n a vantage point , and pulls out a large HORN .
NOO!!=>W'Kabi blows on the horn . We push in on the DRAGONFLYER WRECKAGEas a rumbling sound
SHUR!=>Nakia and I will get control of the Royal Talon with this .
ROSS=>Ok, so what do I do? Shuri slips a kimoyo bead bracelet on Ross ' hand .
SHUR!=>You will have to fly it .
ROSS=>What?
SHUR!=>You were a great pilot . Don't worry , I'll guide you through it . It's just like riding a hoverbike.
ROSS=>You guys have hoverbikes? Shuri raises a sand table. She hurries back to the first table , grabs the gauntlets and points out some Dora armor .
SHUR!=>Nakia, take that .
NAKIA=>I'm not a Dora.
SHUR!=>Just put it on, it's armor ! Shuri runs up the ramp . Nakia begrudgingly grabs the DORA MILAJE UNIFORMand runs after her .
SHUR!=>Good luck , Agent Ross!
ROSS=>Yea I don ' t know what I'm doing --
NAKIA=>We're counting on you!
DESIGN GROUP- DAY=>Ross paces waiting for word from Shuri or Nakia about what to do, when suddenly the SAND TABLE drops to the ground, revealing an F- 16 cockpit .
SHURI=>I made it American style for you ! Get in ! Ross hops in and starts up the ship.
SHURI/NAKIA=>Yes !!
ROSS=>Alright , I'm on it .
DOWNHILL=>T'Challa runs full speed next to RHINO #2 swings around its horn and does a takedown maneuver causing the Rhino to fall into the TRENCHleft by the wing of the TALONFIGHTER. T'Challa flips out of the trench while the Rhino is trapped by the steep incline .
NAKIA=>Wakanda Forever !! He moves towards them with rage in his eyes . He engages Shuri and Nakia in battle , Nakia holds her own with her advanced ringblades while Shuri strafes from the side with her panther gaunt l ets-- shooting Killmonger from a distance .
ROSS=>Ok Shuri , I got 'em what do I do?
ROSS=>Alright ... Ross places his hands on the firing mechanism .
ROSS=>Here goes nothing . A RED TARGETINGCURSORpops up on the display . Ross reacts , then guides the cursor over the cargo ship, and fires !
ROSS=>Alright , I got 'em.
AIRSPACE=>The DRAGONFLYER PILOTS see the cargo ship drop and turn back around towards the RTF. THREE DRAFONGFLYERS immediately begin firing at the RTF.
ROSS=>Oh shit shit shit .
IN=>air, and into a large rock .
DOWNHILL=>On the ground, Panther is suddenly swarmed by Border Tribesmen and PINNED DOWN,stabbed, kicked and slashed with blades by the mob. He sees Killmonger in the distance closing in on Shuri , and then expels the kinetic energy in his suit and . . . WHAM! ! !
T'CHALLA=>Shuri I! The DOG PILE is LAU NCHED off through the air !
KILLMON GER=>What's up, Princess?
SHUR!=>You ' ll never be a true King. Killmonger ominously edges closer and flips his broken SPEAR preparing to go in for the kill when ... Shuri DUCKSas Panther TACKLESKILLMONGER THE BACK
SHUR!=>Brother !!
T'CHALLA=>Shuri !
T'CHALLA=>Turn on the train on the bottom track!
SHUR!=>But the stabilizers will deactivate your suit ... you won't have protection !
T'CHALLA=>Neither will he.
SHURI=>Okay !
KILLMONGER=>I don't need a suit to kill you . They look at each other from across the blinding fast train .
KILLMONGER=>Your reign is over. You sat up here safe and protected.
T'CHALLA=>You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?
KILLMONGER=>No I learn from my enemies -- beat them at their own game .
T'CHALLA=>You have become them . You will destroy the world, Wakanda included .
KILLMONGER=>The world took away everything away from me! Everything I ever loved ! But I'm gonna make sure we're even.
KILLMONGER=>I'm gonna track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you , and I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt , right next to Zuri. Hatred flashes over T'Challa's eyes as he reengages his mask and the train clears. Killmonger engages his mask , and they leap at each other again .
SHURI=>Nakia! Are you alright?
NAKIA=>I'm ok . You?
SHURI=>Yes .
NAKIA=>Let's go . They join the fight with Okoye and Ayo.
ROSS=>Shuri, I've lost one of them but two are on my tail .
ROSS=>What the hell was that?
ROSS=>What? Where?
GRIOT=>Deactivating hologram . The display in front of Ross comes down, revealing A MASSIVE DRAGONFLYER FIRING SONIC BLASTS outside of the windows of the lab. Ross jumps at the sight of this . Realizing he is now sitting in a death trap.
ROSS=>How long have I got?
ROSS=>Put me back in.
W'KABI=>Surrender now ! You have three seconds to lay down your weapons !
W'KABI=>One ... two . . The sound of an attack is heard from behind W'Kabi . LOUDCHANTSseemingly come from every direction as the entire perimeter of the Border Tribe is showing signs of being breached. Shuri , Okoye , Nakia , and Ayo look around confused , as one of the interior shield holding Border Tribesmen is suddenly lifted up by his collar , his shield disappearing as a result . We tilt up to r evea l M'Baku holding him with one hand and SI X Jabari warriors behind him .
M'BAKU=>Witness the might of the Jabari firsthand ! M'Baku throws the border Tribesman into the sonic shield and we go around the horn to see the JABARI WARRIORS tearing through the border tribe perimeter with their wooden weapons. M'Baku , seeing the breaks in the interior shield calls for his troops to move forward .
M'BAKU=>Abya ! ! ! ! He jumps down from the rock followed by his troops . Okoye sees this and calls her troops forward.
OKOYE=>Phambili !!!!
M'BAKU=>Abya ! ! !
GRIOT=>Glass integrity is at 15%. The two remaining Dragonflyers shoot vibranium drills into the hobbled RTF, slowing it down and allowing the Talon Fighter to pull away . The drills send an electronic pulse into the RTF.
ROSS=>Shuril The last cargo ship is almost at the border , but they've got me trapped with some kind of cables .
SHURI=>Now break it! Ross swings his arms open.
GRIOT=>l . .. system rebooted !
ROSS=>Yes ! We did it !
SHUR!=>Great! Now get out of there! Ross gets up and heads towards the ramp in the lab , as the glass blows out.
OKOYE=>Drop your weapon .
W'KABI=>Would you kill me, my love?
OKOYE=>For Wakanda? Without question . W'Kabi sees the fire in Okoye's eyes . He looks around at the battlefie l d where the remaining Border Tribesmen are surrendering to the Jabari and Dora . W'Kabi looks at Okoye for long beat, then throws his sword into the dirt and kneels in front of her .
KILLMON GER=>This is it for you , cousin . T'Challa turns towards the train and sees that it is about to end. He lets Killmonger swing towards him and dodges , backing up even closer to the edge of the track, and Killmonger swings again - but this time T'Challa punches Killmonger's arm , jarring the blade lose and sending it flying up into the air. T'Challa then does a ROLLING ARMBAR TAKEDOWN the
AS BROKEN=>SPEAR flips through the air. We track with the spear as the SONIC STABILIZATION FIELD turns off , and the train passes the two fighters . As the BROKENSPEAR drops T'Challa catches it with his right hand and slams it into Killmonger's chest, just as both their suits form around them . Killmonger removes his helmet , then looks down at the blade that is buried in his chest . T'Challa, realizing this is it , removes his mask as well.
KILLMONGER=>Hell of a move . Killmonger struggles to breathe.
KILLMONGER=>My pops said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He promised he was going to show it to me some day . Can you believe that? Kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales. Killmonger winces from the pain . T'Challa stands and picks Killmonger up , dragging him to his feet .
KILLMONGER=>It's beautiful . T'Challa thinks for a long beat.
T'CHALLA=>Maybe we can still heal you . Killmonger thinks on this .
KILLMONGER=>Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah . Just bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships . . . 'cause they knew death was better than bondage. Killmonger pulls the knife out of his chest, killing himself instantly. T'Challa looks down at his cousin's now lifeless body and becomes emotional.
T'CHALLA=>Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family . Our nation.
NAKIA=>There is nothing to thank me for. It is our duty to . .. it was my duty to fight for what I love . I should
T'CHALLA=>You can't blame me I almost died . Nakia looks at him deeply, and kisses him back.
T'CHALLA=>Stay . I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. Nakia looks at T' Challa with curious eyes. She kisses him .
SHURI=>When you said you would take me to California for the first time, I thought you meant Coachella, or Disneyland . Why here?
T'CHALLA=>This is where our father killed our uncle. Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be demolished .
SHURI=>They are tearing it down. Good.
T'CHALLA=>They're not tearing it down . . . I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused .
T' CHALLA=>And that building , and that one over there ... This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center . Shuri smiles at the surprise.
T'CHALLA=>Nakia will oversee the social outreach ... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange . Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means.
SHURI=>You're kidding ! T'Challa hits a button on his Kimoyo bead , and the RTF comes out of cloaking , revealing itself to have been parked behind the kids playing basketball . A YOUNG BLACKKID turns back to see the ship as the other kids collectively lose their shit .
YOUNGBLACK KID=>What . ..
YOUNGBLACKKID=>Hey yo ! Is this yours?
YOUNG BLACKKID=>Who... who are you? T'Challa thinks on this and smiles .
T'CHALLA=>My name is King T'Challa , son of King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows . We cannot , we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other . Now more than ever , illusions of division threaten our very e x istence. We all know the truth : more connects us than separates us . In times of crisis , the wise build bridges , while the foolish build barriers . We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe . The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering what Wakanda could possibly have to offer .
A FRENCHAMBASSADOR=>can't help but lean into his microphone .
FRENCHAMBASSADOR=>With all due respect , King T'Challa , what can a nation of farmers offer to the rest of the world? There are a few chuckles from the gallery . Nakia , Okoye and Ayo share a look. T'Challa smiles .
SHURI=>Are you playing around with that man again?
CHILD=>No. Nol
SHURI=>You're teasing him again? Bucky exits the hut to the sight of a beautiful Wakandan lakeside. He takes it all in with a deep breath . Outside the hut are WAKANDAN SHAMAN and SHURI, embracing the three giggling CHILDREN TWODORAMILAJE observe Shuri
WAKANDANCHILDREN=>Emhlophe Ingcuka. Bucky settles next to Shuri taking in her view of the lake.
SHURI=>Good morning , Sgt . Barnes .
BUCKY=>Bucky .
SHURI=>How are you feeling?
BUCKY=>Good. Thank you. Shuri smiles.
SHURI=>Come. Much more for you to learn.
