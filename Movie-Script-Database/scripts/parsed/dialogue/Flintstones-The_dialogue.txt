THE QUARRY FOREMAN=>looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time... Millerock time! Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the workday --
ANOTHER ANGLE FRED=>YABBA DABBA DO -- ! Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only motor , slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and OVER --
MUSIC=>'Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They're a modern Stone age fam-i-ly --'
MUSIC=>'From the Town of Bedrock They're a page right Out of his-tor-y -- ' DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK
THE FLINTSTONES=>And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we -- DISSOLVE TO: AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN
A MILKMAN=>who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway. As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.
REAR OF TRUCK=>-- revealing that the back of the truck is actually a giant-jawed CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The garbage men dump the cans into its maw... it happily swallows the works, licks its lips, BELCHES. BACK TO SCENE
TORTOISE=>You can forget about a tip for Christmas...
FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES=>They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout.
LITTLE MAMMOTH=>Oh, my aching sinuses...
THE WOODPECKER=>ducks just in time. It wipes its forehead nervously.
RADIO WOODPECKER=>I hate this job... There's not even a health plan...
RADIO WOODPECKER=>Good morning, Bedrock. This is station B-R-O-K with the morning weather and news... IN THE BED
RADIO WOODPECKER=>It will be fair and mild through the weekend, continuing for the next eight hundred years, followed by cooling breezes and a protracted ice age... Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
FRED=>Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy? And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
FRED=>Dino! Dino, cut it out -- !
RADIO WOODPECKER=>In the news, Bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis.
RADIO WOODPECKER=>Ecological activist Ralph Naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal- powered civilization itself may be threatened.
FRED=>Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --
RADIO WOODPECKER=>In other news, Bedrock police report that the Xenosaurus has struck again! Yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month. Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction...
WILMA=>Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down. Your breakfast's getting cold.
FRED=>Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- !
FRED=>-- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino --
FRED=>-- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats?
WILMA=>So is everybody else in Bedrock. That kibble crisis is getting worse every day. She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of sight.
WILMA=>I'm afraid Dino's going to have to manage on leftovers from Pebbles and me.
FRED=>And what's wrong with my leftovers?
WILMA=>I'll let you know when I see some.
RADIO WOODPECKER=>... Scientists from B.C. University report that the footprints of the Xenosaurus match no known animal.
PEBBLES=>Mommy, is the bad Ze-ze-zenosaurus gonna get me and eat me up?
WILMA=>Of course not, baby.
FRED=>That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!
PEBBLES=>I'm still a little scared...
FRED=>Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.
FRED=>-- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here --
LOBSTER=>Well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant...
FRED=>Thanks, Wilma... Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye.
FRED=>Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see -- HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.
BACK TO SCENE=>Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.
WILMA=>Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.
FRED=>Yeah. What else can go wrong?
BETTY=>Come on, kids. Time for nursery school.
PEBBLES=>'Bye-bye, Daddy.
FRED=>'Bye, little sweetheart. 'Bye, big sweetheart.
BARNEY=>Nice morning, huh, Fred?
FRED=>What's nice about it?
BARNEY=>Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?
FRED=>This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?
BARNEY=>Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --
FRED=>You got fired, didn't ya?
BARNEY=>Fred, don't start on me again. I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas --
FRED=>Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on.
BARNEY=>I invented fire.
FRED=>You invented fire?
BARNEY=>I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas --
FRED=>Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?
FRED=>If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...
BARNEY=>Maybe, Fred. But first...
BARNEY=>Let me try some of that smoke on your car.
BARNEY=>-- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.
BARNEY=>-- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
FRED=>Two coo-coo berries? You made of money, Barney?
BARNEY=>Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.
FRED=>Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to --
BETTY=>... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids.
BETTY=>No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs.
MRS. GRANITE=>Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted to thank you personally.
BETTY=>You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day.
MRS. GRANITE=>No, no, I mean for all your wonderful support the past few years. It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring.
MRS. GRANITE=>On the other hand...
WILMA=>We're really going to miss you, too, Mrs. Granite.
MRS. GRANITE=>Have you found another school for the children?
BETTY=>We're still shopping around.
WILMA=>Fortunately, we're both -- Wilma and Betty straighten... salute.
BARNEY=>Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
FRED=>Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?
BARNEY=>Did I ever?
FRED=>You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney --
BARNEY=>You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
FRED=>I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.
FRED=>-- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything. Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.
FRED=>Barney. Look.
WIDE SHOT=>They're at the crest of a high wide hill.
BARNEY=>Hey. Lava Lane.
FRED=>Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.
BARNEY=>Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!
BARNEY=>Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.
FRED=>Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent?
FRED AND BARNEY BARNEY=>Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !
THE POLICE CAR=>cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
FELDSPAR=>Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day.
FRED=>Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest...
FELDSPAR=>Forget it, Flintstone. This time I got you dead to rights -- Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.
BACK TO SCENE=>Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner.
FELDSPAR=>Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws.
RADAR BIRD=>Whoa! Wings, do your stuff -- !
FRED=>Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- -- justbeonourway -- !
FELDSPAR=>Flintstone! Flintstone, come back here -- ! CUT TO:
LITTLE BIRD=>Four years in accounting school for this... INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
BETTY=>Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets?
MORRIS=>Ah, my two loveliest customers. It's this darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R... people are buying everything I got to feed their dinos...
MRS. SLATE=>Young man, if you're through flirting, I'd like some service. NEW ANGLE
MORRIS=>Of course, Mrs. Slate. Just take a number. Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile.
WILMA=>Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.
WILMA=>We met at the quarry picnic?
MRS. SLATE=>Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein.
MORRIS=>Ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher. Mrs. R, what'll it be?
BETTY=>Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks.
MORRIS=>Gino? We got any dodo bird?
GINO=>There's one left -- and it's the last one!
MORRIS=>Good. Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with this.
MORRIS=>How about you, Mrs. F?
WILMA=>I just need a few things for Fred.
MORRIS=>'Fred...'? David! Herman! Get Rob and BoBo and tell 'em to bring the big dolly!
VOICE FROM BACK=>Flintstone again, huh?
MORRIS=>You got it. Now then... Mrs. Slate? You're in a no parking zone there.
MRS. SLATE=>Well, if I get some service, I'll be out of it, won't I? Mrs. Slate steps to the counter. Meanwhile, the staff begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs, steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma.
MRS. SLATE=>I want a nice fresh, juicy chickensaurus, Morris. And not one you've had laying around on the shelf. I mean fresh.
MORRIS=>Mrs. Slate, we're kind of busy now --
MRS. SLATE=>I don't care if you're busy. What I care about is my adorable little grand nephew. He's staying with me for the summer and I intend to make his favorite dish... Southern fried chickensaurus! Now I want a fresh chickensaurus and I want it now!
MORRIS=>Boys, you heard her... she said fresh. THE STAFF
MRS. SLATE=>Morris, while you're at it, I'd like it plucked --
MRS. SLATE=>My car -- !
FRED=>Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --
NEW ANGLE=>Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.
GIRL=>Hi, Mr. Flintstone.
FRED=>Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?
GIRL=>Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.
GIRL=>Here you go. Thanks again for the football tickets. My boyfriend and I both liked them.
FRED=>My pleasure, Shirl. Anytime.
GIRL=>Okay. But do you think next time we could go to the same game?
FRED=>No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
FRED=>Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.
BARNEY=>Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.
LAVA=>Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection... it intersects here with --
SLATE=>-- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose? I've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime!
LAVA=>You'll be bankrupt in six months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.
BARNEY=>Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
WIDER=>Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in place.
PYRITE=>Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly.
PILTDOWN=>Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge. The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall. BELOW
FRED=>Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
FRED=>All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!
PILTDOWN=>Yeah? Sez who?
FRED=>Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.
PILTDOWN=>Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break. So... ... I'm breakin' some snacks.
UP ABOVE=>This time he's overdone it: The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as tightly as Indiana Jones' whip. The handrail wobbles dangerously in its foundation --
PILTDOWN'S DINO=>SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --
WIDER=>Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse. Fred runs to grab the dino's reins.
FRED=>Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot. As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
FRED=>You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!
PILTDOWN=>You've been asking for this, Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your fat butt --
FRED=>Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK
BACK TO SCENE BARNEY=>Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first.
PILTDOWN=>Why should we?
BARNEY=>It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.
FRED=>Yeah. That's right. I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it...
SLATE=>Bankrupt? Are you crazy?
LAVA=>It's all here in hack and slice. When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton. Since then, it's gone up a hundredfold. You can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos.
SLATE=>I'm two months behind schedule, my option's running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal ... meanwhile that damn union's on my back, hell, they'll probably want an eighty hour week or something... There's got to be an answer...
SLATE=>What's that?
LAVA=>Sounds like a worker's comp claim if I ever heard one...
FRED=>Barney! Grab that line! Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
THE CRANE=>THUDS into place on the dino's back -- the workers cheer --
THE WRECKING BALL=>alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an immovable object, and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS, the wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.
NEW ANGLE=>Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its path. EXT. SLATE'S OFFICE WINDOW
FRED=>Oh boy. Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.
LAVA=>Uncle, Uncle, speak to me -- But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's trophies.
SLATE=>I'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'!
BARNEY=>Hey, nice going, Fred. You even got the spare --
FRED=>Barney, shut up -- Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw.
SLATE=>For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock. Our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. And then something like this happens ... I want to know how! A cacophony of voices starts to answer.
SLATE=>Shut up! I want one person to answer me: Who's responsible for this? PILTDOWN
PILTDOWN=>It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!
PYRITE=>That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone!
BARNEY=>That's a lie, Mr. Slate!
SLATE=>Who are you?
BARNEY=>B. Rubble. White male personal reference --
SLATE=>Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes. Piltdown and Pyrite smirk.
SLATE=>Congratulations!
FRED PILTDOWN=>Huh? What?
SLATE=>This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business! It's strong -- -- Light -- -- Resilient -- It rebounds, "SPROINGING" him on the chin. He recovers, shakes it off.
SLATE=>Where on earth did you get it?
FRED=>Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?
BARNEY=>Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate.
BARNEY=>Sure, Fred, right, right. Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood.
SLATE=>The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious.
SLATE=>Light as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a child could handle this... Lava, we could cut construction costs in half... in quarters... in uh... whatchacallit --
LAVA=>Eighths --
SLATE=>Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call this stuff?
FRED=>Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- -- Barney, what do I call it?
BARNEY=>Fibrerock, Fred...
FRED=>-- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!
SLATE=>'Fibrerock'? 'Fibrerock'? 'Fib-bre-rock' --
SLATE=>I love it!
SLATE'S STAFF=>Love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know? Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney.
SLATE=>You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies.
BARNEY=>Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.
SLATE=>Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.
SLATE=>The Stone Age is over! Let the Fibre Age begin! As HEROIC MUSIC STINGS IN, we...
BETTY=>Here we are, Mrs. Slate. Sorry you had to ride in the back.
MRS. SLATE=>Not at all. I'm used to being driven around. And she's sashaying up the path. Betty and Wilma burn, then follow her.
CHILDREN=>'La hachette de ma tante est sur le roche de mon oncle -- '
HEADMISTRESS=>Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour! Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants Prehistorique Haute Superior!
MRS. SLATE=>Thank you, Marie. I ordered the hors d'oeuvres for the junior talent show. They were out of Ceolanth caviar so I got Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah, these are my, uh, friends, Wilma Flintstein --
WILMA=>Flintstone --
MRS. SLATE=>-- oh, it used to be Flintstein -- ? And this is ah, Becky... Betty!
HEADMISTRESS=>Enchante.
WILMA=>I'm sure.
BETTY=>Likewise.
HEADMISTRESS=>Well, Madame Slate, as you can see, we remain ze creme de la creme in the croissant of life known as Bedrock. Now, your leetle gran' nephew will be wiz us for two weeks, no? Here is ze application for him. An' mais oui, he weel participate in zee annual talent show, naturalment?
HEADMISTRESS=>An' your friends perhaps would like zum school applications for zere enfants?
MRS. SLATE=>Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't understand --
BETTY=>That's right, you don't understand. My husband's business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I don't mind. And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the parchments.
BETTY=>I know Bam-Bam -- -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank you oh so much.
WILMA=>Let me have one of those, too. For ma petite Pebbles.
HEADMISTRESS=>Of course. Any friend of Madame Slate is a friend of mine. As Mrs. Slate reacts, we --
BARNEY=>Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!
FRED=>Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?
BARNEY=>No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.
FRED=>Details, Barney, details... I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news... INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
WILMA=>It's not like the boys to be so late.
BETTY=>Unless they were forced to go bowling again. Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'?
WILMA=>Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible --
BETTY=>Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today...
WILMA=>No kidding. Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable --
BETTY=>I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?
WILMA=>Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and...
BETTY=>And?
WILMA=>And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can?
BETTY=>What do we tell the boys?
WILMA=>What's wrong with the truth?
BETTY=>We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand?
WILMA=>Maybe we could rephrase it... Suddenly the door bursts open. Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers.
FRED AND BARNEY=>Surprise!
BETTY=>Flowers?
WILMA=>Rock candy? That's nice, but... why?
FRED=>Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.
WILMA=>Not anymore you don't...
BARNEY=>Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
BETTY=>Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today.
BARNEY=>Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him.
FRED=>Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- !
WILMA=>Have you been drinking? In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view.
FRED=>Ready when you are. Hey, '1'... a good year.
WILMA=>Fred, there's no easy way to say this so --
FAVORING WILMA AND BETTY=>They can't believe this.
BETTY=>Boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom?
WILMA=>The non-refundable dollar signs?
BARNEY=>Plenty more where that came from.
FRED=>We see your dollar signs, ladies... and...
FRED=>... we raise them.
WILMA=>Betty... these... these look... real --
FRED=>You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world.
BARNEY=>Yeah. And nothing's ever gonna change that... right, Fred?
FRED=>Right, pal o'mine. As they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth, we --
HERDMASTER=>Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes... INT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT
HERDMASTER=>Brothers, your attention!
HERDMASTER=>The herd is now called to the prairie. Antlers... up!
ENTIRE GROUP=>Ack-ack-a-dack!
HERDMASTER=>This meeting of the Water Buffaloes is now in session. Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any old business? Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers.
BARNEY=>Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys.
PILTDOWN=>Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order.
BACK TO SCENE=>After the CRY ECHOES away:
HERDMASTER=>Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you wish to file an objection?
PILTDOWN=>You bet I do. How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'?
PYRITE=>Yeah, how come?
BARNEY=>My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down. NEW ANGLE
FRED=>Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux...
BARNEY=>-- crucible --
FRED=>-- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.
AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER=>It descends. It consists of a bent snout creature which "cranks" down a shelf with several monkeys on it. The monkeys grab the pins with their tails, straighten them up. Then the shelf cranks back up. OTHER END OF ALLEY
LODGE MEMBER=>Congratulations, Fred.
FRED=>Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.
BARNEY=>Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.
FRED=>But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches --
UNDER THE COUNTER=>where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD --
BACK TO SCENE=>Fred uses this creature to open several beers.
FRED=>Here you go, boys, nice and frosty...
"BOTTLE OPENER" CREATURE=>Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different... Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --
UNDER THE COUNTER=>The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re- covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat, exits. BACK TO SCENE
FRED=>Well, here's to...
BACK TO SCENE FRED=>Here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading. Anybody else got a toast...?
BARNEY=>'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'!
FRED=>Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that... ... at least not till after next week's election!
LODGE MEMBER=>Fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace? I thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat -- Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into his pocket.
FRED=>Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner.
PILTDOWN=>You and Slate? Who are you kidding, Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt. Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.
FRED=>Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.
PILTDOWN=>-- If I don't, you will --
FRED=>Gentlemen, my card -- He passes them out, and the others take them, curious --
LODGE MEMBERS=>Hey, way ta go, Fred... Whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy...?
PYRITE=>Ah, it's probably a phony...
BARNEY=>tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close.
BARNEY=>Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards?
FRED=>Barney, it's all part of the plan. Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse --
FRED=>-- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- '
BARNEY=>Fred, we gotta talk turkey --
FRED=>That's right -- just like that --
BARNEY=>Fred -- !
FRED=>Ah, excuse us, boys...
NEW ANGLE=>Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them.
BARNEY=>Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.
FRED=>Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?
BARNEY=>The truth?
FRED=>This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
BARNEY=>Okay.
FRED=>What do they all have in common? I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.
BARNEY=>I never knew that.
FRED=>That's because the silent partner is always silent.
FRED=>But while you're busy being silent -- -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind.
BARNEY=>I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.
FRED=>Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"... CUT TO:
BETTY=>Barney, wait a minute...
CLOSER=>He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty fixes the knot.
BETTY=>There. That looks more like a captain of industry.
BARNEY=>Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?
BETTY=>Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries.
BARNEY=>Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off... She giggles, kisses him.
FRED=>is at the car door, lunch pail in hand, when Wilma calls out to him.
WILMA=>Fred! Wait a minute! There's something wrong with your lunch --
FRED=>Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is embossed on it in gold.
WILMA=>Fit for a king... my king.
FRED=>Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it. Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.
FRED=>-- Baby, you're the greatest.
WILMA=>Good luck. Watch out for those... you know... hostile takeovers.
FRED=>I'm already taken. He moves to the car.
FRED=>Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles?
BARNEY=>Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident.
FRED=>Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned. They crack up at their own wit, drive off.
LAVA=>Ivan, look, okay, so I bought too much on margin... everyone said glaciers were here to stay, I mean, who knew? Just leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and -- what? When did that happen? Piltdown enters, knocks on the open door.
PILTDOWN=>Mister Lava, the armored car is here.
LAVA=>Armored car...?
PILTDOWN=>Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby. You know, for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's. You gotta sign here for it.
LAVA=>I... I'll get back to you.
BACK TO SCENE=>Lava signs the form, meanwhile looking Piltdown up and down. Finally --
LAVA=>Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant. I want to make one more. You've been a wonderful thug and goon for me. Now, I'd like to expand your duties. I want you to become a provocateur.
PILTDOWN=>Gee, Mister Lava, I donno. I kinda like girls myself.
LAVA=>What I mean, is, I'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a living hell.
PILTDOWN=>Oh, okay.
LAVA=>Good. You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me. Now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates.
LAVA=>Coo-coo berries... CUT TO:
BARNEY=>Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain.
FRED=>Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning.
LAVA=>Flintstone! Rubble!
BARNEY=>Oh, hi, Mister Lava.
LAVA=>Please, call me Jerry. Uncle -- I mean, Mister Slate told me to take you to your offices. If you'll follow me...?
FRED=>Hey. What's going on?
LAVA=>The Fibrerock assembly line. Unc -- Mister Slate's had a crew working on it all weekend. We're going to roll out the first sheets of Fibrerock by mid-week.
FRED=>Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.
BARNEY=>But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be --
FRED=>Hey, you're right... ... Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it.
BARNEY=>I guess so. You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer.
LAVA=>Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off. Fred and Barney go --
INSIDE TRAILER=>There're two tiny little desks at the far end, separated by a flimsy divider. The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of "Our Founder" .
BACK TO SCENE=>Fred and Barney look at all this in turn. Pause. Then they whirl, give each other high-fives.
BARNEY=>All-right!
FRED=>Welcome to the top -- partner.
BARNEY=>Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. "Fibrefoam" pours into the mold.
THE CLAY MOLD=>gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
BELOW=>Presto! A Fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score of identical sofas is in view.
END OF ASSEMBLY LINE=>as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas . Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc. UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY
SLATE=>Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone! WORKERS - FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY
BACK TO SCENE SLATE=>No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it. That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend.
THE QUARRY YARD=>The workers stand slack-jawed and stunned.
BARNEY=>Fred. You gotta do something about this!
FRED=>I do? I mean, I do, yeah!
BARNEY=>That's my Fred... INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY
INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP=>A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.
MOUSE=>Whew. And it's still pre-season. He whaps the ball to Slate again.
BACK TO SCENE=>Slate tees up the ball again. Fred barges in, banging the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a PICTURE of Mrs. Slate.
SLATE=>Flintstone!
FRED=>Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
SLATE=>We do, eh? About what?
FRED=>About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of 'em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- -- that!
SLATE=>Of course I can, Fred. I can lay them off like -- -- that, or like -- -- that, or like --
SLATE=>-- that.
FRED=>Oh, you can, huh?
LAVA=>Of course he can, Flintstone. It's his quarry.
SLATE=>That's right. Why -- I could lock the front door and go fishing if I wanted!
SLATE=>Why, I could even fire Lava here if I wanted. Lava quivers with mock surprise. Everyone really laughs, now.
SLATE=>Or... I could fire you, Fred.
FRED=>Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
SLATE=>Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start. I'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say... this isn't a good start. I'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling about... you. You want that feeling to go away, don't you?
FRED=>Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
SLATE=>Good. Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this.
WORKERS=>Well? What'd he say...? Ol' Freddie boy told him a thing or two... Probably got us a raise... Right, Fred...? Fred...?
FRED=>Akkk... something... noble... man ... job... nose... wheel... shoulder... grindstone... hommm... yggggg...
BARNEY=>Fred? Fred staggers over to his locker, opens it... gets in, and closes the door. We hear a MUFFLED SOB. A NEW ANGLE
PEBBLES=>But, Mommy, I wanna go roller skating...
BAM-BAM=>Yeagh... 'hend thugh guys wher ghoing -- -- to play rockball at Paleolithic Park -- Betty wipes Bam-Bam's mouth, smiles sweetly.
BETTY=>Well, you're both going to change your plans. Your new school is going to have a talent show... and you're going to have some talent.
WILMA=>You don't have to win... honorable mention or most Kongenial Kids is perfectly acceptable.
PEBBLES=>As long as we beat the pants offa Mrs. Slate's nephew...
WILMA=>Young lady, this is not about beating pants, this is about becoming a well rounded child. Now, what kind of act will you do?
BAM-BAM=>How about a disappearing act? He takes a tentative step away but Betty grabs him.
BETTY=>We're waiting. Pebbles and Bam-Bam sigh, huddle. We hear snatches of discussion...
PEBBLES BAM-BAM=>... Wanna recite something? Nah, what are we, little 'Inky Dinky Spidersaurus...'? kids? How 'bout magic tricks? We could cut up a newspaper --
PEBBLES=>But then we'd need a hammer BAM-BAM and chisel... oh, what about That dumb thing? You that thing with Dino? think so...? Pebbles turns, the decision made.
PEBBLES=>Okay. We're gonna sing a song with Dino. Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a straw hat and a cane. Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows it --
PEBBLES=>A one-and-a-two and-a -- WIDER
NEW ANGLE THE KIDS=>You can keep the Twist, The Frug and Hop I don't need to Shimmy, I don't need to Bop 'Cause I'm doin' doin' doin' The Igneous Rock! Panting for breath, Pebbles, Bam-Bam and Dino wait for a reaction.
BETTY=>Well? Think they're ready for the talent show?
WILMA=>I think they're ready for Rock Vegas. As they laugh and hug the kids and Dino, we -- CUT TO: EXT. LODGE HALL - THAT NIGHT
HERDMASTER=>Fellow Water Buffalo. In a few moments we will cast our votes for the lodge officers.
HERDMASTER=>The election committee will make the preparations.
FRED=>Since when do you have to prepare for a landslide, right, guys?
FRED=>Barn -- w-what's going on?
BARNEY=>They're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today -- Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
FRED=>Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes?
BARNEY=>Is that a riddle? Give me a second --
PYRITE=>I'll tell ya what! Mosta the guys in this lodge work for Mr. Slate --
PILTDOWN=>-- You mean used to work for him -- until somebody opened their big mouth --
FRED=>Fellas, come on. We're all big boys here -- He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back to the little band of brothers here.
FRED=>Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play... Job, and Lodge...
PILTDOWN=>Candidate and double-crossing back stabber? Herdmaster! I move we commence the meeting... and the election!
PYRITE=>I second the motion!
HERDMASTER=>All in favor, say --
FRED=>Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- ! Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage.
FRED=>Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. The room quiets. Barney clears his throat. Fred waits, hopeful.
BARNEY=>Well, there's not much to tell. True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.
FRED=>No, no, the rest --!
BARNEY=>Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred?
HERDMASTER=>Thank you, Brother Rubble. The Buffaloes will now have their secret vote. Fit... furs!
HERDMASTER=>Paw... ground! Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape.
HERDMASTER=>All for Piltdown, bellow now! The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS.
HERDMASTER=>All for Flintstone, bellow now!
HERDMASTER=>Order furs! The fezzes come up.
HERDMASTER=>The snorts have it! Brother Piltdown, it is my privilege to install you as the new Exalted Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come forward, I will present you with the tokens of office. Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium.
FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY=>Fred's a broken man. Barney moves over, puts his arm around him.
BARNEY=>I voted for you, Fred.
FRED=>Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.
WIDER=>Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group.
PILTDOWN=>Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few words. It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
PILTDOWN=>... and there's a time to stand up and be a man! So let's go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap... then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of Neolithic 101! Meeting adjourned!
BARNEY=>Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- !
FRED=>No kidding. They rejected the best candidate --
BARNEY=>No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line!
FRED=>Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! We could end up with half a percent of nothing!
BARNEY=>No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!
FRED=>Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em! CUT TO: EXT. SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT Silent, empty. CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the gate. Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it!
PILTDOWN=>Okay! Let's start with Slate's golf trophies and work our way up to the assembly line! AD LIB angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant, knocking aside equipment and supplies.
FRED=>I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ?
BARNEY=>I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives.
FRED=>Well, I wouldn't go that far... Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN. Fred looks back and sees --
FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL=>Coming up from rear. Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he pulls abreast of Fred.
FELDSPAR=>Flintstone! Pull over!
FRED=>Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder. Fred smiles, nods...
CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET=>He slams them down through the floorboard --
WIDER=>Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction. FELDSPAR
GRAVEL=>Sarge! Look out -- ! NEW ANGLE
NEW ANGLE=>As we see that the water spout is actually coming from the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its head up from under the broken curb.
WHALE=>I'm gonna sue you for everything you got --
PILTDOWN=>Now we'll show 'em who's boss!
PYRITE=>They can't push us around! Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody juiced up, and then... when no one is looking... ... they slip out the back! REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop -- we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse all around them.
FRED=>Barn! Did you see that -- ? -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn...
BARNEY=>Come on Fred. Time to earn those big bucks.
PYRITE=>Darn that Flintstone and Rubble... they're gonna screw everything up...
PILTDOWN=>Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital. Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below. CLOSE - PYRITE
BARNEY=>Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve ball?
PILTDOWN=>Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again. Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another see-saw motion... ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers under the beam...
NEW ANGLE=>Fred is hanging on the other end.
FRED=>Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?
FRED=>Guess not... Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.
BARNEY AND PYRITE=>Square off in the rafters.
BARNEY=>Give me your best shot. Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...
FRED=>Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.
FRED=>Dare you to cross that line.
FRED=>That line.
OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS=>Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough: The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
FRED=>is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay. THE FIBRE MOLD
BELOW=>The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down beside him.
PILTDOWN=>Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED" SHATTERS.
PILTDOWN=>Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one... CUT TO:
PYRITE=>Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head? He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls --
WIDER=>The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods.
BARNEY=>Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
FELDSPAR=>All right! You're all under arr --
BARNEY=>Whattya know. Even got the spare again...
BETTY=>Barney, I don't understand... what came over you boys?
EXITING BUFFALO=>'Night, Barney. So long, fatso. BUFFALO #2 See ya, Barn. Flintstone, you're dead meat. BUFFALO #2 'Night, pal. 'Night, slimeball.
WILMA=>Fred, is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting?
FRED=>I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway...
LAVA=>A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it --
PILTDOWN=>Hey, we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction, didn't we? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up, too?
LAVA=>The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit. If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age.
PYRITE=>Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're on top of it. They both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
BARNEY=>Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.
LAVA=>How do you know that? I mean... ah, why do you say that?
BARNEY=>It tastes different.
LAVA=>Tastes... different?
BARNEY=>Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff --
LAVA=>Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway?
BARNEY=>Nine days, Mister Lava.
LAVA=>Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down.
LAVA=>I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II -- ?
BARNEY=>But --
LAVA=>No, don't try and thank me.
LAVA=>... As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock!
SLATE=>'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! We should call them... Slate scrapers!
LAVA=>That's brilliant, Unc... Mister Slate. In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex... ... I wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle... but I just can't...
SLATE=>How about, 'Slate Needle'?
LAVA=>'Slate Need...' ... How do you keep coming up with these? It's uncanny.
SLATE=>It's a gift...
LAVA=>Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you...
LAVA=>... Oh, Mister Slate, we're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle.' Good for public relations -- Lava breaks off. He's just looked out the window and seen --
PILTDOWN=>-- who looks down at him with a big smile, Pyrite at his side.
PILTDOWN=>Can we help you... sir?
BARNEY=>Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...
PYRITE=>Our pleasure. Then they grab Barney with such force that the THERMOS drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. -- SLATE QUARRY - MAIN GATE - DAY
PILTDOWN=>Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants! Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava, who has come out of the office building.
LAVA=>That takes care of the half-pint. Now to deal with the half-wit. CUT TO: INT. LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room.
FRED=>... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam --
LAVA=>-- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall.
LAVA=>Flintstone, that... that's a slap in the face of our founder... our employer... our uncle. Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that I'm not capable of running it?
FRED=>Of course not, Mister Lava. But --
LAVA=>Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says --
LAVA=>... Cigar?
FRED=>Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.
LAVA=>Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks... ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars. He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk.
LIZARD=>When they say smoking is bad for your health, they're not kidding...
BACK TO SCENE LAVA=>And others? Wellll...
LAVA=>... Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock...
FRED=>Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say...
LAVA=>Yes?
FRED=>... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of --
LAVA=>You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties?
FRED=>Well, gee, that's tough one -- -- Uh, what are my important duties?
LAVA=>Publicity, Flintstone, publicity!
LAVA=>And that's why I've got a little surprise for you... for the man who made Fibrerock a household word, I want you to meet the man who's going to make you a household word...
FRED=>R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.
LEACH=>'Ello, Fred. I've 'eard a lot h'about you from Mister Lava. H'at's why we're going to put you on our program.
FRED=>M-me? On -- on television?
LAVA=>Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney.
FRED=>Barney who?
LEACH=>Hmm. Lovely little guest 'ouse, Mister Flintstone. So simple, so ordinary, so unexceptional... why, h'it's almost quaint. Let's say we start with the camera 'ere, except...
FRED=>W-what's wrong?
LEACH=>Well, just look at that yard over there... barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image...
FRED=>Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?
LEACH=>Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin' with those greens. The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
WILMA=>Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don't even know. Now what's going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses?
FRED=>It's the Rubble yard, Wilma. It's just not the right image... He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure. BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
BETTY=>I don't know why you want to go to this thing... after the way Fred's been treating you lately --
BARNEY=>Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him.
BETTY=>Yeah... and it's all around his belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma I wouldn't give him the Geological Time --
BARNEY=>Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see -- THEIR POV - THE FENCE The television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.
BIRD=>I've heard of a flash in the pan, but this is ridiculous...
ANNOUNCER=>And now... the man who brings you the romance and excitement you crave... from the casinos of Monte Carlrock to the glamour of Hollyrock, here's your guide to the Rockstyles of the Rich and Famous, Rockin' Leach! Leach takes his cue from the director --
LEACH=>Good evening. Tonight we come to you live from the ah... charming pied a terre of the man of the 'our, Fred Flintstone -- Leach pauses, hearing the sound of someone CHIPPING AWAY at a stone tablet... he looks up at -- HIS POV - FRED He has just carved "FREDERICK" into a stone cue card and points to it. BACK TO SCENE
LEACH=>'Ere we are at the 'ome of Bedrock's man o' the 'our, Frederick Flint-- More CHIPPING. Leach looks up and sees:
LEACH=>'Ere we are at the fabulous 'ome of Bedrock's man o' the 'our, Frederick von Flintstone --
NEAR THE HOUSE=>Barney and Betty appear, Bam-Bam in tow. They come out into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who comes over, whispers.
WILMA=>Thank heaven. There isn't one person I know here.
BARNEY=>You mean beside Fred?
WILMA=>I mean including Fred. They look over at --
THE SET=>Where Leach has pulled Fred on camera. Fred is posing, fluffing his ascot, etc. We notice a "FVF" embroidered patch on his jacket.
LEACH=>Frederick, of course, is the man behind Fibrerock -- the invention that some predict will revolutionize life in the future. Frederick, 'ow does it feel to know that you 'ave personally brought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end?
FRED=>Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock...
WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY=>react with hopeful expressions --
BARNEY=>See? What'd I tell ya?
BACK TO SCENE FRED=>No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction... WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY
POINDEXTER=>Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you promise I can cut in all the lines?
LAVA=>Of course, Poindexter, of course. They head for the mastodon and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. . Lava gives them a big look. They nod. As the elevator rises, his two cronies duck into a stairwell marked "NO ADMITTANCE."
FRED=>Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it...
GUEST=>Hello, Frank...
FRED=>Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that --
WILMA=>Fred, can I talk to you -- ? Fred? Fred? We have a serious problem with Betty and Barney.
FRED=>You mean you can see their house -- ?
WILMA=>I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count?
FRED=>Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success...
FRED=>... But deep down inside, I'm still the same lovable guy you married -- -- Frederick von Flintstone the third --
WILMA=>Arrrgh -- !
FRED=>What'd I say?
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT=>Hangs up the sea shell phone, runs over to Leach.
P.A.=>That was our location guy at Slate City. They just moved the ribbon cutting up by an hour. Guests are already starting to arrive.
LEACH=>Fabulous! I've 'ad enough crab meat and crabgrass to last me a year. All right, boys, that's a wrap!
FRED=>In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him.
FRED=>... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha...
FRED=>... Hey, whoa, what's happening --
LEACH'S AIDE=>What's happening isn't happening here. The action's over at Slate City. Oh, thanks for the booze, Ed --
FRED=>Fred! He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at elbows.
FRED=>Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him.
WILMA=>Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
FRED=>Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here.
WILMA=>Fred...
FRED=>You go on over to Slate City, okay?
WILMA=>Fred, I want to be here with you --
FRED=>Nah, me and some of the guys from the country club, we're gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on anyway... and I wouldn't want people to think... to think the Flintstones were party poopers.
WILMA=>Come on, Pebbles. We're going to another party.
PEBBLES=>Will there be real food there?
WILMA=>We'll find out together. She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.
BETTY=>Wilma, wait. I'm going with you.
WILMA=>Why?
BETTY=>If friends can't do something stupid, who can? Wilma smiles, touched.
BETTY=>Besides... ... Maybe if we leave the boys alone...?
FRED=>Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend.
BACK TO SCENE=>Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters; the potted plants go flying.
FRED=>His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with dirt... then he sees -- NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --
FRED=>B... Barney?
BARNEY=>Hiya, Fred. Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad... ... You feeling better, pal?
FRED=>'Pal'? How can you call me that? Barney, I... I've been such a... such a... such a...
BARNEY=>Creep?
FRED=>Well, yeah. But more of a --
BARNEY=>Fool?
FRED=>Well --
BARNEY=>Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
FRED=>Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?
BARNEY=>Sure, Fred. I've had lots of practice.
FRED=>Aw, Barn... And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys. CUT TO:
RECORDING=>Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous world of tomorrow... a world brought to you by Fibrerock!
REVERSE ANGLE=>REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human family is a veritable family of monkeys, all working the figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted microphone is giving the narration.
PARROT=>Here, we see a typical family of the future, free of the cares and worries of today... yes, the great kibble crisis is a thing of the past when you're living the good life... the Fibrelife! NEXT EXHIBIT
ANOTHER PARROT=>Here, gathered from the four corners of the globe, are the secret ingredients of Fibrerock... some common, some rare... all making life easier for you and yours! THIRD EXHIBIT
FASHION PARROT=>But does Fibrerock belong only in the kitchen, the garage, the workplace? No, no, no, my darlings!
FASHION MODELS ON RUNWAY=>As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend of the future and retro .
FASHION PARROT=>Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed... by Fibre furs... Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations and Fibreshoes... it's to die for!
FOURTH EXHIBIT=>Now, we see a display of Fibrerock props of all kinds -- appliances, toys, tools, etc... all of it upstaged by a choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals all sing in unison --
FIBRE CHOIR=>'It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know -- ' CUT TO: INT. BARNEY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and are singing. FRED & BARNEY 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High!'
FRED=>Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.
BARNEY=>Yeah. Too bad we never made the team.
FRED=>So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?
BARNEY=>You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it. There they are.
FRED=>Boy. Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem.
FRED=>Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries...
BARNEY=>Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.
FRED=>What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us?
FRED=>All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile --
FRED=>-- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.
BARNEY=>Yeah? When did you notice that?
FRED=>About an hour ago.
BARNEY=>Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart.
FRED=>Wha... what's happening?
BARNEY=>I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...
FRED=>Your old models are just fine...
ANGLE=>Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days are rock solid. BACK TO SCENE
BARNEY=>It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
BARNEY=>-- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!
FRED=>What's it?
BARNEY=>Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
FRED=>But.. why would --
BARNEY=>Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
FRED=>-- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!
BARNEY=>Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- !
FRED=>Then... what's happening here...
BARNEY=>... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City!
FRED=>Oh no... Barney! Wilma and Betty -- and the kids -- they're all there -- With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.
FRED=>-- B-barney... what do we do?
BARNEY=>Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model "Slate City"... CUT TO:
LAVA=>You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you.
WILMA=>Uh... thank you... I think.
LAVA=>Yes. I think so, too. Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive.
WILMA=>Oh? Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge.
HEADMISTRESS=>Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An' sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze mos' fantas'tic recital in Bedrock 'istoree. Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.
HEADMISTRESS=>-- An' now, what better introduction could we 'ave for Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran' nephew... Poindexter Lava! She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter. He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins to play:
POINDEXTER=>'Dino of Spain, I adore you Right from the moment I saw you -- '
FRED=>What'll we do when we get there?
BARNEY=>We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops!
FRED=>Barney -- ! -- I can't see straight --
BARNEY=>Hang on, hang on --
FELDSPAR=>Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate... Dirty Harock... Magma, P.I. And you know why? 'Cause they got the breaks, that's why!
BACK TO SCENE GRAVEL=>S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy -- !
FELDSPAR=>There's a lesson there, Gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. Besides -- -- Did you say 'creature'?
FELDSPAR=>This is a xenosaurus alert. Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit of the Venturock Freeway! It is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male Caucasian. Car twelve is in hot pursuit. He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look.
FELDSPAR=>Oh, yeay... over and out!
DISPATCH PARAKEET=>Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way. Car Twelve is on the way...
FELDSPAR=>Gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us! Load the shotgun and turn on the siren!
FRED=>Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore! Suddenly both men react to an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --
FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR=>Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth CAT and is "cranking" its tail. As it WAILS away, the cops close in on our heroes. BACK TO SCENE
FRED=>Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah! Haybee whee hould shtop -- ?
BARNEY=>What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late!
FRED=>'Hen yore height, yore height... Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn. CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.
NEW ANGLE=>Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.
BARNEY=>We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- !
FRED=>'Ood hidea. Ood whuk, ol' bhudee. They slap hands together like basketball players, then head off in two directions.
HEADMISTRESS=>Sank you, sank you. Our nex' performance is Bam-Bam, Pebbles... ... an' friend. She steps aside as a spotlight picks out --
KIDS=>You can keep the twist, the frug and hop --
VARIOUS ANGLES=>As the Dino dance begins, FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT. The audience seems to really like it -- all except --
MRS. SLATE=>who glances over at the judges long enough to see that they like this a lot better than the accordion act. Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The
MUSIC DIES. HEADMISTRESS=>Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?
MRS. SLATE=>I'll tell you what's wrong! This 'act' is an absolute disgrace! This is supposed to be a talent show! And a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus!
BETTY=>A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his --
WILMA=>Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be!
MRS. SLATE=>Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore!
MRS. SLATE=>Ah... Poindexter... that's enough ... Poindexter...?
SLATE=>Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment. HIS POV - SLATE CITY
GRAVEL=>No sign of the driver...
FELDSPAR=>You kidding? By now he's a couple of shinbones and a belch. Gravel drops down on one knee, excited. He shines his light on Fred's big "clawprints."
GRAVEL=>Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep these tracks are! That xeno thing must weigh a ton! They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with -- NEW ANGLE - FRED
FELDSPAR=>Okay, lizard, reach for the sky! Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.
FRED=>Offisser Fledapar, het me hexpwain -- his howse hiss maid uv fibahwock -- He reaches out to tap the nearby wall and -- WHAM -- it collapses all around him, leaving a gaping hole in the house!
FELDSPAR=>Quivering quartzite, d-did you see that --
GRAVEL=>O-one flick of his paw... and he knocked down a wall -- !
FRED=>Nogh, wate, chum baggk -- As Fred "roars" and moves forward, Feldspar and Gravel scream, panic, and run!
FRED=>Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.
INSIDE THE SLATE NEEDLE=>Everyone is rocking back and forth with the escalating vibrations of the swaying building. The remaining table of refreshments slides across the room.
POINDEXTER LAVA=>gets hit full force by a flying cake shaped like Slate City. He falls on top of his accordion, smashing it with one last dissonant squeeze.
PARTYGOERS=>They pause in their panic to applaud gratefully.
FRED=>Barney! The elevator -- !
OTHER SIDE OF WALL=>REVEALING elevator mechanism. The button pokes a mouse which runs out of a box. Seeing the mouse, a nearby mastadon becomes frightened, begins running. A heavy cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into --
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT=>-- where the elevator rises out of the sub-level and INTO VIEW! Fred and Barny start towards it... when suddenly the Fibrerock elevator begins to crumble!
FRED=>Quick! Use your coo-coo gun -- !
CHIEF=>Feldspar, if you ask me, you've seen too many Rockzilla movies: In all the Xenosaurus sightings we've had reported, not one has had this kind of wholesale destruction --
FELDSPAR=>Chief, you -- you gotta believe me -- just one swipe of its paw and -- wham -- a whole house was pre-history -- ! Suddenly one of those police DISPATCH PARAKEETS comes flying excitedly through the window, lands on a perch in front of the Chief.
DISPATCH PARAKEET=>Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Unconfirmed reports of destruction and collapse at Slate City. Rescue vehicles are on the way. The xenosaurus has been spotted in the area. That is all. That is all.
FELDSPAR=>You see -- ? I told you --
CHIEF=>All right, Feldspar, I'm convinced! As of this moment you're completely in charge of operation... ... 'Xeno Dino'! Now, what do you need? CAMERA TIGHTENS ON Feldspar. This is the moment he's waited for all his life.
FELDSPAR=>Artillery.
BARNEY=>Fred, stop it! It might know the way inside! Fred "gets up to speed" and chases the xeno. Barney follows.
NEW ANGLE=>Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall -- INT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
WILMA BETTY=>Fred? Barney?
PEBBLES BAM-BAM=>Daddy! Pop!
FRED BARNEY=>Piltdown? Pyrite?
SLATE=>What the devil's going on here?
FRED=>It's real simple, Mister Slate. Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it!
LAVA=>That's ridiculous, Flintstone! Nobody could get that many coo-coo berries off our premises!
THE SCENE BETTY=>These sure look like coo-coo berries to me --
LAVA=>They're convincing fakes, Mrs. Rubble -- part of our exciting display --
PYRITE=>Fakes? Gee, Pilty, I thought the real ones were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal -- whatta waste a time --
PILTDOWN=>Pyrite, shaddup --
FRED=>Now I remember! These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant! What's this, Lava... 'Plan B'?
LAVA=>Uncle! Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family? This is absurd --
SLATE=>Of course it is! Why, without the coo-coo berry sap, Fibrerock would be completely -- -- unstable...
LAVA=>All right, all right, I admit it! I got in over my head in the stock market... took some big losses... I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day, I guess I just lost my head... I figured with the Woca sap in the Fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous...
SLATE=>I'll tell you what's superfluous, Lava... your liver! So why don't we remove it -- ! He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems -- CUT TO: EXT. SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt, CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue workers jump out. Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the ladders. CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK
FIRE CHIEF=>Come on, come on, what's the hold up -- ?
FIREFIGHTER=>It's the kibble crisis, sir -- the firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month! Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.
IN THE SLATE NEEDLE=>Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads.
WILMA=>Fred! There's a fire hose -- !
GRACE=>-- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies. BETTY
BAM-BAM=>D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
BARNEY=>Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred?
FRED=>Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
FRED=>-- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all --
BARNEY=>It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten.
BARNEY=>-- Okay?
FRED=>Hist hust fine! He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS --
IN THE BOX=>A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside, SNORING.
IN THE MAIN ROOM=>Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir.
WITH FRED=>Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room. Water shoots out of the creature's mouth. WIDER
FRED=>Hit fuzz nudding... wheely... The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
PYTHONSAURUS=>Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
BARNEY=>Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came! Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
POINDEXTER=>Outta the way -- outta the way -- women and children first -- ! I mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah, provided that uh, there's room for the women...
PYTHONSAURUS=>Hey, not bad. Wonder if she lives around here.
PYTHONSAURUS=>Heartbreaker!
UP ABOVE=>Already the first partygoers are sliding down the elevator cable.
HEADMISTRESS=>Oh, geez, we're all gonna croak -- I neva shoulda left Far Rockaway -- Wilma gives her a big suspicious look -- blanching, the Headmistress slides down the cable --
BELOW=>The rescue teams catch the people in nets as they hit the ground. ABOVE
POINDEXTER=>Fifty clams for a piggy-back ride ... a hundred clams!
MRS. SLATE=>Do you see that, Jerry? Do you see how my great-nephew is behaving at this moment of crisis?
LAVA=>Yeah. Real chip off the old block, ain't he? Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck, practically throws him at the cable. She follows him down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate. REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE
FRED=>Upsy-daisy, sweetheart -- piggy back time! She jumps on his back... slamming the monster head back in place.
FRED=>Hohh... GWEAT!
BARNEY=>Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!
BETTY=>Barney... tonight you're the biggest man in Bedrock.

BACK UPSTAIRS FRED=>Lhet's dogh it!
BELOW=>Everyone reacts in horror -- ABOVE
CLOSER=>Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do. BELOW
WILMA AND BETTY=>Suddenly become inspired.
BETTY=>W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo... those wires... do you think -- ?
WILMA=>Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down here -- !
DINO=>Obeys, puzzled --
WILMA AND BETTY=>You can keep the twist, the frug and hop I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop -- BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends. ANOTHER ANGLE
LONG SHOT=>-- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up!
WILMA AND BETTY=>Yes, I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop 'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin' THE IGNEOUS ROCK!
FRED=>rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees -- HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS
FELDSPAR=>It's the xenosaurus -- stand back, men -- it's a vicious killer -- Ready -- Aim --
FRED=>High ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman beeng -- ! BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface. CLOSE - FRED Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire! DINO
WIDER=>Pause.
GRAVEL=>Hey, those are the biggest shorts I've ever seen... ... It... it must be Mister Flintstone! Cease fire! Gee, Sarge, now you don't have to shoot him -- !
POINDEXTER=>Dad! Dad! Can I use the Porscherock while you're in the slammer? Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
SLATE=>Flintstone. Rubble. I... I don't know what to say. I... I treated you horribly... I ignored you, abused you... and then you come here and risk your necks like this... well, there's no price you can put on something like that, so I won't even try. But let me give you... ... a hearty handshake.
MRS. SLATE=>Dear, don't you think a little more than that is in order?
SLATE=>Honey, you're being hysterical, go lie down, okay?
MRS. SLATE=>I am not being hysterical, I am being fair -- now the Flintsteins and Rabbles saved all of our lives, not to mention your reputation.
SLATE=>Okay, okay. Boys, I'm feeling guilty about how you've been taken advantage of, so I'll tell you what... I'm going to give you back all world-wide rights to Fibrerock, free and clear. He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.
SLATE=>Your only obligation will be to cover oh, whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time...
BARNEY=>You think there's gonna be some? Slate looks around at -- HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see. As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City collapse, crushing a police car. BACK TO SCENE
SLATE=>Oh, you never know...
RESCUE DINOS=>Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of Fibrerock crumbs.
FRED=>Barn...? What's going on?
BARNEY=>Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... ... Fred, this... this is Dino kibble!
FRED=>Dino kibble...? Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...
FRED=>Dhinough khibble!! He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract Slate wrote on.
FRED=>Barney, we -- we're rich! Yabba dabba do -- !
SLATE=>Faints dead away! The CAMERA PULLS BACK... BACK... BACK -- EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
MUSIC=>We'll have a yabba dabba-do time A dabba-do time We'll have a gay old time!
FRED=>Wilma...? ... Wilma? CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil- houette banging on the door.
FRED=>Wilma? Wil-ma --!
