OLD WOMAN=>Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?
OLD MAN=>Who the hell knows. What you have in your mouth?
OLD MAN=>Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth out ... doctor said. What you tryin to do? SPIT IT OUT!!!
MARIETTA=>Hello... Who is this?...
SAILOR=>...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
MARIETTA=>Theres no way in hell you can speak to her and...
SAILOR=>What?...
MARIETTA=>...Yes you heard me... Dont ever call back here again.
LULA=>Mama???
MARIETTA=>You know who it was and you know you arent, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
LULA=>Like hell.
TEENAGERS=>EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
BEANY=>I can dig this music... But not that singer.
LULA=>Why?... Hes right in the groove.
BEANY=>Hes so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type.
LULA=>Seeins how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, dont know how you can criticize.
BEANY=>Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, hes a liar.
BEANY=>So, Sailors gettin out soon, and youre gonna see him?
LULA=>Meetin him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mamas hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
BEANY=>I didnt hate me so much, Id feel better wishin you luck.
LULA=>Cant all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadnt kicked his ass out.
BEANY=>So youre gonna be needin the blue-bird pretty soon?
LULA=>Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
MARIETTA=>Wheres Johnnie? Hes not in his office.
BARTENDER=>Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.
MARIETTA=>Well I gotta find him - right this minute!
LULA=>Hey baby...
SAILOR=>Peanut...
SAILOR=>Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
LULA=>Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermads at The Hurricane.
SAILOR=>Stab it and steer.
LULA=>Did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in?... Did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone?
SAILOR=>I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is Gods own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin?
LULA=>Well, I was thinkin about smokin actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now Ive just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? Theyre longer.
SAILOR=>I guess I started smokin when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
LULA=>What brandd she smoke?
SAILOR=>Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
LULA=>Gee, Sailor. Im sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
SAILOR=>Its okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didnt have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin. He was a good ol boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
LULA=>Id stand by you, Sailor ... through anything.
SAILOR=>Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man cant ask for more than that.
LULA=>You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest.
SAILOR=>Youre perfect for me, too.
LULA=>You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
SAILOR=>In a fire, as I recall.
LULA=>Started he couldnt remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask... But I dont know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
CLYDE=>FUCKIN BITCH!!!!
LULA=>Finally in the middle of the one night, with me and mama asleep upstairs ... he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match.
LULA=>Near burned down the house. We got out just in time.
LULA=>It was a year before I met you.
SAILOR=>You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
LULA=>Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
MARIETTA=>I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble. Hes just got some kind of influence over her I cant decipher. Theres somethin wild in Lula I dont know where it comes from. You gotta find em, Johnnie.
JOHNNIE=>He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there aint much can be done about it.
MARIETTA=>Dont talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and thats why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! Hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead. Youd only be defendin yourself, and with his record, nobodyd fuss.
JOHNNIE=>Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if shes with the Ripley boy, Ill give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me. Thats about all I can do.
MARIETTA=>Ill hire a hit man if you dont want to help me stop this thing. Ill call Marcello Santos.
JOHNNIE=>Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you. And dont be gettin carried away. You dont want to be bringin Santos and his people into it.
MARIETTA=>Youre just jealous of Santos cause hes sweet on me.
JOHNNIE=>Darlin, you aint seein Santos again, are ya?
MARIETTA=>Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Dont you trust your very own Marietta?
JOHNNIE=>Sorry, sweetheart. Bein in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
MARIETTA=>Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
JOHNNIE=>Sailor aint a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And fars I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin Lula. Even there he was protectin her. You oughta be thankin him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin after the both of em. Why am I tellin you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
MARIETTA=>Maybe I was there, but I didnt see anythin. All I knows that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now probly all over my baby!
JOHNNIE=>Marietta, settle down now darlin... I want whats best for her, too - Like I said, Ill do what I can to bring her home.
LULA=>Sailor, you are somethin else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon Id be startin to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
SAILOR=>But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
LULA=>Thats true. Uncle Pooch wasnt really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddys? And my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure. His real name was somethin kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised moren a little.
SAILOR=>Howd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
LULA=>Youre terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
SAILOR=>I cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
LULA=>I said you can be too crude sometimes? I dont think I care for it.
SAILOR=>Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
LULA=>Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
LULA=>Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
SAILOR=>Didnt he say somethin?
LULA=>Not really. Least not so I recall now.
SAILOR=>So howd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
LULA=>No, he picked me up.
LULA=>He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
SAILOR=>We did it? Whattaya mean? Didnt he force you?
LULA=>Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess theres all different kinds of rapes. I didnt exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didnt seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich.
SAILOR=>And you never told nobody about it?
LULA=>Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
LULA=>Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space...
SAILOR=>Here she goes again...
LULA=>Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin. Seems to me the government could do somethin about it. One of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
SAILOR=>That aint never will happen, honey. Least not in our lifetime.
SAILOR=>You okay, honey?
LULA=>That womans laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin like that... somewhere before... Soundd like the wicked witch...
SAILOR=>Just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me... You ready to dance?
LULA=>Im always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
SANTOS=>I knew youd want it again...
MARIETTA=>Thats not why I called.
SANTOS=>Oh yeah - sure ... okay.
MARIETTA=>Santos... It isnt.
SANTOS=>Have it your way... But you want it.
MARIETTA=>Lulas gone off with Sailor.
SANTOS=>What do you want me to do about it?
MARIETTA=>I want you to take care of Sailor, so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again.
SANTOS=>Take care of him?
MARIETTA=>Yes.
SANTOS=>What does take care of him mean?... Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
MARIETTA=>Whats with you?... You know what take care of him means. I dont call Santos except for one big reason.
SANTOS=>Big is the key word, and Im telling you I want it bad.
MARIETTA=>I want you to get rid of Sailor.
SANTOS=>Get rid of him?
MARIETTA=>Yes... Get rid of him.
SANTOS=>How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
MARIETTA=>Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game?
SANTOS=>Just tell me what you want.
MARIETTA=>I dont need to explain anymoren I have... You know damn well.
SANTOS=>You need to explain it.
MARIETTA=>All right... I want you ... to ... kill ... Sailor... As simple as that.
SANTOS=>Simple? Kill him?... How?
MARIETTA=>Thats your business... I dont care how.
SANTOS=>Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
MARIETTA=>NO... For Gods sakes, Santos!
SANTOS=>Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
MARIETTA=>Santos...
SANTOS=>Explain it... I told you.
MARIETTA=>Shoot him.
SANTOS=>Shoot him? Like with a gun?
MARIETTA=>Yes.
SANTOS=>Where?... In the leg?
MARIETTA=>No.
SANTOS=>Where?
MARIETTA=>In the head.
SANTOS=>Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now Im beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
MARIETTA=>Yes.
SANTOS=>But where in the head?... Not the chin, I hope.
MARIETTA=>No... In the brains... What little Im sure he has.
SANTOS=>You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
MARIETTA=>Yes.
SANTOS=>Through the forehead?
MARIETTA=>Yes.
SANTOS=>Wrong! Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
MARIETTA=>See! I knew you had it all under control.
SANTOS=>Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?
MARIETTA=>Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town.
SANTOS=>On one condition...
SANTOS=>You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
MARIETTA=>Santos... No... Please, Santos...
SANTOS=>Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him?
MARIETTA=>No... But...
SANTOS=>One day hes gonna find out what were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
SANTOS=>Im gonna take your silence as a yes...
MARIETTA=>Santos... I cant...
SANTOS=>Shhhh... Its all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
MARIETTA=>You fucker, dont you ever touch Lula - You fucker, Ill kill you.
SANTOS=>Put your shoulders back.
MARIETTA=>What?
SANTOS=>Put your shoulders back, I said.
SANTOS=>You got nice tits.
MARIETTA=>Someones gonna see us.
SANTOS=>Thats just another part of the price to pay.
MARIETTA=>Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me.
SANTOS=>Look at me... Theres no turning back on this... Im gonna kill Sailor... Thats for sure.
SAILOR=>Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
IDIOT PUNK=>Dont fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
SAILOR=>This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
IDIOT PUNK=>...Asshole.
SAILOR=>Come here.
LULA=>Sailor, honey...
SAILOR=>Im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
IDIOT PUNK=>Im sorry.
LULA=>Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
SAILOR=>Thats good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Yall know this one?...
LULA=>Why didnt ya sing Love Me Tender? ... You told me that was your favorite love song.
SAILOR=>Cause Im only gonna sing that song to my wife.
LULA=>What you want to watch this trash for? Aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
SAILOR=>That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
LULA=>What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
LULA=>Whats that honey?
SAILOR=>We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
LULA=>Im sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
SAILOR=>Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Dont need to make moren it was. This couples goin on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
LULA=>Dont the reject guys get anythin?
SAILOR=>Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
LULA=>That dont seem fair.
SAILOR=>Hell, why should the Datin Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin to eat.
LULA=>Sailor?
SAILOR=>Yeah?
LULA=>Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
SAILOR=>You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Aint we been doin a pretty fair job this far?
LULA=>Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? Itd make the future so simple and nice.
SAILOR=>At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin out? And what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again.
LULA=>I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
SAILOR=>It aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I aint too proud of, but Ill tell ya from now on I aint gonna do nothin for no good reason. All I know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there.
LULA=>You know theres somethin I aint never told you about, Sailor, and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen... When I was almost sixteen I got pregnant.
SAILOR=>Musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
LULA=>She got me an abortion...
LULA=>...from some old doctor with the hairiest nostrils and ears I ever seen.
LULA=>Afterwards... Momma says...
LULA=>...I hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars, not countin what it cost us to get here and back... This mans the best damn abortionist in the South.
SAILOR=>You tell the boy who knocked you up?
LULA=>It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
SAILOR=>What happened to him?
LULA=>Oh, nothin. I never let on to mama about Dell bein the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didnt tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didnt see the point. Somethin terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
SAILOR=>Whats that, peanut?
LULA=>Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin a hard lesson. What I learned from observin Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. Hed startin behavin weird? Like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin?
DELL=>Howre ya doin?
LULA=>And just seemin real spacey and actin funny.
SAILOR=>Actin funny how?
LULA=>Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dells mama? She found cockroaches in Dells underwear.
LULA=>One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus?
SAILOR=>Hell, peanut...
LULA=>One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen.
AUNT ROOTIE=>Whatre ya doin?
DELL=>Makin my lunch!!!
LULA=>Dell told her he was makin his lunch and goin to work. Hes a welder? And she made him go back to bed.
LULA=>Then hed carry on about the weather? Talk about how rainfalls controlled by aliens livin on earth. Also how men wearin black leather gloves...
LULA=>...are followin him around.
SAILOR=>Probly the rain boys from Outer Space.
LULA=>It aint so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
LULA=>The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind. Nobodys seen him since.
SAILOR=>Sound like ol Dells moren just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldnt visit that ol Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
LULA=>Too bad we all cant, baby... One thing about Dell?
SAILOR=>Whats that?
LULA=>When he was about seventeen, he startin losin his hair.
SAILOR=>So?
LULA=>Hes twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be bout bald.
SAILOR=>Theres worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
LULA=>Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin baby, hair does make a difference.
LULA=>I sure am glad they didnt give you no prison haircut... Gives me somethin to grab hold of while were makin love?
SAILOR=>Lets go dancin, peanut. Im ready.
LULA=>We gotta be careful, honey, my mamas gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and hes one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
SAILOR=>One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... Youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart? Puttin a detective on us. Ill tell ya Lula... Well... Its moren me killin Bob Ray Lemon...
LULA=>Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
SAILOR=>Yeah, maybe...
MARIETTA=>Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lulas mama?...
SAILOR=>No.
MARIETTA=>Well, she wants to fuck you.
OLD MAN=>Lousy fuckin homosexuals...
SAILOR=>What are you, sick?... Im with Lula.
MARIETTA=>No... I just wanted to kiss you good-bye... You know too much bout little Lulas mom...
SAILOR=>Whattya mean?
MARIETTA=>Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
SAILOR=>So?
MARIETTA=>So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And youre gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, youre shit... Dyou think Id let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
SAILOR=>Youre gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
MARIETTA=>Oh, dont worry bout that...
SAILOR=>Its a problm I dont thinks gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, Im thinkin of breakin parole and takin you out to sunny California.
LULA=>Sailor!
SAILOR=>You up for that?
LULA=>Id got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
SAILOR=>Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin to do.
LULA=>...Thats an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
SAILOR=>Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
LULA=>You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
LULA=>Take a picture, bitch... Itll last longer.
GIRL=>Oh yeah?
LULA=>Ill slap those eyes right outta your head.
LULA=>Sorry, baby... Whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin?
SAILOR=>Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kids house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
SAILOR=>She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
LULA=>Whatd you say to her?
SAILOR=>Told her my name. Then she said somethin like, Its so noisy down here. Why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves? She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
SAILOR=>When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
LULA=>Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
SAILOR=>Thats just what she said. I had a boner with a capital O. I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg?
LULA=>You mean like pedal pushers?
SAILOR=>I guess.
SAILOR=>She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
LULA=>Youre excitin me, honey. Whatd she do?
SAILOR=>Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, I wont suck you. Dont ask me to suck you.
LULA=>Poor baby. She dont know what she missed. What color hair she have?
SAILOR=>Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
IRMA=>Take a bite of peach.
LULA=>Jesus, honey! You moren sorta got what you come for... You better rum me back to the hotel, baby... You got me hottern Georgia asphalt.
SAILOR=>Say no more... But go easy on me, sweetheart... Tomorrow we got alotta drivin to do. Hottern Georgia asphalt?
LULA=>Ill drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I dont want her to worry no moren necessary.
SAILOR=>What do you mean by necessary? Shes probly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
LULA=>I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I dont figure she counted on us takin off together like this... I guess this means youre breakin parole, then?
SAILOR=>You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
LULA=>Whatll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it dont rain much there.
SAILOR=>You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
LULA=>We got through two states already.
SAILOR=>That dont smell like a More.
LULA=>It aint. Its part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
SAILOR=>They sure do stink.
LULA=>Yeah, I guess, but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you.
SAILOR=>You aint gonna begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin state lines with a A- Number One certified murderer.
LULA=>Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Dont exaggerate.
SAILOR=>Okay, manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned.
LULA=>Thank the Lord. Well, you aint let me down yet, Sailor. Thats moren I can say for the rest of the world?
SAILOR=>You please me, too, peanut.
SAILOR=>Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
LULA=>What kinda trash talk is that?
SAILOR=>What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
LULA=>Thats disgustin. Those kinda sentiments shouldnt be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
SAILOR=>Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
LULA=>Got anyplace special in mind?
SAILOR=>We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farraguts on our trail hell check those first.
LULA=>How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
SAILOR=>Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but well try her.
LULA=>I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They dont hardly never get washed, and I dont like the idea of lyin on other peoples dirt.
SAILOR=>Come look at this.
LULA=>Whats that, honey?
SAILOR=>There aint no water in the swimmin pool. Just a dead tree fell in, probly from bein struck by lightnin.
LULA=>Its huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
SAILOR=>Lets get fed, sweetheart. The lights fadin fast.
SANTOS=>Hello there, Mr. Reindeer... Marcello Santos speaking.
MR. REINDEER=>Mr. Marcello Santos... Hey there... That was great shit you sent in last month...
SANTOS=>I gotta problem... In fact, I gotta coupla problems...
MR. REINDEER=>Gotta coupla problems, huh?... For each problem drop a silver dollar through my mail slot... With all particulars... Well work out il conto later...
LULA=>M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big N.O.
SAILOR=>Lula... I learned somethin interestin today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin back into style.
LULA=>Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
SAILOR=>Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
LULA=>Yeah, its a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw em by the register and the girl throw em in. Im not big on resistin. So what about a leech?
SAILOR=>Heard on the radio how doctors is usin leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used em?
LULA=>I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
SAILOR=>Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin, theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
LULA=>Sailor? You expect me to believe a mand be goin around with a arm sewed to his nose?
SAILOR=>How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin a balloon in the forehead and lettin it hand down on the nose.
LULA=>Sailor Ripley! You stop! Youre makin this shit up and I aint gonna sit for it!
SAILOR=>Honest, Lula. I probly aint precisely got all the facts straight, but its about what they said.
LULA=>Honey, were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject.
SAILOR=>Were about dry bones, sweetheart. We dont wanna have to push this bird into New Orleans.
LULA=>We sure dont, honey... Get me a Mounds?
BLACK MAN=>Sorry, gentlemen. Im most finished on my shoppin here.
ERV=>This be it?
BLACK MAN=>Yall take American Express?
ERV=>Yessir.
BLACK MAN=>Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
BLACK MAN=>Pussycats gotta eat, too.
BLACK MAN=>Id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if its same to you.
ERV=>We dont have no paper bags.
BLACK MAN=>Hello... Yeah, mama, Im on my way... Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.
SAILOR=>All I wants ten bucks regular. Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.
SAILOR=>I aint got my American Express card with me, so I gotta use cash. Hope thats okay.
LULA=>That took long enough. You forget my Mounds?
SAILOR=>I really do think the country done changed just a little while I was away, peanut.
LULA=>You got to keep an eye on it. Thats sure.
MR. REINDEER=>A coupla silver dollars came my way today... Im sending one of them to you with a paper on the beneficiary ... As usual, you are completely free to fulfill the obligation in any manner you so desire.
REGGIE=>Do you mind if we share this table? ... The others, they are occupied.
JOHNNIE=>Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
DROP SHADOW=>Muchas gracias.
REGGIE=>My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But please do call me Reggie. This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow. He is always with me.
JOHNNIE=>Johnnie Farragut. Pleased to meet ya.
REGGIE=>You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
JOHNNIE=>Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
REGGIE=>Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
JOHNNIE=>Only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
REGGIE=>Yes, thats so. But there is not much to destroy.
DROP SHADOW=>No big buildings like in New Orleans.
JOHNNIE=>Whattaya do there?
REGGIE=>Oh, many things...
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance shop.
REGGIE=>But I am also with the government.
JOHNNIE=>In what capacity?
REGGIE=>In many capacities.
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service.
JOHNNIE=>General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
REGGIE=>He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives.
REGGIE=>That is my permiso.
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.
REGGIE=>Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country.
JOHNNIE=>Of course.
DROP SHADOW=>Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to carry a .45.
REGGIE=>United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
JOHNNIE=>Why are you in New Orleans? If you dont mind my askin.
REGGIE=>Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
DROP SHADOW=>He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
REGGIE=>We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
JOHNNIE=>Its been a real pleasure. I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go.
REGGIE=>The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
JOHNNIE=>I couldnt say, which one?
DROP SHADOW=>Who cares?
LULA=>I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em. Oh, Sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside? Like its got a voice all its own. You get right on me.
SAILOR=>You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
SAILOR=>Lets head out into the crazy world of New Orleans... I gotta get somethin to eat.
GEORGE=>My names George Kovich. Bet youve heard of me.
SAILOR=>Dont know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin in particular?
GEORGE=>Was in all the papers three years ago. Im seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted em killed.
LULA=>Why were you killin pigeons, Mr. Kovich? Were you in the extermination business?
GEORGE=>No, maam. I was a housepainter, in the union forty-one years. Im retired now, livin with my sister, Ida. Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz. Hes dead now, so its just me and Ida. I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW was doin them a service, and they charged me with endangerin the public.
LULA=>Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?
GEORGE=>Theyre useless pests. Ive shot hundreds of em...
GEORGE=>...My neighbors hired me to get rid of the pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches...
GEORGE=>...Neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnt light on my house or my brother Earls anymore, and I told em the truth. I shot em... Earls gone now...
GEORGE=>...Heart attack six months ago - had that cholesterol thick as shit... His widow, Mildred, she still lives in the house next to mine.
GEORGE=>Shes stone deaf but the racket the pigeons made drove Earl crazy. He could hear em even with the TV on. He owned a bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street. Earls roof was a favorite spot for pigeons. They lit there day and night. I wanted to toss a grenade up there.
SAILOR=>If your neighbors didnt mind, howd you get put out of business?
GEORGE=>Woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didnt understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebodys cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didnt make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
SAILOR=>What happened on the charges?
GEORGE=>Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
GEORGE=>Its a serious situation. Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people to remember me and what Ive done and pick up where I left off. Somebody had to make a move. It was nice meetin you folks.
SAILOR=>What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
LULA=>Its just another case, Sailor.
SAILOR=>Whats that, peanut?
LULA=>One person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it.
SAILOR=>Aint it the way...
LULA=>Sailor?... Sailor, honey?
SAILOR=>Huh?
LULA=>Ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast?... Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
SAILOR=>My God, it better be, darlin, cause itd be the last... What time is it?
LULA=>Shhhhh... Its four oclock... That womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin? ... Like bein ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
SAILOR=>Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
LULA=>Anythin interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like were seein these days?
SAILOR=>You got me, peanut.
LULA=>You certain?
SAILOR=>I aint never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
LULA=>Recall the time we was sittin one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, You feel it beatin in there, Lula?... Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now. Dyou recall that?
SAILOR=>I do.
LULA=>I was hopin you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think its the best night of my life.
LULA=>I really do think its the best night of my life.
SAILOR=>We didnt do nothin special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
LULA=>Talkins good. Long as you got the other? Im a big believer in talkin, case you aint noticed.
SAILOR=>Too bad they dont give an award for talkin... Youd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
LULA=>You think so, baby? Does my talkin bother you, honey?
SAILOR=>No, I like gettin up around four a.m. and talkin bout wild animals ... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didnt remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldnt remember any of my dreams.
LULA=>What was this one?
SAILOR=>It wasnt no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin super-hard and I wasnt dressed warm. Only instead of freezin, I was sweatin strong.
SAILOR=>The water was rollin off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadnt had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
LULA=>Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
SAILOR=>I know. I kept walkin, I headed for your house, only it wasnt your house, really. You let me in only you werent real pleased to see me. You kept askin, Whyd you come to see me now? Why now? Like itd been a long time since wed seen each ohter.
LULA=>Oh, baby, what an idea. Id always be happy to see you, no matter what.
SAILOR=>I know, peanut. But it wasnt all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein there was upsettin to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess youd got married and your husband was comin home any minute.
SAILOR=>I tell you, Lula. I was shakin wet. All this black sweat was pourin off me, and I knew I was scarin you, so I took off.
LULA=>Sometimes dreams just dont mean nothin... Stuff comes into your mind and you dont have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams aint no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
SAILOR=>Well, I aint upset about it, darlin. Just give me an odd feelin there a minute, is all.
LULA=>Take a bite of Lula.
CHET=>Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
JOHNNIE=>Real good, Chet... Its been awhile.
CHET=>Everythins relative. Wheres that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didnt split up, I hope.
JOHNNIE=>No... Shes fine. Back home.
CHET=>Whatll it be? The regular? Black Label?
JOHNNIE=>Set one up.
CHET=>So who you out sleuthin for now?... Can I help ya?
JOHNNIE=>Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas daughter, Lula. Her and er beau took off the other day. Mariettas real upset about it.
CHET=>Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin like her was at the Nothin Fancy yesterday.
JOHNNIE=>Sounds right... Ill check it out.
CHET=>You hitched yet?
JOHNNIE=>No sir...
CHET=>Its none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
JOHNNIE=>Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
CHET=>Thats what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
JOHNNIE=>Ill tell ya though, its comin up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that times comin up right soon. But like you said, everythins realtive.
LULA=>Lets get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin about this place. Feelin all that voodoo...
SAILOR=>Gotta hex from a voodoo?
LULA=>Who do?
SAILOR=>You do.
LULA=>Oh my God... Its Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin!
SAILOR=>Where?
LULA=>Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
SAILOR=>Im goin.
JOHNNIE=>Aint love wonderful?...
WAITRESS=>Whats that?
JOHNNIE=>I said, aint love wonderful?
JOHNNIE=>Good luck to you kids.
LULA=>You think he saw us?
SAILOR=>Who knows, baby?
LULA=>He was sittin there havin a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
SAILOR=>Lula, darlin... Makes no difference anyway... Were outta here.
SAILOR=>Sweetheart, keep your panties up. Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.
LULA=>Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
SAILOR=>Hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey. Look at him.
ROACH=>Thanks a lot. I been standin out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha! Cops catch ya hitchin on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha! Which I aint got, ha-ha!
SAILOR=>My names Sailor, and this heres Lula. Whats yours?
ROACH=>Marvin DeLoach. But everbody calls me Roach, ha-ha! Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!
LULA=>You always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk?
ROACH=>Aint laughin, ha-ha!
SAILOR=>What you got in the box?
ROACH=>My dogs, ha-ha!
ROACH=>Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha! These dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!
LULA=>This guys crazy.
SAILOR=>Where you from, Roach?
ROACH=>If you mean where I was born, it was Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha! But I been brought up in Baton Rouge.
LULA=>Why you goin to Alaska? And whered you get them puppies? They look sick.
ROACH=>I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha! The Call of the Wild. I aint never seen snow, ha-ha! I got these dogs at the pound. Nobody wanted em, ha-ha! Everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds. Im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!
LULA=>Sailor! Stop! Stop the car now!
LULA=>Im sorry, but I cant take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant!
LULA=>Im truly sorry? Im truly sorry, Roach. But aint gonna make it to Alaska? Least not any part of the way with us. Youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die? And, if you dont mind my sayin so? You could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath!
LULA=>Drive.
SAILOR=>You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
LULA=>I know youre thinkin that I got moren some of my mama in me? Well, I couldnt help it. Sailor, I really couldnt. Im sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
SAILOR=>Just part of life on the road, peanut.
LULA=>Do me a favor, Sailor? Dont pick up no more hitchers, okay?
JOHNNIE=>No, Marietta, I havent found em.
MARIETTA=>This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindus lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms.
JOHNNIE=>Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
MARIETTA=>Im stayin right here by the phone until you find Lula, then Im comin to get her. You call soons you got somethin, even if its three in the a.m.
JOHNNIE=>I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
REGGIE=>Hola! Senor Farragut! We meet again.
JOHNNIE=>I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
DROP SHADOW=>We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
REGGIE=>Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
JOHNNIE=>Why not? How was the fishin?
REGGIE=>I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
JOHNNIE=>So, its back to the islands.
DROP SHADOW=>Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
REGGIE=>Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
JOHNNIE=>This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
REGGIE=>It has its moments of uncertainty.
DROP SHADOW=>But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
JOHNNIE=>Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
REGGIE=>I can tell you are an intelligent man, Johnnie. One difference between your country and mine is that in the islands, it does not pay to reveal ones intelligence... Others may use what they perceive against us...
REGGIE=>Hasta siempre.
JOHNNIE=>Hasta siempre.
REGGIE=>Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
JOHNNIE=>Hows that?
DROP SHADOW=>Two Scotsmen were fighting over a penny.
JOHNNIE=>I gotta admit, you guys are two in four dozen.
REGGIE=>The real joke is we never went fishing, but were still fishing.
LULA=>I wouldnt mind a little night life. How about you?
SAILOR=>Hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this, honey. You dont want to be walkin in the wrong door.
LULA=>Maybe theres a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin. We could ask someone.
SAILOR=>Someone up here might know somethin.
BUCK=>Gas?
SAILOR=>Got enough, thanks. Were lookin for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin - get somethin to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
BILLY=>Cornbreads. They got western.
BUCK=>No food, though, cept bar nibbles.
LULA=>How about speed metal?
LULA=>Any kinda rocknroll, honey.
BILLY=>Theres a boogie joint just about a mile straight out Lafitte here. But thats a black place mostly.
BUCK=>Mostly black though in that boogie place.
SAILOR=>Whats the name of it?
BUCK=>Club Zanzibar.
SAILOR=>You say its straight ahead a mile?
BUCK=>About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
SAILOR=>Thanks.
SAILOR=>You ready for this?
LULA=>Well find out in a hurry.
LULA=>Come on.
BARTENDER ZANZIBAR=>This is a friendly place, son. You folks just relax and have a nice time.
LULA=>You got yourself a deal.
BARTENDER=>Thats a real jacket... By that, I mean a real stupid jacket.
SAILOR=>This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
BARTENDER=>Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.
LULA=>Ill be damned if Im leavin. That band is too good?
SAILOR=>Uh huh.
LULA=>You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin by herself?
SAILOR=>Yeah.
LULA=>Well, she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
SAILOR=>Honey, we bein strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin.
LULA=>You think shes pretty?
SAILOR=>I tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones. Face aint bad, though.
SAILOR=>Whats wrong, sweetheart? Somethin botherin you?
LULA=>Mama. I been thinkin about her. Shes probly worried to death by now.
SAILOR=>Moren likely.
LULA=>I want to call her and tell her Im okay. That were okay.
SAILOR=>I aint so sure its a great idea, but thats up to you. Just dont tell her where we are.
LULA=>Pardon me? Yall got a phone here I can use?
BARTENDER ZANZIBAR=>Cant you read?
LULA=>Back in a bit.
OPERATOR=>I have a collect call from Lula Fortune. Will you accept?
MARIETTA=>Of course! Lula? Where are you? You all right?
LULA=>Im fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
MARIETTA=>Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin whats happenin to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
LULA=>If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
MARIETTA=>Are you comin back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
LULA=>Need me for what, mama? Im perfectly fine, and safe, too.
MARIETTA=>You in a dance hall or somethin? I can hear music behind you.
LULA=>Just a place.
MARIETTA=>Really, Lula, this aint right!
LULA=>Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
MARIETTA=>Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
LULA=>No, mama, Im in Mexico, and were about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
MARIETTA=>Argentina! Lula, youre outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and Ill come for you. I wont say nothin to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I dont care.
LULA=>Mama, Im hangin up this phone now.
MARIETTA=>No, baby, dont! Can I send you somethin? You runnin low on money? Ill wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
LULA=>I aint that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin off convenience stores all across the south? Aint you read about it?
MARIETTA=>Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
LULA=>I am all right, mama. Thats why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
MARIETTA=>Call me again soon? Ill be waitin by the phone.
LULA=>Dont be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
SAILOR=>I was just wastin time, peanut, till you come back.
LULA=>Its me whos wastin time, Sailor, bein with you.
SAILOR=>Honey, Im sorry. It wasnt nothin. Come on and get up and well take off.
LULA=>Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure Im gonna feel?
SAILOR=>Told you not to call your mama.
MARIETTA=>Santos... If you get this message, call me right away. Its Marietta... I dont know, Santos... Maybe this is all not... Call me.
MARIETTA=>Johnnie! At last! I thought you was never gonna come back to your room.
JOHNNIE=>I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
MARIETTA=>Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
JOHNNIE=>Did she tell you where she was callin from?
MARIETTA=>No, but my guess is theyre headed west, so probly Texas. Their money must be runnin low. I dont think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
JOHNNIE=>Howd she sound? Was she doin okay?
MARIETTA=>Could she be doin okay, Johnnie? Shes tryin to prove somethin to me, thats all. Lula aint doin no moren showin off, defyin me... Johnnie, Ive done somethin bad...
JOHNNIE=>What?
MARIETTA=>I wont tell you over the phone. Im comin to N.O. and Ill tell you then.
JOHNNIE=>Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
MARIETTA=>No, you wait right there for me... Ill be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
JOHNNIE=>Ill meet you, Marietta, if thats what you want, but Im against it.
MARIETTA=>Seven tomorrow evenin. Se can eat at Galatoires. Fix it.
LULA=>How much we got left, honey?
SAILOR=>Under a hundred.
LULA=>You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
SAILOR=>Not in Houston. Wed be better off in some place more out of the way.
LULA=>You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
SAILOR=>Thatd be good, Lula.
ARTIE=>Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
ARTIE=>Yes, maam. Whats on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
ARTIE=>Im fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but Im on a new diet and exercising regularly. Ive never felt better.
ARTIE=>Thank you. Its listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
LULA=>Jesus! How could anyone listen to this crap?
REPORTER=>...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. These are really just children, he said, but theyve been exposed to a lot already.
LULA=>Ill bet.
REPORTER=>In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
REPORTER=>The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
LULA=>Damn!
REPORTER=>The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
REPORTER=>in the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
LULA=>HOLY SHIT!! ITS THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN FUCKIN DEAD!!!!
SAILOR=>Whats that, peanut?
LULA=>I cant take no more of this radio... I aint never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
LULA=>The worlds gettin worse, I think, Sailor. And it dont sound like theres much we can do about it, neither.
SAILOR=>This aint news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
SAILOR=>POWERMAD!!!
MANAGER=>Heres your key. Mr. Farraguts already taken care of everything. I hope youll be comfortable, Mrs. Fortune. Youre in room 351 right down the hall from Mr. Farragut.
DESK CLERK=>I have a phone call for you, Mrs. Fortune ... at the phone by the fireplace. Please wait for it to ring.
MARIETTA=>Yes?...
SANTOS=>I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didnt you?... I cant trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? Theres no turning back. Im in a killing mood.
MARIETTA=>No...
SANTOS=>My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.

SAILOR=>You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin before I met you.
LULA=>I just figured you was out bein Mr. Cool...
SAILOR=>Not exactly, sugar... One reason were in all the trouble were in right now is cause of what I was doin... I tried to tell you this before...
LULA=>Youre scarin me, baby.
SAILOR=>Well, theres a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol guy...
LULA=>You knew my daddy?
SAILOR=>Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin for a man named Marcello Santos...
LULA=>Oh shit...
SAILOR=>I quit workin for im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I dont know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
LULA=>God, Sailor... Thats the night my daddy died.
SAILOR=>I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
LULA=>Thats some big secret you been carryin, Sailor.
SAILOR=>We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you dont think I been lyin to you bout other things, sugar.
LULA=>Howd you know my daddy?
SAIL0R=>Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
SAILOR=>Lula, you there?
LULA=>Yeah, Im here.
SAILOR=>You upset with me?
LULA=>No, Sailor darlin. Just shockin sometimes when things arent the way you thought they were... I been carryin a secret too...
LULA=>That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
LULA=>...They was laughin arm in arm like animals.
SAILOR=>I didnt want to say it ... but I had a feelin Santos was up to somethin with your mama...
LULA=>My mama... So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
SAILOR=>They have, sugar.
LULA=>I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
SAILOR=>Its a comfortin idea.
LULA=>Well, were really out in the middle of it now, aint we?
SAILOR=>Theres worse places, honey.
LULA=>If you say so.
SAILOR=>Trust me on it.
LULA=>I do trust you, Sailor. Like I aint never trusted nobody before.
SAILOR=>Well be alright, peanut, long as weve got room to move.
LULA=>Whats that?
SAILOR=>I dont know... Looks like clothes.
LULA=>Oh God, Sailor.
SAILOR=>One bad car accident...
LULA=>SAILOR!!!
LULA=>Sailor, what are we gonna do?
SAILOR=>I dont know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
GIRL=>Ive got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and I cant find it... My mothers going to kill me. Its got all my cards in it... It was in my pocket... Now my pockets gone. MY PURSE IS GONE!!! NOW SHE TELLS ME.
SAILOR=>Lets get ahold a her quick.
LULA=>You think shes gonna make it?
SAILOR=>Dont know, but shes gonna bleed all over our car, Ill tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
GIRL=>OWWW GOD!!! LEAVE ME ALONE... ROBERT!!!... Shit, I got this damn sticky stuff in my hair...
GIRL=>Gotta find my wallet. Dont you say one word of this to my mother. God, shes gonna kill me.
GIRL=>WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...
LULA=>I cant take this, Sailor. Shes dyin right in front of our eyes...
SAILOR=>Im afraid she is, baby.
GIRL=>Get my lipstick... Its in my purse.
LULA=>She died right in front of me. Whyd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
SAILOR=>Lets get outta here, honey.
SAILOR=>Well, it aint exactly Emerald City...
LULA=>Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it aint even noon yet.
SAILOR=>Thisll do.
SAILOR=>Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
LULA=>No radio or TV...
LULA=>And no AC.
SAILOR=>Fan works.
LULA=>Now what?
SAILOR=>Lets get a sandwich and find out about some work.
LULA=>Sailor?
SAILOR=>Yeah?
LULA=>This aint exactly my most thrillin notion of startin a new life.
LULA=>Im gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I dont feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
SAILOR=>Okay, honey, Ill see you later.
SAILOR=>You Red?
RED=>Well, I aint Blackie.
SAILOR=>Names Sailor Ripley. Katy over at the drugstore thought you might have some work I could do.
RED=>Things aint real hot right now. Rex, there though, is about to relocate in about a week to San Angelo. I might could use a man when he does... You good with engines?
SAILOR=>I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they used to call me Wrench when I was a kid.
RED=>Well see how she goes then when Rex takes off. Check back.
SPARKY=>Hows it look?
RED=>Reckon the heads cracked, like I thought.
SPARKY=>Shit, thats what I was afraid of.
RED=>Ill get you foreigners a beer.
BUDDY=>Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.
SAILOR=>My girl and I are lookin for a place to settle. Were bunked down at the Iguana Motel.
SPARKY=>So are we. Its the only motel in Big Tuna. Have you met Bobby Just Like The Country Peru yet?
SAILOR=>No, we just got in a hour and a half ago.
BUDDY=>You will. Hes the Mr. Fix-It at the Iguana. His truck broke down here a couple of months ago.
REX=>Escaped con. Man got some serious prison tattoos.
RED=>Everbody got a past.
BUDDY=>Just some got more future in em than others.
REX=>That aint no lie.
SAILOR=>Been nice meetin yall. Preciate the beer. Ill be seein yall soon.
BUDDY=>Very soon.
SPARKY=>One thing about bein in Big Tuna: you dont have much choice about who you see and who you dont.
LULA=>That you, Sail, honey?
SAILOR=>The only one.
LULA=>You find any work?
SAILOR=>Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys whos stayin here. Whats that smell?
LULA=>I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
SAILOR=>You sick?
LULA=>A little, I think... Darlin?
SAILOR=>Yeah?
LULA=>Come sit by me.
LULA=>I dont know that this is the right place for us.
SAILOR=>It aint gonna be forever, peanut.
LULA=>I know, Sailor. Nothin is.
BUDDY=>Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was killed when his car went off the road on State Highway 118, according to the Department of Public Safety. Brenton and two passengers, William Reese and Susan Day, were thrown from the automobile, reports said.
SAILOR=>Susan Day...
TOMMY=>Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck. That stupid shit... That fuckin Bob was so fuckin dumb... He deserved to die... That asshole.
BUDDY=>Hey, Tommy... Whats goin on over there in number four where al them bright lights are all the time?
TOMMY=>Them are makin a pornographic movie... Texas style... Why? You wanna join in?
SPARKY=>How do you get sixteen Haitians into a Dixie Cup?
LULA=>How?
SPARKY=>Tell em it floats.
BUDDY=>Sparkys big on Florida jokes.
SPARKY=>You need a active sense of humor to survive in the Big Tuna.
BOBBY=>Hey, everybody.
BUDDY=>Sailor, Lula, this heres the man himself. Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula, the most recent strandees, economic variety.
BOBBY=>Bobby Peru, just like the country.
BUDDY=>Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys the most excitin item to hit Big Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared the roof off the high school.
SPARKY=>Only in town two months and there aint a young thing around dont know how that cobra tattoo works, right, Bob?
LULA=>You from Texas, Mr. Peru?
BOBBY=>Im from all over.
SAILOR=>You was in the Marines, huh?
BOBBY=>Four years.
SPARKY=>Bobby was at Cao Ben.
LULA=>Whats Cao Ben?
BOBBY=>How old are you?
LULA=>Twenty.
BUDDY=>Lotta women and kids and old people died at Cao Ben.
BOBBY=>March, 1968. We torched a village and the government made a big deal out of it.
BOBBY=>You was on a ship, pardner. Hard to make contact with the people when youre off floatin in the Gulf of Tonkin.
SPARKY=>Hey Bobby, have yourself another glass a Jack.
BOBBY=>Dont mind if I fuckin do... Speakin a Jack... One-eyed Jacks yearnin to go a peepin in a seafood store... Good meetin you. Adios, boys.
LULA=>Somethin in that man scares me.
BUDDY=>No shit.
SPARKY=>Bobbys got a way... Cant shake that institution odor.
LULA=>Darlin, I still aint feelin so well. Im goin to bed.
SAILOR=>Ill come along.
SAILOR=>Man, that barf smell dont fade fast.
SAILOR=>Anything I can do for you?
LULA=>No, I dont think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
LULA=>Sailor? You know what?
SAILOR=>I know you aint particularly pleased bein here.
LULA=>Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I cant say it.
SAILOR=>Its okay by me, peanut.
LULA=>Well, nothin personal, but I aint sure its okay by me.
LULA=>Really, Sailor, it aint nothin against you. I love you.
SAILOR=>Love you, too.
LULA=>I know. Just Im sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin, and this dont help soothe me.
SAILOR=>I know this aint easy, Lula, but I aint gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
BOBBY=>Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
LULA=>No, hes out changin the oil in the car.
BOBBY=>Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
LULA=>Well... Yeah - okay.
BOBBY=>I dont mean your head head - Im not gonna piss on your head - your hair an all... Just piss in the toilet. Yall take a listen - here a deep sound comin down from Bobby Peru.
PERDITA=>Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
SAILOR=>Just passin through on my way to who knows where...
PERDITA=>Sure... I figured Id see you sometime...
SAILOR=>Hopin you could tell me if theres a contract out on me. I really need to know.
PERDITA=>By who?
SAILOR=>I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
PERDITA=>Heard you was goin out with that bitchs daughter.
SAILOR=>You heard right.
PERDITA=>You really are one dumb asshole.
SAILOR=>Life is unpredictable.
PERDITA=>Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy? Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin the shit himself?... Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
SAILOR=>I didnt see nothin...
PERDITA=>Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
SAILOR=>Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that wed tip each other off if we ever heard.
PERDITA=>I know... I remember.
SAILOR=>Well?...
PERDITA=>I aint heard of nothin.
SAILOR=>Thanks...
BOBBY=>Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
LULA=>You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here aint any of your business, thats for sure.
BOBBY=>You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, Ill fuck you like a real good like a big ol jack- rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesnt come up for air.
LULA=>Get out.
BOBBY=>Am I scarin ya?... Your pussy wet? ... Come on ... is it?... Hey, dont jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin, dont it?... Means somethin to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
BOBBY=>Hey... Im sorry... I dont think Im bein too polite here ... and I apologize... Hell... A man sees a pretty woman and first thing he knows, he loses his manners... Sure sign of modern times... Next thing ya know, his old handll start crawlin around where it oughtnt to go... Ill be real honest with ya... Id like to fuck you and tear you open like a paycheck envelope... Will you be honest with me - would you like me to do it?... Just a simple yes or no...
BOBBY=>Just feel me breathin on you... And youll know I mean business when it comes to fuckin.
LULA=>GET OUT!!!
BOBBY=>Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin in you now... Stay quiet... Say fuck me and then Ill leave.
LULA=>No way... GET OUT!!!

SAILOR=>Thanks, Bobby, bout done.
BOBBY=>How bout a beer?
SAILOR=>Thatd be fine, Bobby.
BOBBY=>Lets go by Rosaritas. You been there yet?
SAILOR=>No, havent heard of it.
BOBBY=>Thought maybe Sparky and Buddyd taken ya. Come on, Ill drive.
SAILOR=>This your car?
BOBBY=>Hell, no, belongs to my girls sister. The sisters been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while shes gone. Wheres that pretty little lady of yours today?
SAILOR=>Restin in our room. She aint been feelin well.
BOBBY=>Sorry to hear it.
SAILOR=>New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
BOBBY=>Used to be this was a Mobil. Man converted it into a private club and named it after his wife. She left him and he shot himself. The wife owns it now.
BOBBY=>No hard liquor here. Just beer.
BOBBY=>Couple Stars, Jimmy.
SAILOR=>Thought you said this was a private club. How come Im allowed in without bein a member?
BOBBY=>You black?
SAILOR=>No.
BOBBY=>You an indian?
SAILOR=>No.
BOBBY=>Then youre a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
SAILOR=>They look like a bunch of good ol boys to me. I guess its oil money, huh?
BOBBY=>Oil, gas, cattle, farmin. Aint nobody shows off around here. Iguana Countys one of the richest in Texas.
SAILOR=>Wouldnta guessed it, thats sure.
BOBBY=>Ready for another?
SAILOR=>Why not?
BOBBY=>Q-7, three times. Pee Wee Kings Waltz of Regret, my favorite tune.
BOBBY=>I been studyin a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
SAILOR=>Whats that?
BOBBY=>Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
SAILOR=>No... I dont think so, man.
BOBBY=>Be easy, Sailor. Theres two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the othern covered... You aint plannin on raisin a famly in Big Tuna, are ya?
SAILOR=>Whattaya mean family?
BOBBY=>Well... I mean like Lula bein in a family way.
SAILOR=>Lula tell you shes pregnant?
BOBBY=>Couple grand or mored give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
SAILOR=>When did you talk to Lula?
BOBBY=>Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
SAILOR=>She really say she was pregnant?
BOBBY=>Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
SAILOR=>I aint fuckin sure, Bobby.
BOBBY=>Dont think about it too long. You had enough?
SAILOR=>Have now.
BOBBY=>Come on outside, I got somethin to show ya.
BOBBY=>Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off, Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape. Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson .32 handgun with a six inch barrel. Thesell do er... Loosen up that five grand... Two and a half for you and the little lady...
BOBBY=>How much money you have between the two aya right now?...
SAILOR=>Forty bucks...
BOBBY=>This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I dont think you can afford not to take it... Ill be bringin the Eldo round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin... If you aint a pussy - youll be there.
SAILOR=>I dont particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
BOBBY=>Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol round balls for this kinda thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
SAILOR=>Yeah ... yeah... I guess so... That kinda moneyd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
SAILOR=>...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
BOBBY=>Like takin candy from a fuckin baby...
LULA=>You been drinkin, huh?
SAILOR=>Few beers is all. Feelin any better?
LULA=>Cant tell yet. Whered you go?
SAILOR=>That smells still fillin this room good.
LULA=>Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
SAILOR=>And Bobby too, I hear...
LULA=>Yeah... He was lookin for you.
SAILOR=>You talk to im some?...
LULA=>Some... Sparky said Reds promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
SAILOR=>Oughta make em happy.
LULA=>So whered you say you was?
SAILOR=>Went with Bobby.
LULA=>Sail?
SAILOR=>Uh huh?
LULA=>Lets leave here.
SAILOR=>Were goin to, Lula, real soon.
LULA=>I mean tomorrow.
SAILOR=>We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. Thatd get us to El Paso.
LULA=>Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
SAILOR=>You shouldnt be smokin if youre pregnant. Aint smart.
LULA=>Who says Im smart? You up to somethin with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
SAILOR=>What could I be up to, Lula?
LULA=>Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey, and you aint.
SAILOR=>I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didnt I?
LULA=>That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
SAILOR=>That was in Vietnam.
LULA=>Hes the kind liked it.
SAILOR=>Lula, I got to get some sleep.
LULA=>Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
SAILOR=>What?
LULA=>Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped em in a trench. Bobby Peru probly killed the most.
SAILOR=>Lula, he mighta did, I dont know. But it dont matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it aint their fault.
LULA=>I sure enjoy smokin, Sailor. I hate that its bad for you.
LULA=>That mans a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, youll regret it. If you live to.
S AILOR=>Thanks, darlin, I know you got my best interest in mind, and I preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
LULA=>This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top.
LULA=>I wish you really, truly loved me... I wish youd sing me Love Me Tender ... I wish I was somewhere over that rainbow... Shit. Shit, shit, shit.
BOB RAY=>Hey Sailor... Wait a minute... I got somethin for ya.
BOB RAY=>Shit, man... Marietta says you been tryin to fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes... You crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to fuck your girls mama... How do you think that cute little cunt Lula would feel about that? Hey, take a look at this... Marietta just gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said Lula was mine to fuck all the way into next Sunday.
PERDITA=>Nice of you to drop by.
BOBBY=>Told ya I would. You still riled?
PERDITA=>You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
BOBBY=>Aint never had no girl pull a blade on me.
PERDITA=>Wish Id fuckin cut you up good.
BOBBY=>You heard from Reggie?
PERDITA=>Juana called. Theyre stayin another week.
BOBBY=>Stayin a few extra days in the big N.O., huh? This you?
PERDITA=>Yes.
BOBBY=>Dont look like you.
BOBBY=>The cobras waitin to strike, chica.
PERDITA=>That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on im.
BOBBY=>No shit?!?! You know him?
PERDITA=>Used to.
BOBBY=>Whatd you say?
PERDITA=>No, of course.
BOBBY=>Thats right... Could have a bad accident, though ... before ... durin ... or after a hold-up...
PERDITA=>Whats gonna happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow?
BOBBY=>Maybe hell get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
BOBBY=>I knew we could be friends again...
BOBBY=>Jump in back.
SAILOR=>Whats she doin here?
BOBBY=>Shes my girl... Shes drivin... That bother you?
SAILOR=>Why should it?
BOBBY=>Thats right... Take one of these.
SAILOR=>What is it?
BOBBY=>Panty hose. Work bettern stockins. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, theyll know we aint foolin with em.
PERDITA=>Comin up on it now, Bobby.
BOBBY=>Come on! Get that mask on!
BOBBY=>Keep it revved, Chiquita. We wont be long. Just goin in to get our five grand.
BOBBY=>Into the back room, both of you, NOW!!!
BOBBY=>If anyone comes in, herd em back here quick.
DEPUTY=>Waitin for somebody, Miss?
PERDITA=>Mi esposo. Hes in the feed store picking up some supplies.
DEPUTY=>Youd best be careful of that cigarette, Maam. Its about to burn down between your fingers.
PERDITA=>Gracias, officer.
SAILOR=>BOBBY!!!! STOP IT, MAN!!!
BOBBY=>Youre next, fucker.
MARIETTA=>Oh baby, I was beginnin to think I was never gonna see you again.
MARIETTA=>Youre comin home, precious. Santos gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
LULA=>Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here. I just cant leave him.
MARIETTA=>Oh, yes, you can.
SANTOS=>Your mamas been real worried bout you, honey. Me too... Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too?
LULA=>Im goin, mama. No way I cant go.
MARIETTA=>You aint takin Pace, though.
LULA=>Course I am, mama.
MARIETTA=>What times Sailors train get in?
LULA=>Six.
MARIETTA=>Got any plans?
LULA=>Figure well go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Browns Pig Pickin.
MARIETTA=>Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
LULA=>Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.
MARIETTA=>Dont mean him. Its Pace concerns me.
LULA=>Really, mama, I gotta go.
MARIETTA=>What if I asked you not to?
LULA=>Wouldnt make any difference.
MARIETTA=>What if I told you not to?
LULA=>Mama ... if you get in the way of me and Sailors happiness, Ill fuckin pull your arms out by the roots.
PACE=>Howll we know what he looks like?
PACE=>Mama, you almost crashed us.
LULA=>Dont give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This aint the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
PACE=>Howll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
LULA=>Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
PACE=>What I made you do, mama?
LULA=>Nothin, honey. Mamas just actin strange.
PACE=>You aint actin, mama.
LULA=>Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you got one cute mouth tonight?
WHEELCHAIR MAN=>Hey man... HEY... Same fuckin thing happened to me last year...
PACE=>I still aint sure what my daddy looks like.
LULA=>Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
PACE=>My daddy aint never killed nobody, has he, mama?
LULA=>Course he aint never killed nobody. Whyd you say that, Pace?
PACE=>Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin.
LULA=>And?
PACE=>Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
LULA=>Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy aint always been so lucky... Were almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
PACE=>Why we sittin here, mama?
LULA=>Thinkin a second, baby.
PACE=>Im scared, mama.
LULA=>Why, honey?
PACE=>Case daddy dont like me. What if he dont like that I dont got his color hair.
LULA=>Pace, your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all.
LULA=>Still partial to Camels, huh?
SAILOR=>First pack of tailor-mades I had in a while.
SAILOR=>You must be my son.
LULA=>Shake hands with your daddy.
SAILOR=>Pleasure to meet you, Pace. I read a lot about you.
LULA=>You hungry? Pace and I aint had dinner yet.
SAILOR=>Lead the way.
SAILOR=>No rag top, huh?
PACE=>Whats wrong, mama?
SAILOR=>Dont worry, son. Just stay here.
LULA=>Im sorry, Sailor. I just cant help it. Give me a minute and Ill quit.
SAILOR=>Boys frightened, Lula. This aint no good.
LULA=>Really, Sail, Ill be okay.
SAILOR=>Its a mistake, honey. You two go on. Ill walk back to the depot.
LULA=>Whatre you talkin about? Thats your son in there.
SAILOR=>He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget. Not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
LULA=>How can you say that, Sailor?
SAILOR=>What makes sense, is all.
LULA=>Dont do this, Sailor, please.
SAILOR=>Oiga, amigo. If ever somethin dont feel right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid... Lets went, before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music.
SAILOR=>You been doin fine without me, peanut. There aint no need to make life toughern it has to be.
SAILOR=>What do you faggots want?
GOOD WITCH=>Sailor Ripley...
SAILOR=>The Good Witch...
GOOD WITCH=>Sailor... Lula loves you.
SAILOR=>But Im a robber and a manslaughterer and I havent had any parental guidance.
GOOD WITCH=>Shes forgiven you of all these things ... You love her... Dont be afraid, Sailor.
SAILOR=>But Im wild at heart.
GOOD WITCH=>If you are truly wild at heart, youll fight for your dreams... Dont turn away from love, Sailor... Dont turn away from love... Dont turn away from love.
GANG MEMBER=>You had enough, asshole?
SAILOR=>Yes, I have... And I wanna apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals. I also want to thank you fellas, youve taught me a valuable lesson in life. LULA!!!!
SAILOR=>LULA!!!!
LULA=>SAILOR!!!!
