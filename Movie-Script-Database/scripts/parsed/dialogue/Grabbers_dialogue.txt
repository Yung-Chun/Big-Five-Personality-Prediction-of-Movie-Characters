KENIFICK'S VOICE=>O'Shea, I take it you've left already because if you haven't, you're late. That ferry gets in at nine.
KENIFICK'S VOICE=>Where are you?
O'SHEA=>... On the way.
KENIFICK'S VOICE=>So you're in the car?
O'SHEA=>... Yeah ...
KENIFICK'S VOICE=>So you're driving while on the phone?!

KENIFICK'S VOICE=>In the name of God, I don't b--
LISA=>Shit!
O'SHEA=>Well?
LISA=>Howya. O'Shea, is it? Ciarán? We spoke on the phone. I'm Garda Nolan, Lisa.
O'SHEA=>You're not serious?
LISA=>Yeah, well. Just being polite.
O'SHEA=>Are ya gettin' in or what?
LISA=>I have a bag.
LISA=>Would you like a mint?
O'SHEA=>Nah thanks, they give me heartburn.
KENIFICK=>Garda Nolan, lovely to have you. O'Shea, you look like shite. Would you go way and shave.
O'SHEA=>A bit eager aren't ya?
KENIFICK=>Smooth crossing?
LISA=>Smoother than most.
O'SHEA=>Coffee?
LISA=>That'd be great, thanks.
KENIFICK=>So what do you think of the place?
LISA=>It's gorgeous, isn't it?
KENIFICK=>'Tis indeed.
O'SHEA=>And quiet as shite.
O'SHEA=>Milk?
LISA=>Uhm, what kind?
O'SHEA=>Cows. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 10.
LISA=>I'll take it black, thanks.
KENIFICK=>So you can have my desk while I'm gone. O'Shea will tell you, 'tis mostly administrative, processing permits and that sort. You might catch the odd bit of commotion every now and then but half the island's leaving for the show in Dungary so it'll be dead all weekend.
LISA=>I'm sure we can find something to do.
LISA=>Ta.
O'SHEA=>Is she really necessary?
KENIFICK=>You tell me.
O'SHEA=>You're only gone two weeks. I can handle two weeks.
KENIFICK=>You could. But you wouldn't.
KENIFICK=>Don't be late, I said. What did I say?
KENIFICK=>I'm coming, I'm coming. Right, I'm off.
LISA=>Not a bother.
KENIFICK=>Rightio. Reports and files in the top drawer, anything you need, O'Shea will be here to show you round. O'Shea?
O'SHEA=>You're gonna miss your boat.
KENIFICK=>Slán.
KENIFICK=>Won't go far with no tickets. See you in a fortnight. Be good.
LISA=>Garda Nolan.
PADDY=>Take a look at this.
TADHG=>He's a biggun.
PADDY=>He's not a lobster.
TADHG=>Then what is it?
TADHG=>Oh ya bastard, Paddy! Ya knew it was gonna do that.
PADDY=>I didn't. On me life.
TADHG=>Eurgh, the smell.
PADDY=>So what is it?
TADHG=>I dunno, it's a feckin octopus or something, it's covered in seaweed. But 'tis no feckin' lobster!
PADDY=>An octopus?
LISA=>Do I go...? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 13.
O'SHEA=>... Left.
O'SHEA=>So you're after the sarge's desk?
LISA=>What makes you say that?
O'SHEA=>Just wondering.
LISA=>Well, I'm not. I'd some holidays saved that needed to be taken and this posting came up and I thought sure what harm, why not? Can't hurt with the review board, you know?
O'SHEA=>Where are you stationed?
LISA=>Dublin Central.
O'SHEA=>And how's that working out for ya?
LISA=>Great. We got drugs, muggings, murders and rapes. Always on the go.
O'SHEA=>Well you can relax, there's none of that here.
LISA=>You never know. It's the quiet places where all the mad shit happens. Just open a paper.
LISA=>What? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 14.
O'SHEA=>I bet you haven't missed a day of work in your life.
LISA=>And should I be ashamed of that?
O'SHEA=>It's just a job.
LISA=>Seatbelt. It is the law.
DR GLEESON=>In all me years, never seen anything like it.
O'SHEA=>Lisa Nolan, doctor Jim Gleeson. Resident physician.
DR GLEESON=>Oh hello, love. How are ya?
LISA=>Grand, thanks.
O'SHEA=>You wouldn't have any Aspirin on ya, would ya, Jim?
DR GLEESON=>I've a few winegums? Would ya like a winegum?
O'SHEA=>You're all right.
LISA=>I'd prefer it if you'd introduce me as Garda Nolan.
O'SHEA=>Ah, no one minds.
LISA=>I do.
O'SHEA=>What happened?
SMITH=>One second.
SMITH=>Smith.
LISA=>Lisa.
O'SHEA=>Smith's a marine psychologist or something, did I get that right?
SMITH=>No. It's marine ecology.
LISA=>That was quick.
SMITH=>More fortunate really. I'm based here doing studies for the department of the marine.
SMITH=>Hold this, please.
SMITH=>So how long are you here?
LISA=>Two weeks.
SMITH=>Oh, wonderful. Wonderful. Are you staying nearby?
O'SHEA=>So are they dead?!
SMITH=>Hmm? No, they're just sleeping.
O'SHEA=>Slipped.
LISA=>So what happened?
SMITH=>Well they're pilot whales. It happens with them from time to time but no one really knows why.
LISA=>What are those marks?
SMITH=>Not sure. Possible scratches off the rocks while washing up here.
LISA=>They didn't beach themselves? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 17.
SMITH=>No, they died at sea.
O'SHEA=>All of them? At once?
SMITH=>It's a strange one all right.
O'SHEA=>Hey, Daly, Cooney about?
DALY=>Now that is one arresting woman.
LISA=>You, what's your name?
DALY'S MATE=>Przemyslaw Wojciechowski. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 18.
LISA=>Carry on.
O'SHEA=>Busy?
COONEY=>Nah, just stripping an oil tank. This place is a death trap sure.
O'SHEA=>I've warned the kids to keep out.
LISA=>Watch where you're going.
COONEY=>Where's Kenifick?
O'SHEA=>On holiday. Leaving me up the creek.
COONEY=>Why? What's up?
O'SHEA=>Well, remember that favour you owe me? I'm looking for some boys to help move a few things off the beach. An hours work, tops.
COONEY=>What kinda things? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 19.
COONEY=>That'll do, boys. Pack it up.
COONEY=>Don't forget the shovels.
DALY=>I got 'em.
DALY=>-- What in the name of...?
DALY=>HELP! HELP ME!!
COONEY=>Daly?
RTE REPORTER=>-- search and rescue was called off as a search and recover operation became priority. A telling sign that the missing fishermen are believed to have perished.
LISA=>Hi, do you have an iron?
BRIAN=>We do indeed.
LISA=>Hi.
O'SHEA=>Would you like a drink?
LISA=>Another time, maybe.
LISA=>Thanks. See you tomorrow.
O'SHEA=>Tomorrow's Sunday.
LISA=>Oh, right. Well, I have a key so ... see you Monday then.
UNA=>Sparks flying there, huh.
O'SHEA=>What?
UNA=>Do you like her?
O'SHEA=>She's all right. A bit uptight.
UNA=>You should talk to her.
O'SHEA=>I do talk to her. I talked to her all day.
UNA=>God, ye're all the same.
BRIAN=>Ah leave him off, Una.
UNA=>Listen to you. Eight years I was waiting for him to get down on his knee. Have ya ever heard the like of it? My family thought I was mad wasting me time on him. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 22.
BRIAN=>Ah feck them.
UNA=>Ah feck you, Brian.
BRIAN=>Same again?
O'SHEA=>Go on.
BRIAN=>I tell you what though if I weren't, you know, I'd be up them stairs like a shot.
O'SHEA=>What is it, Paddy?
PADDY=>Wouldn't you like to know?
O'SHEA=>No, not really.
PADDY=>But you would, though.
O'SHEA=>Nope.
PADDY=>You would! If you were to know what I know you'd want to know.
O'SHEA=>All right, tell us then.
PADDY=>Right, between you and me, I caught meself a sea monster today. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 23.
PADDY=>Swear to God, may he strike me down. Ya don't believe me?
O'SHEA=>Not a bit.
PADDY=>I'm no liar!
BRIAN=>Ha!
PADDY=>Feck off, you.
O'SHEA=>All right, where is it?
PADDY=>In me bathtub.
O'SHEA=>In your bathtub?
PADDY=>Having a bath.
O'SHEA=>G'night, Paddy.
PADDY=>Ignorant gobshite.
O'SHEA=>What?
PADDY=>Hmm?
O'SHEA=>What did you say?
PADDY=>Nothin'. Didn't open me mouth.
BRIAN=>He called you a gobshite. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 24.
PADDY=>You see you, if this wasn't the only feckin' pub on this shittin' island I'd piss on it than sooner come in here.
BRIAN=>Fine. You're barred.
PADDY=>Ah I'm joking, you know that. One more, huh?
LISA=>Is everything all right?
O'SHEA=>What is it?
LISA=>What do you want?
O'SHEA=>Come on down for a drink.
LISA=>I have work tomorrow.
O'SHEA=>It doesn't matter out here. No one will know.
LISA=>You're drunk. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 25.
O'SHEA=>I am not. I'm sober as a judge.
LISA=>Is that so? Say the alphabet backwards for me.
O'SHEA=>... Zed ... Et cetera.
LISA=>I hope you're not driving?
O'SHEA=>Course not. I'm taking Johnny's horse.
LISA=>You're going to ride a horse while intoxicated?
O'SHEA=>Yeah, so? The horse is sober.
LISA=>Amazing, and you're in charge here.
O'SHEA=>Listen, I think we got off on the wrong foot today.
O'SHEA=>Feck.
O'SHEA=>Sorry.
LISA=>It's OK.
O'SHEA=>What's that? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 26.
O'SHEA=>Whoa, that last drink's gone straight to me head.
LISA=>Just your head?
O'SHEA=>Well, other places too.
LISA=>Do you get this drunk every night?
O'SHEA=>Just high days and holidays.
LISA=>Let's get you to bed.
O'SHEA=>Now you're talking.
PADDY=>You dirty ...
PADDY=>Bastard.
IRENE=>Tadhg, you're stinking. Would you get in the bath already, I can smell you from here.
TADHG=>I'm watching this.
IRENE=>What were you doing at all today?
IRENE=>God, 'tis blowing a gale out.
TADHG=>What?
IRENE=>I said 'tis ... nothing. I don't know why we had to move here.
TADHG=>Apart from your Mam.
IRENE=>What was that?
TADHG=>Irene?
IRENE=>What?
TADHG=>Someone's at the door.
IRENE=>I'm not dressed.
TADHG=>All right, all right.
TADHG=>It's that bloody Declan Cooney and he's pissed as a fart.
IRENE=>Don't give that cowboy any money.
TADHG=>Cooney, you look like death. What are you doing?
IRENE=>What does he want?
TADHG=>To dance?
IRENE=>Jesus.
TADHG=>Cooney? Are you all right, mate?
TADHG=>Cooney?
IRENE=>Tadhg! Tadhg!
IRENE=>Honey? Oh God. Oh God.
UNA=>Good morning. Sleep well?
LISA=>Grand, thanks. Do I have something to sign?
UNA=>Oh yeah. The big one. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 31.
LISA=>How's the weather looking?
UNA=>Oh, there's a storm coming.
LISA=>Really? Are the gulls flying low or something?
UNA=>No, it's on the telly.
UNA=>So, you're working with O'Shea?
LISA=>Temporarily.
UNA=>He's a nice fella isn't he? Quite a catch.
LISA=>Depends what you're fishing.
UNA=>Single? So's O'Shea. Well, widowed.
LISA=>Widowed?
UNA=>Why do you think he's here? Sure there's no want for him round this neck of the woods but I suppose he wanted the peace. Or his superiors thought he did. He doesn't say, God love him.
UNA=>So will you be sticking to the same room all week? Because we have a few doubles. There's more room in those, you know yourself.
LISA=>The single room is fine.
UNA=>Are you sure now? You never know if you want to stretch your legs later on. Give it a week and we'll be booked solid, so we will.
LISA=>I'll think about it.
LISA=>Morning.
O'SHEA=>Wha..?
LISA=>How much does a place like this go for? I mean it's close to the beach, all mod-cons. It's perfect.
O'SHEA=>I ... uh, what happened?
LISA=>Section four point one of the Public Order Act. It is an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger themselves or any other in the vicinity. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 33.
O'SHEA=>You arrested me?!
LISA=>For your own good.
O'SHEA=>Let me out of here.
LISA=>Relax. You passed out before I could find your house.
LISA=>Garda Nolan.
PADDY=>So I get a reward for discovering it, right? A finders fee?
O'SHEA=>We'll discuss it later.
PADDY=>But I get something, right?
O'SHEA=>Eurgh.
SMITH=>Is that your professional opinion?
PADDY=>A Grabber.
O'SHEA=>A what? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 34.
SMITH=>I told you I'm not calling it that. It needs a binomial nomenclature, one identifying its genus and class and once I've figured that out --
PADDY=>I discovered it. I get to name it.
SMITH=>Hi.
LISA=>Hi.
O'SHEA=>Hi.
PADDY=>Hello.
LISA=>What is that thing?
SMITH=>I haven't a clue. I've never seen anything like it. It's a completely foreign species. I can't even begin to originate or class it.
PADDY=>A Grabber.
LISA=>And this attacked you?
PADDY=>Stuck on the ceiling, it was. Like a pancake. Nearly ripped me throat out. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 35.
O'SHEA=>Is it dead?
SMITH=>I'm not sure.
O'SHEA=>You're not what?
SMITH=>Well basic tests I've done so far have shown up nothing usual or normal. It's beyond mystifying. Really I can't be certain without opening it up.
PADDY=>'Tis dead.
SMITH=>Would you stop doing that? It isn't any wonder it bit you.
LISA=>What's that in its mouth?
SMITH=>Its tongue. Check it out.
LISA=>That's not a tongue.
O'SHEA=>It's a weapon.
PADDY=>It spits like a frog and strangles ya. Whippet fast, and sharp.
SMITH=>I'm guessing it bleeds its prey like a leech. Consuming the blood, like some sort of vampiro toothis. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 36.
O'SHEA=>Vampiro what?
SMITH=>Toothis. It's a rare deep sea squid but this isn't that, not in Irish waters. No, this is something totally different. Something ... alien. In that it's undocumented.
PADDY=>It's gotta be worth a fortune.
SMITH=>But here's the thing...
SMITH=>-- When I tried to clean some dirt off of it --
PADDY=>I stood on it a few times.
SMITH=>-- this happened --
SMITH=>All this thing needs to survive is blood ... and water.
PADDY=>Could you put it on the eBay, do ya think?
SMITH=>You are not putting this on eBay. You're lucky she didn't kill you.
O'SHEA=>She? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 37.
SMITH=>Yeah, it's a female from what I can tell.
PADDY=>How can you tell?
SMITH=>It's got no testicles.
SMITH=>And ... she was pregnant.
LISA=>That's disgusting.
SMITH=>We're dealing with something extraordinary here. And if it looks like this when it hatches, then this species nests on land.
LISA=>Do you reckon those things had anything to do with those dead whales?
LISA=>What is it?
O'SHEA=>That's Declan Cooney's car.
O'SHEA=>Cooney?!
LISA=>Where could he be?
O'SHEA=>Nowhere without his keys. Do you believe in coincidences?
LISA=>Not really.
O'SHEA=>Neither do I.
O'SHEA=>Come on.
LISA=>Where are we going?
O'SHEA=>When you're looking for answers you gotta go asking questions.
O'SHEA=>All the lights are on.
O'SHEA=>How come you're not in uniform?
LISA=>It's Sunday. Hey, neither are you!
O'SHEA=>It suits you.
LISA=>-- Smith's a nice fella, isn't he?
O'SHEA=>Oh he's positively smashing.
LISA=>A proper gentleman. And such polite company.
O'SHEA=>Uh huh. Tadhg? Irene?
LISA=>A lovely fella.
O'SHEA=>He's like you, he's married to his job.
LISA=>I'm not-- I take pride in my work. Unlike yourself.
O'SHEA=>Shush, I'm working.
O'SHEA=>Tadhg? Irene?
LISA=>You're looking in the wrong place, Columbo. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 40.
LISA=>Hold it steady.
O'SHEA=>You're something else, you know that. You should've joined the army, not the guards.
LISA=>Stop talking to yourself. It's very distracting.
O'SHEA=>I'm not talking to myself, I'm talking to you.
LISA=>Uh huh, great. There's something up here.
O'SHEA=>Could you be a bit more specific?
LISA=>It's a --
O'SHEA=>Well?
LISA=>Ugh, it stinks like that thing.
LISA=>Oh the Divine Mother of Jesus --
LISA=>Watch out!
O'SHEA=>Aw Jesus Cock!
LISA=>You broke its nose.
O'SHEA=>What killed him, Jim?
DR GLEESON=>The fact he's just a head!
DR GLEESON=>Jesus what do you think? You bring me someone with a head cold or a headache and I could do something. You bring me just a head and you're taking the piss.
LISA=>So when can they get here? ... Tomorrow? ... And what about the state pathologist?
DR GLEESON=>They could bury him in a shoebox. That's not right.
LISA=>Doctor, we need to know.
DR GLEESON=>I don't know. A tiger? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 42.
O'SHEA=>A tiger?!
LISA=>I can't say that.
DR GLEESON=>I'm telling you his head was torn off. By something big.
LISA=>No, no, don't put me through I've already spoken to -- ugh. Thanks.
PADDY=>Holy Christ, wait till I tell ya!
O'SHEA=>Jesus, Paddy.
PADDY=>What? What's wrong with ya?
O'SHEA=>What is it?
PADDY=>Come look for yourself.
PADDY=>How am I supposed to wash meself?
O'SHEA=>OK, we're here. Here's where Cooney's car was abandoned. Here's Tadhg and Irene Murphy's house and here's where the whales washed up.
LISA=>OK, so what does that mean?
O'SHEA=>I have no idea. I was hoping it would show some sort of pattern.
PADDY=>It's the letter zed!
LISA=>Did you show that thing to anyone else before we saw it?
PADDY=>Tadhg Murphy got a look of it when I brought it in. It gawked on him, but that was it.
PADDY=>Why?
LISA=>We think there might be another one of those things, at least one anyway.
PADDY=>Are you serious? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 44.
O'SHEA=>Yeah. That thing you caught couldn't have fertilised that egg by itself, which would mean there's a male out there big enough and strong enough to knock a hole in your bathroom wall.
LISA=>Smith said it needs water, right?
O'SHEA=>He says a lot of things.
PADDY=>Mostly bollocks.
LISA=>Whatever. But if it needs water to survive, how could it be moving about on dry land?
PADDY=>It was raining! When it rains there's no such thing as dry land.
LISA=>There's a storm due tonight.
PADDY=>It'll piss it down.
O'SHEA=>OK, all this is on the west side of the island, right? So that would make this area its territory; which would mean it's got to be somewhere close. Somewhere with access to the waters around the west beach.
PADDY=>The black rock caves. I caught the female just beyond there.
O'SHEA=>What do you think?
LISA=>I think we've got at least two missing persons. We need to take a look.
PADDY=>Ya know what's to blame for all this? Global warming. Ya got your icebergs meltin' and your thingmajigs floodin'. The whole world's drownin' and we don't have the gills for it.
O'SHEA=>What?
LISA=>I didn't say anything.
O'SHEA=>You gave me that look.
LISA=>What look?
O'SHEA=>The "I feel sorry for you" look.
LISA=>No I didn't.
O'SHEA=>Yeah you did.
LISA=>No, I gave you the "I feel embarrassed for you" look. Big difference.
O'SHEA=>Sure that's worse!
O'SHEA=>Look, I know I'm no dandy fop, Ph. D. Smith type.
LISA=>What's Smith got to do with your raging alcoholism? Hmm?
O'SHEA=>I'm not a raging-- You're some character you know that. A real character. I'm a social drinker.
LISA=>Uh huh. Of course you are.
LISA=>Lovely.
PADDY=>We're here.
PADDY=>Tides coming in. Another hour and this place will be under water.
O'SHEA=>Wait here.
PADDY=>You can be sure of it.
LISA=>Are we missing some fishermen?
O'SHEA=>Hello!
LISA=>My heart! What are you doing?
O'SHEA=>Just checking. Well, if you know of a better way? Hello?!
LISA=>What are you expecting? "Helloooo, 'tis only me."
O'SHEA=>Run!
O'SHEA=>Lisa! Hurry!
LISA=>I'm trying!
O'SHEA=>Move your arse! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 48.
LISA=>Get your hands off my arse!
LISA=>I swear to God, if you don't stop!
O'SHEA=>If I die in here I want you to know it's all your fault!
LISA=>Oh shut up.
LISA=>The size of it.
O'SHEA=>It's OK. It can't get us on dry land. Not when it's not raining, it can't.
O'SHEA=>... What?
LISA=>Leg it! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 49.
PADDY=>Mother of God.
PADDY=>The eggs are buried on the beach! There's feckin' loads of 'em!
LISA=>Run!
SMITH=>Good, you're back. I have a theory! Those whales were killed as a food source for their spawn --
O'SHEA=>The eggs are buried at the beach.
SMITH=>Exactly.
LISA=>We know.
SMITH=>Oh.
PADDY=>Well done.
SMITH=>What are you doing?
O'SHEA=>Everywhere that's been, the other one's followed. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 50.
SMITH=>You found another one? Where?
O'SHEA=>It tried to eat us! And it's HUGE and looking for her ... but this will be the last place it looks.
SMITH=>Are you mad? Don't do that!
SMITH=>No, stop, you'll --
LISA=>Smith, it's for the best.
SMITH=>No, you muppet! If he lights that in here you'll--
SMITH=>-- get it wet.
O'SHEA=>Shit.
SMITH=>You really are Irish.
LISA=>Shut it off!
PADDY=>See ya later, lads.
SMITH=>Careful. Once it's wet I don't know what it can do.
O'SHEA=>It didn't burn.
LISA=>Is it dead?
O'SHEA=>I --
SMITH=>OK, it's an alien.
O'SHEA=>You vicious little fu--!
LISA=>Ah! Jesus! O'Shea! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 52.
O'SHEA=>We need to kill it.
SMITH=>No! You can't! It's the scientific discovery of our time, imagine all that we could learn FROM --
SMITH=>I think we got it.
O'SHEA=>Good man.
SMITH=>It's still moving.
LISA=>We need to get help.
O'SHEA=>They'll never make it across the water.
LISA=>If those eggs hatch, with no whales to eat --
SMITH=>-- they'll head in land to feed.
O'SHEA=>Finishing each other's sentences now?
LISA=>What?
O'SHEA=>Nothing. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 53.
PADDY=>They're hatching.
O'SHEA=>It took three of us to get that thing off me.
PADDY=>I woulda helped but I've a bad back, gives me shocking pain, you know yourself.
O'SHEA=>How are you still alive?
PADDY=>Diet and exercise.
O'SHEA=>No, when that thing attacked you. You should be laid out in a box right now, but you're not. What makes you so special?
PADDY=>I was always lucky.
SMITH=>Mustn't have liked your blood much.
LISA=>What have you been eating?
O'SHEA=>You were drunk!
DR GLEESON=>Grabbers?
SMITH=>No, it's a cryptozoological amphibious sanguivore.
LISA=>Not a tiger.
DR GLEESON=>Where are you getting all these heads?
O'SHEA=>Come on.
DR GLEESON=>This place has gone to the dogs.
O'SHEA=>They're like leeches, right? They feed off your blood. Well when one of them bit Paddy, it almost died, why?
PADDY=>Slow down for fuck sake.
LISA=>Because Paddy was so intoxicated his blood-alcohol level was toxic.
O'SHEA=>Exactly. If we taint our blood with booze, we're poisonous to eat.
SMITH=>In theory.
PADDY=>And you told me to cut back. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 55.
O'SHEA=>We have just one night where we have to deal with this on our own. Tomorrow, we'll be sorted. We'll get off the island, they'll nuke the beaches or whatever they do, but all we have to worry about is tonight. And it's simple. We have a lock-in. We stay out of the rain and we drink. We can't stop them coming but we can be ready.
BRIAN=>What?
SMITH=>A hostile migra --
DR GLEESON=>-- Grabbers.
SMITH=>God sake.
BRIAN=>Are ye for real?
PADDY=>Are we for real? Are YOU for real? Show him.
BRIAN=>That? Sure you could kill that with a hammer.
O'SHEA=>That's just the tip of the blood sucking iceberg.
BRIAN=>Grabbers.
SMITH=>I give up. Yes, a Grabber.
DR GLEESON=>But if its allergic to booze can't we just hose 'em with vodka or some shit?
O'SHEA=>No, that won't work.
BRIAN=>How do you know?
SMITH=>Because alcohol is a poison. It needs to be ingested to take affect. Also to preserve specimens I keep them in an alcohol based solution. Just like with this one, right now.
BRIAN=>It's filled with?
SMITH=>Yep.
PADDY=>Can you drink it?
DR GLEESON=>So what if we sprayed whiskey in its mouth?
PADDY=>Feck that. A waste of whiskey.
LISA=>If you want to get that close to it, good luck.
UNA=>What's going on here then? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 57.
BRIAN=>Just discussing something.
UNA=>Looks like you're plotting something.
O'SHEA=>No, no. More like planning.
UNA=>Huh. Carry on.
BRIAN=>Great. It's her birthday next week now she thinks this is something for her.
DR GLEESON=>She's in for a shock.
O'SHEA=>Listen, the only people that know about this are us and it's gotta stay that way or we'll have a panic on our hands.
LISA=>How drunk are we talking here?
SMITH=>Paddy levels of drunkenness.
DR GLEESON=>You're gone off your game, boy.
LISA=>No offence but I don't think my body can handle Paddy levels.
PADDY=>It takes years of practice. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 58.
BRIAN=>If those things do come for us, we'd be lambs to the slaughter if bombed out of our brains.
LISA=>And with everyone hammered there's no one in a fit state to call the shots. The non-alcoholic shots.
DR GLEESON=>Yeah but single someone out and they'll be sought as the only meat on the menu.
LISA=>But what's to keep us safe from ourselves, forget what's outside, we could fall over and break our necks trying to conga. Statistics prove put a large number of people in a confined space, ply them with booze and --
PADDY=>-- you've got a hooley.
LISA=>That's not what it said.
O'SHEA=>This will work. And I'll keep order. I won't be drinking.
LISA=>You? We'll both do it.
SMITH=>That would put you both at risk. I suggest it's just O'Shea.
O'SHEA=>Thanks. Only one of us need risk it and I know these people and this island better than you. It should be me.
SMITH=>I agree. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 59.
LISA=>I see what you're doing here but have you forgotten you're a dependent alcoholic organising a piss up in a brewery! I'll do it. It'll be easier.
O'SHEA=>Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink. I know that. So do you. I can do this.
PADDY=>It's gonna rain any minute.
LISA=>OK. But just so you know, I don't drink. I've never even been drunk. I don't know if I can.
O'SHEA=>Of course you can. And you'll be the best drunken Guard this country's ever seen. You'll probably get promoted.
LISA=>Ah stop.
SMITH=>Right, if we're doing this we'll need a blood test from a healthy subject. Lisa, you're the fittest person here.
LISA=>You charmer. It's true, though.
O'SHEA=>Brian, I want a table of everything Paddy had last night.
BRIAN=>What night was last night? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 60.
PADDY=>Saturday night.
LISA=>Oh you gotta be joking me!
PADDY=>Oh it was a big one.
BRIAN=>Comin' right up.
LISA=>He never liked me as much as her. She was the talented one, Daddy's little girl. That bitch!
O'SHEA=>Come on. Three fingers.
LISA=>But I got you guys. I love you all. Even you.
BRIAN=>She's langers.
O'SHEA=>There, that's everything.
PADDY=>I also had a snifter of ...
BRIAN=>What's that? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 61.
PADDY=>A little home brew.
BRIAN=>You bring potcheen into my bar?
PADDY=>A bird never flew on one wing.
O'SHEA=>When this is over we need to talk.
PADDY=>Ah come off it, this could save all our lives yet.
PADDY=>There ya go, pet.
BRIAN=>I'll take that.
PADDY=>You will in me shit.
O'SHEA=>Paddy.
LISA=>I need to pee.
LISA=>Ow.
O'SHEA=>Now the tainted blood. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 62.
BRIAN=>If you're right, this will kill it?
O'SHEA=>Blow. Point two.
DR GLEESON=>Holy Christ!
O'SHEA=>OK, now we know what we gotta do. Keep our blood alcohol levels at point two.
DR GLEESON=>You unnatural eejit. You're what'll kill us. Point two?!
SMITH=>How are we going to determine that based on each person's body mass index?
DR GLEESON=>You're looking at up to ten pints each depending on height and weight.
BRIAN=>We'll have to do shots. Properly tear the arse out of it.
O'SHEA=>So lets do it.
BRIAN=>Who's going to pay for all this by the way? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 63.
FR POTTS=>Mass has ended, go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
O'SHEA=>Is this everyone?
BRIAN=>It's Fr Potts last mass, so everyone that didn't leave yesterday for the thing in Dungary.
O'SHEA=>Father, do you mind if I say a few words?
FR POTTS=>Go mad.
O'SHEA=>Can I have your attention please?
MAMIE=>Oh here we go. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 64.
O'SHEA=>Folks, just a quick announcement, at Maher's Tavern tonight we're having a bit of a shindig and you're all coming to join us for what will be a great night's craic!
UNA=>You're throwing a party?
O'SHEA=>Yeah.
UNA=>Why?
O'SHEA=>Who needs a reason to have a laugh?
LISA=>It's a welcome party for me.
UNA=>A welcome party? But you're leaving in a fortnight.
LISA=>So it's a goodbye party. Whatever.
UNA=>You only just got here.
LISA=>What's her problem?
O'SHEA=>What we mean to say is --
LISA=>-- Hey bucko! Where are you going? This party's for your benefit. And all of you are gonna be there too. It's the law! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 65.
LISA=>And I swear to God I'll arrest any one of you who isn't. Chalk it down!
FISHERMAN=>Are you coddin' us, love?
LISA=>What's your name?
O'SHEA=>What Garda Nolan means is we'd love your company. There's no point going home to a cold, empty house in weather like tonight when we'll be right across the street from here and we'll have music and craic and company -- and a FREE BAR!
BRIAN=>What?!
HILDA=>Sold!
O'SHEA=>That's the spirit! So c'mon, it's a party and the drinks are on us!
O'SHEA=>Weapons. What have we got?
LISA=>Crap. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 66.
DR GLEESON=>I've got a nail-gun.
DR GLEESON=>And a board with a nail in it.
PADDY=>I've got a hurley and a pellet gun.
SMITH=>What are we gonna do with a pellet gun?
PADDY=>Shoot pellets. But I don't have any pellets.
SMITH=>Great, well you can just wave it at them then.
O'SHEA=>All right, what have you got?
SMITH=>I've got a flare gun.
LISA=>I dibs the flare gun.
BRIAN=>C.P.S. forty-one hundred pump action twin jet Super Soaker. Shoots twenty feet. The nephew's.
PADDY=>A water pistol? This thing likes the water.
BRIAN=>It's a water pistol if you use water. Fill it with petrol and you've got a flamethrower.
LISA=>I dibs the water pistol. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 67.
O'SHEA=>Right, well look sharp. You know your stations: guard each exit and don't let anyone out. Bottoms up.
LISA=>Tequila!
MAMIE=>Two shandies, Brian pet.
BRIAN=>How's the heart, Mamie?
MAMIE=>Tip top.
BRIAN=>Thank Christ for that. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 68.
MAMIE=>Perfect.
LISA=>I dunno, you know?
LISA=>C'mere. Listen. Listen. At the end of the day, you know? I dunno. I'm so into you right now. Joke. Kinda.
O'SHEA=>How much have you had?
LISA=>Not enough to fancy you.
O'SHEA=>Then keep drinking.
O'SHEA=>Blow. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 69.
LISA=>That's it, is it? You think I think I fancy you. That's the sitchuashun we got, huh?
O'SHEA=>No more for you.
LISA=>Well I do. So whatcha wanna do 'bout it? Arrest me?
O'SHEA=>You know as flattering as it is to hear a beautiful drunk slurring her feelings for me, now's not the time.
LISA=>Why do you drink so much, Ciarán?
O'SHEA=>For the craic.
LISA=>Yeah right, and I work everyday 'cause I'm driven.
LISA=>Always chasing them goals, you know? Always chasing. Always running.
O'SHEA=>You're too hard on yourself.
LISA=>I feel like I've known you for years. I don't know why.
O'SHEA=>Maybe because I put years onto people. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 70.
LISA=>... Yeah. That's true.
LISA=>I'm sorry about your wife, O'Shea. I really am.
O'SHEA=>My what?
LISA=>Una told me, how she died. I'm so sorry.
O'SHEA=>Una said what? Of all the stories. Una is the biggest gossip going. You shouldn't listen to her. No one died. We just ... we didn't work out.
LISA=>Oh. Ah shite, I'm sorry.
O'SHEA=>You're grand.
LISA=>... Did you split because ... because of your alcoholickissness?
O'SHEA=>I didn't drink back then. No, she met someone else. It happens.
LISA=>Feck her, O'Shea. If you want I'll find her and do her in for you?
O'SHEA=>A toast. From an alcoholic to a workaholic. To getting out of this alive.
LISA=>Hmm, toast.
O'SHEA=>Patrol to Base. Patrol to Base. Come in, over.
SMITH=>Reading you loud and clear. Over.
O'SHEA=>How are we doing?
SMITH=>Ignorance is bliss.
O'SHEA=>Great. Keep it up. Over.
HILDA=>Two pints please, Brian.
BRIAN=>Both for you? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 72.
HILDA=>No. Jesus, what'cha take me for?
BRIAN=>Right, right. Are you sure?
HILDA=>I am!
BRIAN=>Grand, grand. C'mere Hilda, you're looking well. Did you lose weight?
HILDA=>Aw, really? Well I have been doin' the walkin'.
BRIAN=>Yeah, yeah. How much would you say you lost? Would I be right in thinking you're around fourteen stone?
BRIAN=>No? Fifteen? Yeah, I better go with fifteen to be safe.
PADDY=>Ya all right?
DR GLEESON=>Ugh, bloated.
PADDY=>Ya haven't touched your pint. Ya gonna finish it?
DR GLEESON=>Hold onto it for me.
DR GLEESON=>C'mon, c'mon. Is some bloke doin' his makeup or what?
DR GLEESON=>Ah, feck the likes of this.
DR GLEESON=>Whoa, feck off!
DR GLEESON=>Christ Almighty, me head!
O'SHEA=>Jim, don't move! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 74.
DR GLEESON=>Get it off! Get it off!
LISA=>Git! G'wan! Shag off!
O'SHEA=>You OK, Jim?
DR GLEESON=>I had to piss.
LISA=>Fuck that.
FR POTTS=>Jesus Christ, Una.
LISA=>Get in.
O'SHEA=>WAIT! Oh Jesus Mary Mother of God.
LISA=>Shite. Get in.
O'SHEA=>Drive! Drive!
O'SHEA=>AHH, THE OTHER WAY! THE OTHER WAY!
LISA=>Shite!
O'SHEA=>Let me drive!
LISA=>I'm not feeling so good. I need a drink to calm me nerves.
O'SHEA=>Get us out of here!
LISA=>I can't drive with you shaking me. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 76.
O'SHEA=>We're gonna die!
O'SHEA=>Put your foot on the clutch!
LISA=>I am arresting you for the murder of Doctor Gleeson. You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.
BRIAN=>Base to Patrol. O'Shea we're running short here. We're dry on four taps and out of spirits and wines. Over.
O'SHEA=>BRIAN, GET THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!
LISA=>Fuck that.
LISA=>It's eating the jeep.
O'SHEA=>Let it! GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 77.
BRIAN=>Merciful shit.
BRIAN=>Smith!
SMITH=>I can't feel my face.
BRIAN=>Smith, the lighter!
SMITH=>I think I'm drunk, Brian.
BRIAN=>Hurry!
SMITH=>Your floor is broken.
O'SHEA=>Grab the table.
BRIAN=>Smith! Light me!
BRIAN=>Nearly. Put the other light away. ... Stall on now. That's it ...
O'SHEA=>Brian, forget that help us barricade the door.
BRIAN=>Almost there.
BRIAN=>All right you ugly bollocks, have some of this shit!
BRIAN=>Ahh, Christ!
O'SHEA=>That's gonna blow! Get rid of it!
UNA=>What's goin' on?
O'SHEA=>Nothing!
UNA=>What was that? GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 79.
BRIAN=>What was what?
BRIAN=>Here, honey, have a drink.
UNA=>I have a drink.
BRIAN=>Have two.
UNA=>I've drunk enough.
O'SHEA=>Move back.
UNA=>Who is it?
BRIAN=>It's nobody, honey.
LISA=>Who wants toast?
SMITH=>I do.
O'SHEA=>Is every one all right?
LISA=>Grand.
UNA=>Mother of Jesus!
O'SHEA=>Is this what I'm like when I'm drunk?
LISA=>You're worse.
BRIAN=>We're dry.
PADDY=>We're what?!
BRIAN=>Unless someone goes outside to change the kegs, we're done drinking for the night.
PADDY=>No! NO!
PADDY=>I was just gettin' a taste for it.
O'SHEA=>Folks, listen carefully. We're moving this party upstairs.
FR POTTS=>Ah now, what kind of party is this?
O'SHEA=>It's just a precaution.
UNA=>A precaution to what?
MAMIE=>I'm goin' home. I'm pisht.
O'SHEA=>You can't. No one can.
FR POTTS=>Why?
LISA=>It's raining.
FISHERMAN=>Someone better tell us what's really going on here? Right now!
UNA=>This party isn't for me, is it, Brian?! You lied to me!
BRIAN=>You see you! This is your fault. You brought that thing on the island.
UNA=>What thing?
SMITH=>Are these my sausages?! Kill me. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 82.
PADDY=>Ah relax. You'll give yourself angina.
BRIAN=>I'll give ya angina. Outside, now! I claim ya!
O'SHEA=>No! You can't go outside!
LISA=>Because of the rain.
BRIAN=>C'mon then, put 'em up.
PADDY=>Right you are! I'm sick of your bollocks.
O'SHEA=>Paddy! Brian! Cop on, I'm asking ya! Now's not the time for this.
UNA=>Stop fightin! Stop fightin!
LISA=>Don't worry, we have it all under control. There's nothing trying to kill you.
SMITH=>We need more alcohol. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 83.
MAMIE=>Thanks be to Jesus, let me out of here!
O'SHEA=>No!
O'SHEA=>Get back! Smith, what are you doing? Smith!
SMITH=>It's raining again.
O'SHEA=>Smith, listen to me. It's bigger than you think. Get back inside now! Please, I'm begging you.
SMITH=>I need a picture with it. For National Geographic. And Facebook.
PADDY=>Feck your photos, change the kegs! What? He's flutered, sure he'll be fine. G'wan, Smith! Fine fella y'are!
O'SHEA=>Smith, mate! Listen to me!
SMITH=>Shush, you'll scare it.
UNA=>Oh my God!
FR POTTS=>What the fuck was that?
PADDY=>A Grabber.
SMITH=>Steady. You don't want to eat me. I'm ripped to the tits!
SMITH=>Sticky.
SMITH=>See! I told you. It's just an animal, it doesn't want to hur--
PADDY=>He flew?!
O'SHEA=>Everyone, upstairs! Now!
O'SHEA=>Everyone, stay calm. They can't get up here.
FR POTTS=>And what in the name of fuck were those things?
PADDY=>Jumpers.
FR POTTS=>Ha?
PADDY=>They jump.
O'SHEA=>Has anyone been bitten? You haven't been bitten because of the alcohol you've been drinking. They're allergic to drunk people. So there's no need to panic, we're safe up here. Has anyone got a mobile on them?
O'SHEA=>Call the mainland. Call the Coastguard. Call whoever you can get through to. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 86.
MAMIE=>Father, is it the apocalypse?
FR POTTS=>Jesus, I hope not.
O'SHEA=>We'll be fine!
BRIAN=>It's just linen and cleaning stuff. Nothing we can really use.
FISHERMAN=>Why can't ya just shoot it? Ye guys must have some guns.
O'SHEA=>We're the Gardai. Not the LAPD. An Garda Siochana will succeed not by force of arms or numbers, but on their moral authority as servants of the people.
FISHERMAN=>We're bolloxed.
BRIAN=>Yep.
O'SHEA=>Something's not right. It can't be that hungry.
PADDY=>It's the female. It's following her scent. Sure didn't she slime you in the lab? Like with me bathroom and Tadhg Murphy.
O'SHEA=>Tadhg Murphy's dead!
O'SHEA=>No, no, Tadhg Murphy's fine. He's at the festival on the mainland.
LISA=>And so's his wife.
BRIAN=>It's swinging one of Tommy Riordan's sheep at the door.
LISA=>My cat does that, then leaves it on the doorstep as a present.
PADDY=>A mating ritual.
O'SHEA=>What the hell does that mean?
PADDY=>It'll try to mount you, somehow. Failing that it'll most likely rip you limb from limb in frustration.
O'SHEA=>Grand. Ah sure what can ya do.
LISA=>Play hard to get.
HILDA=>Oh, God. What does it want?
UNA=>It's not gonna stop, is it? We won't survive the night. We're on a sinking ship.
O'SHEA=>What's your reading?
BRIAN=>Too drunk to drive a car but not drunk enough. We're sobering up. All of us.
UNA=>We can't just sit here. It'll bring the walls down around us. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 89.
PADDY=>What if we threw a bomb at it?
BRIAN=>Have you got semtex on you?
PADDY=>Not on me, no.
BRIAN=>How about we like push it off a cliff or something.
UNA=>Or electrocute it? I don't know.
PADDY=>I vote we feed it Father Potts. Unless it eats shit it'll choke to death.
FR POTTS=>I beg your pardon.
PADDY=>Feck, is he in here? I was joking, Father. I apologise.
UNA=>If we can't destroy it, what can we do?
O'SHEA=>What about the phones?
O'SHEA=>OK, we know it does two things: it drinks blood and it breathes water. We took away one, we could take away the other.
UNA=>What do you mean?
O'SHEA=>We need to keep it away from water. Dry it out somehow. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 90.
PADDY=>Look outside.
O'SHEA=>There's got to be some way we can stop it, fight fire with fire.
LISA=>The Grabber! Not the Grabber- Grabber, the mechanical one! The big yoke, with the arm and the thing and you know? That big aul whatchamacallit you crush things with. The feckin' thing at Cooney's site! What's it called?
PADDY=>A Grabber?
LISA=>Exactly! With that thing you could grab it, hoist it up and trap it. It's raining now but it has to stop some time right? And when it does it'd be stuck. Once the sun comes up it'd cook. That'd dry it out.
PADDY=>You think you can catch that thing?
UNA=>Sure 'tis lepping about all over the shop.
BRIAN=>You'd need some sort of...?
O'SHEA=>-- A death trap. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 91.
O'SHEA=>Have you got the keys to your truck?
BRIAN=>They'd be in the kitchen. On the table, I think.
O'SHEA=>I need them.
UNA=>You can't go downstairs, those things will tear you to pieces.
BRIAN=>She's right.
PADDY=>You might not get past them, but someone else could.
FR POTTS=>You'd be talking about the drunkest person we got.
O'SHEA=>Absolutely not, it's too risky. Paddy you go.
PADDY=>What? Feck off! Brian should go.
BRIAN=>I could try...
UNA=>Not a hope. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 92.
LISA=>Slow down there. I'll do it.
O'SHEA=>No. It's too dangerous.
LISA=>Which is exactly why you'll want the best drunken guard this country's ever seen. Right?
O'SHEA=>If you get in trouble. Pull the trigger.
LISA=>Oooh, savage.
O'SHEA=>Careful.
BRIAN=>You missed.
O'SHEA=>Just get the keys and come right back. I'll do the rest.
LISA=>Got it. Just the keys.
LISA=>I'll be all right. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 93.
UNA=>Look what they've done to the carpets!
LISA=>IT'S OK! I'M ALL RIGHT!
O'SHEA=>Shush!! Keep your voice down!
PADDY=>She's a goner.
BRIAN=>How are you gonna get to the truck?
O'SHEA=>Run very fast.
UNA=>Love, you're not that fast.
FR POTTS=>You'll need a decoy.
PADDY=>I got it. If its you it wants, then we give it what it wants. We fashion a dummy, dress it up like bait and confuse the shite out of it. It won't know where to look when there's two of you.
FR POTTS=>And how the hell do we make a dummy?
O'SHEA=>Improvise. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 94.
LISA=>Focus.
LISA=>Get off.
UNA=>I love that song.
PADDY=>What is she doing at all?
O'SHEA=>Hurry.
LISA=>UH FIRE! FIRE!
UNA=>Do you smell smoke?
FR POTTS=>We're going up in flames!
O'SHEA=>Where is she?
BRIAN=>You gotta go now.
O'SHEA=>I need those keys.
BRIAN=>We can't wait, son.
PADDY=>Yoohoo! Come and get me, you rotten bastard!
BRIAN=>Run, O'Shea, run!
O'SHEA=>Lisa?
LISA=>Would ya come on for fuck sake!
O'SHEA=>GO!
LISA=>I'm breaking so many laws. Drinking on duty. Driving under the influence. Speeding. Driving without lights on.
O'SHEA=>PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON!
LISA=>Ah that's better.
PADDY=>Good luck, boy.
BRIAN=>Let's bury the hatchet, Paddy... into the heads of those feckin' things!
PADDY=>Jumpers.
UNA=>Come on!
O'SHEA=>It's following me, so you get the crusher and I'll lure it into position.
LISA=>It's gone.
O'SHEA=>What is?
LISA=>The crusher, the JCB. It's gone. It's not here anymore.
LISA=>Ciarán.
O'SHEA=>I know.
LISA=>What are we gonna do now?
O'SHEA=>Fuck knows.
O'SHEA=>I've got an idea.
LISA=>I've got an idea too.
O'SHEA=>What's your idea?
LISA=>Why, what are you thinking?
O'SHEA=>I'M THINKING--
LISA=>Wait! We're not ready!
O'SHEA=>Run!
LISA=>Give me the keys!
LISA=>Got 'em. Shit!
LISA=>Got 'em!
LISA=>-- the wrong keys. It won't open. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 100.
LISA=>... Breaking and entering. Jacking a stolen vehicle ...
O'SHEA=>Come on, you langer. Just a little closer. Move. Hey, you want me, you're going have to come across and get --
O'SHEA=>Awwwwww bollocks.
O'SHEA=>Enough! Piss off!
LISA=>Get away from him, you --!
LISA=>Cunt.
LISA=>I got you.
O'SHEA=>You took your sweet time.
LISA=>I think this calls for a celebration.
LISA=>O'Shea!
O'SHEA=>Sláinte.
O'SHEA=>He couldn't handle his drink.
O'SHEA=>... What are you...?
LISA=>Oh shut your hole.
O'SHEA=>Jesus, you're dangerous.
LISA=>I know!
LISA=>You look like crap.
O'SHEA=>So do you.
LISA=>Here.
LISA=>I think I'll take some time-off.
O'SHEA=>You know if you lived here you'd be home already.
LISA=>Home of the Erin Island Grabbers. It's gonna get mental round here. GRABBERS - Production Draft 28/1/2011 104.
O'SHEA=>I'll need all the help I can get.
LISA=>You want to get some breakfast?
O'SHEA=>Yeah.
LISA=>First, lets get out of these wet clothes.
O'SHEA=>Sounds good.
