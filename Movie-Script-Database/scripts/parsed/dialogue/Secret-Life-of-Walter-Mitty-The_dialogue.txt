EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You know, you didn't really provide much detail about your occupation. Most people put theirs on their eHarmony page. You don't care to?
WALTER=>Is that like a must? Can't I just say like "I'm employed" or something?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Sure.
WALTER=>My work's not really that interesting. To women. Um. Or men.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>What do you do?
WALTER=>I'm a Practical Asset Manager. For a corporation.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>....okay. What do you do when you're not working?
WALTER=>Mostly I guess I commute to work? It's like an hour and--
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Okay. No worries. I'll submit this information, then check back in the afternoon for your possible eHarmony matchups. That's exciting, huh?
WALTER=>It is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I leave a "wink" for someone? To see if they "wink" back, or..?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>I'll have your eHarmony profile all uploaded in a minute.
WALTER=>Cool.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>So like in two minutes. But hey, you're a little light, if you don't mind me saying this, in your "Been There, Done that" column.
WALTER=>I forgot what I put there?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>...Nothing.
WALTER=>Oh, okay.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>We should beef that up. If you can think of anything to add that would make it, you know, not blank.... give me a ring, I'll add it.
WALTER=>I sure will.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>(like he's a little
CONCERNED)=>...Are you okay, man?
WALTER=>...Me?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Yeah. Why?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You sound, I don't know, a little stressed?
WALTER=>(thinks its odd this guy's taking a personal
INTEREST)=>No, I just had some stuff on my mind. The past couple months.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>....What kind of stuff?
WALTER=>(still thinking this personal interest is a
LITTLE ODD)=>Just, you know... life stuff.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah, I get that.
WALTER=>...okay thanks for asking, I guess, um, Todd was your name?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Todd Mahar. I'll be your eHarmony counselor, while you're with us here at eHarmony.
WALTER=>Okay. Cool.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah. Hey, let's hope you'll have a special lady on your mind later today.
WALTER=>Sounds good, Todd.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Later, Walter.
WALTER=>Later... Todd.
ROY=>Walter.
WALTER=>What's up, Roy?
ROY=>Hey. We just got acquired. Our company. This morning.
WALTER=>Our whole company did?
WALTER=>Gary? You're Vice President of Acquisitions. Right?
GARY=>Yeah.
WALTER=>... we just got acquired. Did you know that? Roy said.
GARY=>The company that I'm supposed to be acquiring companies for? It just got acquired?
WALTER=>Yeah, Roy said.
GARY=>Okay, that's not promising for me probably.
WALTER=>Yeah, they probably have their own acquiring guy.
GARY MANNHEIM=>He's probably the guy who acquired us.
TED HENDRICKS=>Ted Hendricks. Vice President of Acquisitions.
GARY MANNHEIM=>Gary Mannheim. Um. Vice President of Acquisitions. Too. So what are you going to be doing at the company, Ted?
TED HENDRICKS=>Managing the acquisition. Identifying overlap. Reducing staff where we find redundancy. What's your focus been here, Gary?
GARY MANNHEIM=>...I've been managing acquisitions. Identifying overlap. Then reducing staff where I find redundancy.
TED HENDRICKS=>Wow, okay. That's not...
GARY MANNHEIM=>Yeah, that's not good.
TED HENDRICKS=>No. What do you do?
WALTER=>I'm a Practical Asset Manager.
TED HENDRICKS=>Do you play an important role here?
WALTER=>I do. Yeah. Totally. I work in a one-on-one basis with all our photographers.
TED HENDRICKS=>I'm sorry. I was really getting into this song. What were you saying?
WALTER=>I was just saying I manage our film negatives from the moment they arri-
TED HENDRICKS=>Let's talk later. We have a specific time set aside to conference with employees of the former company.
WALTER=>What time is that?
TED HENDRICKS=>I'm not sure. But it's not at this time.
WALTER=>Okay.
TED HENDRICKS=>I have to see the board and start evaluations now.
WALTER=>Okay. Thank you. I mean "not thank you." I mean like "looking forward to it" I should have said.
WALTER=>(through the closing
DOORS)=>Looking forward to it.
TED HENDRICKS=>I'll come by sometime this week.
WALTER=>Awesome.
GARY MANNHEIM=>Are you going to come by my...um?
WALTER=>Hey, Hernando-
HERNANDO=>Yeah?
WALTER=>This 12th neg? From this last Life roll?
HERNANDO=>Yeah.
WALTER=>It's not here.
HERNANDO=>What's it of?
WALTER=>It's of something that's the Absolute Quintessence of Life. Or something.
HERNANDO=>What's "quintessence?"
WALTER=>It means like the best ever.
HERNANDO=>And you can't find it?
WALTER=>Um no.
HERNANDO=>Wow. That's not going to go over well with the new asshole.
TED HENDRICKS=>How's the issue shaping up?
EDITOR=>We got an email from Sean O'Connell.
TED HENDRICKS=>The photographer?
EDITOR=>Yes. He said he got the cover shot. His best. The Quintessence of Life.
TED HENDRICKS=>What does Quintessence mean?
EDITOR=>Like the best ever.
TED HENDRICKS=>Okay. Awesome.
TED HENDRICKS=>(repeating to himself for
SOME REASON)=>Quintessence.
WALTER=>Tim, did you find out anything about Negative Box 2-6? Where it was sent from?
TIM NAUGHTON=>(like he's a real big
DEAL)=>That's the Sean O'Connell commission?
WALTER=>Yeah, the guy who took this--
TIM NAUGHTON=>There's nothing in shipping. The box just showed up it seems like. There's no receipt.
WALTER=>...I'm getting nervous with these new guys around. Lost negative. But I'm not going to freak out. I think my work here the last nine years speaks for itself. I've made my mark.
TED HENDRICKS=>Who am I evaluating next?
WALTER=>What is this?
WALTER=>What is this?
WALTER=>I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box.
CHERYL=>(can't make it out clearly
EITHER)=>It's... is it two badminton racquets? What's it supposed to be?
WALTER=>It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost.
CHERYL=>You lost a Sean O'Connell?
WALTER=>(looking at the out of
FOCUS PRINT)=>...I'm trying to figure out what this picture is. I think he focused, set his lens then took the missing picture. It's just a better picture of this. What is this?
CHERYL=>Maybe Sean has it.
WALTER=>The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off.
WALTER=>No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him.
WALTER=>These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these.
CHERYL=>Have you figured anything out?
WALTER=>Not yet. Because my trail is... water.
WALTER=>A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. And a man thumb.
WALTER=>I've been trying to figure out the gender , as I sat here. How many people in the world?
CHERYL=>Six billion.
WALTER=>Everyone's got two, too.
CHERYL=>Two, too, what?
WALTER=>Thumbs.
CHERYL=>Yeah. But I think there are more Starbucks, so I don't know if that's what you'd call a hot trail--
WALTER=>Look what Sean gave me.
WALTER=>Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... ...boldly
CHERYL=>(having some fun with
WALTER)=>You guys covered the hotspots together boldly?
WALTER=>As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format.
CHERYL=>...What did you do this weekend?
WALTER=>We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you?
CHERYL=>My son and I went on a bike ride in Lake Valhalla. Jersey. We brought lunch. Had lunch in an actual field, of grass. We went swimming. My friend Marny lives on the lake. (getting to what's on everyone's minds around
THERE)=>...This is going to be the last issue. Life's going to be strictly online after this merger. No new photographs. We're just going to be an internet photo storehouse. That's what I'm hearing. They're going to let most of us go.
SEAN=>What's with all these shoes?
WALTER=>It's a sign of disdain here.
SEAN=>That's a lot of shoes, man.
WALTER=>They've been targeting western journalists all summer. It's been a real hot August.
SEAN=>Thanks for doing all the field work here and risking your ass and getting hit by shoes and stuff.
WALTER=>Let's just get this camera bag out of here. We can shoot the shit later, O'Connell. Over whiskeys.
WALTER=>I tried to leave a "wink." For someone. But it didn't work.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Well, they're not required to respond to you favorably. We can't FORCE--
WALTER=>No, it says "unable to perform request," Todd. So I don't think my wink really went through. Do I have like a broken page or something?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Broken page? I've never heard of that.
WALTER=>Well, okay, something's not working. On my page.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah, let me look here Okay, we received your application breaking your personality into 29 different dimensions, and, okay, I see the problem. You don't have any.
WALTER=>Any what?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Dimensions.
WALTER=>...I don't have any dimensions?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Not that we can determine. Through our models. You're just lacking distinguishing features as our system sees it. Based on our really extensive evaluation, you seem, to us, a little too indistinguishable from everybody else.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You're not standing out. In a way that would allow anyone to actually notice you. So hey, let's enhance your profile. Let me ask you, did you always want to be a practical asset manager?
WALTER=>I don't want to be one now. I just am one.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Why do you do it?
WALTER=>It's an occupation. When I became an adult I thought that would be possibly a good thing to have. Because I keep getting bills from places.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>What are some of your accomplishments?
WALTER=>...I studied music.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>How long?
WALTER=>April.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>April? One April?
WALTER=>Yeah. But I was working at Orange Julius to save money for college. That April. And my hands were always sore from working the Frother.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Can you play any pieces?
WALTER=>Sure.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Which?
WALTER=>A piece of Cheers. The first piece. Part.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>I don't know if we should list that.
WALTER=>Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a piano situation I have to take care of.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Okay, man.
WALTER=>Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back?
GUY IN PARK=>Stop playing Cheers, Dick.
WALTER=>Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York?
RICH=>(like it's going to be
FUN)=>Yeah.
CHERYL=>I can't believe they left it in the park. How old is this?
WALTER=>Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old.
CHERYL=>Your sister just took off?
WALTER=>My sister's not the responsible one in the family.
CHERYL=>No kidding, man.
WALTER=>She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off.
CHERYL=>Braces. How old is she?
CHERYL=>You're sure this is your sister's parking space?
WALTER=>Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that.
WALTER=>I used to skateboard a little.
CHERYL=>When?
WALTER=>Maine. When I was a kid. Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it.
CHERYL=>Thanks.
WALTER=>You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich. Thanks for putting your back into it.
RICH=>What does that mean?
WALTER=>Just, you know... helping out, man.
CHERYL=>See you tomorrow.
WALTER=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Are you sure I can't walk you home?
CHERYL=>I'm going to drop Rich at his Dad's. Thanks, Walter.
WALTER=>Is this the Arctic Ocean..? A glass of Sprite.
WALTER=>Hey were you able to use the Circulation computer to find that ship? That boat?
TIM NAUGHTON=>Yeah, it's registered in Nuuk.
WALTER=>Nuuk?
TIM NAUGHTON=>That's a town. I think the town in Greenland. It's a coastal fishing vessel.
WALTER=>....Greenland.
WALTER=>Tim, what would you say is a good accomplishment of yours, like something that you'd put on an online dating page?
TIM NAUGHTON=>I don't know.
TIM NAUGHTON=>I broke Adam Lopez's record for hitting the highest singing note for a male, I guess.
WALTER=>Seriously?
TIM NAUGHTON=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Wow...
TIM NAUGHTON=>But I don't know if I'd put that on eHarmony.
TIM NAUGHTON=>I just don't think that's really going to do a lot for the ladies.
WALTER=>Yeah. How did you know you can do that?
TIM NAUGHTON=>My voice goes way up there when I'm emotional, or whatever, can't really control it.
WALTER=>I was thinking about putting that I've never really been late coming back from lunch.
TIM NAUGHTON=>...I don't know. Kind of weak. That's not exactly winning the Tour de France.
WALTER=>...Yeah
FRENCHMEN=>Wal-ter Mi-tty.
FRENCHMEN=>Wal-ter Mi-tty.
EDNA=>Hi, honey.
WALTER=>Hey, Mom.
EDNA=>Hi, Walter. Is it all right I'm dropping by?
WALTER=>Sure, (meaning the open office
AREA)=>we'll just go through here to my office.
TIM NAUGHTON=>They just called a conference.
WALTER=>Hey, your new place is almost ready. We just had a little hiccup due to Odessa just not getting the right one.
EDNA=>Well, she's the artist...
WALTER=>Why did she get the cool name? She got to turn out cool.
EDNA=>I named her after a wonderful visit your Dad and I had to Odessa, our family's homeland, one summer, in southern Ukraine. There's a beautiful river there also named Odessa.
WALTER=>Why did you name me Walter?
EDNA=>I named you after Walter Matthau
WALTER=>Okay. This is starting I think. We should probably just stop here to--
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>This will only take a moment. I just wanted to inform you all, reluctantly, that this month's issue will be the last.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>You are all valued employees. But as we undergo this transition we wanted to be candid with you that some of you will be--
TED HENDRICKS=>(correcting him, a little more quietly, just to
HIM)=>Most.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>What's that?
TED HENDRICKS=>Most of them.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>We wanted to be clear that most of you will be determined non-vital to the new partnership. The remaining few employees will carry over into the new organization. We'll be deciding which category your positions fall into over the course of the next week.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>Now for some good news. We're very EXCITED TO--
TED HENDRICKS=>Okay. So, we're very excited to play a part in publishing what will be the very last issue of Life Magazine, which has been an American Institution for 75 years and whose renowned covers have touched us all really touching ways. And for the final issue, our cover is going to be something which is... What was that word?
EDITOR=>Quintessence.
TED HENDRICKS=>Our cover will probably be the most famous ever because it really has the awesome quintessence of Life. And we're all going to be a part of this historic happening. Even those of you who will, right after the happening, be asked to leave. Thank you.
WALTER=>Check for negative 12 in the wash bins.
EDNA=>So the moving bill came, for my move down here. I wanted to bring it by. Thank you so much Walter.
WALTER=>Mom, come on. It's nothing.
HERNANDO=>It's not in there, Walter.
TED HENDRICKS=>Yes, sir. It's gone very smoothly. The last issue's underway. The cover? Yeah. It's amazing. It's so quintessence. It encapsulates majesty. Totally. It has some splendor, in it, too, probably. Also, I'm pretty sure it's illustrious and just really awesome. It took my breath away. And I haven't even seen it yet. We're getting it processed from practical assets now. Yes, sir. We're going to retain eleven employees. I'm going to be evaluating them over the next week.
WALTER=>You know, the thing about Greenland... it's really not that far, man.
HERNANDO=>What's that?
WALTER=>Greenland.
HERNANDO=>What's Greenland?
WALTER=>It's a country/island. Sean might be there. It's not as close as Canada but it's really not as far as it sounds. When you hear it. Look.
HERNANDO=>Yeah, it's not that far.
WALTER=>This looks like a chair. Here.
WALTER=>Have you seen this chair?
TEEN=>That's not a chair.
WALTER=>I think it's a chair. Or a pipe. A man's pipe.
WALTER=>Have you seen this pipe?
TEEN=>That's not a pipe either.
WALTER=>(showing them another
PHOTO)=>Have you seen this Starbucks?
SECOND TEEN=>I don't know. Possibly.
WALTER=>Have you seen this man thumb?
CAB DRIVER=>Greenland is the least densely populated country in the world. There's only 56,000 people. Lots to do. Most of us work a few different jobs, to cover everything. For example I drive this cab.
CAB DRIVER=>I'm also the Queen.
WALTER=>...You're the Queen of Greenland?
CAB DRIVER=>Yeah. Oh, there goes my meter.
CAB DRIVER=>You want to just a call it 93 kroner? Flat rate.
WALTER=>That's cool... your Majesty.
WALTER=>Should I call you that?
CAB DRIVER=>Sure.
WALTER=>Is there anything around here that a renowned photographer might be photographing?
CAB DRIVER=>No.
WALTER=>Are you sure?
CAB DRIVER=>Yes.
WALTER=>I think he was here.
CAB DRIVER=>Well, possibly if he was mistaken, he might have thought the Musk Ox migration was worth photographing.
WALTER=>Can we see that?
WALTER=>So are you Queen for life?
CAB DRIVER=>Yeah.
WALTER=>That's a good gig. They're making some changes at work. My work. They're letting most of the divisions go.
CAB DRIVER=>How long have you been there?
WALTER=>Nine years.
CAB DRIVER=>That's tough.
WALTER=>How'd you get to be Queen?
CAB DRIVER=>My dad was King.
WALTER=>...My dad sold ice cream.
CAB DRIVER=>Here we are.
WALTER=>That's the Musk Ox migration?
CAB DRIVER=>Yeah.
WALTER=>There's just three of them.
CAB DRIVER=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Where are they migrating?
CAB DRIVER=>To the other side of the island.
WALTER=>(like it's not that big a
DEAL)=>Yeah, I don't think Sean would cover this, so much. Can you just take me to the boat wharf place?
WALTER=>You're the captain of the Erkigsnek? I don't know how to pronounce that.
BOAT CAPTAIN=>That wasn't right. But yeah, I know what you're trying to say. Yeah. I am.
WALTER=>You're boat was photographed. In the past four days. Do you know where?
BOAT CAPTAIN=>We've been out in the Atlantic the last four days. I have no idea when this was taken.
WALTER=>Can you guess from where?
BOAT CAPTAIN=>Where it was taken from?
WALTER=>Yeah.
BOAT CAPTAIN=>...another ship? Which I can't say. We passed a lot of them. You should check the mail logs at the post office.
POSTAL CLERK=>Are you a detective?
WALTER=>Yep.
WALTER=>Did I just say "yep?" I'm sorry. I meant "nope." I'm an office worker. We're trying to secure a photograph he might have, that's valuable to my company.
POSTAL CLERK=>Well, these are the airmail records from this last week. (checking a large
REGISTER)=>They helicopter mail in. As the shipping freighters go by. We had fifty three pick ups. That's fifty three freighters. He could have been on any one of them.
WALTER=>So he just went by us?
POSTAL CLERK=>If he was on a freighter, he went right by us.
WALTER=>So there's no one here who might have had contact with him, who might know where he's going.
POSTAL CLERK=>I'm afraid I can't help you.
POSTAL CLERK=>Unless you want to mail something.
WALTER=>No, I don't have any... mailing needs.
WALTER=>Can I ask you a question?
MAN=>Sure.
WALTER=>Where was your thumb like four days ago?
WALTER=>I can't believe I found one thumb.
PILOT=>Well, it's the least densely populated country on earth. It's a good place to find a thumb. He's on the Dolores. I helicopter dropped and picked up mail from her Tuesday. He's a strange guy.
WALTER=>Sean?
PILOT=>Yeah. He took a picture of my thumb.
WALTER=>Yeah, why?
PILOT=>He saw I worked my controls with it. He's shooting photos of people working. That's why he's on that ship. I'm taking some radio parts out there in fifteen minutes. Their radio's fucked.
WALTER=>Man, I really need to contact him. We're in a transition period and--
PILOT=>You could contact him by coming with me. Then contacting him. In person. On the boat.
WALTER=>...Can't we just call them? I could ask him on like the boat phone.
PILOT=>The Ship to shore.
WALTER=>Can I just ask him on the "ship to shore?" Instead of going on that old-looking helicopter?
PILOT=>Well, their radio's fucked. That's why I'm flying out.
WALTER=>You're leaving now?
PILOT=>After I finish my beer.
WALTER=>The weather doesn't seem great. Feels like there a storm "moving in." "Brewing."
MAN=>Yeah.
WALTER=>But you're just going to finish
YOUR BIG-GLASS-WOMAN'S-BEER-BOOT=>and then fly?
PILOT=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Okay. I'm not going to go with you.
WALTER=>Is that a fjord?
PILOT=>Yeah.
WALTER=>I've seen pictures of fjords. But I've never actually seen a fjord. I don't think I've ever even said the word fjord out loud--
PILOT=>Stop saying fjord. It's annoying.
WALTER=>Okay.
PILOT=>We're not going to be able to land on the freighter. I've got to drop the radio parts and you in a life raft.
PILOT=>It's a short drop, but your decision. You can just fly back with me.
WALTER=>I'd really like to get my hands on this property. They're making some changes at the office. It's going to reflect poorly on my work. I might get let go. And I have a mounting piano situation that's-- Whoa...
PILOT=>You're doing great. We're only six feet up. Just jump out the door, Walter.
CAPTAIN=>We're sending a pontoon. Try to remain calm.
CAPTAIN=>Okay, if that's a porpoise--
WALTER=>(sort of to himself,
LOOKING AROUND)=>If what's a-- what?
CAPTAIN=>If that is a porpoise, befriend it. Porpoises are mammals with rare intelligence and sympathy. They often protect swimmers from predators.
CAPTAIN=>If that's a shark, strike it. Their snouts are sensory hubs.
WALTER=>How do you-- I just see a fin. Can you get a bead on some more information?
CAPTAIN=>(then, to Walter through
THE MEGAPHONE)=>We're confident that's a shark.
CAPTAIN=>Okay, now we think that was a porpoise.
CAPTAIN=>That probably is a shark.
CHILEAN SAILOR=>Sean O'Connell? He was picked up.
WALTER=>From your ship?
CHILEAN CAPTAIN=>A pilot boat came. They took him. Four hours ago.
WALTER=>Took him where?
CHILEAN CAPTAIN=>I don't know.
WALTER=>Can we radio them? There's something I need to discuss with--
CAPTAIN=>You jumped into the ocean with our radio components. No. We are, as you say, "on our own."
CHILEAN SAILOR=>You can sleep where Sean did.
WALTER=>Sean slept here?
CHILEAN SAILOR=>Yes.
WALTER=>In this Subaru Outback?
CHILEAN SAILOR=>Yes. That's where our undocumented laborers sleep. Our Stevedores. He was photographing our workers.
WALTER=>He was photographing Chilean Stevedores?
CHILEAN SAILOR=>Yeah.
WALTER=>This was his room/car?
CHILEAN SAILOR=>Now it will be your room/car.
WALTER=>Hey. Walter.
WALTER=>Did you guys, were you living in this car back seat when Sean O'Connell lived in the front seat?
WALTER=>Sean?
BACK SEAT CHILEAN=>La Quintasencia....
SECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN=>La Quintasencia.
WALTER=>Is that-- Are you saying quin--
SECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN=>La Quintasencia...
WALTER=>Are you saying Quintessence? In the Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that.
WALTER=>Is that Clementine cake? My mom makes-- I didn't know anyone else made that.
WALTER=>Clementine cake. Wow.
WALTER=>This is Sean's.
WALTER=>...this is an itinerary.
WALTER=>That's where Sean is. Tomorrow. This gibberish. I have to crack it.
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>Crack?
WALTER=>I have to crack the gibberish.
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>You don't have to crack anything. It's a volcano. In Iceland. That's the name. Eyjafjallajökull.
WALTER=>...Sean's in Iceland. We're going past there, right? Can we land there?
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>We can get you there.
WALTER=>Can you get me there tomorrow?
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>We can get you there tomorrow, yes.
WALTER=>Would you like some Clementine cake?
WALTER=>It's very good. It tastes, man, exactly like my mom's. I didn't know Chilean mom's made this. Small world.
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>No thank you. I have to actually perform a function up here, during the storm. That's why I'm up here.
WALTER=>Oh. Sorry.
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>I have to monitor the mooring winches and wind Lasses.
ENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR=>And you're standing, I'm sorry, like right where I'm supposed to be looking.
WALTER=>Okay, I'm going to go, take my cake and.....
WALTER=>...Hello?
MAN'S VOICE=>Walter.
WALTER=>Yeah.
MAN'S VOICE=>Todd Mahar. From eHarmony.
WALTER=>...Oh. Hey. Um, do I owe you guys money? Because your supervisor was clear I can't get my 400 dollars back. But I don't think I'm going to renew-
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>No, I just wanted to see how you were doing. You didn't sound great last time.
WALTER=>The last time we talked? The time you told me I have no personality?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Well, you know, you just left your application so empty. Share something about yourself. It doesn't have to be major league.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Life's full of small accomplishments. What do you strive to do everyday, that you take pride in? Can I ask you that?
WALTER=>Well, I take my work seriously. Also keeping a tidy apartment. I help my sister out paying her bills now and then. But can we not list that? None of that stuff really seems like an accomplishment.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You know there's a way to consider it where the tasks you accomplish (paying some of your sister's rent--
WALTER=>Braces.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>What's that?
WALTER=>She hasn't asked me for rent money. For like a year. But I did pay for her braces. She's 36.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Well, taking care of yourself and your household, your mom, after you do that without ever failing, for a long time, hey that becomes an accomplishment.
WALTER=>I fought a dolphin.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Today?
WALTER=>Yeah.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Aren't they supposed to be nice?
WALTER=>They are. I think they're probably the best mammal.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>(meaning like aren't we
THE BEST)=>We're mammals.
WALTER=>This mammal tried to protect me. And most of the other mammals I know, like the mammals at the office, they're dicks.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Why are you near dolphins?
WALTER=>I'm on a ship.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Where?
WALTER=>Near Greenland. I tracked a thumb here. To Nuuk, Greenland. I located the thumb. Now I'm fortunately going to Iceland to correct an oversight.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Well, I'm going to tweak your profile, add "sailing" or whatever to your Done Thats. I'll put Swims with Dolphins, too.
WALTER=>It was just one.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>I can really put Swims with Dolphin. That sounds like you have a pet dolphin you swim with everyday. Can I handle this please? It's my job.
WALTER=>Okay, Todd.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You sound a little better?
WALTER=>Do I? Because I think I'm a little worse.
CAPTAIN=>It's a mile and half to Iceland. It's as far in as we can get with our hull size.
WALTER=>So. Okay. I'm supposed to kayak in?
CAPTAIN=>Reykjavik is due north. You'll be there by 9 am.
RICH=>I stayed under longer.
CHERYL=>Just barely.
RICH=>Let's do it again.
CHERYL=>Okay. One, two, three.
RICH=>You're cheating.
CHERYL=>Okay, okay. One two three.
CHERYL=>Rich...?
CHERYL=>Rich?
CHERYL=>It's okay. Come here. Hey come here.
CHERYL=>Hey, it's okay.
CHERYL=>Hey, don't worry. You're good. Don't worry. Hey...
CHERYL=>Don't worry, about a thing, `cause every little thing, is gonna be all right. Don't worry. About a thing...
WALTER=>....shit.
WALTER=>Fuck. Sorry.
WALTER=>Hey, Mom.
EDNA=>Hi, Walter.
WALTER=>What's up?
EDNA=>Oh, I'm just making some yogurt. With some banana.
WALTER=>Okay. Cool.
EDNA=>It snowed today. Didn't expect that. Not much. Just a light little cover. Very pretty. Less than an inch even.
WALTER=>That's awesome.
EDNA=>My piano got towed, Walter.
WALTER=>...Your piano got towed?
EDNA=>Yes. Odessa said it wasn't there. Where you said it was going to be.
EDNA=>She said possibly that it got towed. That that's not her space anymore.
WALTER=>I lent her money for that space.
EDNA=>Where are you, honey?
WALTER=>In Iceland.
EDNA=>That's nice.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT=>It is now safe to turn on portable electronic devices.
CAR IMPOUND OFFICER=>Retrieving..?
WALTER=>My mom's piano.
CAR IMPOUND OFFICER=>...Make and color?
WALTER=>(doesn't really understand the question in regard to
A PIANO)=>It's a Baldwin? Um, Walnut, I guess? A Walnut Baldwin. Piano.
WALTER=>It's a piano.
CAR IMPOUND OFFICER=>I heard you.
WALTER=>It's right out there. I just walked by it. Do you have more than one piano?
CAR IMPOUND OFFICER=>Impound fees. I'm making your fees. Heavy duty tow fee. $370. Two nights overnight. $80.
CAR IMPOUND OFFICER=>Failure to display city vehicle inspection sticker. $112.
WALTER=>It's a piano.
WALTER=>It's not a car. Its a musical instrument. I should have had my musical instrument inspected? By a government.
MOVER=>Where are we taking it?
WALTER=>We can't move into my mom's until tomorrow.
MOVER=>Well, what do you want me to do? Drive really slowly? We can store it at our warehouse and move it in the morning. But that's two moves. Separate billings.
WALTER=>Man.... You know what? Don't worry about it.
MOVER=>What are you talking about?
WALTER=>Don't worry about it.
ODESSA=>Does that say eHarmony? Four hundred dollars.
WALTER=>Yes.
ODESSA=>Are you on eHarmony?
WALTER=>No.
ODESSA=>Then why did you give them four hundred dollars?
WALTER=>I tried to join, but-- I don't really even want to be on it. I'm just trying to do this thing with someone at work.
ODESSA=>What?
WALTER=>I'm trying to do that Piña Colada thing? "If you like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain while wearing a cape--"
ODESSA=>That's not how it goes.
WALTER=>Well, the guy answers a personal ad and finds out it's his wife. They have a good laugh, then they make love on the cape while drinking Piña Coladas or something, and wearing capes, I think. Anyway. I'm hoping she'll click my profile and not realize that she works in my office area. Then we can realize it and have a good laugh. Then--
ODESSA=>Make love on a cape? While wearing capes? Because that's not what they do in the song.
WALTER=>No, then we can know that we picked each other out, you know, from the whole planet. Not just the cafeteria.
WALTER=>... We're friends. I'd like there to be more.
WALTER=>I was hoping this web site would show her more.
ODESSA=>What's that?
WALTER=>I don't know. What do you think it is?
ODESSA=>...Triple A batteries working, as a team, to carry a fish tank up some apartment stairs.
WALTER=>We better tell them they need to shift that over to outside the big room.
ODESSA=>What big room?
WALTER=>The big room where the big piano is going to go.
ODESSA=>This is the big room.
WALTER=>Hey, Odessa?
ODESSA=>Yeah.
WALTER=>You know when I asked you to pick the apartment out for Mom, you understood that she was taking her piano along.
ODESSA=>I did not understand that.
WALTER=>Oh, I thought I made that clear when I said the English sentence to you Mom's bringing her piano with her. A month ago.
ODESSA=>I think when we were having that conversation I was using my blender, for a juice drink. It's quite a noisemaker.
WALTER=>Did you enjoy that juice drink? That you were making simultaneous to me talking to you about important matters? So, okay, right now the piano is hanging in the air, above a city, we can't fit it in here, and I'm not sure I can afford to move it anywhere else. So I hope you enjoyed that juice drink.
RETIREMENT HOME ADMINISTRATOR=>The instrument will fit in one of our Villa apartments. Those units, though, are more spacious, and more highly priced.
RETIREMENT HOME ADMINISTRATOR=>Or you can remain with the unit lease you have, the less expensive one, and possibly sell the piano?
WALTER=>We can't. It's the only thing she really wanted to take along. I think it's really best for her. She can still play. Reading's not that easy for her now. She doesn't really have any friends in New York.
RETIREMENT HOME ADMINISTRATOR=>Well, a Villa Apartment comes open in three weeks.
WALTER=>What's that move-in like. In terms of deposits and-- for Villa living? In a Villa situation?
RETIREMENT HOME ADMINISTRATOR=>On your move-in we'll need first month's, last month's and your full deposit. $6,300.
WALTER=>How much should I make this deposit for today? To reserve it.
BILLING DIRECTOR=>Nine hundred.
WALTER=>Where's that frigging Clementine cake wrapper thing...
WALTER=>Warlock...
ODESSA=>What is that?
WALTER=>I almost found someone I was looking for. For work. In Iceland. This is where he's going next. I just don't know where it is. Warlock. Little weird deer. Like kind of a fez-style hat.
ODESSA=>What are you talking about?
WALTER=>That's what these things are. Klipspringer. Koofiyad. I just don't know what they add up to. I put them all in Google nothing comes up.
ODESSA=>...Is everything okay? At work? Are you sure?
WALTER=>Yeah. Don't worry.
ODESSA=>Hey. Happy birthday, Walter.
ODESSA=>Those were your favorite toys when you were a kid. You don't remember?
WALTER=>Yeah, I do.... Thanks.
WALTER=>Oh. Hey.
WALTER=>You know we haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I know you're deciding who's vital to the transition. And I wanted to let you know what I do--
TED HENDRICKS=>You're vital here?
WALTER=>I am. Totally.
TED HENDRICKS=>Why are you holding toys?
WALTER=>...It's my birthday.
TED HENDRICKS=>...you wanted toys.
WALTER=>No... Um, my sister gave me these.
TED HENDRICKS=>(nodding at Walter's
STRETCH ARMSTRONG)=>What does that do?
WALTER=>My... (doesn't want to call it a
TOY)=>...item?
TED HENDRICKS=>Yeah, you're toy.
WALTER=>His arms and legs stretch outward. Um. But that's not-- I wanted, before we have the chance to talk, I need to discuss an asset situation with you.
TED HENDRICKS=>A photographic negative? I thought those had all been processed?
WALTER=>I've processed the digitization of every single photograph in Life's library. Two million and eleven. But we haven't been able to locate this last negative.
TED HENDRICKS=>I know. Because I've been asking for it. Because it's the Quintessence fucking one that I told my boss we had. It's the cover. You seriously lost a photographer's work? At Life?
WALTER=>I'm confident we'll find it.
TED HENDRICKS=>Why are you confident we'll find it?
TED HENDRICKS=>That doesn't give me confidence, a no-answer. You're in assets, I guess?
WALTER=>Yes.
TED HENDRICKS=>This doesn't reflect very well on you.
TED HENDRICKS=>During an evaluation week.
WALTER=>I've been here nine years--
TED HENDRICKS=>(gesturing out his cell
PHONE)=>Here. Call Helmut Newton. Tell him you lost his picture.
WALTER=>Helmut Newton didn't--
TED HENDRICKS=>Don't Helmut Newton me.
WALTER=>I didn't Helmut Newton you.
WALTER=>I didn't Helmut Newton anyone. I was saying I haven't misplaced a negative in nine years. I've handled every negative in our library and prepared them for our archive. I've overseen their digitization, catalogued each photographer's period-specific film and photo equipment. And I've managed the preservation of the original vision of each photograph. I've never mishandled a single nega-
TED HENDRICKS=>Hey. We've held up publication of this issue because I told my boss that photo was fucking amazing. Okay? We've spent a hundred and nine thousand dollars because of the overage. You lost an amazing PHOTO--
WALTER=>I know where he is. Sean.
TED HENDRICKS=>Where is he?
WALTER=>Somewhere-- I haven't pieced it together, somewhere were there are little deers and Warlocks.
TED HENDRICKS=>Do you know what "fired with cause" means?
WALTER=>Yes.
TED HENDRICKS=>I have cause to fire you. You won't pick up another check. I can let you go without severance because-
WALTER=>THAT'S NOT--
TED HENDRICKS=>You lost a Sean O'Connell. It was quintessence. He's a war photographer? Cubicle, you're going to tell this brave photographer, risks his life, that you, a male sitting in an office, lost--?
WALTER=>Did you call me Cubicle?
TED HENDRICKS=>Do you work at one?
WALTER=>Well, yeah, but I'm not named after one.
TED HENDRICKS=>What are you named?
TED HENDRICKS=>What's your name?
WALTER=>Mom, why are you-- did you need something?
EDNA=>I just wanted to thank you for my Villa. Odessa told me all about it. It sounds so pleasant. Villa. That guy was a real dick.
WALTER=>Yeah.
EDNA=>Anyway, hon, you've really become the man of the family, and I wanted to say I love you, and Happy Birthday.
WALTER=>...thanks, Mom.
EDNA=>What a dick. Big man. Big warlord of the fortieth floor--
WALTER=>Warlord?
EDNA=>I was just discussing them. Last week. They rule over small areas of land using threats, and force bribes of livestock or klipspringers.
WALTER=>(strange, his mom's using words from the clementine
ITINERARY)=>...Klipspringers?
EDNA=>Yes.
WALTER=>Why did you just say that word?
EDNA=>In some parts of the world they carry small deer like we carry, say, quarters. To pay bribes. Also, blankets or clothing items like koofiyads.
WALTER=>...koofiyads.
EDNA=>Yes, for the warlords.
WALTER=>...Warlord.
(EXISTENTIALLY BEWILDERED=>about where he is) ...Is this real life?
WALTER=>I need to buy a ticket, I think to Dubai. Because I'm going, actually, to Mogadishu which I think, I'm not allowed to do from here, because it's illegally dangerous.
TICKET CLERK=>Yeah.. That's right more or less..
WALTER=>Here you go. Whoa, what do you have in there?
ULF=>Skateboards. Some switch out boards.
WALTER=>I like your trucks. I used to skateboard. Where are you guys headed?
SOREN=>Into Dubai.
WALTER=>Hey, do you guys know anyplace to stay, that's not like an arm and a leg.
SOREN=>He said you're too old to sleep in a room, but you can sleep in the stairwell, hallway or business center.
WALTER=>Business center.
NEWSCASTER=>...evacuations began in earnest Wednesday the third.
NEWSCASTER=>In a city already long ago descended into chaos--
WALTER=>Do you know-- are there American journalists working here? What would someone want to photograph here?
SOMALIAN=>The evacuations.
WALTER=>Who's evacuating?
SOMALIAN=>The peacekeepers.
WALTER=>The peacekeepers?
SOMALIAN=>Yeah, they're evacuating.
WALTER=>Like right now?
SOMALIAN=>All week. The Koreans are leaving from the soccer field.
WALTER=>...Sean?
WALTER=>Sean?
WALTER=>Sean O'Connell?
WALTER=>Hey. Walter Mitty. From the office.
SEAN=>Walter?
WALTER=>...Yeah. Hey. Man, I've really been trying to reach you. Hey. It's good to finally meet you. Thanks for the wallet, man, by the way. Sean, do you happen to know where that negative 12 is. 2-6? On the roll three?
SEAN=>...you have it.
WALTER=>You know what, we don't. I've looked in every neg box and even every camera bag and we have in the warehouse. I even double-checked the Teaneck warehouse.
SEANN=>You have it.
WALTER=>I really don't.
SEAN=>No, it's not in the neg box. That one was special. Favorite ever. You have it. Seriously. Loan me five bucks.
WALTER=>Loan you... what?
SEAN=>Loan me five bucks.
WALTER=>Fuck...
WALTER=>Do you have any sense how I could get back to America if I can't afford a plane ticket right now? Totally?
RODNEY=>...Yeah, my brother William. Two dollars.
WALTER=>I give your brother two dollars and then he'll tell me how to get back to America?
RODNEY=>Two dollars. To go to America.
WALTER=>...I can go to America for two dollars?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Eharmony. Todd Mahar.
WALTER=>Hey, Todd. It's Walter. Mitty.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>What's up, Walter?
WALTER=>Hey I wanted to add a couple items?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Okay.
WALTER=>To my Been There, Done Thats. If that's cool.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>It's really cool. What do you got?
WALTER=>Okay. Mogadishu?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Been there.
WALTER=>Cheryl Mellhoff.
FRONT DESK LADY=>Your name?
WALTER=>Walter Mitty.
FRONT DESK LADY=>Have a seat. She'll be right down.
WALTER=>Thanks.
CHERYL=>Hey.
WALTER=>Hey.
CHERYL=>Did you find the Quintessence of Life?
WALTER=>Almost...
CHERYL=>Man, I'm sorry. How are you feeling?
WALTER=>...I'm okay.
WALTER AS A CUBICLE=>(gesturing with the Arabic
SKATEBOARD)=>Hey, I picked this up for you, Rich. It's got some cool Arabic writing on it. I don't know what it means. But it looked cool.
CHERYL=>(impressed about the
BOARD)=>...Walter. You go to Mogadishu, and you think about bringing a gift home to my son?
WALTER=>I got the board in Dubai. Hey, Rich. Here watch. The board's going to come up. You don't have to try to lift it.
WALTER=>You really just have to think about landing. Both feet. Same time.
RICH=>Thanks, Walter.
CHERYL=>Do you have any idea where Sean is now?
WALTER=>No, I lost him. He said I had it though. Like he knew. He smiled. He said "you have it." "You." What's he talking about?
CHERYL=>Honey. Hey. Come here. That was great.
CHERYL=>That was really great. Here.
CHERYL=>Hey. Don't worry. You're going to feel fine in five minutes. Don't worry. Hey.
CHERYL=>Don't worry, about a thing, `cause every little thing is going to be all right. Don't worry.....
CHERYL=>You know, all hell broke loose this week, while you were gone.
WALTER=>Excuse me. Can you pass key me in? I need to see Ted. My pass key isn't working. I need to let him know I verified that I have negative 12. I just didn't verify where I have it.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>You're Walter Mitty?
WALTER=>Yes.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>Practical Assets.
WALTER=>Yes.
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE=>Your pass key's not working because you've been let go. With cause.
WALTER=>I need to speak to Ted. I found SEAN O'CONNELL--
NEW GUY=>Ted's been let go. We had an overage of 280,000 dollars. Due to this publishing delay.
WALTER=>Is there someone who took over Ted's responsibilities? On a PERMANENT--
NEW GUY=>Yeah, that's me Steve Penders. We're late for Squash.
STEVE PENDERS=>This is the last-Life-cover situation?
WALTER=>Yes.
STEVE PENDERS=>You lost an asset. You cost that COMP--
WALTER=>I didn't lose it. I have it. The photographer told me. I just don't know where I have it.
STEVE PENDERS=>Those are grounds--
WALTER=>Those are no grounds. You can't fire me for not having something that I have.
STEVE PENDERS=>I'm not following you.
WALTER=>I have it. I always have had it. When you fired me, I had it. Why are you trying to hit me with Squash balls?
STEVE PENDERS=>You're on a squash court. I'm trying to play--
WALTER=>No one's informed me that I've been let go.
STEVE PENDERS=>I'm informing you.
WALTER=>I should be sent my November check.
STEVE PENDERS=>Fired with cause. No picture. No CHECK
WALTER=>There's no cause to keep my salary. Ow.
STEVE PENDERS=>Can you get off the fucking court here?
WALTER=>I'd like to speak to your supervisor.
STEVE PENDERS=>You can't.
WALTER=>I demand to speak to your supervisor.
STEVE PENDERS=>You can't do that either.
WALTER=>I'd like to demand to speak to your supervisor.
STEVE PENDERS=>I don't work at Comcast. I don't have a supervisor you can just talk to. My supervisor is Mark Chatham. He owns The Timms Company. Which is a holding company that holds conglomerates. He's in Los Angeles for the G8 summit, and he wouldn't talk to you anyway even if you were stuck in a fucking elevator. That's my supervisor.
WALTER=>The Purpose of Life--
STEVE PENDERS=>Go.
WALTER=>Hey, fuck you, man.
WALTER=>What is this?
WALTER=>....Mom?
EDNA=>Yes?
WALTER=>Hey, did-- did a guy take a picture of your piano? Like a week ago?
EDNA=>Sean?
WALTER=>...yeah.
EDNA=>No. I took it. With Sean's camera.
WALTER=>Where did you get Sean's camera?
EDNA=>From Sean. He came to visit.
WALTER=>Sean O'Connell?
EDNA=>He came to visit. To talk about you.
WALTER=>Me?
EDNA=>Yeah. He asked me some questions about you? What your work schedule was, when you left, when you came home. He said you really understood Life. He wanted to know about your work. He said you "got Life."
EDNA=>I just sent him my recipe for Clementine cake? To his email. I packed him some when he left. He just loved it. We snacked on some during our Warlord conversation.
WALTER=>Do you know where--
EDNA=>He's in Nepal now, I think. Photographing snow leopards. Let me think. Yes. Ship. Iceland. Mogadishu. Nepal. That's what he said.
WALTER=>Man, I've been desperately searching for him. For a long time. Thanks, mom.
EDNA=>I didn't know that. You don't talk about work that often.
WALTER=>I know. I don't want you to worry. It's not always cool and easy. ... why did you take a picture of your piano?
EDNA=>I was concerned we couldn't keep it, Dear. I know it's a burden. I didn't know if we could manage. So I thought I might not see it again. I wanted a picture.
EDNA=>That's not a very good picture. But that's okay. She's right here.
EDNA=>You know, I wonder sometimes... you had to start work so early. Orange Julius. Then all through college. At Avis. Then Pizza delivery. That shitty pizza. Then at this company.
EDNA=>I wish maybe you had the chance, a greater chance to pursue your dreams.
WALTER=>Mom. Hey. Come on. I like my job. I mean it's not my dream job. So what? I have a lot of company.
EDNA=>What did you want to be, when you younger?
WALTER=>...I don't even remember.
EDNA=>Sure you do. Everybody does.
EDNA=>Thanks for taking care of us, Walter.
WALTER=>I have to go somewhere, mom. Possibly I'll be reachable by phone.
WALTER=>What are you?
NORMAL GUY=>Stay at home dad.
WALTER=>Cool.
NORMAL GUY=>Congratulations.
WALTER=>Thanks, man.
NORMAL GUY=>Is that a Grammy? Or a Nobel--
WALTER=>Grammy. Best male R & B vocal performance.
NORMAL GUY=>Way to go.
WALTER=>You, too.
ETIHAD CLERK=>There's only one flight to Nepal, in the next 18 hours.
WALTER=>That's okay.
ETIHAD CLERK=>But there aren't any seats left.
WALTER=>None?
ETIHAD CLERK=>I'm afraid not.
WALTER=>...Not one?
ETIHAD CLERK=>Well, there's one seat, but...
WALTER=>I'm trying to locate a photographer.
GUIDE=>How can I help?
WALTER=>The information I have is that he's working with a guide named Stepit. Any idea... is that enough of a clue where they might be? I know they're photographing snow leopards, and this is the snow leopard region--
GUIDE=>They'll be in the Kosi forest. That's where Stepit was raised. When he's booked it's to go there. It's dangerous. Only he can take you there safely.
WALTER=>I need to go there.
GUIDE=>I can take you. For a fee.
WALTER=>Didn't you just say that only that other guy can take you through there? Safely?
GUIDE=>...Did I say that?
WALTER=>Yes.
GUIDE=>I didn't mean that. I meant that only he and I are the guys who can do that.
WALTER=>This way?
GUIDE=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Aren't you coming?
GUIDE=>I can't walk in the snow. It's hard as shit. Just go that way.
WALTER=>That's-- that's how you're guiding me? By pointing and saying go that way?
GUIDE=>A little-- to the left. There. Yeah.
WALTER=>...Hello.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Hey.
WALTER=>Hey, Todd.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>What's up?
WALTER=>Not much.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Good news. I think we're going to be able to get you on eHarmony.
WALTER=>Okay. Cool.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Your profile has rounded out a little. I put your travels in. There's enough going on in your profile so now we can submit you.
WALTER=>Great, man.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Where are you now? It sounds cold.
WALTER=>It even sounds cold?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Nepal.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Hey, Walter. Why didn't you submit any pictures? Most people have photos of them with friends, out on the town.
WALTER=>I don't really do a lot of, you know, swinging.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Swinging?
WALTER=>Yeah.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Swinging means fucking married people. When you're married.
WALTER=>Oh. I don't mean that.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>No.
WALTER=>I meant like partying, I guess. I used to like to be at work at 8. And I have some family demands that keep me pretty busy.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Your mom and sister.
WALTER=>Yeah.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You know. People don't know they're leaning on you. Until you move. And they fall.
WALTER=>(not in the mood for
ADVICE)=>Are you Chinese? You're so wise.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>I'm neither. But I know you, Walter. I've been studying you here. You seem to carry a lot of weight.
WALTER=>Well, I'm not going to move and let the people who lean on me fall, because the people who lean on me are my mom and my sister.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Are you in a bad mood?
WALTER=>A little.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>Well, let's keep rounding this profile out. What do you do during your downtime?
WALTER=>I don't get a lot. But I guess if I had to say - mostly I just consider thoughts... for my visions for ideas and scenarios about the world.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>(like that sentence doesn't actually mean
ANYTHING)=>You consider thoughts for your visions for ideas and scenarios about the world?
WALTER=>Yeah.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You daydream?
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>You know, studies show that people who spend a great deal of time fantasizing and daydreaming, doodling and shit they're not really that happy.
SEAN=>...Hey, man, do you mind?
SEAN=>I'm trying to photograph a snow leopard.
WALTER=>...Sean?
SEAN=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Hey, I got to go.
EHARMONY COUNSELOR=>No problem. Congratulations. You're on eHarmony.
WALTER=>Cool.
WALTER=>Sean O'Connell?
SEAN=>Yeah.
WALTER=>Walter. Mitty.
SEAN=>Walter. Seriously. What the fuck? What are you--
WALTER=>I've been looking for you.
SEAN=>Sit down.
SEAN=>...Are you okay?
WALTER=>Yeah, warming up.
SEAN=>Take your time.
WALTER=>Hey, Sean. I really need that picture. I'm taking a lot of heat at work. Over that.
SEAN=>That negative you asked me about.
WALTER=>Yeah.
SEAN=>12?
SEAN=>You're sitting on it.
WALTER=>Why am I sitting on it?
SEAN=>Because it's in your wallet.
SEAN=>That was the gift. The picture. The wallet was just someplace to keep the picture. I put it in the little picture slot in the wallet. The little picture holder. I thought that would be cute. I said "look inside." In the note.
WALTER=>I thought that meant inside the wrapping paper. I never opened it. Goddmanit. The wallet. I left the--
SEAN=>Shhh...
WALTER=>Oh, yeah... Fuck.
SEAN=>What?
WALTER=>I-- can you believe it - I just this morning I put it in a receptacle thing.
SEAN=>The picture?
WALTER=>Well, I didn't know I was throwing that out, but... yeah.
SEAN=>The wallet?
WALTER=>I just didn't believe in Life's Purpose anymore. So I fucking chucked it.
SEAN=>So you have no idea what it is?
WALTER=>No...
SEAN=>The picture?
WALTER=>No.
SEAN=>Do you want to know what it was? It was great.
SEAN=>Hey.
SEAN=>Real life.
SEAN=>They're pretty rare.
SEAN=>Your hand's over the lens.
WALTER=>Oh.
SEAN=>There you go.
WALTER=>...We may have to sell Mom's piano, in order to pay for the Villa. This week.
ODESSA=>But didn't we get the Villa so we can put Mom's piano in it?
WALTER=>Yeah.
WALTER=>It's "f"d up. I know. But if I don't get my severance I'm going to have to forfeit that deposit, because I can't afford the room. And I won't have enough to get her another place. Another decent place.
ODESSA=>So we may end up having to pay for a bigger room because it can hold a piano by selling that piano? And then having to pay for the bigger empty room for a year.
WALTER=>Yeah.
ODESSA=>....Did you get everything you wanted? For your birthday.
WALTER=>Almost?
ODESSA=>What's left?
WALTER=>Nothing I just want everyone in the world to be Morgan Freeman. So it would just be me and Morgan Freemans, in the whole world.
ODESSA=>What about me?
WALTER=>You'd be you. But like a combo with him. Just a little calmer, more quiet. Gentler.
ODESSA=>Would I have push-back hair and freckles?
WALTER=>Yeah.
ODESSA=>Where are you?
WALTER=>Los Angeles.
ODESSA=>Are you okay? You sound tired.
WALTER=>I'm okay. I'm going to take the train to my hotel. Try to get home tomorrow.
ODESSA=>I love you.
WALTER=>I love you, too.
WALTER=>I'm sorry.
15-YR-OLD-PUERTO-RICAN GIRL MORGAN FREEMAN=>Don't worry about it.
COP=>You can't go this way without a summit pass.
WALTER=>What's a summit pass?
COP=>For the G8.
WALTER=>I'm trying to get to my hotel.
COP=>... protests are on 3rd street.
WALTER=>My boss, the guy who runs my company is here. Is it cool if I talked to him. Am I allowed?
COP=>This is America. You can do whatever you want as long as you stay on the far sides of the barricades on 3rd.
WALTER=>There's a work situation I want to clue him in on. I was let go with cause. But there wasn't--
COP=>Hey. Keep walking, okay? I've got a job to do.
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER=>It's a tense environment. To be sure. There are fears of a repeat of the violence in Seattle at the WTO. And there are three thousand more protestors here today.
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER=>There's an outdoor concert scheduled just a block away from the hotel where the summit is held, which summit organizers say is a deliberate provocation, but which concert promoters and protestors say is within their freedom to assemble.
WALTER=>Sir, can I have two secs? Mr. Chatham, Can I have two secs? I'm a former employee of one of your companies. Mitty?
WALTER=>Just two secs? Former employee? Mitty? I was let go with cause. But I don't think that's actually what should have happened.
MARK CHATHAM=>Where did you work?
WALTER=>The Life corporation. Two secs?
MARK CHATHAM=>(gesturing for Walter to
"HOLD ON")=>One minute.
AIDE=>There was a Mitty there, but she's a black woman.
MARK CHATHAM OKAY=>Nice try.
WALTER=>Wait. No. I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man!
WALTER=>I'm Walter Mitty!
WALTER=>(really having to yell
NOW)=>I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man!
POLICE OFFICER=>Get the fuck behind the barricade.
WALTER=>(meaning the young
PROTESTORS)=>I'm not with them.
WALTER=>Hey, Ulf.
WALTER=>What the fuck?
WALTER=>Ow, fuck, man. Hey, I have a scaled- back co-pay medical plan.
WALTER=>Hey.
