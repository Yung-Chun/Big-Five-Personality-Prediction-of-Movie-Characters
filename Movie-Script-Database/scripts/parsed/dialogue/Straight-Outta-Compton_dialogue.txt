ICE CUBE=>Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me. Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary. Ice Cube would like to say, That I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way. Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya read about. Takin a life or two, that's what the hell I do. Don't like how I'm livin', well fuck you!
LONZO=>I'm this close to firin' your monkey ass! You tryin' to start a riot up in here?! You know I don't want that hardcore shit played in my club, but I turn my back and you do that shit anyway..?
DRE=>I'm just tryin' to keep you in business. Open your eyes. They went crazy to that shit --
LONZO=>You're up on that stage `cause I put you there. You're a bad ass DJ, I'll give you that, but you don't listen and I'm gettin' real tired of arguing all the time. You know it's plenty DJs out there who'll play what I want `em to play. Guys that don't bite the hand that feeds 'em. Now you take a backseat to that shit.
YELLA=>Don't trip off him, homie.
DRE=>Man, Lonzo ain't got no vision.
DRE=>Oh shit -- Check out this nigga. Yo, take over for a minute.
EAZY=>Dr. Dre, how you been doin'?
DRE=>What up, E? Been a minute.
EAZY=>You know. Out here on the grind -- Nice jacket.
DRE=>It's the uniform. I make it work.
EAZY=>You remember Ren from Kelly Park, right?
REN=>Wuddup, Dre.
EAZY=>Heard you been spendin' a lot of time at your auntie's house. How's the couch life?
DRE=>It's fucked up. I'm too tall for that shit. Plus I got my woman and baby livin' there. It's hard. But everybody can't do what you do.
EAZY=>Yeah, but what I do is playin' out, fast. Muthafuckas are gettin' locked up and laid down out here left and right. Time to make a few changes.
DRE=>Yeah. Change ain't bad. Shit, I'm tryin' to make a few changes my self.
EAZY=>What you mean?
DRE=>Man, you should think about dumpin' some money into this music shit. I got some ideas --
YELLA=>Yo!

DRE=>Tyree, you gotta stop doin' this shit, man!
DRE=>We got this, Officer --
DRE=>I am home.
EAZY=>They got you for carrying records? That's some gangsta shit, Dre.
DRE=>Cops will throw a nigga in jail for anything.
EAZY=>Lonzo just left you here, huh?
DRE=>Guess he's sick of bailing my ass out.
EAZY=>Mind gettin' your funny lookin' ass in the car before they arrest you for some other dumb shit?
EAZY=>Man, I was thinkin' about what you said last night.
DRE=>Yeah, and..?
EAZY=>It's interestin' --
DRE=>Interestin'? Tell me this, how long you think that shit you doin' gonna last, huh? You ever heard of a happy ending in that game?
EAZY=>Shit, man, this all comin' from the nigga I just bailed out.
DRE=>Listen, if you can slang dope, you can slang records. You got a mind for this shit, E.
EAZY=>Okay so what then -- That nigga last night? Is that what we doin'?
DRE=>What, Cube? Nah, he in a group right now, got some other business goin' on. But I got this group called H.B.O. from the east coast. Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song for `em that's crazy.
CUBE=>It's a car. A `64 Impala.
CUBE=>Gankin's when somebody jacks you. Ain't a big deal. Just sounds better that way.
DRE=>Y'all got somethin' to say about Compton? Cause we might have a problem up in this bitch.
DRE=>Then do the lyrics. We losin' time and I'm losin' patience.
CUBE=>Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga, remember that.
CUBE=>What you wanna do, mark ass nigga?
EAZY=>Well there goes the talent. Don't know a whole lot about the music game, but we can't start a label without talent.
EAZY=>Okay, I put up my money -- I held up my side of the deal, Dre. When you gonna deliver your side?
DRE=>Well shit, why don't you get on the mic and try it?
EAZY=>What? Fool, I ain't no rapper.
DRE=>You already spent the money. Don't you get it? Man, this song is all about you! This song is about Eazy-muthafuckin'-E! Now get in the booth. Let me deliver my side of this shit.
EAZY=>Fuck you doin'?
DRE=>Just lemme produce. Get comfortable, man.
EAZY=>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4 -
DRE=>Hit that first beat hard. CRUISE-in down the street. CRUISE-in.
EAZY=>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4 -
CUBE=>That ain't it...
EAZY=>Get that dry-ass Jheri curl outta here, maybe I can concentrate.
CUBE=>You kickin' me out?
CUBE=>Aiight. I'm just sayin'...
DRE=>Just gimme the words.
EAZY=>Nigga what?
DRE=>Say that shit with me -- CRUISE-in -
EAZY=>Dre, you know this shit is hopeless, right?
DRE=>That! See how you just said that shit? Like you believe it!
EAZY=>`Cause I do.
DRE=>So say this shit like you believe it. Like it's muthafuckin' Sunday and you cruisin' down the street in that dope-ass 6-4. Feel that shit, like its ya own words.
EAZY=>You really gonna make me do this, huh?
EAZY=>Aiight, fuck it. Let's do this.
EAZY=>Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4.
DRE=>Hell yeah! That shit was tight. Only 59 more lines, E. But we gonna get through it. Hit that next line -
YELLA=>Lonzo, what you think?
LONZO=>That some waste of time shit right there and trust me, it ain't gonna work. Won't get no radio play.
DRE=>You never know-- We might do a radio version and take it up to KDAY and see what happens.
LONZO=>This reality rap is never going to work, Dre. You need to hurry up and rap this shit up and finish that slow jam I had you working on. I'm serious, Dre! Hurry up with this...
DRE=>Yo, I don't know about working on this slow stuff anymore. After this I'm going to work on songs with DOC.
LONZO=>It's not a request, Dre.
DRE=>Yo, if Lonzo don't like it, you know that shit is dope.
REN=>Damn, Dre -- You just turned a hustler into a rapper.
EAZY=>Now this right here..? This some ruthless shit for real. Dre, you a muthafuckin' genius. And Cube, you got more of them stories to tell?
CUBE=>Homie, I got rhymes for days. But I got to hear this one more gen...Dre, hit that shit.
GREG MACK=>1580 KDAY, this is Greg Mack -- Mack Attack. That was "Boyz n tha Hood" by Eazy-E, local rapper out of Compton. Sounds like he's about 15 years old --
GREG MACK=>-- I know you like it. It's been the most requested record on this station ever since I played it. The freshest song of 1986 --
JERRY HELLER=>I heard your record.
JERRY=>Jerry Heller.
EAZY=>Eric Wright.
JERRY=>Pleasure to meet you. Would it be possible to have a word with you, Eric?
EAZY=>About what?
JERRY=>I thought your record was good.
EAZY=>Just good? Why you call me in here then --
JERRY=>No-no-no, hang on. I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down.
JERRY=>Let's try this again. As a music manager, let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric --
EAZY=>Maybe I'm the one who can do somethin' for you.
JERRY=>You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon --
EAZY=>You manage anybody this decade?
JERRY=>Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy.
JERRY=>That's what I do for you. I will make you legit. I will take you into that building. I will protect you. I will block out all the noise of this business and we can build something big.
JERRY=>But you're gonna have to believe in me like I believe in you. If you don't think you can do that...
JERRY=>You got more music for me?
EAZY=>I got everything you need.
JERRY=>Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway? No Whites Allowed?
EAZY=>"Niggas With Attitudes."
EAZY=>I asked everybody to wear something black today, `cause if we gonna be an All-Star group, we gotta look like an All-Star group.
EAZY=>Damn Yella! What happened?
YELLA=>Man, kiss my ass, I ain't got no Raider gear.-- Are we gettin' paid to wear that shit?
EAZY=>Put this on.
CUBE=>Aww damn-- here come The White Shadow.
REN=>Nah, Mr. Furley from "Three's Company."
EAZY=>Man, shut the fuck up? This dude knows the game inside out. He been out there shopping our shit around. Gonna find distribution for Ruthless, get us on tour and bring a whole lot of money to the table.
DRE=>And then what-- How he get paid?
EAZY=>Just takes 20::percent:: off the top. That's it. We cut up 80. That's how managers work.
DOC=>All managers don't get 20 mothafuckin' percent!
EAZY=>Doc, shut yo drunk ass up. You don't know the music business.
JERRY HELLER=>Hey fellas, sorry I'm running late. I'll be honest. We've had a lot of passes. People are scared of you guys big time. They think you're dangerous. But I think that's a good thing. And we've had a couple nibbles, from a couple labels. Epic, Capitol, Priority...
REN=>"Nibbles"..? What's that mean?
JERRY HELLER=>Here's the thing. You guys can make a real record. Sell it nationwide. But we're not there yet. These labels, they're still gonna need some... convincing. So I invited a few of them to your show. So you have to kick ass tonight. Can you do that?
JERRY HELLER=>Let me go and make sure they're all here.
CUBE=>And you trust this dude? Cause he looks like a one of my old muthafuckin' history teachers.
EAZY=>You trust me?
CUBE=>Yeah, I trust you. But that ain't what we talking about --
EAZY=>Just leave it up to me. I'll make sure everything is straight. Just have them raps cocked and loaded.
DRE=>Come on now. Cube has never failed to deliver. He always comes correct, ready to work. That ain't gonna change. Aiight?
YELLA=>Can this muthafucka Jerry Heller bring in more pussy? That's worth 20 percent!
BRYAN TURNER=>You sure this is... safe for us..?
JERRY=>Try not to look so scared, Bryan. They smell it on ya, you're finished.
JERRY=>Relax. You're in for a real treat!
CUBE=>Yo Dre, kick in the bass!
CUBE=>It was once said by a man who couldn't quit --
THE CROWD=>DOPE MAN PLEASE CAN I HAVE ANOTHER HIT???
CUBE=>The Dopeman said Cluck I don't give a shit, if your girl kneels down --
THE CROWD=>AND SUCKS MY DICK!!!
JERRY=>So what do ya think?
RECORD EXEC=>Jerry, we're friends, but Compton? I don't think so. Queens..? Maybe. But. If you find another Bon Jovi, you call me.
EAZY=>Yeah high-rollin', big money I'm foldin, Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'. Strung strawberry, jockin' me so early. Ho you want a hit --
CROWD=>YOU GOTTA GET YOUR KNEES DIRTY!!!
DOC=>Damn Dre, ya'll wrecked these mothafuckas tonight!
DRE=>I know. Stage was shaking so much-- thought my needles was about to jump off the record!
CUBE=>I'm still trippin' that they knew all the words! That's Crazy...
REN=>Compton is definitely on the map my nigga!
YELLA=>Did you see all the freaks that was out there? Lord, thank God for biker shorts!
CUBE=>We talkin' about the power of N.W.A. and all you saw tonight was pussy?
YELLA=>Man, pussy is power.
SUGE=>Man, I had a feelin' y'all was gonna represent tonight. Good shit.
EAZY=>Wuddup, Suge -- What you been up to, homie? Still out in Vegas?
SUGE=>Back and forth. Doing some bodyguard work among other things. If ya'll need my services, just let me know.
EAZY=>Aight. But we don't need no body guards.
SUGE=>You never know what you need until you need it.
SUGE=>I just came back here to give ya'll your props. I got my people out here waiting on me. But I'll be around.
JERRY=>That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice.
JERRY=>This is Eazy E and NWA. Guys, this is Bryan Turner.
CUBE=>Ice Cube, `Sup?
JERRY=>Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you.
BRYAN TURNER=>Immediately. Fellas, I loved the show. You really had the crowd on their feet. I think you'll fit perfectly with our label.
DRE=>That'll work. Priority Records? I'm not familiar with your label. What artist do you got over there?
BRYAN TURNER=>Nothing big. Just an R&B group.
REN=>Who dat?
BRYAN TURNER=>Uh-- The California Raisins.
CUBE=>Them little-ass raisins on the commercial? Singin', "I Heard it Through the Grapevine"?
BRYAN TURNER=>Laugh all you want. Those little fuckers went gold last year.
EAZY=>Gold?
JERRY=>Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform.
BRYAN TURNER=>So what do ya say? Wanna go make a record?
DRE=>Aiight! If your rhymes ain't tight, you ain't makin' the record. So you better have your shit together. Yella Boy -- Rewind that shit!
DRE=>I'm expressin' with my full capabilities, And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities...
DRE=>Now this is what I'm talkin' about. You hear the difference?
YELLA=>Yeah, no doubt.
JERRY=>Our deal with Priority is done. I have the contracts for you to sign.
JERRY=>If this music keeps sounding like this. This album is going to be amazing.
DRE=>Thanks, Jerry.
JERRY=>The lyrics you're writing is really good, Cube.
CUBE=>I appreciate that, man. Eazy what's up with our deal.
EAZY=>Jerry handles that.
JERRY=>The lawyers just started drawing them up.
TYREE=>Yo Dre, there's something outside you need to take care of. Trust me.
DRE=>So let me get this straight -- You gonna do this right here, right now?
LAVETTA=>What am I supposed to do? We're sleepin' on a twin bed, at your auntie's house. We have a baby, Andre. You expect me to wait for what you're doin' in there? And you in the streets, fuckin' around? Are you crazy?
DRE=>What? I'm out here day and night bustin' my ass, tryin' to create something, and you gonna come up in here talkin' about some bitches? Are you crazy?
LAVETTA=>You don't get it.
DRE=>Nah, you don't get it.
LAVETTA=>Bye, Andre.
YELLA=>You cool?
DRE=>Fuck no. I'm far from cool.
TYREE=>What happened, Dre? What she say?
CUBE=>Aww shit, here we go again...
REN=>What we do?!
DRE=>Why you got on the ground like this, officer?
EAZY=>Yeah. Here. We workin'.
DRE=>What we do?
DRE=>What the fuck --
JERRY=>Excuse me officer, what's going on out here?!
JERRY=>These are not thugs, they're artists!
JERRY=>They're rappers working in the studio right here.
JERRY=>I'm the manager.
CUBE=>Yo!
EAZY=>This gonna start some shit, Cube.
CUBE=>Yeah, fuck the police.
JERRY=>This is only the tip of the iceberg, fellas. The days of selling records out of your trunk are a thing of the past, Eric.
EAZY=>My days of selling anything out the trunk is over.
BRYAN TURNER=>So, are you going out with them?
JERRY=>Are you crazy? Had a enough of that shit in the 70's. I'll fly out a couple of times and check on'em.
BRYAN TURNER=>Well make sure everything goes smooth, okay? I have enough bad press with Tipper Gore and P.M.R.C. on my ass. I'm gonna have to put Parental Advisory stickers on all the records from now on --
JERRY HELLER=>What's wrong with that? Bryan, controversy's good -- It's gonna help us sell more records.
JERRY=>Excuse me.
JERRY=>What ya got in there, Mr. Wright?
JERRY=>Have you lost your mind? You are not taking that on the bus.
EAZY=>Yeah we are. How we supposed to protect ourselves out there, Jerry? In fuckin' Texas? And Tennessee? They lynch niggas down there --
JERRY=>I'm not gonna let you take that arsenal on tour, Eric!
EAZY=>Let me? Jerry, you take care of the business, I'll take care of the rest.
CUBE=>Ain't that some shit... Talk some truth and people lose they minds.
EAZY=>They had to buy all those albums to do that! More money in our pockets.
CUBE=>Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Ice Cube, from a gang called Niggaz With Attitudes. When I'm called off, I got a sawed off, squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off --
EAZY=>Where the fuck y'all at, Cincinnati!?
DRE=>To the people over here --
REN=>To the People over there --
DRE/REN=>To the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people, people from Kansas City, watchin' the show --
CUBE=>Indianapolis in the muthafuckin' house!
DRE=>I can't do it, T.
TYREE=>Come on. I could meet up with y'all in Dallas or -- Yo, you gotta let me come fuck with you in Miami!
DRE=>Oh, you wanna partake in some of those fat asses, huh.
TYREE=>You know it!
DRE=>So what you think moms will say about you comin' on tour?
DRE=>Exactly. `Cause you got school and you know she won't let you miss that many days.
TYREE=>You did.
DRE=>Exactly my point.
TYREE=>So I'm paying for your shit?
DRE=>How it is, T. Youngest always do.
DRE=>How moms doin'? Is she there?
TYREE=>She good, but nah, you know her, constantly workin'.
DRE=>Well make sure you take care of her, aiight? I'll tell you what, you stay your ass outta trouble and I'll call you when I'm on the way to Miami-- we'll see about getting you on a flight.
TYREE=>Aiight, man... You promise, Dre!
DRE=>I got you. Just bring a lot of rubbers.
DRE=>Hold on a second, somebody at the --
BIG DUDE=>Yeah nigga, I'm looking for my girl Felicia. Heard she was up here in one of these rooms.
DRE=>No Felicia in here, man.
BIG DUDE=>Mind if I take a look?
DRE=>Get your foot out my door --
DRE=>Yo! Any of y'all named Felicia?
YELLA=>Hey baby. You Felicia?
GIRL=>You forgot my name, muthafucka?
DRE=>I think her man's outside. And that nigga strapped.
YELLA=>Whoa! Eazy, you can't be blastin inside the hotel --
EAZY=>Hey, you lookin' for Felicia?
BIG DUDE=>She in there or what?
EAZY=>Yeah, she's in here. Problem is, my homeboy's got his dick in her mouth.
BIG DUDE=>What the fuck did you say?
EAZY=>How bad you want Felicia now?
REN=>Where they go?
CUBE=>Meet y'all upstairs.
NANCY REAGAN=>For the sake of our children, I implore each of you to be unyielding and inflexible in your opposition to drugs. Our young people are helping us lead the way. Not long ago in Oakland, California, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs. And I answered, just say no.
JERRY=>Another one called-- said she was pregnant by you too. Eric, you gotta slow down. You can't fuck'em all...
EAZY=>Yeah, I know. All these chicks want is money. If I was broke, they're wouldn't even be calling.
JERRY=>Yeah well, you start making a little money, problems come with it.
EAZY=>White people problems?
JERRY=>Money problems are race neutral. But I'll help you through all of it. I'll put you in touch with --
JERRY=>Evening, Cube...
CUBE=>What's the deal on them contracts, Jerry? I'm still waitin' on 'em...
EAZY=>Man, stop asking about them fuckin' contract. They're coming --
JERRY=>It's all right, Eric. Cube's right to ask, and I'm remiss in not updating you guys. Contracts are being finalized as we speak. Truth is, attorneys will bleed you dry going over `em. Wish I was paid by the hour...
CUBE=>Yeah me too. I just like to know what's goin' on. Since I wrote a lot of lyrics on this record.
JERRY=>Everybody knows how important you are, Cube. Just give us a little more time.
CUBE=>Shit's pretty good. Someday, huh?
JERRY=>He wants to be you so freaking bad. This kid has issues. At some point, you gotta trust somebody...
EAZY=>Waiter! Another round over here...
DRE=>Nah, I think you over reacting. Eazy's one of us, Cube. What you thinking don't even make sense --
CUBE=>Know what don't make sense? Eazy chillin' with Jerry eatin' steak and lobster while we at Mickey D's. That shit don't make sense.
DRE=>Look, I hear that, but I think we should ride this wave. Don't be jumpin' to conclusions until you know for sure,
DRE=>We gotta stop. Gotta get somewhere with a phone --
DRIVER=>But we're in the middle of nowh --
DRE=>Stop the fuckin' bus, man!
YELLA=>Yo, Dre. What's goin' on?
DRE=>My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother...
DRE=>He got into a fight near Leimert Park. A big mothafucka fell on top of him -- broke his neck. He killed Tyree. I can't believe this shit.
CUBE=>Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious--
EAZY=>Dope game took my cousin's life. I remember when they found him.
DRE=>He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened...
REN=>Or it could've happened in another way. Can't blame yourself, Dre... Life has to end for all of us, but love don't. Feel me? Tyree is always gonna be with you. No matter what.
EAZY=>Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with you.
PASTOR=>Death is a threshold we all have to pass through. No one is exempt. Tyree will set a place for us on the other side and we will see him again. The flesh will always return to the earth. But our spirits will live on forever. Amen!
DRE=>If I brung him out on tour with me, like he wanted --
VERNA=>This is not on you, Andre.
VERNA=>Andre.
DRE=>We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got --
VERNA=>This is not your fault. Understand me? Stop this nonsense. Stop it now.
VERNA=>Your brother looked up to you. And you took great care of him. We both did. It's time to let someone else take care of him now.
VERNA=>I'm proud of you... So proud of you, baby...
CUBE=>Check this out --
REN=>We should get out and beat his ass.
EAZY=>Man shut that off. Put on my shit.
JERRY=>Moving up on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Holding our bullet the R&B, Hip-Hop chart. I mean, you have any idea how many records we're selling? Ruthless has arrived. Eric, we are huge!
EAZY=>The muthafuckin' FBI?
DRE=>Damn, they comin' after us, too?
CUBE=>"... advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action." Have they ever heard of freedom of speech? What the fuck can they do to us?
JERRY=>It's a warning. A message to our record label about "Fuck the Police". We should really think about not performing that song for a while.
JERRY=>Relax. RELAX. No need to worry-- All I'm saying is, we should be aware of this threat...
CUBE=>If it was from the LAPD, then I'd be worried.
EAZY=>We should all be happy, not worried. This is a gift, man. More free publicity for NWA. That's why we gonna send this to the press. Let everybody know about this kind of harassment and intimidation by the government. Right, Jerry?
JERRY=>Well, uh. If that's what you wanna do, then maybe we --
EAZY=>Do it, Jerry. Let everybody see this bullshit.
CUBE=>I guess freedom of speech don't mean shit.
REN=>Not if you a nigga wit an attitude.

CUBE=>Are we finished, man? We got a show to do.
POLICE OFFICER=>Just watch yourselves.
REN=>Yeah-- You watch yourselves too.
YELLA=>Yeah man, fuck the po-lice for real.
EAZY=>This is the auto-biography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me you'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha who will smother, word to the motherfucka, straight outta Compton.
CUBE=>Yo hold up, hold up -- Y'all know what the muthafuckin' po-lice just told us back stage? They tired to tell us-- what the fuck we can't say-- what the fuck we can't play!
CUBE=>Put ya middle finger in the air!
CUBE=>This NWA -- We do what the fuck we wanna do! We say what the fuck we wanna say! So, all I wanna tell that cop talking shit back stage is -- Yo Dre, I got something to say!
CUBE=>FUCK THE POLICE COMIN' STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND. A YOUNG NIGGA GOT IT BAD CAUSE I'M BROWN --
EAZY=>What the fuck did you DO!?
REN=>Aw fuck...
ICE CUBE=>Here we go y'all...
CROWD=>FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE --
JERRY=>You have no right! This is illegal! You can't do this --
COP=>Stay fucking put, old man!
JERRY=>What the fuck were you guys thinking? They can hold us libel for inciting a riot! No one cares that the police started it...
JERRY=>Whether you like it or not, you are a political group. Never give these assholes a reason to hurt you. Next time they might take it.
KURT LODER=>The explosive Compton rap group, N.W.A. --
KURT LODER=>-- aka Niggers With Attitudes, officially had their video banned here at MTV due to gang-like images that could incite violence. This is not the first scrape with controversy for the band --
EAZ=>We didn't insight shit.
DRE=>You just got a snapshot of how Americans honestly feel.
REN=>We didn't create that.
CUBE=>My art is the reflection of my reality. What do you see when you go outside of your door. I know what i see.
YELLA=>And it ain't glamorous.
CUBE=>And by the way, the hood gets AKs from Russia and cocaine from Columbia.
EAZY=>We don't even have passports. Check the source.
REN=>Who is responsible for that?
DRE=>Isn't it obvious. Real recongnize real.
CUBE=>WE must of struck a nerve.
REN=>Nope.
CUBE=>Hell no. Last I heard, this is America and we got Freedom of Speech. Pretty sure that includes rap music. Exercisin' our Free Speech across this whole damn country, openin' people's eyes. Far as I'm concerned that's our job.
JERRY=>It's nice to see you, Cube.
CUBE=>Well I can barely see you, Jerry. What's with all this Godfather shit?
JERRY=>I know you've been very eager to sign a contract with Eric's company, Ruthless Records.
CUBE=>It's your company too, right? You and Eric. All for one, one for all.
JERRY=>That's incorrect. It's not my company. I work for you. I've made that clear from the beginning.
CUBE=>Alright, cool. So I can take this one, show it to a lawyer or somethin'?
JERRY=>Cube, lawyers get paid to make trouble. That's what they do -- create problems where problems don't exist.
CUBE=>But I have no idea what it says. At least let me take it to show my family.
JERRY=>I can assure you, it's all standard. You can read it now, if you like.
CUBE=>Jerry, you know I can't understand this legal shit. None of us can. That's why we need to show it to a lawyer--
JERRY=>Cube, I thought you knew? Everyone else signed already. You're the only one who hasn't.
CUBE=>What the fuck..?
JERRY=>Look. Cube. This is a great thing. This is what you always wanted your whole life. And there's also this.
CUBE=>Damn. Thanks, man.
JERRY=>Soon as you sign this contract, the money is all yours.
CUBE=>That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months.
CUBE=>Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me?
JERRY=>That's ridiculous.
CUBE=>Give me my money, Jerry.
JERRY=>You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free?
CUBE=>Why all this now, Jerry? Back in the beginning, if you thought we were so good, why didn't you just give us contracts then?
JERRY=>Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind.
CUBE=>I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody?
CUBE=>Bye, Jerry.
REN=>I'mma get me a El Camino with some gold Daytons and a Phantom top.
YELLA=>I can't wait to get out of that "po- man's Porsche" and get me some real shit --
CUBE=>Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer?
REN=>Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid!
YELLA=>For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract!
DRE=>You ain't signed?
CUBE=>Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. Thought we talked about this, dude?
REN=>It is what it is... I don't trust Jerry but I trust Eric.
CUBE=>At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat!
EAZY=>What up with Doc and Suge?
YELLA=>Guess that dude's "managing" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act...
DRE=>Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..?
CUBE=>Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre?
DRE=>Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed.
CUBE=>Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter.
DRE=>Cube, we Ruthless.
CUBE=>Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless.
T-BONE=>You comin', Cube?
JINX=>Can't believe you left the group, man. What you gonna do now? Guess we gotta start working on some solo stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?!
CUBE=>How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours?
KIM=>Kim.
CUBE=>Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day.
CUBE=>You believe in love at first sight?
KIM=>What you think?
BRYAN=>Wow, you're really leaving the group...
CUBE=>Yeah, I'm tired of the games. Eazy puts everything on Jerry and Jerry puts everything on Eazy. They can have it.
BRYAN=>How do you feel about that Kim? Is he making a big mistake?
KIM=>I don't think so-- after hearing everything that happened, I would've left too. Now he has the chance to showcase all his talents.
BRYAN=>Well, I believe in you Cube, so I'll tell ya what: there's not a lot of money in this right now, but if this first record hits, I'll make it up to you on the next one.
CUBE=>Well get ready-- `cause these albums are gonna be comin' real fast. I'm hungry and I got a lot to say that's gonna fuck the world up.
BRYAN TURNER=>Who're you gonna get to produce? Ruthless is probably gonna veto Dre working on the project. So what's your plan?
CUBE=>If I can't get the best producer in the in the west. I gotta go get the best in the east.
CUBE=>Kickin' shit called street knowledge. Why more niggas in the pen than in college? Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate. That's from the nigga ya love to hate.
CUBE TRACK=>Yeah, HA-HA! I'm the nigga ya love to hate --
EAZY=>Cube's record's in the Billboard top 20! Our shit never even came close to that. He's blowin' the fuck up --
JERRY=>It's gonna be fine, Eric. It's not just NWA anymore, it's our whole Ruthless roster.
JERRY=>We've got D.O.C., we've got Michel'le, we've got Above the Law. We're moving up to the next level.
EAZY=>We gotta keep Dre happy. Keep him motivated.
JERRY=>Look at him. You think he needs anymore motivation than that?
EAZY=>Yeah I get it. He drownin' in pussy. But that don't mean --
JERRY=>You gotta stop worrying so much. Let me do the worrying for you. Fact is, Ren can write just as good as Cube. Maybe even better. Come over here a minute --
JERRY=>Need your autograph on these checks and a few other things. Just sign right here --
EAZY=>We done with this shit now?
JERRY=>We're done.
EAZY=>Thanks, Jerry. I'mma go fuck now.
DRE=>Wuddup, Suge -- You good?
SUGE=>Are you?
SUGE=>Just figured you might be a bit fucked up after hearin' Cube's shit.
DRE=>Fucked up about what? I been bangin' that shit.
D.O.C.=>Wuddup, Dre. There's some bitches up in here, right? Yo, you take care of that shit for me?
SUGE=>I'm on it.
CUBE=>I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said.
BRYAN TURNER=>It's more complicated than that, Cube, there's metrics --
CUBE=>Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means.
CUBE=>Man, I got a kid on the way -- and I just bought a house on the strength of what you told me. You gave me your word.
BRYAN TURNER=>Cube. Relax. We're on the same team here. I'm your biggest fan --
CUBE=>It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine?
BRYAN TURNER=>Of course your not begging -- and I'm not trying to be difficult.
CUBE=>But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'.
BRYAN TURNER=>Cube, wait, Cube, come back --
CUBE=>Shoulda kept your word, Bryan.
BRYAN TURNER=>STOP! STOP! WHAT THE FUCK, CUBE!??!
BRYAN TURNER=>FINE! FINE, I'LL GET YOU YOUR MONEY! JUST STOP!
REN=>... Prisoner like a hostage. You shoulda covered your muthafuckin' head like an ostrich. Deep in the dirt cause you a sucka. And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucka --
EAZY=>That's what I'm talkin' about. Cube ain't shit.
DRE=>How you figure? That record's still the hottest shit out there.
YELLA=>For real. Cube killed it --
EAZY=>That's why we gotta go hard at him. We gonna look like some bitches if we just take that shit.
D.O.C.=>Take what? I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about. I like that shit.
EAZY=>Man, why you gotta be drunk all the time? Get your shit together.
D.O.C.=>Get your own shit together, lil nigga --
TOMICA=>This place is nice. Wow, I didn't realize this was a real "date" date. I thought we were just going out to eat. You bring all your females here?
EAZY=>Only the special ones. Actually I've never been here before, but I heard it's good. High as it is, it better be.
TOMICA=>You know I have a job, right?
EAZY=>Excuse me, Miss Record Executive.
TOMICA=>Executive Assistant. Ya know, you don't have to impress me. We could've went to Fat Burgers. I just like hangin with you. You make me laugh. That's good enough for me, you know? We can just chill.
TOMICA=>Yeah, she had a nice ass. But she might wanna fix those teeth.
DRE=>Wuddup.
SUGE=>Doc shouldn't even be alive. He got thrown from the car-- hit a tree.
DRE=>Goddamn. Is he paralyzed?
SUGE=>Nah. His throat got crushed. Doctor said he'll never talk right again.
DRE=>Vocal chords?
SUGE=>All fucked up. Career could be in jeopardy . Where's Eazy and Jerry?
DRE=>I don't know.
SUGE=>Them niggas ain't loyal. Taking they're fuckin' time to come see the man. That's why I got my people looking into his contracts at Ruthless. Gotta protect what he got left.
SUGE=>What do you think about Jerry?
DRE=>He aiight. I guess.
SUGE=>What about your paperwork? Is it cool?
DRE=>I dunno. I just focus on the music. . Maybe your people could look into my shit too?
SUGE=>Most definitely. I can arrange that.
BRYAN TURNER=>Cube, Kim -- Great to see you guys. How's that new house treating you?
KIM=>The new house is great. Thanks for asking. How's the new office?
BRYAN TURNER=>Great. I never did like the design of the old one anyway.
CUBE=>What you got, Bryan? I know you called me up here for somethin'.
BRYAN TURNER=>It's the new NWA record. I wanted to play it for you first, before you heard it anywhere else --
BRYAN TURNER=>About one minute in --
DRE=>... We started out with too much cargo. So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold.
CUBE=>Benedict Arnold.
KIM=>They're trying to call you some kind of a traitor.
CUBE=>I'm a traitor!? I didn't say shit about NWA on Amerikkka's Most Wanted! But now they're trying to diss. Okay.
KIM=>Baby, tell me what you're thinking.
CUBE=>I can't wait to get to the mothafuckin' studio!
CUBE=>God DAMN I'm glad y'all set it off. Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft. First you was down with the AK. And now I see you on a video with Michel'le. Lookin' like straight Bozos. I saw it comin', that's why I went solo.
CUBE=>Yella Boy's on your team so you're LOSIN'! And yo, Dre? Stick to producin'. Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-A-Dick. Eazy saw your ass, and went in it QUICK.
CUBE=>Y'all disgrace the C-P-T. `Cause you gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy, with No Vaseline.
CUBE=>... So don't believe what Ren say, cause he goin out like Kunta Kinte. But I got a whip for ya, Toby; used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me --
CUBE=>You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot. With your manager, fella, fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella. But if they were smart as me, Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree. With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline. Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on. Til that Jheri curl is gone. On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation. Heard you both got the same bank account -- Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' about? Get rid of that Devil real simple: put a bullet in his temple. Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew with a white Jew tellin' you what to do --
YELLA=>That shit's kinda funny.
REN=>Mothafucka got us! What we gonna do? I got my pen ready to serve that fool. Just say the word.
JERRY=>We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard. Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight --
EAZY=>Stop it, Jerry. Relax man. Niggas don't know what anti-Semitic means - - It's just a battle rap.
JERRY=>I always knew Cube was a rotten human being. And people are gonna know the facts. I'll make sure of it. I can't believe you're not as angry as I am, what's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what he said?
EAZY=>I heard it, Jerry. You deal with it your way, I'll deal with it mine. All we got to do is hit the studio and end this boy career.
YELLA=>I don't know about all that.
JERRY=>Well call Dre and you guys go do it!
REN=>Damn, E. Who work for who?
EAZY=>Who you see sitting in the big chair mothafucka?!
JERRY=>Help you with something?
LARGE MAN=>This your house?
JERRY=>Who's asking?
LARGE MAN=>It's a real nice house.
JERRY=>Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube?
LARGE MAN=>Have yourself a good night, Jerry.
CUBE=>Fuck'd y'all say!?
DRE=>Still can't believe it. It's like they're enjoying themselves.
EAZY=>Least they got it on video. LAPD gonna have a real good time on that level 3 prison yard, know what I mean?
DRE=>Yep, we got they asses this time. Tape don't lie.
JERRY=>Just need a word with Dre --
SUGE=>It can wait. Let the man work.
SUGE=>Yo Dre. Hold up.
SUGE=>I did what you asked. Had my people look into your contracts.
SUGE=>It ain't good. Not that I'm surprised or anything. Gotta watch yourself.
DRE=>What you mean by that?
SUGE=>Everything you need to know. It's all in there.
SUGE=>You know I can help you with this.
DRE=>Nah. I got this.
EAZY=>So, what'd you wanna see me about? Sounded all worked up on the phone.
DRE=>I know you don't like hearin' this shit. But it's about Jerry. We gotta get rid of that muthafuck --
EAZY=>Is that seriously the reason you wanted to talk? I thought we were past all that --
DRE=>I found out some information, Eric. Real shit. I had some people look at this, and I ain't gettin' my fair share.
EAZY=>You know why you rich, Dre? You know why you live in a big ass house and don't sleep on a couch no more? Do you know why you fuck the finest bitches? That's Jerry, dude. He broke us through the door. He made this shit happen, and you wanna turn on him just like Cube --
DRE=>Cube was right, fool! You gotta look at these papers, E. Just look and you'll see.
DRE=>We made it because our shit is dope, Eric, not because of Jerry. We can keep going and own the goddamn world, we just can't be fuckin' with him no more.
DRE=>Dude. We go back a long, long way. You and me. We started this NWA shit. I just want it to be right.
EAZY=>You think that's right, turning your back on somebody? After all he's done for us?
DRE=>You mean all he's done for you.
DRE=>Look at me, man. Why won't you look at me? It's like I don't mean shit to you. Like I never meant shit.
DRE=>Thought you were my brother.
EAZY=>Thought you were mine, too.
REN=>Everything cool, E?
YELLA=>Yo where Dre at anyway --
EAZY=>Man, fuck Dre.
YELLA=>Whatchu mean?
EAZY=>Why don't y'all ask him.
REN=>Fuck you talkin' about? He comin' or not --
EAZY=>That nigga quit. So nah, he ain't comin'. But fuck it, we gonna keep this shit movin'. Don't need that punk anyway...
SUGE=>This shit sounds good.
DRE=>None of this means anything, while I'm under contract with Ruthless.
SUGE=>Don't worry about that. I promise you that I'll get you out of your contracts.
SNOOP=>What's up, Cuz.
SUGE=>Yo who the fuck's this, Warren?
WARREN G=>My bad.
SNOOP=>Snoop Doggy Dog, Cuz. Who are you?
DRE=>Glad y'all came by. Your demo was tight.
SNOOP=>Thanks, Dre.
DRE=>Well listen, I'm workin' on a track for this movie called "Deep Cover." I want you to get down on it.
SNOOP=>For real?
SNOOP=>Oh hell yeah...
EAZY=>Hello?
SUGE=>We need to talk about them contracts.
EAZY=>Talk to Jerry.
SUGE=>Don't wanna talk to Jerry. It's your company. You're the man.
SUGE=>Come by the studio. We'll be here all night. Just workin'. We just wanna squash this. Make it right for you.
EAZY=>Where the hell is Dre? You said he'd be here --
SUGE=>Don't worry about Dre. Truth be told, he ain't got nothing to do with this right here.
SUGE=>Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna sign these. Releasing Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless.
EAZY=>Whatever homie. You think I'm signing that shit, you crazier then I thought. I'm out --
SUGE=>Naw. I think you gonna stay awhile.
EAZY=>Fuck you, Suge. I ain't scared of none you niggas, cuzz!
SUGE=>You can talk tough all you want-- but this ain't no record. Don't make me change you, Eric Wright.
EAZY=>The fuck is that supposed to mean?
SUGE=>These niggas will take something from you that you can't get back.
BLOOD=>Just let me murder this Crab, Suge.
SUGE=>Naw. That's too easy. I got a whole night planned for you if you don't sign them release forms.
SUGE=>It could happen quick, Eric. Or it could take a long, long time. You better choose right. Because you know where I come from. This Bompton nigga!
EAZY=>Dirty mothafucka...
JERRY=>Jesus Christ, Eric. You can't just... I thought you were --
JERRY=>Are yo okay? Eric. Why don't we go inside? All right? Come on...
JERRY=>Hey. You gotta tell me what's going on. I can tell when something's --
EAZY=>I gotta kill that mothafucka, Suge. I just wanted you to know that shit's about to get thick around here.
JERRY=>You're not gonna do that.
EAZY=>I didn't come over here to ask you - - I came to tell you.
EAZY=>You the one that wanted to be down with this gangsta shit. So here we go.
JERRY=>You do that, it's gonna ruin everything we've built --
EAZY=>I have to do it! This is the streets, muthafucka! I don't have a choice! He came at me! He came at us. We don't hit back, it's over! Done! Put a fork in this shit!
JERRY=>Eric. Listen to me. I never said we won't hit back. But this isn't Compton. We don't hit back with bullets. We do it with lawyers. We drain those assholes.
EAZY=>I don't care about the money, Jerry. Ain't about the money.
JERRY=>Of course it is. You're smarter than those criminals. You wanna kill somebody? Then you'll be in prison, forever. No more family. No more Ruthless. No more anything.
JERRY=>If you kill this man. His problems are over and yours are just beginning -- Lets hit 'em where it really hurts.
JOURNALIST=>Are you Anti-Semitic?
CUBE=>What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial?
JOURNALIST=>The J.D.L. has recently gotten involved, saying that the lyrics regarding your former manager Jerry Heller --
CUBE=>I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation?
JOURNALIST=>I have no idea.
CUBE=>Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue -
JOURNALIST=>But it isn't just the Jewish community. The Korean grocer community have also accused you of racism, mostly because of your song "Black Korea" --
CUBE=>Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes.
JOURNALIST=>What's your relationship with the Nation of Islam?
CUBE=>There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a "sandbag reporter" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's "Black Korea," and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent?
DRE=>What you fools doin' out here?
WARREN G=>Watching you daydream for the last five minutes.
DOC=>Looking stupid as a mothafucka.
SNOOP=>Come take a ride with us Dr. Dre. You gotta get out this house, Cuz and get your mind right.
SNOOP=>What you so tense for, Cuz?
DRE=>I'm cool.
WARREN G=>No you not. You been up in that house for a month now, and not one track? Wassup, what's wrong?
DRE=>First time in my life, I feel like I'm forcin' it.
WARREN G=>Why?
DRE=>Too much outside interference -- Eazy and Jerry tryin' to starve me out. Playin' games with my money. Tryin' to get me back in there on my hands and knees --
SNOOP=>Is that why you ain't got no furniture?
SNOOP=>This shit'll chill you out.
DRE=>Nah, that ain't me. I'm good.
WARREN G=>Come on, big bro. Loosen up.
DRE=>Fuck it, gimme that shit.
DRE=>Wow. What is in this shit?
SNOOP=>That shit right there? That's the Chronic.
SNOOP=>You never smoked before?
DRE=>No. I can feel it in my nuts, man. Is that normal?
SNOOP=>Oh shit. Keep playing that.
SNOOP=>One. Two. Three into the Four. Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door...
JERRY=>We're about to get back into the game in a big way, Eric --
EAZY=>Yeah? How you figure?
JERRY=>Are you just trying to insult me?
JERRY=>Did you forget about Ren's album? Or the fact that you're working on an album that I believe is gonna be bigger than anything NWA ever --
EAZY=>Do you really believe that bullshit? All I know is Cube's doin' big things, makin' movies and shit. And I keep hearin' about this album Dre workin' on --
JERRY=>Dre's a fuckin' producer, Eric! Producer's don't rap! It's never gonna work! Period!
DRE=>You look like you're ready to go.
NICOLE=>I'm just waiting on my friend. I knew I should've drove.
DRE=>You're not having fun?
NICOLE=>Oh no, it was fun. I had a lot of fun. But now it's starting to get a little wild.
DRE=>Yeah, it does get crazy around here sometimes. Hi, I'm Andre.
WOMAN=>I know. I'm Nicole.
DRE=>Hey Nicole, why don't you come over here with me and kick it for a while til your friend gets back.
NICOLE=>I don't know, maybe another time and another place. But not now.
WARREN G=>Yo Dre, we're can I dump this shit?
DRE=>Do it look like I give a fuck right now? Can't you see I'm tryin' to make a Love Connection?
NICOLE=>No, he's trying make a friend connection.
WARREN G=>Aiight, regulate that shit!
DRE=>A friend connection?
NICOLE=>Speaking of friends, I need to go find mine before she gets too lost.
DRE=>You want me to help you?
NICOLE=>No, seems like you need to get back to your game. I'll talk to you later.
DRE=>I'mma find you, Nicole!
SNOOP=>FREESTYLE TBD...
SNOOP=>What the fuhhhh --
WARREN G=>Your house is on fire.
DRE=>Yeah. Shit's crazy, right.
WARREN G=>Maybe I shouldn't have thrown them coals in the trash.
DRE=>MY FUCKIN' MASTERS!
DRE=>What do you mean that everyone is passing on this record?
SUGE=>What do you think?
SUGE=>They all turned it down. "Too many live instruments. It's not hip- hop."
DRE=>It's not hip-hop? Shit, it's the future. Ain't no more money in sampling everythang.
SUGE=>This guy has a lot of money. This is the only shot we got.
DRE=>Okay, shoot.
JIMMY=>Jimmy Iovine. Interscope Records. It's nice to meet you. Dre or Dr Dre. What should I call you?
DRE=>Dre's cool. How are you doing? I heard John McClain gave you my album. What did you think?
JIMMY IOVINE=>I think it was great. So, you're the artist on this record. Who produced it?
DRE=>I did.
JIMMY IOVINE=>Who engineered it?
DRE=>I did.
JIMMY IOVINE=>Listen. I don't know anything about hip hop. And to be honest with you, I don't necessarily care for it. But I know this is special.
DRE=>Thank you.
SUGE=>We'd love to bring it to Interscope. But there's a problem.
JIMMY IOVINE=>What's the problem?
SUGE=>Ruthless. Lawsuits. Contracts.
JIMMY IOVINE=>How about this. Give me three weeks. But I don't want to hear any bullshit about you shopping it anywhere else. If you do that. I believe I can get you out of this mess. Sound good?
JERRY=>Eazy. You may wanna see this.
TOM BROKAW=>... a stunning verdict of "not guilty" for the L.A. Four today in Simi Valley...
JERRY=>Sorry...
EAZY=>Sorry? We all ought to be sorry... We had them on tape -- we had their asses on tape.
CROWD=>No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police! No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police!
YELLA=>So all this weed. It's for your Ruthless artists?
EAZY=>Havin' some cash flow problems. They can smoke it, they can sell it, I don't care. As long as it keeps 'em off my back for a minute.
YELLA=>Maybe you should think about diversifying into my kinda shit. There's money in there, too.
EAZY=>What, makin' pornos? No thanks, man. That's your thing. I'll stick with this music shit. Once my new album right here's done, I'mma be fine --
REN=>You all right, man?
EAZY=>Yeah. Just tired. All this shit, downsizin' to a new crib, just weighin' on me. I'll figure it out though. I always do.
JERRY=>Eric --
JERRY=>Can you come by my office? I need you to sign some checks --
EAZY=>I'll come when I can, Jerry.
JERRY=>Eric --
DRE=>Man, this is just the beginning... We're building an empire.
SUGE=>You're in my spot!
DRE=>Suge, it's cool --
SUGE=>Did you park in my muthafuckin' parking space or not?
EMPLOYEE=>I didn't know, I --
SUGE=>Now move yo' piece of shit and park my car.
SUGE=>-- And I bet not see one drop of blood in that mothafucka.
CUBE=>Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea?
KIM=>Look how young you guys look.
CUBE=>Damn... We left some good records on the table...
KIM=>Well-- ain't nobody burnt down the table did they? Ever thought about getting back together?
CUBE=>All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be "ON" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know.
KIM=>That's a shame. It's terrible how money tears us apart.
CUBE=>Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky.
DRE=>Aren't you glad I tracked you down?
NICOLE=>I wasn't exactly hiding.
DRE=>So wassup, you been havin' good time?
NICOLE=>Yeah... Why?
DRE=>Well I mean, I like comin' over your place, but you know, your neighbors be complainin' about "the noise" --
DRE=>I think a little more privacy would be better.
NICOLE=>So what, you want me to move?
DRE=>Yeah, maybe. I know of a perfect spot. Plenty of room, and I know the owner.
NICOLE=>After a few months, you sure you're ready for that, Andre?
DRE=>Yeah. I'm really feelin' you like that.
NICOLE=>I'm feelin' you too, but...
DRE=>Hey you know what, don't worry about it right now. Was just a thought...
DRE=>Listen, I don't mean to change the temperature in here. But it had to be crazy, bein' married to a Laker.
NICOLE=>Wasn't what I'd call a good fit. It got crazy once we moved to L.A. I definitely went through some unnecessary shit when he started acting like an asshole. But I have a beautiful son and all that other nonsense is behind me now.
DRE=>Look, no offense, but I'm a little glad he was an asshole. His loss is my gain. To assholes.
NICOLE=>Chin-chin.
NICOLE=>All right -- Good night.
DRE=>Really? Good night?
NICOLE=>Are you okay to drive?
DRE=>No.
NICOLE=>Good night, Andre.
DRE=>See, I can't help thinkin', maybe you want me to come inside...
NICOLE=>Of course I do.
DRE=>So what's different now?
NICOLE=>I got a lot of things to think about. You're asking me to move in... That's a big step. I like you, Andre. But there's a lot going on around you.
DRE=>What do you mean?
NICOLE=>I read the papers. I'm not stupid. I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting... Just seems dangerous. My son's my world.
DRE=>But I thought we been havin fun.
NICOLE=>Fun is fun, Andre. But I refuse to walk away from one crazy life into another.
NICOLE=>I'll a call you.
GUY WITH DOG=>Dre, you want to put some money on this red nose?
DRE=>Nah man, I'm good.
DRE=>Where's Pac at?
GUY WITH DOG=>Studio A...
DRE=>Wha'up Pac?
TUPAC=>Oh shit! Wha'up Dre... I'm about to hit niggas in the mouth with this new album. Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
DRE=>Nigga what? I do...guess who I worked with last night.
TUPAC=>Who dat?
DRE=>Roger fuckin' Troutman. Man this shit is fire. Wait til you hear it.
TUPAC=>Oh! OK what you thinking about calling it?
DRE=>I'm thinking about calling it California love.
DRE=>Press play
DRE=>What the fuck y'all doin?
SUGE=>Yo Dre, you just in time. Watch this. Get up! You know what to do.
POOR BASTARD=>I'd like to make a toast...
POOR BASTARD=>...to Death Row Records...
ROOM=>To Death Row...
GOON GIRL=>May the west coast reign forever.
POOR BASTARD=>May the west coast reign forever.
BLOOD#1=>What else!?
POOR BASTARD=>I'd like to make a toast to Suge. For making this all happen.
SUGE=>Don't forget to toast Dr. Dre. you little bitch ass mothafucka!
DRE=>Hold the fuck up! Put cha' glasses down. Put your fuckin clothes on. What the fuck is going on around here?! Seriously, what's going on?!
DRE=>Nah Nah... What the fuck is this shit. Is this why we got money? To act like we ain't got no god damn sense?! We could of did all this kind of dumb shit back in Compton! This what you muthafuckas turned into!? Seriously!
SUGE=>Its okay, Dre.
DRE=>This shit is stupid! Do ya'll know what it took for us to get here. Do y'all know what you doin'? Y'all fuckin' it up! Y'all fucking it up! And what the fuck ya'll doing here?!
DRE=>Really, ok...
SUGE=>Who fuckin' shit up! You trippin. We can do anything we want to do. We started this shit. This is us.
DRE=>Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us. This other shit -- is you!
DRE=>'Tha fuck you talking too?
DRE=>What the fuck?!!!
DRE=>Get the fuck off me.
SUGE=>Man don't even trip off this muthafucka. What he going to do? Where he going to go?
DRE=>Come on, come on, come --
NICOLE=>Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row?
DRE=>Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway.
NICOLE=>112 days? That doesn't even make sense.
DRE=>Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation.
NICOLE=>You got one phone call and you called me?
DRE=>`Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care.
DRE=>I fucked up. But I've had a lot of time to think in here, and I promise you, things are gonna be different from now on.
NICOLE=>You take care of yourself, Andre.
EAZY=>I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going.
TOMICA=>I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you.
EAZY=>Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way.
CUBE=>Heads up y'all. This lil nigga might wanna do something.
EAZY=>Relax everybody. Just came in the club-- heard you were over here.
CUBE=>Yeah. I'm over here. What you need?
EAZY=>I don't need shit. Out here with Bone Thugs-- Was just in the neighborhood. Wanted to say wassup.
EAZY=>Saw your movie. It was good.
CUBE=>Thought you said it was an after- school special.
EAZY=>Missed you, boy.
CUBE=>Missed you too, E. Wish we could've work shit out.
EAZY=>Guess it all happened like it was supposed to. You a movie star-- I'm a music mogul. Dre. Well Dre is tripping right now, but he's doing his thang. Just wanted to come over here and put something on your mind..
EAZY=>I wish all that bullshit never happen between us.
EAZY=>Definitely never wanted it to get physical-- we should've kept it on wax.
CUBE=>Never should've dissed each other in the first place. Made our fans choice between us. That ain't cool.
EAZY=>Yeah you right. Ever though we was going to be this big?
CUBE=>Nope. I was reminiscing with my wife the other day. What it felt like-- In the beginning. We were so young and ferocious. Doing music straight for the hood. Trying to be ghetto stars... I thought I knew everything back then -- But I didn't know shit.
EAZY=>Me neither. I'm still trying to figure this stuff out. One minute I'm slangin' in a crack house -- next thing I know, they invite me to the White House.
CUBE=>Yeah. I get it. Everything changes so fast. Feels like it was 20 years ago. If we were still together do you know how large we'd be?
EAZY=>You ever think about fuckin' with some new NWA shit?
CUBE=>I'd be lyin' if I said I never thought about it.
EAZY=>Me too, Cube. Been thinkin' about it a lot. Be like 1989 again. We changed the world forever. Mothafuckas can never go back to that fake shit after us. It gets no realer then NWA. No matter what...
CUBE=>If you can get Dre to do it, I'm in. But check this out homie-- I ain't doin' it if Jerry's around. He done made enough off us.
EAZY=>I hear you.
CUBE=>Cool. We done talked til the damn club closed -- I got a car coming. You need a ride back to your hotel?
EAZY=>Naw, I'm cool. I wanna walk.
CUBE=>Walk? It's cold as fuck Eric, this ain't L.A.
EAZY=>I'm good. Hit me up later.
JERRY=>Wait, aren't you gonna sign --
EAZY=>I'mma take these home with me. I'll sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a couple days.
JERRY=>But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it --
EAZY=>It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills, my checks. I mean look, my name's right there.
JERRY=>I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost --
EAZY=>Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can handle it.
TOMICA=>You had to know the truth sometime. Now you do.
EAZY=>Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre. And I didn't listen. I fucked up.
JERRY=>Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you --
JERRY=>So what was it, the groupie? The executive assistant? Did she even go to college? Come on. You're smarter than that, Eric --
EAZY=>This ain't about Tomica, Jerry. It's about you. And you really gotta stop acting like you never did anything wrong.
JERRY=>Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork --
EAZY=>Jerry, for real? You can stop givin' me advice. As of, like, now. I'm getting NWA back together. It's happening. But you ain't gonna have nothing to do with it this time.
JERRY=>Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight.
JERRY=>I know what's best for you, and for Ruthless, and we've built a trust over years of hard work. That trust is our foundation, Eric.
JERRY=>Are you okay? You don't look --
EAZY=>Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust is a muthafucka.
JERRY=>Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric.
EAZY=>You're fired, Jerry.
JERRY=>Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we do things! This is a business and I won't let you --
DRE=>Hello?
EAZY'S VOICE=>Wassup Andre, it's Eric.
DRE=>Yeah? Wassup wit you?
EAZY=>Just felt like callin' --
DRE=>Yeah. Okay. Wassup?
EAZY=>You know. Doin' my thing. Makin records. Killin' all that pussy out there.
EAZY=>How about you?
DRE=>Just makin' tracks.
EAZY=>That Snoop record you did was big. 850,000 copies in the first week?! Congratulations on the success of that.
DRE=>Good lookin' out.
EAZY=>Well look, I know you're busy, but I talked to Cube, and we were, like, talkin' about some... possibilities.
EAZY=>And by the way, if you ain't heard-- I ain't fuckin' with Jerry Heller no more. Nigga's fired.
DRE=>Really. Well it's about time. He's the reason why we broke up.
EAZY=>Listen man, I know everything got messed up and went the wrong way. I wish it didn't. I wish we can go back to the days of Skateland when we were all just young, hungry and ferocious. The world's most dangerous group. Before all the money and fame got between us.
DRE=>Yeah me too-- cause I'm not proud of all the shit I did, either.
EAZY=>So you think maybe, we can make somethin' happen?
DRE=>Yeah, that's sounds cool -- Let's stay in touch.
EAZY=>Fair enough.
EAZY=>Everybody's all in. NWA is back!
REN=>Wuddup, y'all.
YELLA=>Hey so, when are Dre and Cube gonna roll in here?
REN=>Yeah, you know -- Gettin' kinda anxious to get this new shit goin'.
EAZY=>I don't know. Hopefully soon. Let's just get ready. New NWA gonna change the game, just like back in the day --
REN=>No doubt. I got books of new shit --
YELLA=>Yo, you alright, Eazy?
EAZY=>Yeah. Just. Like. Need some fresh air, somethin' --
TOMICA=>Eric!
TOMICA=>You gonna say something? Is it a respiratory infection -- pneumonia?
DOCTOR=>Yes, well, it is those things... and more, I'm afraid... We ran a full blood battery and -- Mr. Wright, I'm sorry but you've tested positive for the HIV virus.
EAZY=>Get the fuck outta here.
DOCTOR=>The normal T-cell count is anywhere between 500 and 1500. Right now, your T-cell count is... 14.
EAZY=>But I ain't no faggot.
DOCTOR=>Mr. Wright, there are actually quite a few ways that the virus can be transmitted --
EAZY=>It's wrong. No way. Test me again. Test my shit again --
DOCTOR=>We've actually run the test five times, with five different samples... and the results remain --
EAZY=>Tomica. She's pregnant. Oh fuck. Does that mean she --
DOCTOR=>No. Not necessarily. But we'll need to test her, too.
EAZY=>So what do we do? What's the treatment? Let's get started.
EAZY=>I got work to do. How long's it gonna take to get me healthy again?
DOCTOR=>Mr. Wright. You need to understand. You're very, very sick --
EAZY=>But I don't even feel that bad...
DOCTOR=>With treatment, and palliative care, we can probably keep you comfortable for... maybe six months. At the very most.
EAZY=>Comfortable? What you mean comfortable? Six months!?
DOCTOR=>I'm truly sorry, Mr. Wright.
REPORTER=>Last week, the rap world was stunned to learn in a press conference held by his lawyer, that Eazy-E had been admitted to Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and diagnosed as suffering from full- blown AIDS.
RON SWEENEY=>Eazy started getting sick about a month ago but hadn't shown signs of improvement, so he checked into the hospital. They ran extensive tests and as a result we found out that... he has what he has...
EAZY=>Just glad you're okay. You and the baby.
TOMICA=>No. We can beat this. Together.
EAZY=>Yo.
REN'S VOICE=>Eazy! What the fuck, cuz? People been sayin' some crazy shit. Like you got AIDS or somethin'? Can you believe that? Muthafuckin' Eazy-E got AIDS? Niggas be starting too many rumors, huh?
TOMICA=>Who was that?
NICOLE=>It's for you.
DRE=>What up.
YELLA=>It's Bone Thugs' new LP. It's good, Eric. It's gonna be huge when it drops. Everybody thinks so. Want me to play it for you?
EAZY=>Put it on the table. I'll listen later. Thanks for stoppin' through. Hit you when I get outta here.
TOMICA=>I can't. That's not the way it should happen. It's not right --
EAZY=>Please. It's gotta happen, baby. I'm having my surgery tomorrow, so it has to happen now. Because I might not. Wake up.
TOMICA=>Don't say that.
EAZY=>It's true, Tomica. I gotta make this right. Ron says it's the only way to protect everything I built.
TOMICA=>It's so... fucked up --
EAZY=>Hey. Listen to me. It doesn't matter what people think. They don't know. They don't understand. There's no other way. Please. I know it's not the way you pictured it. You deserve better.
EAZY=>But if we don't do this, I won't be able to protect either of you.
TOMICA=>Okay. I love you, Eric.
PASTOR=>Are we ready?
PASTOR=>Tomica Woods, do you take Eric Wright to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold...
DRE=>Yo, Eazy. Wanna tell you somethin'. I know you can hear me. I know you're still in there --
CUBE=>S'up Dre?
DRE=>Good to see you, Cube.
CUBE=>You see him? How he look?
DRE=>He looks the same -- like Eric just sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a machine breathing for him --
CUBE=>Can't see him like that, man. This is bad. I asked one of his homies to call me when he wakes up.
DRE=>Okay.
DRE=>He's gone.
SUGE=>What's the urgency, Dre?
DRE=>I'm out, man. I'm out of Death Row.
SUGE=>You're not making any sense. Death Row and Dr. Dre are one in the same. You can't just up and go.
DRE=>Gonna do my own thing now. Start fresh. Nobody to answer to but myself. It's time, Suge.
SUGE=>You're one stupid muthafucka. You just gonna throw away all this money? `Cause if you leave, everything we created is mine.
DRE=>What we created? Ha -- Well you can have it.
SUGE=>You ain't takin nobody with you. Death Row stays Death Row. And if you even think about touching my money? You know how I handle shit. Blue Rev. 141.
DRE=>Do what you gotta do. I'm still out.
SUGE=>You're not gettin none of it.
DRE=>I don't give a fuck-- You can't put a price on peace of mind. So you can keep the artists, the money, the masters and the bullshit. I'm startin' my own thing.
SUGE=>What you gonna call it?
DRE=>Aftermath.
