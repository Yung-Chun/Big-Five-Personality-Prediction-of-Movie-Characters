BLOMKVIST=>What is this, the media event of the year? REPORTER 1 Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work.
BLOMKVIST=>Don't try to play it up, that won't either. 4A EXT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 4A
BLOMKVIST=>I'll appeal to you, Viggo: Find a real story to cover. He hurries off in the rain.
NEWSCASTER V/O=>Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel against financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
TV NEWSCASTER=>In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.
WENNERSTROM ON TV=>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a good journalist who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered. He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences.
BLOMKVIST=>Marlboro Red ... and a lighter. EXT. CAFE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
TV NEWSCASTER V/O=>Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more.
ERIKA=>Where you been?
BLOMKVIST=>Walking. Thinking.
ERIKA=>Smoking?
BLOMKVIST=>Just one. He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
ERIKA=>TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety.
BLOMKVIST=>I have. Who else?
ERIKA=>Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated.
BLOMKVIST=>You've been on the phone all day then.
ERIKA=>I'm as much to blame for this as you.
BLOMKVIST=>You are? You wrote it?
ERIKA=>I read it. I ran it.
BLOMKVIST=>Not the same.
ERIKA=>Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
BLOMKVIST=>Mine is. They regard each other in another silence. Then -
BLOMKVIST=>I'm tired. I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week.
ERIKA=>Alone? He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'

FRODE=>You called her, I thought. You spoke to her.
ARMANSKY=>I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
FRODE=>I don't understand.
ARMANSKY=>No one here likes her. So it's better if she works at home.
FRODE=>But you told her I wanted to meet her.
ARMANSKY=>But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
FRODE V/O=>But you like her.
ARMANSKY V/O=>Very much. She's one of the best investigators I have. As you saw from her report -
FRODE=>But.
ARMANSKY=>I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different.
FRODE=>In what way.
ARMANSKY=>In every way. INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY
SECRETARY/INTERCOM=>Ms. Salander's here.
ARMANSKY=>Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
FRODE=>How do you do?
SALANDER=>Something wrong with the report?
FRODE=>No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it.
SALANDER=>There's nothing not in it.
FRODE=>Your opinion of him isn't.
SALANDER=>I'm not paid to give my opinion.
FRODE=>So you don't have one?
SALANDER=>He's clean. In my opinion.
FRODE=>He's - excuse me?
SALANDER=>He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset.
FRODE=>There's less in his asset column after his conviction today.
SALANDER=>That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. Frode looks at Armansky. What's that supposed to mean?
SALANDER=>If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character.
FRODE=>Are you saying he was set up?
SALANDER=>That wasn't part of my assignment.
FRODE=>You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. How big of a fool did he make of himself financially?
SALANDER=>The judgement will just about empty his savings. This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it.
SALANDER=>May I go?
FRODE=>Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include?
SALANDER=>Nothing that warranted inclusion.
FRODE=>I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
ARMANSKY=>I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated.
FRODE=>Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
SALANDER=>He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.
FRODE=>You were right not to include that.
SALANDER=>I know.
FRODE=>Anything else?
SALANDER=>No.
FRODE=>Please think before you say no.
SALANDER=>I did.
FRODE=>I don't want to be surprised by something later.
FRODE=>So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure.
SALANDER=>He likes sandwiches. A15 EXT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING A15

ANNIKA=>Never a good idea mixing family and business.
BLOMKVIST=>And I still would have lost.
GREGOR=>Did you have ... anything on him.
BLOMKVIST=>I had a lot. It just wasn't any good.
ERIKA=>It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to worry about me.
PERNILLA=>Mom's worried.
BLOMKVIST=>About me?

DOCTOR V/O=>He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage.

PERNILLA=>You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to.

BLOMKVIST=>Hello.
FRODE O/S=>Mr. Blomkvist?
BLOMKVIST=>Yes.
FRODE O/S=>Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode. I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of -
BLOMKVIST=>Of course.
FRODE O/S=>He'd like to speak to you about a private matter.
BLOMKVIST=>You know, you're calling at an awkward time.
FRODE O/S=>I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to Christmas dinner myself.
BLOMKVIST=>That's not what I mean.
FRODE O/S=>You're referring to your recent legal trouble. That has provided Mr. Vanger with some entertainment.
BLOMKVIST=>Excuse me?
FRODE O/S=>He doesn't care for Wennerstrom either.
BLOMKVIST=>Have him call me.
FRODE O/S=>He'd like to meet in person if that's okay. Up north. Hedestad.
BLOMKVIST=>No. Sorry.
FRODE O/S=>He's much too old to make a trip to Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please. If you'd be so kind as to consider.
FRODE O/S=>Hedestad is lovely in winter. Like a Christmas card.
FRODE=>First time in Hedestad?
BLOMKVIST=>And last, I'm sure.
FRODE=>It's lovely in the spring.
BLOMKVIST=>You said it was lovely in winter.
FRODE=>This is unseasonable.
BLOMKVIST=>I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
FRODE=>Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish.
VANGER=>Welcome. Come inside. It's warm.
VANGER=>Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like?
FRODE=>Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
VANGER=>What?
BLOMKVIST=>I can't stay for dinner.
VANGER=>Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY
VANGER=>What do you know about me?
BLOMKVIST=>That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country.
VANGER=>Used to. That's correct.
VANGER=>My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines. We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden. You know what our most profitable product now is? Fertilizer.
VANGER=>I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking. I need your help.
BLOMKVIST=>Doing.
VANGER=>Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ... my family. A30 EXT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING A30
VANGER V/O=>This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard.
VANGER=>Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17.
VANGER=>Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried.
VANGER=>Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie.
BLOMKVIST=>They're still called that.
VANGER=>Are they? Okay. INSERT: Close on a photo of Gottfried.
VANGER=>He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on.
BLOMKVIST=>Someone has to do it.
VANGER=>That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.
VANGER=>His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet.
VANGER=>She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person.
BLOMKVIST=>And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...
BLOMKVIST=>Something happened to her?
VANGER=>Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane. OMIT: INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DUSK
VANGER=>It was September 21st, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16.
VANGER V/O=>My brothers - along with their wives, children and grandchildren - had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the Yacht Club held its Autumn parade.
VANGER V/O=>Harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it. She returned a little after two o'clock. INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966
VANGER V/O=>She came to the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. She leaves. He returns to the others in the room.
VANGER V/O=>But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred.
VANGER V/O=>The accident had nothing to do with Harriet - and everything.
VANGER V/O=>It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing.
VANGER V/O=>Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side.
VANGER V/O=>The driver of the car - a Mr. Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured. All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark.
VANGER V/O=>About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966
VANGER V/O=>We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house.
VANGER V/O=>The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner. That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.
VANGER V/O=>And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next forty years.
VANGER=>What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?
BLOMKVIST=>She couldn't have run away?
VANGER=>Not without being seen.
VANGER=>Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked. 45B INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY 45B
BLOMKVIST=>She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
VANGER=>The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing.
VANGER=>No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall.
VANGER=>These were from her.
VANGER=>These, from her killer. Blomkvist regards the forty ...
BLOMKVIST=>Who knows about these?
VANGER=>Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you.
VANGER V/O=>When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it -
VANGER=>- studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.
BLOMKVIST=>I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money.
VANGER=>We haven't discussed your fee.
BLOMKVIST=>We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.
VANGER=>You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind.
VANGER=>Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't.
BLOMKVIST=>You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.
VANGER=>Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now. As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery.
BLOMKVIST=>Mr. -
VANGER=>I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
VANGER=>He began his career working for me. And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it.
PLAGUE=>Would you like to sit? I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
SALANDER=>Did you make it?
PLAGUE=>Have you something for me?
PLAGUE=>I'm on welfare; I don't administer it. This isn't enough.
SALANDER=>I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now.
PLAGUE=>I find that so poignant. So much so that he does nothing more than look at her. She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands.

BLOMKVIST=>Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am. They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup.
BLOMKVIST=>Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.
ERIKA=>There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone.
BLOMKVIST=>It's four hours by train. It's not the North Pole. EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases.

NILSSON=>There. EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY
VANGER=>The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse.
BLOMKVIST=>He was there that day?
VANGER=>Indeed he was.
VANGER=>That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak.
BLOMKVIST=>Does anyone speak to anyone on this island?
VANGER=>Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her. Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
BLOMKVIST=>Who doesn't he speak to?
VANGER=>You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm quickly losing track who's who.
VANGER=>Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies. Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother.
BLOMKVIST=>Who speaks to him?
VANGER=>I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you.
VANGER=>Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker.
BLOMKVIST=>I just met him.
VANGER=>He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
VANGER=>He lives over there.

YOUNGER VANGER=>No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there.
VANGER=>Please. I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell."
MORELL V/O=>We searched for days ...
MORELL V/O=>Eventually, much to his dismay - and mine - I had to talk to Henrik about calling it off -
MORELL V/O=>The fact that I never found a body didn't surprise me. You can't dig up an entire island. A77 OMIT: EXT. CABIN - LAKE SILJAN - ESTABLISHING A77
MORELL=>But I also couldn't find a motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business?
BLOMKVIST=>Business? She was sixteen.
MORELL=>And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.
BLOMKVIST=>She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them.
MORELL=>She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.
BLOMKVIST=>I have one.
MORELL=>So you know. Did you bring the last gift Henrik received?
BLOMKVIST=>It's at the National Forensic Lab.
MORELL=>I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA. He lights the pipe. Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.
BLOMKVIST=>I wanted to ask you about this.
MORELL=>She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it.
BLOMKVIST=>It's the last page I'm curious about.
MORELL=>As was I.
BLOMKVIST=>The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018
MORELL=>They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still.
BLOMKVIST=>I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry.
MORELL=>I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case.
MORELL=>Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh.
BLOMKVIST=>Was this also a missing girl case?
MORELL=>No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case. EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY

BJURMAN=>Here's the problem. There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.
SALANDER=>It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances.
BJURMAN=>But that's not clear to me.
SALANDER=>I'm not a child.
BJURMAN=>No. You're not. But you were. And between then and now - - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this - - not to mention how you're looking at me now - I can see you haven't. So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over. Starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.
BJURMAN=>If the numbers don't balance, I'll have to assume the difference is going to drugs.
SALANDER=>I've been on my own since I was twelve.
BJURMAN=>No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
BJURMAN=>Ms. Salander? Please look at me. Because this is important. She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.
BJURMAN=>This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here - - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined.

MARTIN=>We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
LIV=>That's one reason.
MARTIN=>Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company.
BLOMKVIST=>How so.
MARTIN=>We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.
BLOMKVIST=>You were here that day?
MARTIN=>Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train.
BLOMKVIST=>I know it well.
MARTIN=>It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse. Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
MARTIN=>This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book.
CECILIA=>Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia.
CECILIA=>We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.
BLOMKVIST=>It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company.
CECILIA=>Like I said.
BLOMKVIST=>It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
CECILIA=>Unlike the one that landed you in court.
BLOMKVIST=>Unlike that one. Correct.
CECILIA=>So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet.
BLOMKVIST=>I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.
CECILIA=>So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall.
BLOMKVIST=>Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?
CECILIA=>I'm sure Henrik has told you.
BLOMKVIST=>He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age.
CECILIA=>Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age.
CECILIA=>She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her.
BLOMKVIST=>I'd love to, where is she.
CECILIA=>If I had to guess - London.
BLOMKVIST=>You don't know where your own sister lives?
CECILIA=>I haven't seen her in years. We never really got along.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm getting used to that comment.
CECILIA=>That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.
BLOMKVIST=>People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
CECILIA=>Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit.
BLOMKVIST=>I'll try to track her down for you.
CECILIA=>Don't bother.
BLOMKVIST=>For myself then.
CECILIA=>If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off. INT. MACJESUS - DAY
TECH=>You backed up?
SALANDER=>Hard drives at home, yeah.
TECH=>That's good. This one's dead.
SECRETARY V/O=>I'm sorry, he's booked all day.
SALANDER=>It'll take five minutes. It's important.
SECRETARY V/O=>Hold, please. Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they always do. The secretary comes back on.
SECRETARY V/O=>Seven o'clock.
BJURMAN=>Have you ever had an STD? When's the last time you were tested for HIV? Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
BJURMAN=>How many partners have you had in the last month? How many were men? That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her.
BJURMAN=>I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health.
SALANDER=>Write down anything you want. Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again.
BJURMAN=>Why do you need such an expensive computer?
SALANDER=>For work.
BJURMAN=>Making coffee and sorting mail.
SALANDER=>I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before.
BJURMAN=>And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that? Shall we start with me? Shall we start now?
BJURMAN=>If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are.
BJURMAN=>You've done this before. You know what to do.
BJURMAN=>Do you want this computer or not?
BJURMAN=>You feel that? That's gaberdine. Unzip them. And ... And ... I like the reticence. I prefer a whore who pretends she isn't. It's almost convincing. He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him. INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him calmly writing a check.
BJURMAN=>Here you go. As promised.
BJURMAN=>I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date. Enjoy your computer games. She takes the check and leaves.
BLOMKVIST=>Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment.
ANITA=>It's fine. Please. Have a seat.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm Mikael.
ANITA=>Mikael. How do you do.
ANITA=>You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael?
BLOMKVIST=>I would if had any money to invest.
ANITA=>Excuse me?
BLOMKVIST=>I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come. EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAY
ANITA=>How is Henrik?
BLOMKVIST=>Good. Engaging. I like him.
ANITA=>I haven't seen him in over 30 years. Or my sister. Or anyone else in my family.
BLOMKVIST=>Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid.
ANITA=>I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question.
BLOMKVIST=>I can narrow it. I've gotten up to the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life.
ANITA=>Harriet. Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened.
BLOMKVIST=>Morell.
ANITA=>My recollections then were a lot better than they are now.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end.
ANITA=>She was messed up. Like all us Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine.
BLOMKVIST=>Was he abusive?
ANITA=>Mine?
BLOMKVIST=>Hers.
ANITA=>I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy.
BLOMKVIST=>She never confided in you what about, specifically?
ANITA=>There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it.
BLOMKVIST=>What do you think happened to her?
ANITA=>Everyone knows what.
BLOMKVIST=>But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who.
ANITA=>All I know is I always felt sorry for her. Even more than for myself. I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back. She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18. EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY
SALANDER=>Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth Salander. ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment. I had a lot of work ... no, nothing to be concerned about ... I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight? ... I don't need a pen, what's the address?
BJURMAN O/S=>Yes?
SALANDER=>It's me.
BJURMAN=>Come on in.
BJURMAN=>Like it?
SALANDER=>It's nice.
BJURMAN=>It's home. So, what do you need money for this time? Grand Theft Auto 5?
SALANDER=>Food. He smiles. Steps toward her. Lifts her chin.
BJURMAN=>How are you? Been thinking about last time? Decided you wanted to see me again?
SALANDER=>I just want my money.
BJURMAN=>Well, let's see if I can help you out with that.
SALANDER=>Wait.
BJURMAN=>Is there a problem?
SALANDER=>I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat?
BJURMAN=>It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out. He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness. 100A INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 100A
BJURMAN=>Please. I have neighbors.
BJURMAN=>What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
BJURMAN=>I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex?
HARRIET V/O=>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible ...
BJURMAN=>I'll drive you home.
SALANDER=>I can get home on my own.
BJURMAN=>Are you sure?
BJURMAN=>So, next Saturday, here?
ERIKA=>Is it any warmer inside?
BLOMKVIST=>No.
BLOMKVIST=>What have I missed besides you?
ERIKA=>The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers.
BLOMKVIST=>Seriously?
ERIKA=>Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat?
BLOMKVIST=>I'm not. I'm working.
ERIKA=>I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.
BLOMKVIST=>Would you like to meet him?
ERIKA=>Maybe in about an hour. If you're interested.
VANGER=>I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence.
ERIKA=>We'll work through them.
VANGER=>Are you sure?
MARTIN=>How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so?
ERIKA=>That sounds about right.
VANGER=>You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's.
MARTIN=>We still own one. The Courier, here in town.
VANGER=>I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else.
MARTIN=>So what do you say to taking on a partner?
ERIKA=>We've never considered it before. We value our independence.
MARTIN=>Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content.
BLOMKVIST=>Excuse me. Did I miss something?
VANGER=>We're talking about an investment in the magazine.
BLOMKVIST=>I gather. Why would you want to do that?
MARTIN=>Not for the return, that's for sure.
VANGER=>I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.
ERIKA=>And.
VANGER=>The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. Silence.
VANGER=>So what do you say?
VANGER=>Is that a maybe? She nods.
VANGER=>Wonderful! More wine, Anna.
VANGER=>I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way.
ERIKA=>Have you seen him try to make a fire?
VANGER=>Put the logs on end, like this.
BLOMKVIST=>How long have you been discussing this with them?
ERIKA=>I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday.
BLOMKVIST=>Why didn't you tell me?
ERIKA=>Why would I. You live in the woods.
BLOMKVIST=>So I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
ERIKA=>I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could.
BLOMKVIST=>I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea.
ERIKA=>You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three.
BLOMKVIST=>You don't know this family. They're crazy.
ERIKA=>We're not marrying into it.
BLOMKVIST=>We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing.
ERIKA=>You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing.
ERIKA O/S=>Mikael?
BLOMKVIST=>What.
ERIKA O/S=>I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning.
BLOMKVIST=>So?
ERIKA=>So are you coming to bed or not.
TATTOO ARTIST=>You thinking one arm or both?
SALANDER=>Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs.
TATTOO ARTIST=>It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
SALANDER=>How much do one of those cost?
ANNOUNCER=>Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last December when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom - INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY
ERIKA=>We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step.
ERIKA=>That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical. REPORTER 2 Where.
ERIKA=>I'm not sure, to be honest with you.
MARTIN=>Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us.
VANGER=>There's another reason. I don't like bullies. REPORTER 3 Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
VANGER=>I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back. REPORTER 3 You're enjoying this.
VANGER=>Already it's the most fun I've had in years.
WENNERSTROM ON TV=>I've always admired Henrik Vanger. He's a titan - and a gentleman. But he's also quite old now - which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar.
