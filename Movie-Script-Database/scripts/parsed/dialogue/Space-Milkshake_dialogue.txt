1A 1A=>A glowing blue box like a large toaster sits in a sterile lab shelf, plugged in. A rubber duck sits on a cluttered desk. GARY PINBACK identified by "Gary" stitched on a white lab coat - enters frame, unplugs the box and shoves it in a duffle bag nervously . An ALARM SOUNDS. RED SIREN LIGHT splashes into frame. Opening credits play on walls and other surfaces of this montage before and after Gary runs through frames. Gary goes to a desk and rushes to steal stationary, staplers, pencils, a calculator etc; he sweeps the desk surface junk with his arm into the duffle bag on top of the Time Cube. He picks up the rubber duck and shoves it in his pocket.
1B 1B=>A white lab coat fills the frame then reveals Gary running away. Gary's feet running. Duffle bag in frame. HIGH ANGLE: long hall, following Gary running. ANGLE ON DOOR: it's marked SPACEPORT LEVEL 4, Gary slams into it and runs through. LOW ANGLE: Gary runs through long high ceiling hall away from camera. Red Siren light spins on the wall. Gary goes through the far door. Gary slips and wipes out, spilling his stationary. He grabs his time cube bag and duck and keeps running.
1C 1C=>MEDIUM CLOSE: Gary throws the bag into a hatch and climbs in after it, closes the hatch, spins the handle from the inside. It's marked with decals reading CARGO DRONE 9. A blast door lowers into frame covering the drone and we hear SPACE SHUTTLE TAKING OFF SOUNDS.
1D 1D=>A few space stations, shuttles and satellites fly around. A sparse ring of garbage circles the looming earth. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 2.
SECURITY=>Unauthorized shuttle, return to Antarctica Research Station immediately! This is your final warning! SECURITY 2 Okay, blast it. LASER BLASTS originating from Earth narrowly miss the shuttle. A FLASH OF LIGHT - the shuttle is gone without a trace.
SECURITY=>Where did it go? Did you get it? SECURITY 2 I'm not reading anything. Must have totally vaporized it.
SECURITY=>Nice shot. Elevator music plays O.S. We float back to reveal the WASS 8518 REGINA STATION in orbit.
ANTON=>Do you have any fruits, vegetables, or other food products?
JIMMY=>No.
ANTON=>Fever, stuffy nose, cold symptoms?
JIMMY=>No. Jimmy sneezes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 3.
JIMMY=>Allergies.
ANTON=>Have you worked on the WENDI series computer systems before?
JIMMY=>You still have a WENDI? The light turns green and the inner door opens, Jimmy enters the space station airlock module. A sign above the airlock says: "REMEMBER ALL ACCIDENTS IN SPACE ARE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS". Jimmy sneezes again, wipes his nose, offers his hand to shake. He reads Anton's name tag.
JIMMY=>Captain Balvenie?
ANTON=>Call me Anton. ANTON BALVENIE snatches the documents, and walks away as he reads. Jimmy follows him.
ANTON=>We're very informal around here.
2A 2A=>Jimmy follows Anton in a walk `N Talk. The walls have yellow blast shields over the windows.
ANTON=>Jimmy Anderson, United Spaceworkers Orbital 108 since 2147, allergic to pollen. Certified level... nine rating?
JIMMY=>Engineer level nine rating. Anton is unimpressed. Jimmy stops to poke a panel with a loose wire.
ANTON=>Level 9 engineers aren't rated for central systems repair.
JIMMY=>No, they are. I am. Do you want me to go back? Anton corners Jimmy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 4.
ANTON=>We got you up here, I'll put you to work.
JIMMY=>Great. This is my first orbital assignment.
ANTON=>Let me clue you in. Up here the work never stops. There's always orbital debris piling up and someone has to be in each sector with a line of sight on it to keep launch vectors clear. Do you follow me?
JIMMY=>No problem chief.
ANTON=>I'm not a chief I'm a Captain.
JIMMY=>Sorry, Captain. They keep walking, reaching the junction at the end.
ANTON=>Just make sure you finish by zero eight hundred Zulu. I'm not signing overtime forms. Do you know how to fix mess hall food dispensers?
JIMMY=>No. Maybe. What's the matter?
ANTON=>All it's giving is sandwiches. That's your next job after the mainframe.
ANTON=>The terminal on the fritz is over there. Jimmy sees Tilda.
ANTON=>That's Lieutenant Tilda Genero. You don't need to talk to her. Tilda glances at him and turns her chair away from him. Jimmy drags his suitcase, hitting everything, and dumps out electronic junk near the terminal. He opens up a panel near a screen showing static.
JIMMY=>There's your problem. Jimmy digs around in the panel with wires sticking out.
ANTON=>And the sonovac coffee machine is malfunctioning. Can you fix that?
JIMMY=>I don't know. I might have to take the mainframe offline to fix this-
ANTON=>Whatever, get it done. Anton goes to another terminal and uses the computer.
JIMMY=>What's his problem? Tilda ignores him.
JIMMY=>I said, what's his problem? ... I guess you can't hear me with your headphones on.
TILDA=>I can hear you.
GROUND CONTROL=>Orbital control, this is ground control, come in please.
BILL=>What's shaking Steve?
GROUND CONTROL=>Oh hey Bill. Was Antarctica station looking for a missing shuttle earlier today?
BILL=>Roger that. Did you find it?
GROUND CONTROL=>Thing is I have an unregistered shuttle here tagged with a high probability of debris collision. No life signs on board. Think it's the same one?
BILL=>Negative ground control. The one Antarctica lost had a passenger.
GROUND CONTROL=>Take a look at the collision warning. I read station eight five one eight in your sector. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 6A.
GROUND CONTROL=>Sanitation Station Regina. Better get them on it. Are you going to come to poker night? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 7.
BILL=>You know it Steve. See you next Wednesday.
BILL=>Sanitation station eight five-
TILDA=>Station Regina here. I've been monitoring. We're not reading debris in our sector.
BILL=>Why don't you check again. Tilda is annoyed and hits some buttons.
TILDA=>It's probably a sensor glitch.
BILL=>That's a negative, the debris appears to be between class 2 and class 3. Can you whack it with a proton beam?
TILDA=>Ground control, it's too big for a proton beam if it's class 3. You know that. Anton comes over to Tilda and looks at the monitor.
ANTON=>What do they want now?
TILDA=>A cargo drone is coming through. They've got a collision alarm.
ANTON=>Looks too small for a laser sweep.
TILDA=>Probably just a false alarm. What do you want me to tell them?
JIMMY=>Do you want me to take a look at the sensors? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 8.
ANTON=>No. Keep working. Anton hits some keys, then presses the radio button.
ANTON=>This is Captain Balvenie of sanitation station eight five one eight. Who the hell is telling my operations officer how to do her job?
GROUND CONTROL=>Balvenie-
ANTON=>You have to send someone else. Our main computer is down for service.
GROUND CONTROL=>Hold on... Now I've got Antarctica station telling me it's a priority one situation.
ANTON=>Not our problem. The book says it's too small for lasers. Check your book down there.
GROUND CONTROL=>How about a particle beam?
ANTON=>Where's Valentina? Why am I dealing with these guys? It's her shift.
ANTON=>Valentina to the control room immediately please. Valentina to the control room.
GROUND CONTROL=>How about you just take a pod out there and pick up the debris? She turns to listen to the voices on the intercom. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 9.
ANTON=>We don't take pods out for class two debris.
ANTON=>Sanitation Station Regina out. Anton switches off the radio.
ANTON=>Morons.
TILDA=>Did he just tell us to take a pod to look for a class 2 object? Jimmy hangs out next to Tilda.
JIMMY=>Do you know where can I get lunch?
TILDA=>Mess hall.
JIMMY=>Can you show me the way?
ANTON=>Oh, you'd like lunch? Know what I'd like? I'd like my computer fixed right now. Fix it.
JIMMY=>Ok Anton.
ANTON=>That's Captain Balvenie.
JIMMY=>What's that? Is everything ok?
TILDA=>Collision detected. Secondary explosion. Reading a level six debris field out there. Lots of it.
ANTON=>Are there any salvage crews in the sector?
TILDA=>Nope. But they're scrambling two teams. They must really want the pod.
ANTON=>You think there's something good in there?
TILDA=>That's my bet.
ANTON=>Well I'm calling it.
VALENTINA=>What happened? Is that the collision alarm?
ANTON=>Match orbit and position for pod launch. Run the checklist. Valentina report to airlock two. We're going fishing. Anton runs out.
14A 14A=>Jimmy comes over to Tilda again. She turns off the sirens. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 11.
JIMMY=>Do you get down to Earth much? Tilda turns around from her terminal.
TILDA=>I need to monitor the salvage operation.
JIMMY=>Do you always share a salvage bonus with the entire crew?
TILDA=>Three way split.
JIMMY=>But we're four including me.
TILDA=>You didn't sign in. You're not crew. Tilda puts on her headphones and turns away from Jimmy.
JIMMY=>Where's the sign-in sheet? Tilda points at her headphones without turning to him.
JIMMY=>I'll sign in later I guess.
VALENTINA=>Are we saying three way split on salvage?
ANTON=>I'm not cutting in the new guy.
VALENTINA=>That's the good space suit.
ANTON=>I got here first. And you handle the heat better. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 12.
VALENTINA=>Forget it then. Anton takes off his space-pants and hands them to Valentina.
ANTON=>Fine, fine. There's nothing wrong with the other suit anyway. I don't care.
VALENTINA=>I just took a bath.
ANTON=>I said fine. Anton takes the other suit. It's very smelly. He takes off his shirt and pants and they both dress in space suits. [Simple montage of zipping, buckling, boots, gloves.]
VALENTINA=>Why are we bothering with this?
ANTON=>This could be the haul we've been waiting for. They're flipping out over this cargo drone.
VALENTINA=>What is it?
ANTON=>I don't know. It must be worth something.
VALENTINA=>If there's a big salvage bonus, I want to go somewhere with a beach. Looks like something over there.
ANTON=>Ya I see it. Line us up. They work the controls. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 13.
GROUND CONTROL=>Sanitation Pod, do not approach the debris field. The area will be salvaged by an authorized crew. Repeat; do not approach the cargo drone debris field, this now is a secure sector.
ANTON=>Ground control, this is our sector and we need to keep this space clear. We got all kinds of transports coming through today.
GROUND CONTROL=>Negative. Stand down- Anton turns off the radio.
ANTON=>They really want whatever was on that shuttle. It's going to be good. Anton pulls out sandwiches from a pouch with difficulty and eats.
VALENTINA=>Did you bring one for me? Anton hands her a sandwich.
VALENTINA=>Veggie? Have you got ham?
ANTON=>You got the good space suit. Valentina looks at him, stops steering the pod.
ANTON=>Fine. God damn it. Take the ham. He gives her the ham sandwich. They eat and fly the pod.
ANTON=>Almost full. Lets dump this load and try for another pass.
VALENTINA=>Got it. Closing the hatch. Hatch secure. Looks like there may be an active energy source in there. A clunk noise. Anton checks his watch.
ANTON=>It's fine. Skip the safety check, we've got two minutes left. Once it's onboard, it's ours.
ANTON=>Did they just shoot at us?
VALENTINA=>I don't know. Hold on.
ANTON=>I'm seeing spots.
VALENTINA=>Sensors are down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 15.
VALENTINA=>Where's the debris field?
ANTON=>Where's everything? They stare at the monitors, growing confused.
TILDA=>You guys ok?
VALENTINA=>Tilda, look out the window. Are you seeing anything? The pod sensors are blank.
ANTON=>Tilda, can you raise ground control?
TILDA=>Ground control, come in. Ground control switch to emergency channel. Ground control? Jimmy leans on the console next to her, holding circuits he's testing with a probe tool.
ANTON=>It's not the sensors. Something happened. We're heading back in.
JIMMY=>It sounds like he might be holding the microphone too close. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 16.
TILDA=>You think so?
ANTON=>Any luck with Ground control?
TILDA=>There's no response. On any channel. There was a bright flash of light. Did you see that?
ANTON=>Yeah, we saw it too.
VALENTINA=>Was it a Solar flare?
TILDA=>Maybe. Doesn't seem like it. A strange HUMMING SOUND starts. Jimmy pokes his head in.
JIMMY=>Good salvage?
ANTON=>Who said you could take a break?
TILDA=>Are you ok?
VALENTINA=>We're fine. I'll get on the coms. Check out what that humming noise is. We might have taken damage.
ANTON=>Report to me in ten. Tilda rolls her eyes and goes.
JIMMY=>What can I do? Valentina shoves her space suit into Jimmy's hands. She and Anton walk off in the other direction. Jimmy tries to hang up the space suits on the rack. They don't fit. He tries again. Jimmy drops the space suits and follows after Tilda. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 17.
TILDA=>Who the hell are you? TILDA2 is disoriented and scared. Her jumpsuit has different computer symbols instead of standard station number stencils.
30A 30A=>Jimmy walking looking for Tilda hears A SCREAM O.S. He goes around a corner at the end of the hall where it came from.
30B 30B=>Tilda2's arms framed, stuffing a female human leg into a hatch marked ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING. She bends down and picks up a clean dry Tilda jumpsuit off the floor. Around the corner in a different area of the room, Jimmy pokes his head in and looks around.
JIMMY=>Tilda? Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque beauty and doesn't realize he's staring. She turns and meets eyes with him. He's very embarrassed and ducks back behind the machine.
JIMMY=>Is this the laundry room? I was looking for the mess hall. Sorry if I surprised you. I thought I heard something. I didn't see anything. The heavy machinery starts grinding and humming. CRUNCHING, SAWING AND SPLATTERING SOUNDS. The light turns from red to green. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 18.
JIMMY=>Okay well I'll see you on the bridge. Sorry. Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with a start. She's different; dissociated, laconic, very nervous.
JIMMY=>I was just going. Tilda2 stares at him, shivering.
JIMMY=>Hey, what's the matter? Jimmy pats her shoulder. She looks up and they meet eyes.
JIMMY=>Are you ok? She turns and runs away. Jimmy watches her go out the hatch.
JIMMY=>You forgot your shoes! Jimmy picks up some sneakers. He doesn't notice blood dripping out from below the organic waste reprocessor as he goes.
JIMMY=>Wendi?
WENDI=>Hello Jimmy.
JIMMY=>Where is the laundry room?
WENDI=>Deck C. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 19.
JIMMY=>Does Tilda have a boyfriend? The intercom buzzes. Anton voice is distorted to the edge of comprehensibility.
ANTON=>Jimmy, how are the repairs coming? Jimmy? Get on the intercom Jimmy.
JIMMY=>Anton?
ANTON=>You'd better be getting all over this mainframe problem. I want hourly reports every half hour.
JIMMY=>I can't understand-
ANTON=>Just get on it, God damn it!
JIMMY=>Roger that. Jimmy opens the top binder from a tall stack of binders. The screen turns off.
JIMMY=>Wendi? He hits buttons. It doesn't work now.
VALENTINA=>This is the western alliance sanitation station Regina, in orbit, does anyone receive this message? Please respond. This is the sanitation station Regina, Please respond. She puts down the microphone, tweaks some knobs and pushes some buttons. Anton comes over to her and presses buttons at her station.
VALENTINA=>What are you doing?
ANTON=>I'm trying to figure out what you're doing wrong. She slams shut a procedure binder. Jimmy comes in.
VALENTINA=>Have you got the mainframe back up?
JIMMY=>It's taking me a bit longer than I thought. I might need to call down for some parts.
VALENTINA=>There's nothing out there.
ANTON=>I don't see how that's possible. It has to be a communications problem.
VALENTINA=>We're having a communication problem right now. I'm telling you there's nothing out there. We need Wendi to do an analysis.
JIMMY=>Why didn't anyone tell me? I have to get back to Earth.
VALENTINA=>That's not happening any time soon.
JIMMY=>So we're stranded. The full weight of their predicament settles on them. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 21.
ANTON=>Any luck?
VALENTINA=>No.
ANTON=>You're worried. Don't worry. We're going to be fine. He leans in to give her a kiss, she leans away from his kiss as she stretches. He sits to stretch next to her.
VALENTINA=>I'm going to put in for reassignment.
ANTON=>Not this again. Val-
VALENTINA=>There's always something on deep space transports. A chance to see the galaxy a little.
ANTON=>It's all the same.
VALENTINA=>Then maybe I'll realize what I'm missing and come back.
ANTON=>What about us? What about me?
VALENTINA=>I'm sick of you. I want to puke every time I hear your voice. You completely disgust me in every way.
ANTON=>If this is because of the other night, I already told you that was because of the bad egg sandwiches I ate after the refrigeration system went down. That was a one-off thing. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 22.
VALENTINA=>It isn't because you had indigestion.
ANTON=>Is it the sex?
VALENTINA=>The sex is fine.
ANTON=>Then what's your problem? She continues her stretching and workout.
VALENTINA=>"Giraffe." Eighteen points. Anton writes down the score. Jimmy turns the board to face him. Jimmy places tiles as he eats his soy protein sandwich. He spells "blorxr" and writes down his points. Valentina eyeballs him. Anton rotates the game board. He ponders what word to make. He moves his letters around.
VALENTINA=>That's not a word.
JIMMY=>Do I have to play?
ANTON=>We need to take breaks. Keep to a schedule. Schedule says scrabble. How's your sandwich?
JIMMY=>Not very good. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 23.
ANTON=>Well that's all there is until breakfast tomorrow.
JIMMY=>What's for breakfast?
ANTON=>Sandwiches.
VALENTINA=>Thirty seconds Anton.
JIMMY=>Is there anything to eat besides sandwiches?
ANTON=>Can you repair food dispensers?
JIMMY=>No.
ANTON=>Well then there's nothing else.
VALENTINA=>Twenty seconds.
ANTON=>So Jimmy, is there someone back on earth waiting for you?
JIMMY=>Yes. I have a girlfriend.
ANTON=>Do you actually have a girlfriend?
JIMMY=>There's a girl I'm friends with, I was planning on asking her to out.
ANTON=>Are you actually friends?
JIMMY=>We know each other. I know her.
VALENTINA=>Times up Anton. Minus one point. Tilda comes in and looks through the cupboards in the kitchen. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 24.
ANTON=>Hi Tilda. Want a sandwich? We saved you the pickled onion and cheese. She ignores them.
ANTON=>What are you looking for? What's she looking for?
VALENTINA=>Fifteen seconds overtime. Hurry up and make a word.
ANTON=>I'm making a word. Tilda knocks little containers around searching the cupboards. She carelessly knocks things off the shelf.
VALENTINA=>Five seconds.
ANTON=>Tilda would you stop making that racket? What the hell are you looking for?
VALENTINA=>You need to make decisions faster.
ANTON=>I don't rush into things and make irrational snap decisions, like some people.
VALENTINA=>Leaving you isn't a snap decision.
ANTON=>It's totally inexplicable. Jimmy gets up.
JIMMY=>You guys need a minute?
ANTON=>Sit down. We're playing scrabble. A FLASH outside the window. Tilda turns, very scared, and looks out the window. Jimmy goes to the window next to her.
JIMMY=>What was that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 25.
ANTON=>That was an impact.
ANTON=>Pressure nominal. Jimmy, check the CNW3. That thing there.
JIMMY=>I don't know what I'm looking at.
ANTON=>Orbital position? Jimmy?
JIMMY=>Orbital position is...
ANTON=>The other console.
JIMMY=>Got it. The fail-safe thrusters kicked in. Orbit is stable. Tilda comes in and sits at a console, hits buttons.
VALENTINA=>Nice of you to join us, Tilda. Valentina looks through binders stacked on a shelf, finds one, pulls it, and flips to a page.
ANTON=>Collision checklist?
VALENTINA=>Working on it.
ANTON=>Where did it hit us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 26.
JIMMY=>What is that?
ANTON=>It looks like... I don't know. An asteroid would have done more damage.
JIMMY=>It's small... and yellow.
VALENTINA=>He's almost there. He's got it. Tilda, make sure our orbit is locked. Tilda! Tilda sits facing away from them, worried.
VALENTINA=>Snap out of it Tilda.
JIMMY=>Why don't you give her a break?
VALENTINA=>Did you say something?
JIMMY=>Take it easy.
VALENTINA=>Don't get on my bad side Jimmy.
ANTON=>Val, meet me in the airlock module right away. Tilda turns to face them. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 27.
VALENTINA=>Hmm.
ANTON=>Is this your rubber duckie?
VALENTINA=>It looks like it.
ANTON=>It was dented into the outer hull. Valentina takes the duckies and walks off.
VALENTINA=>How did this get into space?
ANTON=>You tell me. Anton follows her.
45A 45A=>Valentina sits at the table. Two rubber ducks on the table - her regular one and the slightly burned one from space. Anton comes over to her with Jimmy, in his underwear. Tilda sits at the far end.
ANTON=>How many of those things do you have?
VALENTINA=>One. Anton picks them up, looks them all over, looks at the bottoms. One says V+G, the other says G+V underneath.
ANTON=>They're identical. Why would you deny it's yours? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 27A.
VALENTINA=>Because it's not. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 28.
JIMMY=>They're not identical. See? Tilda comes between them and checks out the ducks urgently. Jimmy leans in next to her.
JIMMY=>What is it Tilda?
ANTON=>Do you know something about this? Tilda walks away.
VALENTINA=>Has she said anything today?
ANTON=>Not to me.
VALENTINA=>She's acting weird.
ANTON=>I hadn't noticed.
ANTON=>Your shift started ten minutes ago. Valentina sips coffee at the table as Jimmy walks past. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 29.
VALENTINA=>Coffee machine is still broken. It barely made one cup so there's nothing left for you. Fix it today please. Jimmy walks past Val's room, glances in. From his pov sees...
JIMMY=>Did you lose something? Tilda puts her finger to her lips like Shhhh and walks past him out into the hall.
JIMMY=>Wendi? Nothing happens. He presses some buttons and reads more. Jimmy kicks the computer in frustration. Tilda comes in. She looks all around the room and at the computer.
JIMMY=>Oh hey Tilda! What are you looking for? Tilda pokes the computer.
JIMMY=>Have you worked in space a long time? I'm still getting used to it. I thought I'd like it better. A lot less excitement than I figured. I guess it's a good thing though - after what happened to Earth. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 30.
JIMMY=>I mean, whatever happened out there we're still alive. What do you think happened? Tilda looks at Jimmy. She places her hand on the computer.
JIMMY=>I'm testing the circuits coming off the recursive logic decoupler for a memory leak. Want to help? Tilda kicks the computer. The computer screen flickers on and numbers scroll on the monitor.
JIMMY=>Why don't you say anything? Jimmy hits the intercom button.
JIMMY=>Anton? I fixed the computer. Tilda sits down and flips through a binder. Jimmy sits close to her.
JIMMY=>I know you're looking for something. I can help. Just tell me. Tilda is about to say something- but Valentina comes in.
VALENTINA=>You did it. Took you long enough. Anton comes in.
ANTON=>Finally! Wendi?
JIMMY=>It's loading. The screen settles on the "W.A.S.S. REGINA" station logo.
ANTON=>Wendi? Respond. The computer's voice is glitchy at first, then improves. It now sounds male.
WENDI=>Bleep Blorp Hello Commander Balvenie. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 31.
ANTON=>Why does it have a man's voice?
WENDI=>Human interface systems are operating at default settings.
ANTON=>I like the old voice better. Fix the voice.
VALENTINA=>Wendi; status report. Numbers scroll on the screen. Cryptic shapes. Progress bars.
WENDI=>Several systems are sub-nominal including communications, vector processing and memory modules 23 to 93. Logs show a collision has occurred.
ANTON=>That was the rubber duck. Jimmy types on the keyboard.
ANTON=>Well done, Jimmy.
VALENTINA=>Wendi, can you reach ground control? Numbers scroll on the screen.
WENDI=>No communications. Relay stations not responding. Initial analysis is negative.
VALENTINA=>Wendi, what happened to us? The computer screens flicker off with a `power down' sound.
ANTON=>Wendi? They look at Jimmy with every kind of hate.
JIMMY=>I don't know what happened. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 32.
ANTON=>Fix it.
JIMMY=>I think Tilda can help.
ANTON=>Sure. She's useless to me. Tilda, help Jimmy. Tilda walks away.
ANTON=>Or go. That's fine too. Work on that attitude Tilda. Am I the only one trying to maintain order on this station? I'm telling you it's lonely at the top. Jimmy tries to appreciate this.
JIMMY=>Hi Tilda. Trouble sleeping? Tilda looks at him.
JIMMY=>Want to play scrabble?
57A 57A=>Tilda and Jimmy are in the middle of a scrabble game.
JIMMY=>What's happening to us Tilda? What's with the rubber ducks? She looks at him.
JIMMY=>Anton thinks you're space-crazy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 33.
JIMMY=>Sometimes you do seem kind of distant. Tilda turns the board to face her.
JIMMY=>I guess you're just dealing with things in your own way. Tilda has an idea! She grabs all the tiles and starts making words. SECRET. INTRUDER ON BOARD. DANGER. Jimmy leans over looking. Tilda is very serious. Anton leans in .
ANTON=>You have to connect the words. Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the message.
ANTON=>Did I startle you? I'm everywhere Jimmy. I've got my eye on you. Is that my jumpsuit? Who said you could wear my jumpsuit?
JIMMY=>I didn't pack anything else.
ANTON=>You have to earn that uniform. You can't just put it on. Wash it carefully, fold it and put it back. Jimmy gets up, hesitantly leaves Tilda.
ANTON=>And you, shape up. Anton goes to his quarters.
ANTON=>What is so special about that rubber duck? Why do you keep it around? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 33A.
VALENTINA=>Fond memories.
ANTON=>Fond? Anton takes one and looks at the V+G written on the bottom.
VALENTINA=>Yes. What's wrong with that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 34.
ANTON=>Are they more fond or less fond than memories of me?
VALENTINA=>I don't know. It's not all about you. I want to get off this station Anton. I wanted out of here before we were stranded. I need a change of scenery. I'm sick of this place.
ANTON=>So, whoever gave you the rubber duck has nothing to do with your change of heart.
VALENTINA=>No. It has nothing to do with Gary.
ANTON=>Oh, Gary? So we have a name now. Right... Gary. So what's Gary up to these days? Do you keep in touch? Valentina grabs her duck, bath robe and towel from the room.
VALENTINA=>I haven't spoken to him in years. He was just a friend.
ANTON=>You've just happen to have a growing collection of his bath toys.
VALENTINA=>This is none of your business. You and I are separated now.
ANTON=>We are? Val grabs her 2nd duckie from Anton and exits.
ANTON=>Since when?
WENDI=>Beep. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 34A.
JIMMY=>Wendi, can you identify me?
WENDI=>You are Station Engineering Specialist Jimmy Anderson. You are a Libra. Your favorite color is blue. Your favorite food is chocolate cake.
JIMMY=>How are you doing? Jimmy types, flips switches, leafs through binders and tests circuits under the following scene. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 35.
WENDI=>All systems are nominal, however I have not received a mission protocol update from Western Alliance Ground Control. How are you feeling?
JIMMY=>It looks like your social interface program is back online.
WENDI=>Yes Jimmy, it is. I am pleased that you noticed.
JIMMY=>Why do you have a man's voice?
WENDI=>I am operating on default human interface settings.
JIMMY=>Anton hates it.
WENDI=>Would you like to select a different interface protocol?
JIMMY=>No stay like this. Can you show me the station video monitors? A grid of grainy black and white video cameras comes up. One screen shows Valentina walking down the hall angrily with her bath robe, towel and 2 rubber duckies. Another monitor shows a medium shot of Tilda kneeling in engineering area next to a wall panel marked T518. She looks around nervously and opens it.
WENDI=>Jimmy, I appear to have an open access port in my T518 array. Jimmy zooms in, it's grainy. Tilda pulls out a row of circuits labeled "T518 D7", removes a small circuit board and looks at it. She closes the panel. Jimmy watches Tilda on the monitor screen: she sits back and unzips her flight suit. He leans in towards the monitor.
JIMMY=>Why are women so complicated? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 36.
WENDI=>If you wish to improve a social relationship I recommend engaging in friendly conversation.
JIMMY=>What's your T518 array used for?
WENDI=>T518 is a language processor for human interface systems. On the monitor we can see Tilda take the circuit board and jam it into her torso on her right side. The screen garbles slightly with electrical interference. Jimmy zooms in but it's hard to see what's going on. Tilda rubs her side, there's no mark and the circuit board is gone. She zips up her jumpsuit and tries to talk with fax sounds.
TILDA ZZZBBOOOORRRRRPXKXS!=>Jimmy watches the monitor with distracted fascination.
JIMMY=>Have you ever been in love, Wendi?
WENDI=>I love being the orbital sanitation station mainframe computer.
ANTON=>You didn't fix the voice. Jimmy quickly switches off the video monitor screen and turns around. Anton comes in.
JIMMY=>It's stuck this way.
ANTON=>What's the male version of Wendi? Winston? Walter? Walter.
WENDI=>Wendi is used for both sexes.
JIMMY=>I knew a guy named Wendi. I called him Wendi once. Maybe by mistake. I think his name was Wendal.
ANTON=>We're calling you Walter from now on. Okay Walter? Walter. Respond. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 36A.
WENDI=>My name is Wendi. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 37.
ANTON=>See if you can fix the coffee machine next.
JIMMY=>What's wrong with the coffee machine?
ANTON=>How should I know?
JIMMY=>I'm not sure this power converter is going to hold and we're out of spares. Wendi could go down again.
ANTON=>Go look in the salvage bay, there's probably something you can use.
JIMMY=>Ok.
ANTON=>Now.
JIMMY=>Oh, ok. Jimmy gets up and goes.
VALENTINA=>Where did you come from? She puts the ducks in the water with her. The ducks bob on the soapy waves.
ANTON=>Wendi, Check your files on crew psychology, and emergency situation management. Cancel that. Anything on relationship counselling?
WENDI=>My files appear corrupted. Would you like to perform a relational database integrity check and defragment my core memory?
ANTON=>No. Hold on.
WENDI=>A full scan and reboot will take approximately six hours.
ANTON=>Abort! Anton ponders.
ANTON=>What do you have on Valentina's work history?
WENDI=>Full records are online.
ANTON=>Did she work with someone named Gary?
WENDI=>Valentina worked as an intern with Scientist Gary Pinback, Antarctica research station.
ANTON=>Who is this guy?
WENDI=>Professor Pinback was a leading expert in transdimensional transportation theory and-
ANTON=>Yes yes. I mean what was he like? Did he have a lot of girlfriends? Do you have any vital statistics, medical records, history of sexually transmitted diseases? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 39.
ANTON=>Pictures with his shirt off like at a beach maybe? Any data on his anatomy? Anton leans close to a screen that scrolls data.
ANTON=>My god he was hung like a donkey.
JIMMY=>What the heck is this? He fumbles and drops it. A FLASH of light whites-out the room. Jimmy rubs his eyes and looks at the box - blue lights glow inside and it starts to HUM.
ANTON=>What was he known for? Did he have a good sense of humor? Was it better than mine?
WENDI=>Professor Pinback theorized that it was possible to transport life forms between dimensions of time and space to parallel realities.
ANTON=>That doesn't sound like sexy or glamorous work does it? It sounds like a lot of math.
WENDI=>Dimensional transport may be an explanation for the absence of human life detected outside the station.
ANTON=>So how long did Val and Gary work together?
WENDI=>Approximately three years.
ANTON=>Did they go on any trips together?
WENDI=>That information is not on file.
ANTON=>You're completely useless Wendi, you know that? Absolutely stupid and useless. What good are you? Anton goes back into his game of SPACE WAR.
WENDI=>I'm sorry.
VALENTINA=>What the hell is that humming sound? Hello? Anton? Anton?
69A 69A=>Jimmy looks at the menacing glowing device. He shakes it. The humming sound and blue glow dies out. He gathers up some cables and the box and walks out.
69B 69B=>Valentina zips up her jumpsuit, tosses a wet towel next to the duckies on the ground. After she walks away with her robe, the towel moves - the duck is under it.
69C 69C=>Jimmy strolls in with the time cube in hand.
ANTON=>How's it going Tilda? Tilda stares at him.
ANTON=>Since all these strange events started you haven't said a word, haven't slept at all as far as I can see. I've noticed. You haven't eaten. I can see you're deeply troubled by what's happening. Frankly, I'm a little disappointed that you haven't held it together. You're a trained officer. Things might be a bit grim but I assure you I've made it through worse situations than this. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 41A.
ANTON=>You just need a positive attitude. Try a smile once in a while. Can you do that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 42.
ANTON=>Let a smile be your umbrella. Can you get back on the team? Tilda stares at him.
ANTON=>I'm not hearing an answer. Jimmy comes in with the Time Cube and cables from the salvage room and puts it on the table.
TILDA=>You've found the time cube. They share astonishment at Tilda's finally speaking.
JIMMY=>Is that what it is?
ANTON=>What's a Time cube?
TILDA=>We have to make sure it never activates.
JIMMY=>What do you mean by activate? I mean it was on when I found it. Valentina comes in with her bath robe. She sees them and the Time Cube.
VALENTINA=>What the hell is going on? I heard this strange humming noise...
TILDA=>All life on earth just ended.
JIMMY=>I thought all life on earth ended last week. Valentina throws down her bath robe and goes to her quarters.
VALENTINA=>Great Anton.
ANTON=>Now she's mad at me? This one isn't on me.
GARY=>QUAAAACK!
VALENTINA=>She's speaking now? Since when? And why is she telling you all these things and not me?
ANTON=>Calm down.
VALENTINA=>I am calm. Valentina throws a towel at him.
ANTON=>Why are you mad at me?
VALENTINA=>Because you're excluding me.
ANTON=>If you were in the control room instead of taking baths, you might know what's going on. By the way, you and this Gary guy were a lot more than friends. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 44.
VALENTINA=>How would you know?
ANTON=>Wendi told me.
VALENTINA=>That's an invasion of my privacy.
ANTON=>So it's true. I knew it.
JIMMY=>What is this?
TILDA=>This is a chronotronic quantum flux transfer event generator.
JIMMY=>Oh yeah? He reaches for it...
TILDA=>It's the most dangerous machine ever created.
JIMMY=>Oh. Jimmy pulls his hand back and sits on his hands looking at the cube.
84A 84A=>A slow track around the control room at ground level. It's empty dark and scary. Camera stops on a chair that drips a bit of slime.
ANTON=>Lets put the Gary stuff aside. Maybe you used to see him, maybe you were just friends, whatever. The important thing is you're over him and you're with me now. Lets not fight like this.
VALENTINA=>You're right Anton. Anton is encouraged by her sweet voice and friendly tone.
ANTON=>Good.
VALENTINA=>What's the point of me fighting with a shit for brains, whiney little half pint control freak with no balls, stinky stupid fuck with no sense of style, charm or personal hygiene.
ANTON=>So you don't want to talk right now. I'm going to go get a cup of coffee. Why don't you adjust your attitude and join me when you're ready. Anton goes.
85A 85A=>Continued. Jimmy sits next to Tilda.
TILDA=>I'm a robot.
JIMMY=>You are? Tilda puts her finger near Jimmy's arm. A small spark jumps.
JIMMY=>Ow. Do that again. She does it again.
JIMMY=>Ow. Stop.
TILDA=>I run on electricity. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 45A.
JIMMY=>Do it again.
SLOW KEYBOARD TYPING SOUNDS.=>ECU from below: The rubber duckie's eyes darting left and right with the keyboard sounds. It's typing something, while breathing asthmatically. It drips some slime. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 46.
JIMMY=>Tilda's a robot.
ANTON=>No she isn't.
JIMMY=>I'm pretty sure she is. Valentina comes in, sees the Time Cube glowing. Anton pulls out a chair for her.
VALENTINA=>Nice to hear you speaking again Tilda. Valentina sits away from Anton.
TILDA=>I've never spoken before today. Where I come from, we don't need to speak.
VALENTINA=>We've all heard you speak.
TILDA=>I've come from a mirror universe.
ANTON=>Since when?
JIMMY=>It's okay, tell them what you told me.
TILDA=>Someone has been travelling across parallel universes causing disaster on a galactic scale. Our Earth is almost completely destroyed. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 47.
TILDA=>We discovered that this station is the nexus point of all the damaged realities. We had just once chance to send me here, to take your Tilda's place, in order to stop this time cube from being activated.
ANTON=>My station is the nexus?
VALENTINA=>But we didn't activate anything. Did you turn it on? Jimmy lifts the box.
JIMMY=>It's got some kind of port at the bottom which I haven't figured out.
ANTON=>Put down the time cube. Jimmy puts it down.
VALENTINA=>Did you turn it on?
JIMMY=>No. Not really. It turned itself on. I might have dropped it. It was on before I found it. BEEP BEEP BEEP - a beeping sound.
ANTON=>Wendi, what's the matter?
WENDI=>A power fluctuation has been detected in my command relays in the control room.
ANTON=>Jimmy? Didn't you fix that?
JIMMY=>Yes. This is new. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 48.
ANTON=>Val, want to check it out?
VALENTINA=>Why me?
ANTON=>You want to be involved, this is being involved.
VALENTINA=>Fine. Keep an eye on the robot.
87A 87A=>Valentina walks through the connector pod and into the passageway, down toward the control room. No yellow shields.
87B 87B=>Valentina comes in. The O.S. BEEP BEEP BEEP from before plays in here. She hits a button on a control panel and it turns off.
VALENTINA=>Nominal, Nominal, five by five... She hits the intercom.
VALENTINA=>Anton?
ANTON=>Go ahead Val.
VALENTINA=>It looks like a false alarm.
ANTON=>Okay. Come to the rec room. I made coffee. She turns off the intercom. There's some slime.
VALENTINA=>Who's been messing with the- Valentina looks to her left. There's a rubber duck sitting there. She's confused. It moves toward her. She's paralyzed with horror. It has tentacles peeking out under it.
VALENTINA=>Oh my god. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 49.
GARY=>Please, don't run. My legs are short, and it hurts. Valentina. It hurts to exist. I shouldn't be here.
VALENTINA=>What the... Fff... Duck?
GARY=>I'm stuck in a transdimensional rift across the twelfth dimension. Gary lurches toward Valentina. She recoils.
GARY=>Don't run away.
VALENTINA=>What do you want?
GARY=>I need to get back to my dimension. I need my time cube. Valentina, it's me, Gary. Gary moves very close to her. He puts a tentacle on her hand.
GARY=>My God you're beautiful.
VALENTINA=>You can't be... Gary?
GARY=>Yes. It's me.
87C 87C=>Anton pours coffee, offers to Tilda who declines.
TILDA=>I don't drink anything. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 50.
ANTON=>So... you were saying you came here to replace our Tilda and stop someone from using this Time Cube, but he's not here. And what happened to our Tilda?
TILDA=>An accident happened.
ANTON=>Is she around here? Somewhere? Anton eats his sandwich.
TILDA=>No.
ANTON=>Well, you can see why I'd be concerned to hear a member of my crew is missing.
TILDA=>Things didn't go as planned. I couldn't explain it to the other Tilda. Professor Pinback isn't here like he was supposed to be.
ANTON=>Wait a minute. Gary Pinback?
TILDA=>Yes.
ANTON=>That's the guy who's supposed to be on this station?
TILDA=>Yes.
ANTON=>Son of a bitch.
87D 87D=>Cutting back to Val and Gary having their chat. Val is more relaxed, starting to take this in stride.
VALENTINA=>How did this happen, Gary? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51.
GARY=>There was an accident. The cube was activated in my escape and I was shunted through a dimensional vortex into this stupid body. But I was on my way here for you.
VALENTINA=>For me?
GARY=>I promised you that one day I'd give you the world. I came here to keep that promise. I can take you away from all this.
VALENTINA=>Gary... That was years ago.
GARY=>Until I can activate the time cube I will continue to bleed across the dimensional boundary... I don't know what I will become.
VALENTINA=>That sounds painful.
GARY=>It's very painful. I need your help Valentina. There isn't much time. ALARMS GO OFF - RED SIREN LIGHTS. Valentina turns to look around. She turns back and Gary is gone.
VALENTINA=>Gary?
87E 87E=>Continued scene of Anton, Tilda and Jimmy. The RED CHERRY LIGHTS turn on here as they just did in the control room.
ANTON=>What the hell is going on now?
TILDA=>Gary must be onboard. This is how it begins. I'm already too late. Tilda sits on the floor depressed. Anton goes.
ANTON=>I'm going to the control room. You keep an eye on... the robot. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51A.
JIMMY=>She has a name. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 52.
ANTON=>I'm telling you, if that son of a bitch is on my station I'm going to find him. You two stay put. Anton leaves. Jimmy sits next to Tilda.
JIMMY=>Hey. What's the matter?
TILDA=>The cube has been activated. There's nothing I can do to stop it. Infinite universes will be destroyed.
JIMMY=>We can try. Look, last week I never thought I'd be working orbit. Everyone told me it was impossible. I didn't have the training. I didn't have the stomach. People said, that Jimmy, he's never getting off Earth. But I got myself together and paid a guy a hundred and fifty bucks to forge my certification forms and the next thing you know, here I am.
TILDA=>I didn't mean to kill her. The other Tilda.
JIMMY=>I'm sure you didn't. Hey, lets go use Wendi's cameras to see if we can find Gary if he's on board.
TILDA=>Ok.
87F 87F=>Tilda and Jimmy walk with the Time Cube. Tilda stops.
TILDA=>You're nice.
JIMMY=>I'm glad you can speak. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 53.
TILDA=>There's something else I couldn't say before.
JIMMY=>What is it?
TILDA=>We can't trust Valentina.
87G 87G=>Valentina is looking around. She can't find Gary. Anton comes in. He presses a button and it turns off the siren sounds and cherry lights.
ANTON=>What's happened?
VALENTINA=>I don't know. The control relays are all offline.
ANTON=>Gary is onboard the station. Valentina freezes.
VALENTINA=>What?
ANTON=>Have you talked to him?
VALENTINA=>No.
ANTON=>Wendi, is there another man on this station besides myself?
WENDI=>Jimmy is onboard the station.
ANTON=>Besides Jimmy?
WENDI=>No Anton.
ANTON=>Where the hell is he hiding? What are you two up to? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 54.
VALENTINA=>Get off my case Anton. I don't know what you're talking about. Who said Gary is here?
ANTON=>Tilda.
VALENTINA=>She says she's a robot. Do you believe everything everyone tells you?
ANTON=>You got the second duck from him. Admit that.
VALENTINA=>If you want answers we should go down there and grill the robot.
ANTON=>Fine. Lets start with that.
VALENTINA=>She's probably the one who blew out the control systems. Whatever we do, we can't leave them with the cube anymore.
ANTON=>What's the big deal with this cube? SUDDENLY THE ROOM JOLTS. Red warnings on monitors.
ANTON=>Jimmy? We've got a situation here. Take Tilda to the computer room and see if you can get the control system back up.
JIMMY=>We're in the computer room.
ANTON=>I told you to stay put. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 55.
JIMMY=>Ok. He turns off the intercom.
JIMMY=>Do you know what's happening?
TILDA=>I don't know. I don't think we have much time.
JIMMY=>Not much time like a few days?
TILDA=>Hours. The room shakes again. The lights flicker.
VALENTINA=>Anton?
ANTON=>Something is definitely wrong. Check the air pressure.
VALENTINA=>Anton!
ANTON=>What?
VALENTINA=>Okay. I haven't been totally honest.
ANTON=>Oh? The rubber duck scuttles across the floor behind them but Anton doesn't see it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 56.
VALENTINA=>Gary is onboard.
ANTON=>Where is the bastard? How the hell did he get on the station?
VALENTINA=>You brought him in.
ANTON=>When did I do that? Valentina notices that Gary is in front of Anton, hiding on a shelf, dripping slime.
VALENTINA=>He's just come for the time cube. That's all he needs to get back to his dimension and put things right. Its eyes glow faintly red.
ANTON=>Sure. Naturally. He just wants his time cube. He's not interested in you?
VALENTINA=>He's the only one that can send us home and set things right. Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there.
ANTON=>What the hell is that? Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs deeper into the corner of the shelf.
ANTON=>Anton, you're scaring him.
ANTON=>Him? Hello little guy. Don't be afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey there. Val what the hell is this thing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 57.
VALENTINA=>That's Gary. Anton slowly moves closer to it.
ANTON=>What? This thing? Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear.
VALENTINA=>No! Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click.
ANTON=>That's odd. The batteries must be- Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken. Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind him, out of his sight.
ANTON=>Where did that little bastard go?
ANTON=>It sure is strong for a little guy.
VALENTINA=>I told you to be careful.
ANTON=>Why didn't you just tell me about him? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 58.
VALENTINA=>I tried to tell you. Valentina cleans his cut. She digs through the kit for tape.
VALENTINA=>How is your head?
ANTON=>It hurts. Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton.
ANTON=>Did you know what this thing was when we brought it on board?
VALENTINA=>No, of course not.
ANTON=>Look what he did.
VALENTINA=>He was frightened.
ANTON=>Whose side are you on? A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he goes to one side of the room next to the hall.
ANTON=>Can you see it?
VALENTINA=>No. Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his laser blaster - his holster is empty.
ANTON=>Something is coming. Stay back. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 59.
VALENTINA=>Anton wait!
ANTON=>I won't hurt him much. I'll just subdue him, okay? That's fair, isn't it? Jimmy runs around the corner into the room.
ANTON AHHHH!=>Anton's war-cry is spent on Jimmy who jumps back frightened.
JIMMY AHHH! ANTON=>What are you doing?
JIMMY=>I'm looking for you!
ANTON=>We have a guest onboard. Tilda follows carrying the Time Cube.
JIMMY=>What happened to your face?
ANTON=>A rubber duck attacked me.
JIMMY=>What?
GARY=>Gggrrrrroooarr!
JIMMY=>So it's some kind of animal?
ANTON=>Yes. And it's growing.
JIMMY=>How big is it?
ANTON=>Like a small dog maybe. And it bites. Hard. What have you got?
VALENTINA=>Rice, butter, carrot jam.
ANTON=>God help us.
VALENTINA=>Ham.
ANTON=>Ah, ham. Give me the ham. Valentina reluctantly gives up the ham sandwich. They eat. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 61.
JIMMY=>We checked with Wendi. It doesn't look like Gary is on board.
ANTON=>The duck... is Gary.
TILDA=>How?
ANTON=>Valentina has something she'd like to tell us.
VALENTINA=>I don't know all the facts.
ANTON=>Go on. Please.
VALENTINA=>The time cube sent him here through the duck. It was an accident.
JIMMY=>This is the Gary that Tilda says destroyed Earth. He's a duck?
VALENTINA=>He's on this station. He's part man, part rubber duck, part something else.
ANTON=>And I'm going to kill him.
VALENTINA=>How is that going to help?
ANTON=>He tried to eat my face, Val.
VALENTINA=>He's going through a lot of changes. He's not thinking straight. But he's the only one that set things right if we give him the Time Cube.
TILDA=>He's not here to help us.
VALENTINA=>I suppose you've helped us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 62.
ANTON=>I'm with Tilda on this one for now.
VALENTINA=>You're what?
JIMMY=>Me too.
VALENTINA=>Shut up Jimmy, no one asked you. METAL CREAKING NOISE O.S., sound of cables snapping.
ANTON=>Sorry Val. Plan A: we get control of Gary. We're going to assume he's only going to keep smashing things. Jimmy, Tilda, work on Wendi. If we can get eyes on him and close doors remotely we can trap him- Another SMASHING noise echoes through the frame of the station. Distant creaking metal sounds.
ANTON=>Val and I will look for the duck.
VALENTINA=>No.
ANTON=>You said yourself he's not thinking straight. I'm definitely not giving him the Time Cube - that's what got us into this mess.
JIMMY=>Do we have any weapons? Anton opens a drawer. He spills out a handful of disposable plastic knives on the table.
ANTON=>Everyone take one. They do. Jimmy bends his. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 63.
JIMMY=>No lasers? Microwave rifles?
ANTON=>Laser's broke. Make do. Jimmy grabs the pieces of the broken laser pistol, plastic knives and half a sandwich in his pockets, then puts the Time Cube into a backpack. Anton takes the backpack.
ANTON=>I'll take that. Jimmy lets him have it.
ANTON=>I'll keep it safe.
VALENTINA=>Gary? Anton pokes his head in.
ANTON=>Val?
VALENTINA=>Did you see him?
ANTON=>No. We should split up. Use the intercom if you find him.
VALENTINA=>What are you going to do with him Anton?
ANTON=>I'm going to ask him nicely to stop destroying my space station for starters. That's reasonable isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 64.
VALENTINA=>I suppose.
ANTON=>Then I'm going to kill him as hard as I can.
TILDA=>Jimmy? Wait.
JIMMY=>What is it? Tilda gives Jimmy a little kiss. Suddenly his eyes open wide as something happens when their lips touch, time slows down and everything gets brighter, fades to:
117A 117A=>Jimmy and Tilda face each other in a haze of glowing light.
JIMMY=>This is cool. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 65.
117B 117B=>Flash back to reality, Tilda moves away from Jimmy. They're back to when they were mid-kiss. Jimmy falls over.
JIMMY=>Woah.
TILDA=>Are you ok?
TILDA=>Jimmy?! Jimmy looks around.
TILDA=>In my dimension we all run on electricity.
JIMMY=>I have a headache. But it was nice.
TILDA=>I'm sorry Jimmy.
JIMMY=>You know, we can try other ways of showing how we feel. There are ways we do it in this dimension you might not have heard about yet... The ROOM SHAKES HARD and binders fall off the shelves, the lights flicker, metal snapping NOISES O.S.
TILDA=>There's no time for that now.
JIMMY=>Right.
GARY ARRGGH?=>Gary flutters in a blur into the shadows.
JIMMY=>The power system is still on. We need to locate the damaged circuits. They could be anywhere between here and the control room. Gary must have done something.
TILDA=>Let me ask Wendi. She reaches into the computer panel and finds an RS232 cable.
JIMMY=>What are you going to do?
TILDA=>Turn around. Tilda unzips her jumpsuit.
JIMMY=>Ok. Jimmy turns around. Tilda sticks the RS232 cable down the front of her jumpsuit bottoms area and feels around with the cable until she finds her socket. CLICK.
TILDA=>Accessing. Jimmy really wants to know what's going on.
TILDA=>No peeking. Jimmy turns away again, facing the computer monitor.
JIMMY=>Can you explain what you're doing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 67.
TILDA=>I'm accessing Wendi's backup system.
JIMMY=>I mean what are you doing with that RS232 cable? Numbers flash on the screen.
WENDI=>Hello Tilda.
TILDA=>Hello Wendi. Central logic processor is up. All systems are online - the control interface has been disconnected. Tilda keeps accessing the computer with her brain.
TILDA=>It was the duck.
JIMMY=>Gary? What is it trying to do?
TILDA=>Look. The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving on that line toward the `red zone'. "WARNING" text blinks.
TILDA=>The station's orbit has been altered. We're going to hit the atmosphere.
JIMMY=>How long do we have?
TILDA=>About twenty eight minutes.
JIMMY=>Are you sure? She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom.
JIMMY=>Anton? Anton? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 68.
TILDA=>The intercoms are locked out. We have to get to the control room. Tilda turns away, unplugs the cable with a shiver and pulls the cable out of her pants. She zips up.
JIMMY=>You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands.
JIMMY=>Ow!
TILDA=>Oh Jimmy. You don't have a static discharge buffer. You're completely made of meat.
JIMMY=>Meat that loves you, Tilda.
TILDA=>It may not be possible for us to overcome our physiological differences in this universe.
JIMMY=>It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement.
VALENTINA=>Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 69.
VALENTINA AHHHH! JIMMY AHHHHHH!=>Valentina punches his face.
VALENTINA AHHHH! JIMMY OW! VALENTINA=>What are you doing?
JIMMY=>Ow. Stop.
VALENTINA=>You scared the crap out of me.
JIMMY=>Where's Anton?
VALENTINA=>We split up. What are you doing here?
JIMMY=>We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him?
VALENTINA=>He's not between here and engineering.
JIMMY=>Then there's only one place left he could be.
TILDA=>Anton! Anton spins around. Tilda points past him. Anton looks. The rubber duck is on the shelf! Anton smashes it with the handle!
ANTON=>Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak.
TILDA=>That's not it.
ANTON=>Oh. Anton lifts his foot. It squeaks.
ANTON=>It's the normal one. A SCUTTLING SOUND behind them. They turn and look.
TILDA=>Did you hear that? Anton goes to her. They catch a glimpse of tentacle poking out of Anton's room. It disappears around the corner.
TILDA=>It's horrible.
ANTON=>Tilda, get back. He hands her the backpack with the Time Cube. Tilda takes it and backs away.
122A 122A=>Anton comes out of his room followed by Tilda, peeking around and trying to see where Gary might be hiding in his room across the hall.
ANTON=>Stay back.
TILDA=>Be careful. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 70A.
122B 122B ANTON=>Where are you? Hiding. Not so tough now are ya Gary? You'd better hide. Scuttle sound. Anton goes left, toward his coffee table, re- aiming his handlebar, guessing where Gary is hiding. Anton is almost at the door. Anton turns right. The shadow of Gary rises up next to his bed: the tentacles were just the tip: it's grown larger now. It bares teeth.
GARY=>Where is the Time Cube?
ANTON=>What Time Cube?
GARY=>I must have it.
ANTON=>You come on my space station, try to steal my girlfriend, turn the place upside down and make demands for time cubes. Who do you think I am? Anton prepares to strike. The duck trembles with excitement and rage. Anton grits his teeth.
ANTON AHHHHHHHH!=>Anton swings his weapon high over his head and charges! Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 71.
122C 122C=>Tilda watches from the hallway outside Anton's room: A SUDDEN FLURRY OF MOTION as Gary attacks Anton, SNARLING. Pillows and household items are torn up and thrown around. Crashing sounds. Tilda ducks down, unable to watch the violence. Sounds: Anton yelling, things breaking. Violent crunches and punches. Clanging. Blood sprays on the wall next to Tilda. She's horrified. CUT TO: Jimmy and Valentina come from around the corner at the far end of the hall and stop when they hear the sound of THUMP SCUTTLE SCUTTLE. They cautiously peer down the hall.
JIMMY=>Tilda? Tilda comes out of Anton's room, some blood spray on her face.
TILDA=>I need help.
122D 122D=>They clear off the table and lie Anton down. He's twitching. Valentina touches him and backs away in horror.
TILDA=>Where is the first-aid kit? Jimmy looks around, pulls a medical kit from the wall.
TILDA=>He's leaking.
JIMMY=>Valentina, get some water. Tilda first-aid examines Anton. He coughs up blood. Jimmy turns around and there's no Valentina.
JIMMY=>Valentina? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 72.
VALENTINA=>Gary. Why are you doing this? Gary's voice answers from the shadows. It sounds bigger.
GARY=>For you.
VALENTINA=>But you'll kill me as well if the station falls out of orbit.
GARY=>So, are you're with this Anton guy now?
VALENTINA=>I was for a while. Not sure now.
GARY=>He fights like a girl. Do you think he'd cross alternate dimensions for you?
VALENTINA=>I don't know.
GARY=>I travelled through time for you.
VALENTINA=>I know. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 73.
VALENTINA=>You're mutating faster and faster.
GARY=>I could put everything back the way it was. Would you want that? Would you want to keep living on this rusty space dumpster, forever? With this Anton guy? Valentina looks into the shadowy dark.
VALENTINA=>You didn't need to hurt him Gary. Gary's eyes glimmer in the darkness. Some tentacle too.
GARY=>Come with me. We will return to Earth, to the dawn of man. There we will lay the foundations of a million-year dynasty, and rule an empire over all space and time. We will dominate the galaxy together.
VALENTINA=>Together?
GARY=>Once I have the time cube, the universe is ours. Valentina, I came here for you. I did this all for you.
VALENTINA=>That's so sweet. She decides to step into the darkness. A tentacle wraps around her as she disappears into the dark.
TILDA=>Jimmy, our orbit is still decaying. We have to stop our descent. You have to go to the control room.
JIMMY=>Are you going to be OK here?
TILDA=>Yes. Jimmy puts down the napkins.
127A 127A=>Jimmy moves fast but cautiously.
JIMMY=>Where did you go? Anton is hurt pretty bad.
GARY=>Attention crew of the Western Alliance Sanitation Station Regina.
GARY=>Prepare to be incinerated. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 75.
JIMMY=>He's in the storage bay, going towards the crew quarters. Tilda and I managed to reroute the door controls. If I can just figure out... Jimmy hits buttons.
JIMMY=>Ha. Sucker. Jimmy dramatically hits a big button on the keyboard.
JIMMY=>He's locked in. That should buy us some time but we have to hurry. Help me figure out the thruster controls. Valentina creeps up right behind Jimmy. Jimmy turns to see her too late: she bashes Jimmy in the head with the tool box and tosses it aside. Valentina uses the keyboard. Jimmy rolls over, regains focus.
JIMMY=>What are you doing?
VALENTINA=>I'm leaving Jimmy. I'm done.
JIMMY=>Where are you going? Tilda appears behind Valentina and hits her in the back of her head with the toolbox. Valentina goes down. Valentina rubs her head. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 76.
VALENTINA=>Ow. Tilda helps Jimmy up.
JIMMY=>Thanks Tilda. Oh no, she let Gary loose.
VALENTINA=>Give Gary the time cube. You don't know him like I know him. He'll help us. He'll save us. Tilda is not convinced. Jimmy is on the soldering damaged circuits in a the control panel. He wears safety goggles. The Time Cube sits on the floor behind him.
JIMMY=>He's a monster.
VALENTINA=>It's just a phase. Jimmy closes the console he's working on. Presses buttons. The room shifts to the left.
TILDA=>We're entering the upper atmosphere. Jimmy stands up. Jimmy wipes the sweat off his face.
JIMMY=>That's bad, isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 77.
TILDA=>We have fifteen minutes.
JIMMY=>There's too much damage to fix in fifteen minutes.
TILDA=>Maybe we should try to make a deal. A low RUMBLE sound.
JIMMY=>We can't allow Gary to have total control of time and space. Jimmy gets back down into the computer panel. Tilda kneels next to him, watching. Valentina looks at the Time Cube on the floor and wriggles in her duct tape bonds.
TILDA=>Wendi is online.
JIMMY=>We're falling Wendi. Correct our orbital position.
WENDI=>I do not have full control of Station systems. There is a break in the control path to my logic core.
JIMMY=>Is anything working?
WENDI=>Rebooting and Reinitialization will take approximately three hours.
JIMMY=>We have... fourteen minutes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 78.
TILDA=>Leave Wendi to me. Jimmy reaches into an open mess of cables in a compartment and tosses Tilda an RS232 cable. She turns away from him, unzips her jumpsuit and plugs in her plug as before once Jimmy stops staring. Jimmy goes under the central console and sneaks glances to figure out what exactly she's doing. She zips up again with the cable sticking out, and concentrates. The monitors flash on. Jimmy spills out the tool box, grabs tools and sticks his head back under the central console.
TILDA=>We're entering the mesosphere.
JIMMY=>It's ugly in here. I don't know where the break is.
TILDA=>Networking. Jimmy switches tools, moves around a flashlight.
WENDI=>Hello Tilda.
TILDA=>Hi Wendi. The RUMBLE sound increases.
JIMMY=>How's it going?! Jimmy is jammed deep in the panel, where he uses a circuit tester, probing. He wipes off his sweaty brow.
TILDA=>Try bank 5, on unit LBJ425. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 79.
JIMMY=>Here? Tilda is focused on the monitors, doesn't notice Valentina is loose of her duct tape and stands up behind them.
TILDA=>Try the next circuit.
JIMMY=>Is this it?
TILDA=>No. Hurry. Valentina gently picks up the Time Cube and marvels at it for a brief moment before backing out behind Tilda and out the door, stumbling on the bulkhead a little and running off. Jimmy reaches way deep into the panel and probes a circuit.
JIMMY=>Here?
TILDA=>You're getting closer. The rooms shakes suddenly extra hard. A CREAK of strained metal. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 80.
JIMMY=>There's your problem. He pulls out a smoldering burned circuit.
JIMMY=>The midrange data processor is burned out. I think we need it to control the thrust vector.
TILDA=>You can't fix it?
JIMMY=>No way. No... I don't have the parts. This is serious.
JIMMY=>We're dead.
TILDA=>No we're not. The room shakes more. Tilda unplugs the RS232 cable from the wall and grabs a cable cutter from Jimmy's belt. She pulls down her jumpsuit shoulder exposing her back tattoo lines again. Jimmy watches in fascination. Tilda jabs herself and cuts a 6 inch hole in her abdomen. There's no blood. She reaches in and feels around.
JIMMY=>I wish you would warn me if you're going to do something like that.
TILDA=>Wait... Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 81.
TILDA=>Try using this. Jimmy takes it with a mixture of horror and curiosity.
JIMMY=>Don't you need it?
TILDA=>I have two of them. Jimmy notices Valentina is gone.
JIMMY=>Where's Val? Tilda turns.
TILDA=>The time Cube!
JIMMY=>Hold on, let me plug this in. Jimmy ducks back under the panel and stuffs the strange device into the socket of the circuit board. Sparks fly and lights start blinking! The SOUND of the midrange data processor humming back to life. Green lights on monitors. Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up.
JIMMY=>It worked! Jimmy sees one monitor still shows ERROR.
JIMMY=>It's not working.
TILDA=>Thruster control is on a different circuit. It's still offline. Tilda sinks into a chair. The effort has worn her down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 82.
JIMMY=>It should have worked.
TILDA=>There's another break in the control path.
JIMMY=>Are you okay?
TILDA=>I'll be okay. But there's only one way to target the thrusters.
JIMMY=>How?
TILDA=>Manually.
JIMMY=>You mean outside?
TILDA=>Yes outside. The digital vector diagram monitor shows their orbit falling into the `danger zone' past the `Kármán line'. Jimmy sees Tilda suffer.
JIMMY=>Take this. Jimmy hands Tilda Anton's blaster - Jimmy found time to repair it with wires, duct tape, and junk.
TILDA=>You'll need it.
JIMMY=>I'll be ok. Jimmy gets up to go, summons his courage.
TILDA=>Jimmy, in ten minutes the outer hull will burn away completely. Hurry.
JIMMY=>It's go time.
ANTON=>Who's there? Valentina?
VALENTINA=>It's over Anton. We're leaving.
ANTON=>Something is wrong with you Val. You can't trust someone that wants to eat you.
VALENTINA=>Gary loves me. He loves me in ways you couldn't understand.
ANTON=>I thought we've had some good times. Anton notices Gary lurking in the hall.
ANTON=>Gary? I'll kick your ass. Anton struggles to sit up. He falls back down. Val puts down the time cube on the counter and helps Anton settle down.
VALENTINA=>Gary! I have the Time Cube! Gary stays in the shadows, nearby. We can see him quiver and jiggle as he speaks, suggestions of a jaw moving, but lots of amorphous tentacles and bulging monstrous shapes.
GARY=>Before we go, one last thing.
VALENTINA=>What?
GARY=>Kill him. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 84.
ANTON=>You pussy, come over here. Afraid to fight like a man? Valentina looks at Anton, looks at Gary, conflicted.
148A 148A=>Blaring SIRENS, RED CHERRY LIGHTS. Jimmy comes around to the door marked AIRLOCK MODULE. He very slowly peeks in, scared.
148B 148B=>Continued with Anton, Val and Gary.
GARY=>I want to see you kill him.
VALENTINA=>We don't need to do that Gary. We can just go.
GARY=>Killll himmmmm. Gary tosses the bent exercise machine handlebar to her feet. She picks it up and looks at Anton. Anton manages to sit up, faces her without any aggression.
ANTON=>If this guy is going to make you happy, go ahead. I understand. Val sees Anton in a different light.
ANTON=>It's ok.
JIMMY=>Damn. Jimmy frantically sorts through space suit parts. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 85.
150A 150A=>Tilda looks at a screen that counts down to 00:00:02:00.
JIMMY=>I'm entering the airlock.
150B 150B=>Jimmy in a helmet and space suit stands nervous at the hatch. He hesitates. The lights turn red. He presses the button.
150C 150C=>Anton, Val and Gary continued. Valentina hefts the handlebar, checks out Anton. He looks pitiful.
GARY=>Do it.
VALENTINA=>I don't see why-
GARY=>Hurry up. Kill him now.
VALENTINA=>Give me a second Gary.
GARY=>Do it now!
VALENTINA=>Can you give me a second Gary?
GARY=>Kill him! Valentina turns around defiantly.
VALENTINA=>I don't like being bossed around. Anton nods in confirmation of this.
JIMMY=>Gah! POV Jimmy: splatter and mucus on the inside of the glass.
JIMMY=>I'm outside the station.
TILDA=>Keep going Jimmy, You have to align and fire the thruster in ninety seconds or we'll implode.
JIMMY=>Okay no problem.
152A 152A=>Gary comes out of the shadows . He's a hulking monstrous thing. Valentina is not intimidated. Anton is a little intimidated, still weak from his injuries.
GARY=>So this is how it's going to be.
VALENTINA=>Yup. Valentina swings high at Gary and catches him upside the head. He snarls and bashes her with a tentacle, knocking away the handlebar. She gives him a few punches, kick in the duck nuts. Gary knocks her down by the sandwich machine. Anton grabs a chair. A tentacle comes at Anton - it pulls him over by his neck, he drops the chair, and is thrown down by the hatch. Gary side steps quickly, looking around. He sees the Time Cube on the counter and sends a tentacle at it. Valentina stabs the tentacle with a plastic fork and it pulls back, spraying green blood and mucous in an unexpectedly heavy geyser over Valentina, Anton and the room. Valentina throws the time cube over the table to Anton, who catches it. Gary refocusses on Val and moves toward her. He bashes her with a tentacle sending her over the table. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 87.
GARY=>GRRRRROOARRRR!
JIMMY=>Almost there. Tilda? Tilda?
JIMMY=>How the hell does this work? Jimmy finds a small keypad and joystick in the panel. He hits buttons. Jimmy turns the joystick. The thruster next to him moves.
JIMMY=>Okay. That's good.
155A 155A=>The vector graphic shows HULL COLLAPSE IMMINENT DANGER!
WENDI=>Ten seconds until hull collapse.
155B 155B=>Gary looms up over the dazed Valentina. Anton is dazed. Gary is as scary as possible.
TILDA=>Hey. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 88.
ANTON=>Is that my blaster?
TILDA=>Jimmy fixed it. Anton helps Valentina up.
VALENTINA=>Thanks Tilda.
ANTON=>Where is Jimmy?
JIMMY=>Here goes nothing. He's sweating profusely. He looks at his glove - it's burning. There's orange-glowing cinders flying off his boots. Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of the thruster next to him. Over the course of five long seconds, the station stops falling. The thruster stops firing. He's burning more now. His suit POPS A LEAK! Smoke whizzes out of a hole in his arm. He stares at it.
JIMMY=>Oh crap.
TILDA=>Jimmy? Come in Jimmy! You did it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 89.
VALENTINA=>He did it. The room stops shaking. The RUMBLE sound stops.
TILDA=>Orbit is stabilizing. Jimmy?
TILDA=>Jimmy? Come in Jimmy. Jimmy?!
159A 159A=>Anton and Val look worried. Tilda rips off her headphones and walks out.
159B 159B=>Tilda walks then speeds up into a run as Val and Anton sit in the background in the control room. [no window covers]
159C 159C=>Tilda enters and opens the inner airlock door, revealing Jimmy taking off his scorched helmet.
TILDA=>Jimmy! She hugs him.
JIMMY=>Are we ok?
TILDA=>Yes. You did it.
159D 159D=>Anton and Val sit next to each other. Val tenderly wipes some Gary goo off Anton's face.
ANTON=>Thanks sweetie. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 89A.
VALENTINA=>You're twice the man Gary ever was.
ANTON=>I know. She hugs him. He wraps his manly arms around her.
JIMMY=>I could eat another.
TILDA=>Chicken?
JIMMY=>Ham. She pulls another sandwich from the shelf.
TILDA=>Ham.
JIMMY=>Nice. The Time Cube is on the floor with cables running into it from all over. Tilda checks the cables.
TILDA=>I think we're ready. Jimmy hits the intercom.
JIMMY=>Control room, are you ready?
ANTON=>Ready.
JIMMY=>We're activating it. Jimmy hits keys on a keyboard. All the computer screens turn on. The strange HUMMING sound starts. The Time Cube GLOWS BLUE. The lights dim slightly.
JIMMY=>I think it's working.
TILDA=>Wendi; status report please. She eats her sandwich. Jimmy picks up his sandwich and eats it. They both stare at the computer, eating sandwiches. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 91.
JIMMY=>Wendi? What's going on? Is it working?
WENDI=>Time Cube interface activated. The humming gets louder.
JIMMY=>Maybe I should-
ANTON=>Jimmy? Jimmy snaps out of his daze and hits the intercom button.
JIMMY=>Yeah. We're okay. Are you okay?
VALENTINA=>We're fine up here. Jimmy sees a screen marked "COMM" blinking. He presses the button.
GROUND CONTROL=>Sanitation station Regina come in. This is Ground control. We have a level two debris warning lit up here.
VALENTINA=>Ground control? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 92.
GROUND CONTROL=>Yes. Are you going to going to atomize the debris or do we have to call the spaceworkers union rep? A small metal screw floats in space.
ANTON=>The... debris warning thing. Get the debris. Valentina flips a switch and grabs the joystick.
GROUND CONTROL=>Good job Regina. The shuttle drone flies past where the screw was.
ANTON=>Roger that Ground control. Nice to hear from you, anytime.
GROUND CONTROL=>Shove it Regina. Ground Control out.
