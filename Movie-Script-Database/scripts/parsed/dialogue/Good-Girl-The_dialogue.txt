JUSTINE=>I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study?
CORNY=>Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to have ya.
JUSTINE=>Can I bring my husband?
CORNY=>'Course! A couple that prays together stays together.
PHIL=>What's this?
JUSTINE=>The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me.
PHIL=>Not very light is it?
JUSTINE=>We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together.
PHIL=>I heard it was the couple that lays together stays together.
JUSTINE=>Well you heard wrong.
JUSTINE=>Cheryl? You think you can take this one?
CHERYL=>Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair?
CUSTOMER=>Wait, you gonna do my hair?
CHERYL=>No, I just need to know if that's your usual way of wearing it all big and high. If it is then I'll just put more makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, you're gonna want to take a whole bottle of this home wtih you. It's got quite alot of ingredients in it so you're getting a good deal. It's got Ginco extract in it, do you know what that is?
CUSTOMER=>No.
CHERYL=>It's extract of the Ginco and it makes your skin real slick so that any liquid will roll right off, be it water or lemon juice or urine. I'll put that in a bag for you.
JUSTINE=>Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're gonna be late for Bible study. You're stoned, you got paint in your hair, would you just get in the shower?
PHIL=>I completely didn't remember...
JUSTINE=>Get in the shower.
BUBBA=>Workin' on your spiritual life?
JUSTINE=>Yeah, I guess.
BUBBA=>Ain't that a hoot and a holler.
JUSTINE=>What do you mean?
BUBBA=>I saw you, Justine.
JUSTINE=>Saw me what?
BUBBA=>I saw you. We got some things to talk about, you and me. You come by my place after work. If you knwo what's good for ya.
PHIL=>Hey. Where's Bubba?
JUSTINE=>He left.
PHIL=>Well, I'm ready. Let's go.
PHIL=>I don't know what to say about Jesus. I'm stoned.
JUSTINE=>Just let the other people do the talking.
PHIL=>Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.
JUSTINE=>Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us.
CORNY=>Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could make it!
JUSTINE=>Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.
CORNY=>Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good discussion going tonight. If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God?
PHIL=>Yeah, that sounds like a good one.
JUSTINE=>Phil, come with me to the car.
PHIL=>What?
JUSTINE=>Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'.
PHIL=>What's goin' on?
JUSTINE=>Just get in the car. Get in the car, Phil.
PHIL=>What the hell?
JUSTINE=>I don't want to go to Bible study.
PHIL=>Why not?
JUSTINE=>Because I don't want to. Now, can we please just get out of here?
PHIL=>Justine, this is embarassing. We're runnin' away from Bible study like a couple of Devil worshippers.
JUSTINE=>I don't care. I'm not in the mood.
PHIL=>You are freakin' me out, man. Why?
JUSTINE=>Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is why.
PHIL=>You just said a few minutes ago they'll forgive us.
JUSTINE=>Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So can we please just get the shit outta here?
PHIL=>I'm never goin' back to Bible study again.
JUSTINE=>I don't care, fine by me.
CUSTOMER=>I think I look too white, don't you think?
CHERYL=>I'm just tryin' to match your face with your hair, I was thinkin' you're not white enough.
CUSTOMER=>I think I look kinda wierd.
CHERYL=>Well, the first rule of fashion is that you have to look wierd. What I'm doing here has come straight from France.
CUSTOMER=>Oh.
CHERYL=>It's called circ du face, meaning circus of the face and it's all the rage with the Frenchies.
CUSTOMER=>Well, you're the professoinal.
CHERYL=>That's right.
CORNY=>Justine, what happened to you? I looked up and I saw you two drivin' off like vampires in the night.
JUSTINE=>Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.
CORNY=>You coulda looked off your neighbor. It's a church, you know. You can't make water without bumpin' your nut on a bible.
JUSTINE=>Oh. Well, we felt bad.
CORNY=>What in blazes?!
CUSTOMER=>Do you like it?
JUSTINE=>I can't go.
HOLDEN=>What?
JUSTINE=>I can't go today. There's something important I need to tend to.
HOLDEN=>I thought you said we'd go today.
JUSTINE=>Well, something came up.
HOLDEN=>What came up?
JUSTINE=>Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's found out about us.
HOLDEN=>I'm starting to wonder if you even want to go. I'm startin' to think you don't get me.
JUSTINE=>Well, maybe I don't get you.
HOLDEN=>You do, you do get me you just don't want to me 'cause I'm too intensified for you! Justine, who cares, who cares if someone finds out. We don't have to live like this, Justine. I know what it's like to go home every night and feel like you're hidin' out. We can leave all this behind...
JUSTINE=>That's easy for you to say, Holden, you are not married.
HOLDEN=>You just, you just gonna give up?! You gonna go crawlin' back?!
JUSTINE=>Holden, you are gonna get us caught!
HOLDEN=>You're so fucking afraid it makes me sick. Don't give up on us.
JUSTINE=>I won't.
JUSTINE=>I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?
HOLDEN=>Okay. Good luck on your important thing.
JUSTINE=>Thanks.
BUBBA=>Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. Sit. I'm in shock.
JUSTINE=>Why?
BUBBA=>You know why.
JUSTINE=>Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle.
JUSTINE=>Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.
BUBBA=>But don't you see? This is my chance, for liberation.
JUSTINE=>But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way.
BUBBA=>I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.
JUSTINE=>Why?
BUBBA=>He's my best friend. I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big. He's a cuckhold.
JUSTINE=>You wanna cuckhold him yourself!
BUBBA=>Well that's different. That isn't about him. That's about my salvation. Look, you've got your choice to make. Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart. Or have sex with me right now.
JUSTINE=>Oh god! There was someone in the window! Did you not see?
BUBBA=>You're paranoid.
JUSTINE=>I gotta go.
BUBBA=>Phil is never gonna find out about any of this. Don't fret.
JUSTINE=>Get this damn dog away from me!
BUBBA=>You're lookin' at a free man, Justine. A free man.
JUSTINE=>Great. Good for you.
BUBBA=>Thank you.
PHIL=>I'm nervous.
JUSTINE=>You're nervous? Why?
PHIL=>'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup, that's why. What if I can't do it?
JUSTINE=>You can do it.
PHIL=>You know, If you said you'd help me I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna be on your lunch hour anyway.
JUSTINE=>Okay.
PHIL=>You didn't even say nothing about the TV bein' fixed.
JUSTINE=>Oh. Is it? Thanks.
PHIL=>You're welcome.
JACK=>Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you talked to Holden lately? He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives. I know you two are friends.
JUSTINE=>We're not friends.
JACK=>You eat lunch together every day.
JUSTINE=>No, we don't.
JACK=>Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him.
JUSTINE=>Oh my god. What are you doin'?
HOLDEN=>You're a hooker, you hooker.
JUSTINE=>I saw you. You followed me.
HOLDEN=>So, how many guys you gettin' with? You gettin' with every guy in the state?
JUSTINE=>No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us!
HOLDEN=>I'm so alone!
JUSTINE=>You've gotta get a hold of yourself! Are you drunk?
HOLDEN=>Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every day until the day I die! What do you care?! You jump on any pecker that's put in front of you!
JUSTINE=>It's not what you think.
HOLDEN=>I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.
JUSTINE=>Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me after work.
HOLDEN=>Where you goin'?
JUSTINE=>I gotta help Phil with his sperm.
HOLDEN=>What?
JUSTINE=>Just go. Go!
HOLDEN=>I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with one man but not with a whole bunch of 'em!
JUSTINE=>Great.
NURSE=>Mr. Last? Would you come with me?
PHIL=>Wish me luck.
JUSTINE=>Good luck, honey.
BUBBA=>Knock 'em dead, partner. You look nice.
JUSTINE=>No, I don't.
BUBBA=>I know you're angry and I can figure why. But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing.
JUSTINE=>Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.
BUBBA=>Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine.
JUSTINE=>Bubba, I mean it.
BUBBA=>Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts?
NURSE=>Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request for your presence.
PHIL=>Who's there?
JUSTINE=>It's Justine.
PHIL=>C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I need help.
JUSTINE=>You've never done it on your own?
PHIL=>Not in a place like this! Not where I have to hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob.
JUSTINE=>Ah, they're sore.
CHERYL=>What's wrong with you? You look like death.
JUSTINE=>My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.
CHERYL=>Is it your period?
JUSTINE=>Nah, it's stress.
CHERYL=>This job is stressful. I'm breaking out.
JUSTINE=>You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face.
CHERYL=>Maybe you're pregnant.
JUSTINE=>What?... No...
HOLDEN=>You know, sometimes, I think to myself, at least it can't get any worse. But it can. I can worse. As long as you can say you've hit rock bottom you can.
JUSTINE=>Oh my god, Blackberries.
HOLDEN=>A blind man can go deaf. A widow can lose her children. Babies starve and they never get food. They never get any food. They just come into the world and they die.
JUSTINE=>Calm down, Holden!
HOLDEN=>I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I was a hooker like you. I could calm down all over town.
JUSTINE=>Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.
HOLDEN=>I know you're not. I'm in agony.
JUSTINE=>Why?
HOLDEN=>What do you mean 'why'? I thought you hated your life.
JUSTINE=>I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You are really depressed.
HOLDEN=>I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal the money whatever it takes. You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me. Please don't forsake me Justine.
JUSTINE=>Oh... I, I promise.
JUSTINE=>I realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon. If I was ever gonna go straight I'd have to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops.
JUSTINE=>How much are the blackberries?
BLACKBERRY MAN=>A tin for two dollars, miss. There you go.
JUSTINE=>Thank you.
JUSTINE=>Have a blackberry.
HOLDEN=>We need a plan. We can't keep livin' day to day. We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick....
JUSTINE=>Have a blackberry, Holden!
HOLDEN=>But, they're dirty. They're sweet. If I could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do. But If I ever do, I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do. But do what? What...? What was that for?
JUSTINE=>They looked dirty. I, I think I saw a bug in them or something.
JUSTINE=>I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well, I think he's mentally ill. He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair. Which is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, and I just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him. Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble.
PHIL=>What are you doin' in here? What's that?
JUSTINE=>It's a home pregnancy test.
PHIL=>Why you takin' it?
JUSTINE=>'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.
PHIL=>What's it say?
JUSTINE=>Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could you give me a minute please?
PHIL=>I wanna be here when you find out.
JUSTINE=>Okay.
PHIL=>The little plastic doohickey's turnin' blue. What's that mean?
JUSTINE=>Blue?
PHIL=>Bright blue.
JUSTINE=>It means I'm pregnant.
PHIL=>ALRIGHT!
PHIL=>I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna have ourselves a baby.
JUSTINE=>Maybe.
PHIL=>And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.
JUSTINE=>The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party.
PHIL=>Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't seem too excited.
JUSTINE=>No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby...
PHIL=>Don't think negative. Think positive. We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny.
JUSTINE=>Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby?
PHIL=>What do you mean? Everything's gonna change.
JUSTINE=>Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change?
PHIL=>What do ya mean?
HOLDEN=>Hello?
WOMAN=>Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from the Holland County psychiatric hospital.
MOTHER=>Who was it, Tom?
HOLDEN=>It was a wrong number.
JACK=>Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out on his ass!
CHERYL=>Justine, somethin's goin' on. Something is definately happening.
JUSTINE=>Go find out.
CHERYL=>It's big. It's very big.
JUSTINE=>C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.
CHERYL=>Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe. They blew the thing open with a gun.
JUSTINE=>Oh my god.
CHERYL=>Not only that but the cops know who did it.
JUSTINE=>Who?
CHERYL=>Somebody who works here.
JUSTINE=>Cheryl!
CHERYL=>Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his cashier key in the door.
JUSTINE=>Oh my god.
CHERYL=>They can't find him though. They say he robbed his folks too. You in on it?
JUSTINE=>What?! No!
CHERYL=>I know you two played hookie in the store room. I never rat on ya, I've done some things myself. But, still. You in on it?
JUSTINE=>I don't know what you're talkin' about.
CHERYL=>Suit yourself.
CORNY=>Justine. Can we talk to you for a second?
JACK=>Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.
CORNY=>Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya?
JACK=>Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it?
JUSTINE=>No. I don't know anything.
CORNY=>'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden.
JUSTINE=>I hardly know him.
CORNY=>I've seen you in the store room with him Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well.
JUSTINE=>I don't know anything.
HOLDEN=>Justine! Justine!
HOLDEN=>I did it! I finally did somethin'!
JUSTINE=>Holden, the police are lookin' for you!
HOLDEN=>Oh, who cares? I'm proud of myself. Fuck them, Fuck all of them!
JUSTINE=>Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too! Corny's got a camera in that storage room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's been watchin' us the whole time.
HOLDEN=>Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got over twenty thousand dollars! I got a gun, what else?!
JUSTINE=>I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm gonna crash. I'm pregnant, Holden.
HOLDEN=>It's my baby.
JUSTINE=>Not necessarily.
HOLDEN=>Yes, it is. You know it is.
JUSTINE=>Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on the run.
HOLDEN=>Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise a baby here. You know that. Justine. You hate your husband. You hate your job. You love me, so let's go.
JUSTINE=>I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my things and I'd have to get more money.
HOLDEN=>Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the motel and wait for you. Just be there by noon.
JUSTINE=>This is all going too fast.
HOLDEN=>Justine, what have you got to lose?
JUSTINE=>Nothin'.
HOLDEN=>So be there by noon.
JUSTINE=>Okay.
HOLDEN=>I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You inspired me.
PHIL=>Hey Teeny!
JUSTINE=>Hey.
PHIL=>We were gettin' worried about ya!
JUSTINE=>Sorry.
BUBBA=>Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is Justine.
JUSTINE=>Hi.
LIBERTA=>Hi.
BUBBA=>Congratulations, on your expectation.
JUSTINE=>Thanks.
LIBERTA=>Do you think it's a girl or a boy?
PHIL=>Doesn't matter. As long as it plays quarterback for the Cowboys.
BUBBA=>Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin'.
PHIL=>Hello. Yeah. Well, that's not right. What's that supposed to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got that? Well, look you better check your records again, pal, then call me! Some doctor says my sperm's no good. Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?
BUBBA=>No. That just means they got it wrong, is all. They don't know everything.
JUSTINE=>They just got it wrong, so...
PHIL=>Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.
JUSTINE=>How it all came down to this, only the devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was down the road to my right. I closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future. On my left I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and quiet whisperings. and burning secrets that won't ever die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, never ending nothing.
CHERYL=>Hey Justine.
JUSTINE=>I know where you can find him.
JACK=>Holden?
JUSTINE=>He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll be there till noon.
JACK=>You done good. You're a good girl.
PHIL=>Hey.
JUSTINE=>Hey.
PHIL=>What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it.
JUSTINE=>Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.
PHIL=>I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work?
JUSTINE=>They gave me the day off.
PHIL=>Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?
JUSTINE=>No.
JACK=>Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden.
CHERYL=>I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies....
JUSTINE=>What?
BUBBA=>I was just at your house and the mail came. Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company. And F&$%. Please don't tell him about us, Justine. Please. Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on me.
JUSTINE=>Hey Phil.
PHIL=>Have you been sleepin' around behind my back?
JUSTINE=>What?
PHIL=>I said, have you been sleepin' around behind my back?
JUSTINE=>Yes.
PHIL=>Why? Why?
JUSTINE=>I don't know why.
PHIL=>Don't you love me? Don't you love me at all?
JUSTINE=>You're the only man alive that I love.
PHIL=>Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not my baby.
JUSTINE=>It's your baby.
PHIL=>Are you sure?
JUSTINE=>It is. I swear. I swear to God.
PHIL=>Who is he?
JUSTINE=>It doesn't matter.
PHIL=>Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?
JUSTINE=>Yes.
PHIL=>Yeah, I know who it was. It was that Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine. That's why you were actin' so spooked.
JUSTINE=>Yeah, yeah.
PHIL=>I'm gonna beat his ass.
JUSTINE=>Don't.
PHIL=>You're gettin' all swollen. I'm sorry I hit you, baby.
JUSTINE=>I'm sorry, Phil.
PHIL=>I need to get stoned.
JUSTINE=>Okay. Get stoned.
PHIL=>I just gotta escape, you know. You ever feel like that? Like you gotta escape?
JUSTINE=>What are those?
CHERYL=>Fake eyelashes. Extra long.
JUSTINE=>Just do it normal for once?
CHERYL=>You want me to make the other cheek purple to even it out?
JUSTINE=>No.
CHERYL=>D'you hear about Corny? He was goin' home after Bible study last night and two beefy guys with painted faces pulled up in a truck and jumped him.
JUSTINE=>That's terrible.
JUSTINE=>That day I read the story Holden wrote for me. It was kinda different from the other one, but kinda the same. It was about a woman who was put upon. Whose job was a prison, and whose life had lost all meaning. Other people don't get her, especially her husband. One day she meets a boy who is also put upon, and they fall in love. After spending their whole lives not getting got, with one look they get eachother completely. In the end, the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness, never
