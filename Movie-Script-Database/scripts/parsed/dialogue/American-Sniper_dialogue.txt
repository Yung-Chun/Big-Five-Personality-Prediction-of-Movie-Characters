COMMANDING OFFICER=>Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from the east. Clear to proceed, over.
CHRIS KYLE=>Fucking hot box.
GOAT=>Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.
CHRIS KYLE=>I guess you'd know.
CHRIS KYLE=>I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over.
COMMANDING OFFICER=>If you think he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over.
GOAT=>He could be calling his old lady.
CHRIS KYLE=>He stepped off.
CHRIS KYLE=>Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, moving toward the convoy.
CHRIS KYLE=>Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something.
CHRIS KYLE=>She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.
COMMANDING OFFICER=>--you say a woman and kid? 3.
CHRIS KYLE=>You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
COMMANDING OFFICER=>Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call.
GOAT=>They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth.
CHRIS KYLE=>Fuck--
MAN'S VOICE=>Get back here.
WAYNE=>Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt.
CHRIS=>Yes, sir.
WAYNE=>Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.
WAYNE=>Everything dies to give life.
CHRIS=>Can it see me?
WAYNE=>It's a deer, son.
WAYNE KYLE=>You shot it, you deal with it.
PASTOR=>We don't see with his eyes so we don't know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror. But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways--
WAYNE KYLE=>There are three types of people in this world. Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.
WAYNE KYLE=>Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world, and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn't know how to protect themselves... those are the sheep.
WAYNE KYLE=>Then you got predators who use violence to prey on the weak. They're the wolves. 6.
WAYNE KYLE=>Then there are those blessed with the gift of aggression and an overpowering need to protect the flock.
WAYNE KYLE=>These men are the rare breed that live to confront the wolf--
WAYNE KYLE=>They are the sheepdog.
WAYNE KYLE=>Now we're not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf--
DEBBY=>Wayne--
WAYNE=>But we take care of our own. And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother, you have my permission to finish it.
CHRIS=>The guy was picking on Jeff.
WAYNE KYLE=>That true?
JEFF=>Yes sir... Yes, he was... 7.
WAYNE KYLE=>And did you finish it?
WAYNE=>Then you know who you are...
WAYNE=>You know your purpose.
JEFF=>Wasn't nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear. What you supposed to do with it? 8.
CHRIS=>You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood.
JEFF=>A strong wind'd put Sarah in the mood.
CHRIS=>Is that what they say?
JEFF=>You know what they called her in high school--
CHRIS=>Don't say it.
JEFF=>Sarah suck-a--
JEFF=>Shit man--
CHRIS=>Who wants to hump a rodeo star?
CHRIS=>What the fuck--
SARAH=>You said you wasn't coming home until tomorrow.
CHRIS=>Why would you do this?
SARAH=>Just let him out. He didn't know...
CHRIS=>You didn't know?
SARAH=>What the fuck is wrong with you! What'd you expect? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend!
CHRIS=>Get out.
SARAH=>You think you're a cowboy cause you rodeo? You're no cowboy. You're just a lousy ranch-hand and a shitty fuckin lay!
JEFF=>Some people ain't worth fighting for.
CHRIS=>But she was right...
JEFF=>A job is a job. At least we're outside. 10.
NEWS ANCHOR=>--group of radical militants called Al- Qaeda are taking credit for a bombing that left six dead and hundreds injured--
CHRIS=>Jeff, wake up. Look at this--
CHRIS=>Look what they did...
CHRIS=>I saw what they did, on our soil, and--
NAVY RECRUITER=>And you're from Texas and you're a patriot so it pissed you off.
CHRIS=>Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight--
NAVY RECRUITER=>You wanna fight? Meet the warrior elite.
CHRIS KYLE=>SEALs?
NAVY RECRUITER=>Sea, Air and Land.
CHRIS=>I ain't much of a swimmer-- 11.
NAVY RECRUITER=>This isn't for the faint of heart. Most men wash-out. They quit--
CHRIS=>I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>You a quitter, boy?
CHRIS KYLE=>No, sir!
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Bullshit, you are fleet-meat. Don't turn away. Look up and take it. You're old as fuck. Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah's Arc? How old are you?
CHRIS=>30, sir.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>30! You fart dust and could've fathered half these boys. You think cause you had a pop-gun back in Texas you're cut out to be a SEAL?
CHRIS=>No, sir.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>No, you're not cut out to be one?
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water.
CHRIS=>I love water, hooyah.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>My ass you do.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Is that you giggling you fat fuck? Look at you. You're so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World. Your momma fat too?
RYAN=>No sir, she's not.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Don't lie to me! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute. What the fuck are you doing here fatboy? Do your feet get wet when you shower? When's the last time you saw your pecker? You're not a Seal, you're a fuckin Walrus. A big giggling Walrus. "Biggles" that's your new name--
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>--and that's your ticket home. Just drag your jelly-roll ass up and ring it and you'll be headed home to momma Shamu.
CHRIS=>Two hundred.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Did I ask you to count?
CHRIS=>No, sir. 13.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Was that your ass talking then?
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two.
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE=>Wave goodbye to the sun, boys...
CHRIS=>--and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and--
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford.
DAUBER=>Country is countrywide, sir.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>I don't think he likes black dudes, "D".
"D"=>That's alright, sir. I'm not black.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>No?
"D"=>No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck.
BIGGLES=>Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts?
SQUIRREL=>Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good.
INSTRUCTOR "TONY"=>How about you old man? How you feeling? 15.
CHRIS KYLE=>Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous.
CHRIS=>I'm gonna try and get into sniper school.
BIGGLES=>Can you shoot?
CHRIS=>I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper?
BIGGLES=>Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way cooler.
DAPPER NAVY GUY=>Come on, just let me buy you a drink. 16.
TAYA=>Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married?
DAPPER NAVY GUY=>I'm not--
TAYA=>I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home.
CHRIS=>It could be the leather pants.
TAYA=>Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?
CHRIS=>Corduroy.
TAYA=>Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers?
CHRIS=>Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth.
TAYA=>That's great. A real red-neck.
CHRIS=>I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan.
TAYA=>What's the difference?
CHRIS=>We ride horses, they ride their cousins.
TAYA=>What do you do for work? You look like military. 17.
CHRIS=>I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates.
TAYA=>Do I look stupid to you?
CHRIS=>To be honest, you look a little sad.
CHRIS=>So am I tall enough to buy you a drink?
TAYA=>Not until you tell me what you do.
CHRIS=>How about this: one shot, one answer.
TAYA=>You're obviously military. What branch?
CHRIS=>I'm just finishing BUD/S.
TAYA=>Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
CHRIS=>That was two questions...
TAYA=>I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL.
CHRIS=>What's that mean you know all about us?
TAYA=>You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL. 18.
CHRIS=>How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country.
TAYA=>Why?
CHRIS=>Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you.
TAYA=>Where are you going?
CHRIS=>You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home.
TAYA=>I said I'd never marry one.
CHRIS=>Well in that case... what's your name?
TAYA=>Taya.
CHRIS=>Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle.
TAYA=>Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris?
CHRIS=>Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women.
TAYA=>Sounds like you're under attack.
TAYA=>--I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it.
PO TOSH=>Feel breath filling every cell of your body. This is our ritual. We master our breath, we master our mind---
PO TOSH=>--pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. You will be aware of it but not directing it. And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats.
CHRIS=>It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- 20.
TAYA=>You figured what?
PO TOSH=>Aim small, miss small. If you aim for his shirt button, you might miss by two inches. If you aim for his shirt, you miss by two feet. You better close those groupings, Kyle.
TAYA=>Did you always want to be a soldier?
CHRIS=>I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more.
TAYA=>So you started rescuing girls from bars?
CHRIS=>I rescued that bar from you.
CHRIS=>Do you like country music?
TAYA=>Only when I'm depressed.
CHRIS=>You want kids? 21.
TAYA=>Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men.
CHRIS=>That's a shitty thing to tell a girl.
TAYA=>I've proven her right.
CHRIS=>But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are.
TAYA=>What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun?
CHRIS=>I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes.
PO TOSH=>Mirage is boiling at 35 degree angle.
CHRIS=>Check. I'm dialed for windage.
PO TOSH=>Hold right-four, up-two.
PO TOSH=>Are we looking at the same target? 22.
CHRIS=>You're trembling...
TAYA=>I know. I don't...
CHRIS=>We don't have to do this...
TAYA=>I want to. I do...
PO TOSH=>You need to shut your off-eye.
CHRIS=>If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there.
PO TOSH=>There is nothing out there but a target.
CHRIS=>Negative. There's something--
PO TOSH=>Give me 50 push-ups. Clear and safe. Push `em out.
CHRIS=>There it is.
TAYA=>You hardly even know me.
CHRIS=>I know enough. You're a package deal, babe.
CHRIS=>What are you afraid of?
TAYA=>Nothing. Everything. I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?
CHRIS=>I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family.
TAYA=>You got it all planned out, don't you.
CHRIS=>I love you. I'm done. 24.
TAYA=>Well... you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that.
TAYA=>Oh my god! No! Chris--
TAYA=>What the hell is on your neck?
CHRIS=>Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago? 25.
TAYA=>What do you--
CHRIS=>Package deal babe.
"D"=>What's the word, Chief?
TONY=>It's on boys. Just got the call.
CHRIS=>They say it'll be over in 6 weeks.
TAYA=>I'm so afraid.
CHRIS=>Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan.
TAYA=>Your heart is beating out of your chest.
CHRIS=>I'm not the only one going to war.
MARC LEE=>Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of the old middle east.
MARC LEE=>AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it.
MARC LEE=>You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do "overwatch" for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs.
MARC LEE=>The city was evacuated. Any military-aged male still here, is here to kill you. Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home. Move--
WINSTON=>Keep your head down, Tex. The Muj' got snipers too.
CHRIS=>A sniper won't aim for your head.
WINSTON=>They got this sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out--
WINSTON=>--they call him "Mustafa." He was in the Olympics.
CHRIS=>They got sniping in the Olympics now?
WINSTON=>What're we looking for?
CHRIS=>You ever hunt?
WINSTON=>I ain't that kind of red-neck.
WINSTON=>Fuck, fuck--
CHRIS=>You just got your first kill, Goat.
CHRIS=>I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals.
CHRIS KYLE=>I got a military-aged male, on a cell phone, watching the convoy. Over. 29.
COMMANDING OFFICER=>If he's reporting troop movement you have a green-light. Your call. Over.
CHRIS KYLE=>He stepped off.
CHRIS KYLE=>Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, moving toward the convoy.
CHRIS KYLE=>Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying something.
CHRIS KYLE=>She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.
COMMANDING OFFICER=>--you say a woman and kid?
CHRIS KYLE=>You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Over.
COMMANDING OFFICER=>Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call.
GOAT=>They fry you if you're wrong. Send your ass to Leavenworth. 30.
CHRIS KYLE=>Fuck--
GOAT=>-Fuck that was gnarly.
GOAT=>Shit yeah. Evil bitch!
COMMANDING OFFICER=>Nice shooting, Tex. Helluva call. 31.
COMPANY COMMANDER=>Roger that. Good lookin' out Navy.
GOAT=>You hear that?
CHRIS=>Get the fuck off me.
MARC LEE=>That's your overwatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. Keep moving.
CHRIS=>That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over.
MARINE VIPER CO=>Negative. East side of Elizabeth is locked-down. Over.
MARC LEE=>Smells like piss in here. You covered our ass out there, man. Appreciate it. Those were ballsy shots.
CHRIS KYLE=>And they were clean. Right?
MARC LEE=>Hell yeah, they were.
CHRIS=>That sniper walked right up our ass.
MARC LEE=>I chewed out our security detail. It won't happen again.
CHRIS=>My shooter statements are on the dresser.
MARC LEE=>Six?
CHRIS=>Should be eight. Two got dragged off. Something wrong?
MARC LEE=>No... but you got more kills than the rest of the snipers combined.
CHRIS=>They still got one of our guys. 35.
MARC LEE=>You can't shoot what you can't see.
BIGGLES=>Heard you got your dick wet.
CHRIS=>Where is everybody?
BIGGLES=>We're just picking our dicks here, training those fucking haji soldiers.
CHRIS=>Why ain't you out there?
BIGGLES=>I got the shits. Marc Lee said you were on fuckin fire out there.
CHRIS=>You still read comic books?
BIGGLES=>It's a fuckin graphic novel. Talk to me, man. Did you pop your cherry?
CHRIS=>This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines.
BIGGLES=>You saw his balls? 36.
CHRIS=>It was evil, man. That was hate like I've never seen it before.
BIGGLES=>That kid could've taken out ten Marines--
CHRIS=>I know.
BIGGLES=>You did your job. End of fuckin story.
CHRIS=>It's just not how you imagine the first one going down.
BIGGLES=>How about the other ones? What about the other kills?
CHRIS=>The other ones-- were righteous. Like God was blowing on my bullets.
ANOTHER SNIPER=>--that you again Kyle?
JAG OFFICER=>Our task here is to make sure every kill is a righteous kill and conforms to ROEs.
CHRIS=>By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? 37.
CHRIS=>Sorry, was that a question?
MARINE SNIPER=>Haven't seen shit all day. Maybe the war is over and they forgot to tell us.
CHRIS=>I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump?
COMMANDING OFFICER=>Negative. Bomb maker. Green-light.
MARINE SNIPER=>--are you fucking serious?
JAG OFFICER=>His wife said he was carrying a Koran.
CHRIS=>Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47.
MESS HALL=>38.
BIGGLES=>Listen up ladies and genitals. The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it's better to be lucky than good! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that--
TAYA=>Have you killed anyone yet?
CHRIS=>That's not how the call-home goes, babe.
TAYA=>Don't be weird with me. Seriously. I want you to tell me everything.
CHRIS=>There are things we can't say over the phone.
TAYA=>You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan?
TAYA=>You guys almost done over there yet? 39.
CHRIS=>I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon...
TAYA=>It's called a nightgown.
CHRIS=>Yeah--
TAYA=>And three days is not a honeymoon.
CHRIS=>It was a good three days. I miss you bad.
TAYA=>You want me to talk dirty to you?
CHRIS=>Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other--
TAYA=>Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important.
CHRIS=>You're horny preggers.
TAYA=>Fat and horny. It's kinda disgusting.
CHRIS=>You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you.
TAYA=>-So romantic.
CHRIS=>How's my boy?
TAYA=>Nobody said it's a boy--
CHRIS=>I can't wait to see the way you are with him. You're gonna be incredible. 40.
TAYA=>How do you know?
CHRIS=>I just know. I can see it.
TAYA=>I hope you're right.
TAYA=>Did your dad get hold of you?
CHRIS=>I haven't checked any email.
TAYA=>Shit. You need to call him. Hang up and--
CHRIS=>What happened?
TAYA=>I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking--
CHRIS=>Taya.
TAYA=>Your little brother deployed.
CHRIS=>What happened to jump school? I thought--
TAYA=>He didn't get in. Just call your dad--
CHRIS=>Deployed where? Where's he going?
TAYA=>Over there. He's headed to Iraq.
COL. GRONSKI=>The man with the blade is a Jordanian radical funded by Bin Laden, trained by Bin Laden and loyal to Bin Laden.
COL. GRONSKI=>His name is "Zarqawi" and he is the prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. AQI, his mercenary army, are 5000 strong. They're trained well, paid well and waging the heaviest urban combat since Vietnam.
COL. GRONSKI=>Zarqawi and his Lieutenants are our highest priority. Only way to root them out is to go house-to-house until we find them, or someone who will reveal their whereabouts. We need to clear ten structures an hour. It's aggressive so we'll loosen things up with air support--
CHRIS=>These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off.
MARC LEE=>They're Marines. They don't get the training we do. Half of them were civilians six months ago.
CHRIS=>So let's coach them up. I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street.
MARC LEE=>Can't do. We need you on overwatch.
CHRIS=>But if I was down in the street--
MARC LEE=>House-to-house is the deadliest job here. You got some kind of savior complex?
CHRIS=>I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em.
MARC LEE=>You got a hot hand. These Marines all know your name now and they think they're invincible with you up there.
CHRIS=>They're not--
MARC LEE=>They are if they believe they are. Just keep banging on the long-gun and let these ground-pounders sniff out Zarqawi.
CHRIS=>You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics-- but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games.
GOAT=>Mustafa's not Iraqi. He's from Syria. 43.
CHRIS=>Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target.
CHRIS=>Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming?
GOAT=>No man. No. I like my life. I wanna make it home. I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit. It's not my job to knock down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I ain't doing that shit.
CHRIS=>If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again.
CHRIS=>You wanna be a sniper? Swap me guns.
"JEFF" MARINE=>Really?
CHRIS=>I'll roll with you guys if that's cool?
CPT. GILLESPIE=>Hey, any Navy Seal is cool by me.
THOMPSON=>You're that guy. They're calling you The Legend. You got like 24 confirmed kills.
CHRIS=>It's 32. But who's counting.
THOMPSON=>That's badass.
SANCHEZ=>There's some boy in Bravo catching up.
CHRIS KYLE=>Y'all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you, some simple shit, that might just keep us above ground. What do you say?
SANCHEZ=>-Whas that mean again?
GILLESPIE=>Cover and follow.
CHRIS=>Down. Down! On the floor, now!
CHRIS=>I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down--
FATHER OF KID=>No, please--
FATHER OF KID=>Please! He can't understand. Look at him--
GILLESPIE=>He does look a little retarded.
CHRIS=>You were ordered to evacuate. Why are you still here?
FATHER OF KID=>This is our home. I won't give it to them. Or to you.
SANCHEZ=>I found these bitches in the back closet.
FATHER OF KID=>I'm Sheikh al-Obeidi. You are my guest but please tell the others to come inside. If they are in the street he will know we have spoken.
SANCHEZ=>This sand nig' want us in here so he can blow us up. Check his ass for a vest.
CHRIS=>Who will know we've spoken? 46.
SHEIK AL-OBEIDI/FATHER=>Your enemy is mine enemy. We share this. You understand?
CHRIS=>Bring the other guys in.
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>If we talk to US soldiers he will come to our home and make examples of us--
CHRIS=>Who is he? I need a name.
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>The man who comes we call The Butcher. He is the despaired one, son of Shaytan--
TERP=>He calls him - the pure flame of fire- . Basically, this man comes to their house and prey on the weak with hurt.
CHRIS=>So he's some kind of enforcer?
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>Enforcer. Yes. Top soldier of Zarqawi.
CHRIS=>We want Zarqawi. Where do we find Zarqawi?
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>If you find The Butcher you will see he reports direct to Zarqawi each day.
CHRIS=>How do we find him?
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>You must understand the risk to us.
TERP=>He will ask for money.
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>We need one hundred thousand US dollars.
CHRIS=>We don't even have proof this guy exists.
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>Is this not proof?
CHRIS=>I'm sorry. I want to help you. I do. But I need names, places, phone numbers--
THOMPSON=>Hey, we got a Marine unit pinned down in a house just uprange--
CHRIS=>Give me a name, Sheik. Give me something.
THOMPSON=>They're out of ammo. If we don't go now--
SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI=>"Amir Khalaf Fanus". This is given name of The Butcher. But to help you find him--
AGENT SHEAD=>I guess that translates to "pay me" in just about any language, doesn't it?
CHRIS=>Yes sir, it does.
MARC LEE=>And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right?
AGENT SHEAD=>When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in?
CHRIS KYLE=>He left that part out.
AGENT SHEAD=>That's AQI's racket now. Your Sheik got edged out. This could be blowback.
CHRIS=>Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it.
AGENT SHEAD=>This is your guy here. We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man.
CHRIS=>But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. 49.
AGENT SHEAD=>We have several aliases-- If "Fanus" is legit we go see the Sheik.
MARC LEE=>He's asking for 100,000.
AGENT SHEAD=>If he delivers the Butcher he'll get it. This is Agent Shead, DIA, I need a name check on "Amir Khalaf Fanus." I'll wait.
CHRIS=>If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security--
AGENT SHEAD=>If we're humping money the head-shed will want contractors on it. I'm here. What do you got?
CONTRACTOR=>Road-kill.
AGENT SHEAD=>The Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer. They say his weapon of choice is a drill.
MARC LEE=>I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy. Came close to being a preacher.
CHRIS=>Why didn't you? 50.
MARC LEE=>I love to gamble, man. Love those dice.
CHRIS=>My kind of preacher.
MARC LEE=>It's like that now, huh?
CHRIS KYLE=>You haven't heard? I'm The Legend. Hey babe--
TAYA=>You were right, doctor says it's a boy.
CHRIS KYLE=>It's a boy!
MARC LEE=>Hell yeah. Congratu--
TAYA=>Chris!--
MARC LEE=>I heard one shot.
CHRIS KYLE=>Check. Large caliber. Came in at an angle, gotta be 300 or more out-- 51.
MARC LEE=>He's all over us. You get a bead?
CHRIS KYLE=>Negative--
AGENT SHEAD=>Transfer the pallet. We're pulling back.
CHRIS=>Minaret, 11 o'clock!
AGENT SHEAD=>There's no room. We'll come back for you--
CHRIS=>You got eyes on that?
MARC LEE=>Negative.
UPRANGE=>52.
CHRIS=>Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street--
CHRIS=>Fuck!--
MARC LEE=>--requesting back-up. We're pinned down taking sniper fire on approach of high- value target, GRID 04536236. Over.
MARC LEE=>We're on the wrong end of this.
CHRIS=>I'm gonna pop smoke for cover but don't move till I say.
CHRIS=>Hold.
MARC LEE=>We gotta go--
CHRIS=>Holding! Hold...
CHRIS=>Move now. Go--
MARC LEE=>How you know he'd wait-- 53.
CHRIS=>Cause I'd wait.
TAYA=>Chris--
CHRIS=>Go around. I'll go high.
THE BUTCHER=>You talk to them, you die with them.
CHRIS KYLE=>He had line-of-sight 500 meters out.
BIGGLES=>Colonel Gronski is all over Marc, bro. 55.
CHRIS=>We need to work up a squad to pursue him.
MARC LEE=>They're shutting us down.
CHRIS=>What do you mean?
MARC LEE=>We're confined to base pending an incident review.
CHRIS=>Can he do that? Just shelf us like that? I ship home in three weeks.
BIGGLES=>It's gonna be a long three weeks.
TAYA=>I thought you were dead. I thought--
CHRIS=>Shh. I'm know. I'm so sorry.
CHRIS=>You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
TAYA=>I have an alien growing inside me--
TAYA=>And there's a strange man in my bedroom.
CHRIS=>Our bedroom.
TAYA=>Why isn't it on your finger?
CHRIS=>If it catches the light...
TAYA=>Your hands feel different.
CHRIS=>They're mine. I swear...
TAYA=>Why am I so fucking nervous?
CHRIS=>I'm nervous too.
TAYA=>No you're not. Don't lie.
CHRIS=>I am... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me?
TAYA=>Why are you so good with me.
TAYA=>--it might be nice to get out--
TAYA=>--are you listening to me? Chris--
CHRIS=>Huh?--
TAYA=>What do you want to do today, hon'?
CHRIS=>Maybe we just relax here?
TAYA=>Okay, we do that. Let's relax.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>How you feeling?
TAYA=>I'm done being pregnant. I want to meet him.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>It'll be any day now. 58.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>How about you Mr. Kyle? How're you feeling?
CHRIS KYLE=>Good. Doing good.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>I imagine you're still decompressing.
CHRIS=>Not really.
TAYA=>Well, this is the first time we left the house.
CHRIS=>I'm just happy to be home.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>Here, slip this on for me.
CHRIS=>If you wanna help, you should be looking at my knees. I don't know what I did but--
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>Are you a smoker?
CHRIS=>No, ma'am.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>Do you drink?
CHRIS=>Only when I'm thirsty.
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>170 over 110.
TAYA=>Jesus Christ Chris... 59.
CHRIS=>Is that high?
DOCTOR HOFFSTADER=>Not if you just had 14 cups of coffee. But for someone who is sitting down--
CHRIS=>I'll look into it. Thanks doc.
CHRIS=>You sabotaged me back there.
TAYA=>What am I supposed to do. You're not talking. You act like it's all okay--
CHRIS=>It is okay. I'm fine.
TAYA=>You're not fine. Your blood pressure--
CHRIS=>Babe, I'm driving down the freeway, it's sunny and 72 degrees. I'm fine. But there are people dying over there and I look around and it's like it's not even happening. It's barely on the news, no one talks about it. No one cares. And if I stay too long I'll forget about it too.
TAYA=>Chris--
CHRIS=>We're at war and I'm headed to the mall.
CHRIS=>I don't belong here. I can't help anybody-
TAYA=>--it's happening-- 60.
CHRIS=>Oh shit--
TAYA=>What're you doing!
CHRIS=>I'm going back.
TAYA=>--oh my god, you're crazy! You're fucking crazy you know that?
CHRIS=>My little man...
CHRIS=>Look at our boy. Look what we did. I love you, baby. We made it--
TAYA=>The baby is crying. I thought you were--
TAYA=>Don't bother turning it off, I already watched it.
TAYA=>I had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos.
CHRIS=>This sniper is recording his kills. Mustafa. They sell these in the street.
TAYA=>That day we were on the phone--
TAYA=>You're not protecting me by not talking about it.
CHRIS=>I don't want you thinking about it. I don't need you worrying.
TAYA=>My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me--
CHRIS=>No, it's not. They're savages.
TAYA=>Chris--
CHRIS=>They're fuckin savages.
TAYA=>It's not about them, it's about us. You have to make it back to us.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Welcome home, Petty Officer Kyle. Colonel Jones is waiting. How was the flight?
CHRIS KYLE=>Slower than Christmas.
CHRIS=>Can you give me a second--?
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>The colonel is waiting--
CHRIS KYLE=>Hey, grunt--
JEFF=>Chris?
CHRIS KYLE=>Y'alright? You in one piece?
MARINE LCPL=>Let's go, PFC Kyle. Move your ass.
CHRIS=>You okay? Jeff?--
JEFF=>I heard you're kickin ass our here. All the guys, that's what they say--
JEFF=>You're my hero, bro. Always have been.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Lets go, Kyle. Colonel's waiting--
JEFF=>The Legend...
JEFF=>I'm gonna miss my ride.
CHRIS KYLE=>What happened?
JEFF=>I'm just tired, man. I'm-- I'm going home.
CHRIS=>I'm proud of you. You hear me?
CHRIS=>Dad too. He's proud of you.
JEFF=>Fuck this place-- 64.
CHRIS=>What?
JEFF=>Fuck this place.
COL. JONES=>You made Chief. Congratulations.
CHRIS KYLE=>Thank you, sir.
COL. JONES=>Gronski's gone. A lot of top-brass are. We're working off a new playbook now.
COL. JONES=>I've studied insurgencies for the last decade. I know every stone thrown since before the first century. These wars are won and lost in the minds of our enemy.
COL. JONES=>That you?
COL. JONES=>You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>That's $80,000 on your head.
CHRIS KYLE=>Don't tell my wife, she might take that number right about now.
COL. JONES=>I understand you wanted to put together a direct-action squad to hunt The Butcher. 65.
CHRIS KYLE=>Yes, sir.
COL. JONES=>We plugged the rat-hole that is Fallujah and flushed them into Ramadi. We got some intel indicating his area of operations.
COL. JONES=>I want you to put the fear of God in these savages, and find his ass.
CHRIS=>You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river--
BIGGLES=>You give good power-point, Legend.
MARC LEE=>Is this thing bulletproof? You never open it so I assumed...
CHRIS KYLE=>God, country, family, right? 66.
MARC LEE=>You got a God?
CHRIS KYLE=>You getting weird on me?
MARC LEE=>We had this electric fence around our property in Oregon and us kids used to see who could grab it and hang on the longest. War feels like that, it puts lightning in your bones, makes it hard to hold on to anything else.
CHRIS KYLE=>You need to sit this one out?
MARC LEE=>I just wanna believe in what we're doing--
CHRIS KYLE=>Evil lives here, we've seen it.
MARC LEE=>It lives everywhere--
CHRIS KYLE=>You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego? Or New York? We're protecting more than this dirt.
MARC LEE=>Hooyah then. Lets go kill this fucker.
TONY=>This building, any apartment on the east side, will look down Fahima Halal.
CHRIS=>Breacher-up.
CHRIS=>Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- Ask if they seen him.
BIGGLES=>--Private eyes, we're watching you, watching your every move...
"D"=>Why a restaurant?
MARC LEE=>Big freezers.
CHRIS=>Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going.
BIGGLES=>Fucking Chief Nappy-nap.
"D"=>Got some nice rugs up in here. This shit is hand-knotted. Beautiful.
CHRIS=>What do we got?
MARC LEE=>16 military aged males have gone in.
CHRIS=>Sixteen?
BIGGLES=>They serve more customers than McDonalds.
MARC LEE=>And check this.
CHRIS=>He still inside?
MARC LEE=>I'm only clocking one point of entry. He's in there, but it's no easy breach.
BIGGLES=>When they see it's The Legend they'll probably just invite him in-- 69.
CHRIS=>You got a problem? I didn't promote myself.
BIGGLES=>No, I did it for you. You'd never have made Chief if I nicknamed you "The Myth".
"D"=>Myth becomes Legend when we occupy a house, get 23 kills, and 21 are his.
TONY=>Enough. It's everybody's Navy.
BIGGLES=>--naw, it's Legend's Navy now. Just hope he leaves some for the rest of us.
CHRIS=>Hash out tactics. We go at zero-dark. And Big Giggles is making the coffee.
TERP=>He invites you to join him for Eid al- Adha supper. He says -on this day everyone has a seat at my table-.
CHRIS=>Tell him that's very generous of him.
CHRIS=>Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there.
MARC LEE=>That's a bad move--
BIGGLES=>He's our breech. He's a fucking way in--
MARC LEE=>If something happens--
BIGGLES=>He's AQI man, look what he's holding.
CHRIS=>It's his choice. Tell him.
"D"=>Approaching the door...
"D"=>10 meters... 71.
"D"=>5 meters...
"D"=>He's knocking...
"D"=>They're vetting him.
"D"=>Hold. Hold--
"D"=>Now.
CHRIS=>We have eyes on the target. Flushing them out the back--
BIGGLES=>Negative. Nothing yet.
CHRIS=>Help him--
MARC LEE=>Down here.
CHRIS=>They're coming back up! Watch your six--
BIGGLES=>--I can't hear you. Say again.
CHRIS KYLE=>Move.
"D"=>Big freezers. Fuck--
DAUBER=>Biggles! Watch your six. Roadies on you--
CHRIS=>Pull back! Loading--
BIGGLES=>Got you.
BIGGLES=>RPG!
CHRIS=>Contact. Eyes on The Butcher. 12 o'clock.
CHRIS=>Dauber? You got visual? Confirm. 74.
DAUBER=>Negative. No shot--
CHRIS=>He's on the move. Crossing!
BIGGLES=>Got you. Got you. Go, go, go--
CHRIS=>I offered his father detention. I gave him a choice--
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>He picked the wrong fucking side. That's all there is to it. Fog of war.
PFC ALVAREZ=>Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way. We need to make tracks.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Helluva an effort here, Chief. You keep after this bastard. We'll get him.
CHRIS KYLE=>Tell him this boy's father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there.
TERP=>- This is our territory. If you want to come here, you ask me. If you want to find someone, I find them- 76.
BIGGLES=>Fuck `em. Let's go. Shit's getting hairy.
CHRIS KYLE=>If I ask for your help you're the one they carve up next. I've seen it happen.
TERP=>-I am the seventh son of Isaac of Abraham. This is the land of my father, and I am not afraid.- He says your evil is greater than those you fight. He calls you white satan, devil of Ramadi.
CHRIS KYLE=>You tell him to deliver The Butcher to us, or the devil comes back.
TAYA=>The news is saying the war is over.
CHRIS=>It's not over.
TAYA=>But are we winning?
CHRIS=>I don't know...
CHRIS=>Hey, some help here-- She's crying--
COLTON=>But I want that one-- 78.
CHRIS=>You don't get to choose, bubba.
COLTON=>But I don't like it! I want that one--
CHRIS=>You get what it gives you. That's how this thing works.
CHRIS=>Don't do this. Get up. Come on--
RECEPTIONIST=>Chris Kyle, your truck is ready.
CHRIS=>Get off the floor. Right now--
MAN'S VOICE=>Excuse me, sir.
YOUNG MAN=>Are you... "Chief" Chris Kyle?
CHRIS=>That's me.
YOUNG MAN=>Sorry to intrude, sir, but we met in Fallujah. You saved my life.
CHRIS=>Did I--?
YOUNG MAN/VETERAN=>Yes, sir. My name is Mads. We were trapped in a house when you showed up with 1st Marines. You carried me out. 79.
CHRIS=>Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up?
MADS/YOUNG VETERAN=>Great, sir. I'm grateful to be alive. It hasn't been easy but--
MADS=>It cost lots of guys more than a leg.
CHRIS=>Did you lose some friends?
MADS=>That too, but I'm talking about guys that lived. They made it back but they're just not back. They can't seem to get right.
CHRIS=>Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that.
MADS=>You should come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it. They all know who The Legend is.
MADS=>I bet you missed your daddy when he was gone. But can I tell you something? Your dad is a hero. He saved my life-- He helped me get home to my little girl.
MADS=>So thank you for loaning him to us, li'l man. I wouldn't be here without him.
MADS=>My family thanks you for your service.
TAYA=>I'm making memories by myself. I have no one to share them with.
CHRIS=>We have the rest of our lives for that.
TAYA=>When does that start? Even when you're here you're not here.
TAYA=>I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back.
CHRIS=>We can wait. They can't.
TAYA=>If you think this war isn't changing you you're wrong.
TAYA=>You can only circle the flame so long.
BIGGLES=>--we are tailing the Butcher's courier, turning onto Maryland Street. Over.
BIGGLES=>I bought the ring.
CHRIS=>Here?
BIGGLES=>They're cheaper here.
CHRIS=>You want some savage's ring? What if it's a blood diamond?
BIGGLES=>What the fuck do you care? You spilled more blood than anyone!
CHRIS=>Not for a rock.
BIGGLES=>Whatever, man.
CHRIS=>Ease off, don't get too close. You gonna tell her where it came from?
BIGGLES=>Hell no! I'll tell her I got from Zales.
BIGGLES=>Still with us cookie? 82.
"D"=>Half a block back and we are wet and ready, Big Giggles.
MARC LEE=>20 years from now, we'll have a reunion and you'll be married to a dude.
"D"=>As long as you cook and clean.
CHRIS=>The Butcher has his peepers out.
BIGGLES=>This motherfucker is Keyser Söze. Next time you got a shot try not to miss.
CHRIS=>I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn't have to save your ass--
BIGGLES=>Whatever helps you sleep at night.
BIGGLES=>You gonna be my best man?
CHRIS=>Is it just me? Or other guys too?
BIGGLES=>You fucking egomaniac--
BIGGLES=>Rooftop, twelve-o'clock--
CHRIS=>Get me a shot, grandma.
BIGGLES=>That should do it.
CHRIS=>What the fuck!? How'd he survive--
BIGGLES=>Rubber junk-man's got your horseshoe.
"D"=>--need a two block perimeter around the area. No one gets in or out. 84.
BIGGLES=>Clear.
CHRIS=>We're headed to the roof. Secure the van.
"D"=>The Butcher is building a 7-11?
MARC LEE=>No ammo, no jihad.
BIGGLES=>How the hell'd he make that?
CHRIS=>He didn't--
BIGGLES=>So much for leading us to the Butcher.
CHRIS=>So much for him having my horseshoe. 85.
CHRIS=>She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent.
BIGGLES=>She's not like that.
CHRIS=>They're all like that.
BIGGLES=>It's giant, bro. Four karats. It had to belong to one of Saddam's bitches--
CHRIS=>No!--
CHRIS=>Biggles is down. Man down. No, buddy. No! Stay with me-- 86.
CHRIS=>Cover! I need cover. He's picking us off.
BIGGLES=>I'm got it. I got it-- I can walk--
BIGGLES=>--I'm sorry--
CHRIS=>You got nothing to be sorry for. I shouldn't have had us up there--
BIGGLES=>Am I gonna die?
DAUBER=>We'll rub a little dirt in it, get you a sip of water, you'll be fine.
BIGGLES=>--it was always gonna be me--
CHRIS=>Coulda been any of us. Just hang on-- 87.
BIGGLES=>Not you. Not the Legend. You lucky fuck--
CHRIS=>Don't die, Ryan. You hold on--
"D"=>Did you see where it came from?
CHRIS=>He was 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper makes that shot.
COL. JONES=>Will he make it?
DAUBER=>Doesn't look good, Master Chief.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>That's the first SEAL hit, sir.
"D"=>Fuck!
COL. JONES=>A Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Marine units that covered your exfil are still engaged there. 88.
COL. JONES=>I can understand if you want to stand- down and regroup. It's up to you.
MARC LEE=>Lex talionis... Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.
CHRIS=>We're going back.
MARC LEE=>Two clicks out. Lock and load.
CHRIS=>For Biggles.
MARC LEE=>Courtyard is clear. Moving.
CHRIS=>Some stronghold. Move.
MARC LEE=>Clear.
MARC LEE=>Somebody left in a hurry.
CHRIS=>You sure we got the right address--
DAUBER=>Fuck--
MARC LEE=>Contact--
CHRIS=>Marc--
MARC LEE'S MOM=>"Glory is something some men chase and others find themselves stumbling upon."
MARC'S LEE MOM=>"My question is when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade?"
MARC LEE=>"When does it become an unjustified means by which one is completely consumed."
TAYA=>Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you?
TAYA=>Chris? I want to know what you thought of his letter...
CHRIS=>An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush.
CHRIS=>But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. He let go and he paid the price for it. 92.
CHRIS=>If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. You'd be alright.
TAYA=>Do you want to die? Is that what it is?
CHRIS=>No.
TAYA=>Then tell me why do you do it. I want to understand.
CHRIS=>I do it for you. To protect you.
TAYA=>No you don't. I'm here. Your family is here. Your children have no father--
CHRIS=>Without this, there's nothing.
TAYA=>Bullshit. It's not about us anymore. You don't know when to quit. It's over- You did your part! We sacrificed enough. Let somebody else go--
CHRIS=>I could never live with myself.
TAYA=>You find a way! You have to. I need you to be human again. I need you here. If you leave again, we might not be here when you get back.
CHRIS=>I know.
CHRIS=>Hey, buddy--
BIGGLES=>Chris? Where are you?
CHRIS=>I'm right here just give me a minute-- Just blind as a bat, huh?
BIGGLES=>Yeah... It fucking blows. They're gonna fix my face though.
CHRIS=>That's good. Your face always needed a little fixing.
CHRIS=>I heard you proposed? Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales?
BIGGLES=>Naw, I bought a new one. A small one. Her dad helped me out.
CHRIS=>Nice.
BIGGLES=>She wouldn't leave me, bro. I told her to go-- but she wouldn't leave. 94.
BIGGLES=>She's getting a raw fucking deal.
CHRIS=>No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. All four inches.
BIGGLES=>I'm glad this happened to me and not you. No way you could've handled it.
CHRIS=>You're probably right.
BIGGLES=>They say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. Military history.
CHRIS=>Is that what they say?
CHRIS=>The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City.
BIGGLES=>You're not going back?
CHRIS=>We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down.
BIGGLES=>You don't have to do this.
CHRIS=>Yes I do. You're my brother and they're going to pay for what they did to you.
BIGGLES=>Hooyah, Legend. Hooyah--
MARINE LT.=>The Legend, right? I heard you killed 101 men your last tour. The hajis call you The Devil of Ramadi.
MARINE LT.=>So how many kills you got now?
CHRIS KYLE=>You have to ask the Navy. I lost count.
"D"=>We been shot off position three nights in a row. Fallujah was bad, Ramadi was worse but this shit is fuckin biblical.
CHRIS=>Any other Punishers here?
"D"=>Squirrel cycled out. Dauber was coming back but his wife knocked him up. And if I bring home another rug my old lady'll murder my ass. Teams and shit.
CHRIS=>Teams and shit.
"D"=>That Biggles news hit hard.
CHRIS=>I know. I visited him before I left. That fucker can't see shit.
"D"=>Bro... Biggles is gone. He was in surgery yesterday and he died on the table.
TAYA VOICEMAIL=>-This is Taya, I can't get to the phone so please leave a message.
CHRIS MESSAGE=>It's me. I'm just calling to hear your voice. I'm missing you guys. I been thinking about some things you said. 97.
CHRIS MESSAGE (VO=>Tell the kids I love them.
CHRIS MESSAGE=>I love you too.
CHRIS=>Don't do it--
CHRIS=>--please God--
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Brass believe this T-wall will end the war by trapping remaining AQI inside. But we got a sniper picking off contractors from deep behind the wall.
CHRIS=>How deep?
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Roughly 1000 meters.
CHRIS=>Is it Mustafa?
RANGER ONE=>Moo-who?
"D"=>The sniper who shot our boy Biggles.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>He can be whoever you need him to be, we just need him dead.
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>We'll shuttle you six blocks north into enemy territory which will put you right up under his nose when he takes his shot.
DELTA SNIPER=>In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Bring your goggles, Bambi. We need to shut this shooter down.
CHRIS=>What was that--
MARINE GATE GUARD=>This is east gate. We've got an unknown vehicle coming up fast.
MARINE GATE GUARD=>Get out of the car! Now--
GATE GUARD=>Step away from the car!
GATE GUARD=>Drop it! Right there! Drop him now--
TRIBAL LEADER=>Tell the devil we found his Butcher. We will protect ourselves now.
CLOSE ON BUTCHER=>100.
RANGER ONE=>The streets are crawling. Hold your fire.
"D"=>Enter the fuckin sandman.
CHRIS=>No-- It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall.
RANGER ONE=>Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got uglies right below us--
CHRIS=>I got something. 1900 yards out.
RANGER ONE=>You can't even see that far out. Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.
"D"=>He's right, Legend. No bueno.
CHRIS=>Correction. 2100 yards out.
"D"=>That's a mile. Impossible shot. 102.
CHRIS=>It's him.
CHRIS=>This is Charlie 7 Bravo. We have eyes on the target. Initiate QRF. Over.
"D"=>Can you confirm it's him.
CHRIS=>He has eyes on our guys.
RANGER ONE=>Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out. You will stand the fuck down--
"D"=>It's your call, Chris.
"D"=>If you got it, take it.
RANGER ONE=>Negative, negative--
CHRIS=>Aim small. Aim small.
CHRIS=>For Biggles.
CHRIS KYLE=>Tango down.
RANGER ONE=>You just fucked us, Legend-- We need Stryker and QRF units, ASAP.
CHRIS KYLE=>He was on our boys and I took him out.
RANGER ONE=>We are fucked like a football bat.
"D"=>Mission accomplished. Biggles be proud.
ROOFTOP=>104.
CHRIS=>There are two ways onto the roof. We cover both stairways and conserve ammo.
"D"=>If you FNGs shit your pants, don't stop shooting. Scoop and shoot. Scoop and--
CHRIS=>Conserve--
RANGER ONE=>Negative, negative, danger-close, they're all over us--
"D"=>Drop motherfucker! Drop!
"D"=>3 o'clock. Loading. Last mag.
RANGER ONE=>QRF is stuck three blocks out.
MARINE GUNNER=>I'm out of ammo-- 105.
RANGER ONE=>I don't wanna get dragged in the street--
"D"=>Call it in. Light us up.
CHRIS=>Do it. Call in our coordinates.
RANGER ONE=>This is Rio Two Bravo, requesting ordinance drop. GRID 04837959. I know my fucking position! They're right on top of us. Drop it!
MARINE SNIPER=>White-side!
MASTER CHIEF MARTIN=>Tell the pilot to turn it loose.
PILOT=>3-4, copy that. 30 seconds out. 106.
"D"=>You're up--
CHRIS=>--you got four rounds.
TAYA=>Hello?
TAYA=>Hello?
CHRIS=>Hey baby--
TAYA=>Chris-- What's the noise?
TAYA=>I can't hear you--
CHRIS=>I'm ready to come home. I'm ready...
TAYA=>What's happening--
CHRIS=>--I'm coming home. Can you hear me?
TAYA=>Chris--
CHRIS=>Go, go, let's move--
CHRIS=>Stryker-3, what's your location--
CHRIS=>Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- Go. Straight ahead. Go--
GUNNER=>BDUs-- That's them! Drop the ramp.
"D"=>Where's Chris? He was just--
"D"=>--stop the rig, man! Stop--
DRIVER=>I don't see him--
CHRIS=>--hello?
TAYA=>Where are you? I got a weird message that you were on a plane?
CHRIS=>Yeah, I got out early.
TAYA=>So are you in Germany, or--
CHRIS=>I'm here, I'm stateside.
TAYA=>You're home? What are you doing?
CHRIS=>I guess I just needed a minute.
TAYA=>Chris, the kids are dying to see you. It's been nine months.
CHRIS=>Yeah, I know... Me too. I'm coming.
TAYA=>Are you alright?
CHRIS=>Yeah. I'm good.
TAYA=>Then come home. We miss you.
CHRIS=>Okay.
TAYA=>Chris...?
TAYA=>--his game is Saturdays. He's the tallest kid on the team. The doctor said he could be six-four. I can't wait for you to see him play. Maybe you could even coach?
TAYA=>McKenna's about to lose that tooth and I'm worried she's going to swallow it. She said she'd let you pull it. But only you.
TAYA=>I wish you'd talk to me, Chris.
TAYA=>I just feel this dark space between us and I don't know how to reach you.
BOY'S MOM=>Get him off! Get away--
TAYA=>No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know!
DOCTOR=>Maybe you saw things, or did some things over there that you wish you hadn't--
CHRIS=>That's not me.
DOCTOR=>What's not you?
CHRIS=>I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save.
NAVY DOCTOR=>You want to save more guys, walk down any hall in this hospital. We got plenty soldiers that need saving. I'm going to recommend Zoloft and--
CHRIS=>How's it feel?
WYNN=>Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck up my shot. Stay still, man.
WYNN=>Bulls-eye, boy! Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back. 113.
WYNN=>Why you spend all this time with us? I know you got a family.
CHRIS=>I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and--
WYNN=>Seriously man. Why do you do it.
CHRIS=>We gotta take care of our own.
CHRIS=>Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air.
TAYA=>Can I tell you something.
CHRIS=>Tell it to the judge.
TAYA=>I'm proud of you and I don't say it enough. I feel blessed. You're an incredible father and-- I feel lucky to have my husband back.
CHRIS=>We could lock the doors. They can't get out of the yard.
TAYA=>I know how hard you fought to get here. 115.
CHRIS=>You're worth fighting for.
TAYA=>Did you pleat those jeans?
CHRIS=>Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle.
TAYA=>Well, you're just a regular old cowboy again, aren't you?
CHRIS=>I meant what I said about locking the doors.
TAYA=>Aren't you and Chad going to the range?
CHRIS=>Not for four minutes.
TAYA=>Is that all it takes.
CHRIS=>It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you.
TAYA=>Who are you taking out?
CHRIS=>This Marine. His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help.
TAYA=>Well don't be late for dinner.
COLTON=>Dad, you want to play Skylander? Please-- 116.
CHRIS=>I gotta go do something but when I get back, okay? But you have to let me win.
COLTON=>No way.
MCKENNA=>Poke the bear--
MCKENNA=>No. You're supposed to roar. Like Grrr.
CHRIS=>I should get going...
CHRIS=>Look after our women, Bubba. Love you, babe.
TAYA=>Love you too.
