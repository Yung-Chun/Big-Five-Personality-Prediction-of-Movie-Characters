HOTEL MANAGER O.S.=>Hey, you! You gotta message.
WHITE=>What?
MANAGER O.S.=>Message in d'box! You deaf?
MANAGER O.S.=>Got my money?
WHITE=>What? I... How long have I been here?
MANAGER O.S.=>Jeez, too damn long if you ask me! What about the two weeks y'owe me...
VOICE O.S.=>What is your name... What is your name...
MANAGER O.S.=>Hey!
MANAGER O.S.=>Yeah. Well, y'better be.
BUMSTEAD=>I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty... It's - um - well, inconvenient...
BUMSTEAD=>Yes, sir... I understand... Yes... But, I've done fine so far without an assistant...
BUMSTEAD=>But... But I... I... Nine-thirty. Yes.
VOICE O.S.=>There you are.
MYSTERY MAN=>You are lost, yes?
MYSTERY MAN=>Co-operate. Do not make this difficult.
MYSTERY MAN=>You will not shoot, yes. There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness...
BUMSTEAD=>Good evening, sir.
STROMBOLI=>Yes. This way.
MORTICIAN=>Welcome, gentlemen. Youíre early. Here for the examination, right?
STROMBOLI=>The handiwork of an extremely sick individual.
STROMBOLI=>Youíve read the reports. Not much to go on. We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case... Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.
STROMBOLI=>Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
BUMSTEAD=>Germs, sir. These places are full of them.
STROMBOLI=>I see. One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
MORTICIAN=>You can say that again.
BUMSTEAD=>What about Thompson, sir? Wasnít this his case?
STROMBOLI=>Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing. Anyway he isnít with us any longer. The case is yours. Go through his files. Take what you need. By the way, howís your mother?
BUMSTEAD=>Sheís getting better, thanks. She...
STROMBOLI=>Letís go, Bumstead. So much to do and so little time.
MANAGER=>What for?
WOMAN=>We call.
BUMSTEAD=>A real shame...
VOICE=>Fifty-six... Fifty-six...
WHITE=>What? Who are you?
FREDRICK=>Címon, letís go! We donít have any time.
WHITE=>Hold it a minute. Letís start at the beginning, huh?
FRERICK=>Shit! Quick! Run!
WHITE=>Shit.
COP=>We got another one upstairs
BUMSTEAD=>Dammit!
MISS CRENSHAW=>Sorry, sir.
BUMSTEAD=>Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Patricia Crenshaw.
MISS CRENSHAW=>Iím your new assistant.
BUMSTEAD=>I didnít requisition a secretary.
MISS CRENSHAW=>The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
MISS CRENSHAW=>Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
BUMSTEAD=>Good.
MISS CRENSHAW=>You wonít regret this, sir.
BUMSTEAD=>Fine.
WHITE=>Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing?
LIBRARIAN=>Which would you like first?
WHITE=>Okay. Newspapers.
LIBRARIAN=>Are you alright?
LIBRARIAN=>Donít mention it...
WHITE=>Iím trying to reach nine zero eight triple two. I canít get through... What?!... Shit!
WHITE=>It is?... Which area is that number listed in?... Is that near the ocean?... The ocean... Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?... WHITE. Seventeen? All Johns? I see... Never mind.
CRENSHAW O.S.=>Coffee?
BUMSTEAD=>What? I donít drink coffee. A cup of tea would be good. Milk and no sugar.
CRENSHAW=>Making progress?
BUMSTEAD=>These are the investigations of a madman. He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever. This is a mess. A horrible mess. Itís the second time now.
BUMSTEAD=>Look at this!
BUMSTEAD=>You typed this report?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Yes, sir. Anything wrong?
BUMSTEAD=>Wrong? Look at this!
MISS CRENSHAW=>It seems fine.
BUMSTEAD=>Fine? Look here!
BUMSTEAD=>How can I submit this?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Iím sorry...
BUMSTEAD=>Do you wash your hands before you type things?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Why, yes.
BUMSTEAD=>Well be more careful, please.
CRENSHAW=>Inspector Bumsteadís office... Yes... Yes...
MISS CRENSHAW=>Yes, sir. The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now.
STROMBOLI O.S.=>Enter!
STROMBOLI=>What is it?
BUMSTEAD=>A formality. I need to speak with Thompson. Officially I need your written permission.
STROMBOLI=>Why do you want to speak to him?
BUMSTEAD=>A hunch. He might be able to...
BUMSTEAD=>Itís extremely important to my investigation...
STROMBOLI=>Iíll be the judge of that. Anything else?
BUMSTEAD=>Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
BUMSTEAD=>Lost something?
STROMBOLI=>What makes you think that! If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
WHITE=>I need something to keep me awake.
BARBER=>Looks like you need a haircut to me.
WHITE=>Thanks. Just some pills.
BARBER=>Only two bucks. Shave as well...
BARBER=>Relax. Sure!
BARBER=>Tell you what - let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Canít argue at that!
WHITE=>Sell maps?
BARBER=>What of?
WHITE=>The city. I need to get to the ocean.
BARBER=>Nope. No maps. Ocean, huh? On vacation?
BARBER=>Grandpa thought customers might like some mood music.
BARBER=>You still look familiar. Itís driving me nuts! Sure I donít know ya from somewhere?
BARBER=>Mnunn. Cold lately. That night, couple weeks ago. That was real cold. Remember that?
WHITE=>Not really...
BARBER=>Yeah, Iím like that. Senility says the wife. But she sure canít complain. Heh. The erector set still works good. And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead. Feel it! All mine!
GRANDPA=>Yes! Feeeeel it!
PRIEST=>Beware! The night is deadly. There is a criminal among us.
PRIEST=>It could be she! The innocent across the street!
PRIEST=>Or the temptress next door!
PRIEST=>Or mister nervy stranger at the back!
PRIEST=>You are thinking it could be anyone? And youíre right! Why, it could even be Mother!
GAUNT WOMAN=>He took my little boy! Iíll rip out his eyes!
OLDER PRIEST=>You have sinned?
WHITE=>NO. Ah...
PRIEST=>I am listening.
PRIEST=>You fornicated?
WHITE=>No. I, ah...
PRIEST=>You seem restless.
WHITE=>Someoneís after me.
PRIEST=>Then we must call the police.
WHITE=>No. I mean... that isnít necessary.
PRIEST=>I see. Then who is after you? What sins have you committed?
WHITE=>Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
PRIEST=>Youíre the murderer? Yes! That must be it! Donít kill me!
WHITE=>Shut up! Listen. Walk out quietly. Understand?
PRIEST=>Donít kill me!
WHITE=>Shut up!
PRIEST=>Please...
MYSTERY MAN=>It will be inconvenient, yes...
BUMSTEAD=>How long have you been here?
COP=>Maybe ten minutes... Thatís strange.
BUMSTEAD=>Spinning backwards?
COP=>Yours too?
BUMSTEAD=>I want prints over here...
WHITE=>I want to see the doctor. It's important.
NURSE=>What time was your appointment?
WHITE=>No idea. Just get him...
SCHREBER=>You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?
WHITE=>You know something about me?
SCHREBER=>Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try.
WHITE=>You think I haven't been trying! It's like there was never anything there. Just water.
SCHREBER=>Water?
WHITE=>Waves... A beach. A woman whispering. That's all. I need to stay awake. Do you have any pills?
SCHREBER=>What does she say? The woman.
WHITE=>Asks my name. Over and over. Just like a broken record. Only thing is, I can't answer. I've no idea what my name is.
SCHREBER=>Your name is John White.
WHITE=>That's what people keep telling me.
SCHREBER=>Bad dreams?
WHITE=>Yes.
SCHREBER=>Tell me about them...
SCHREBER=>If you like.
WHITE=>You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
SCHREBER=>That's right. I am your doctor.
WHITE=>Known me for long?
SCHREBER=>Well...
SCHREBER=>I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that?
WHITE=>I told you, I can't remember a thing!
SCHREBER=>We won't get anywhere like this. Please. Let's take things in easy steps...
SCHREBER=>Put simply... a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium... complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges. Without going into detail... the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla...
WHITE=>Did she drown? The woman you told me about?
SCHREBER=>Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
WHITE=>Horrible...
SCHREBER=>You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something.
SCHREBER=>Formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.
SCHREBER=>We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting.
WHITE=>I'm nothing then.
SCHREBER=>Anything but, my friend.
SCHREBER=>It feels no pain.
WHITE=>Can I get my life back?
SCHREBER=>Maybe.
SCHREBER=>We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory.
SCHREBER=>And then there is procedural memory.
SCHREBER=>Follow?
SCHREBER=>Research on simple animals can be... useful. To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example. I am building an experiment with hamsters next. Cute little things.
SCHREBER=>Listen to me talk! You must be hungry.
SCHREBER=>Whole damn wing lost power. Wiring's old. Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are.
SCHREBER=>Ah. Beautiful! Head and all! Just how I like 'em!
WHITE=>I'm sorry. About before.
SCHREBER=>I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help.
SCHREBER=>It can't wait?
WHITE=>Still kicking, huh?
SCHREBER O.S.=>How are things in here?
SCHREBER=>Ah, nearly done. So tell me about your dreams. I'm very interested.
WHITE=>Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind. You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing...
SCHREBER=>Ah, our friends in black... they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.
SCHREBER=>I know everything about you. You have no choice but to trust me.
SCHREBER=>Scarey, isn't it?
SCHREBER=>Are you feeling alright?
SCHREBER=>What are you doing?
WHITE=>I have to go...
SCHREBER=>You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about...
SCHREBER=>You're tired. You need to lie down.
WHITE=>Those pills...
SCHREBER=>Leave it!
SCHREBER=>Damn! Whoever it is - get rid of them!
NURSE=>Keys.
SCHREBER=>I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.
BUMSTEAD=>Hold it!
BUMSTEAD=>Police. Nobody move.
SCHREBER=>He tried to kill me!
BUMSTEAD=>Shut up! Everybody stay calm...
BUMSTEAD=>What's that?
BUMSTEAD=>Dammit! I'm curious? How many so far?
BUMSTEAD=>The six year old. Sure, you remember.
BUMSTEAD=>You sure have demonstrated a great deal of... imagination. The baby was the best though. Several cops lost their lunch over that one. Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech...
BUMSTEAD=>We count seven so far. Anyone we missed?
VOICE=>Inspector Bumstead... Inspector...
BUMSTEAD=>What is it, Crenshaw?
CRENSHAW=>Just reminding you... your eight pee em...
BUMSTEAD=>Dammit. Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch. It needs fixing.
CRENSHAW=>Yes sir.
WHITE=>Where are we going?
BUMSTEAD=>Shut-up.
BUMSTEAD=>Gesundheit!
WHITE=>What are we doing here?
BUMSTEAD=>Get out.
BUMSTEAD=>Wait here.
BUMSTEAD=>Bumstead. I'm here to see my mother.
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Left - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Right - profile.
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Move - forward.
VOICE=>Move - forward.
VOICE=>Watch - the - wheel.
VOICE=>Move - forward.
VOICE=>Stand - behind - the - screen.
VOICE=>Move - forward.
VOICE=>Face - the - wall.
VOICE=>What's your name?
VOICE=>Oh, no?
STROMBOLI=>John...
STROMBOLI=>...Murderer.
STROMBOLI=>You'll sign a confession?
GUARD=>Visitor.
SCHREBER=>Please, stay calm.
SCHREBER=>You're innocent... You didn't kill anyone.
SCHREBER=>Listen to what I have to say. Decide for yourself.
BUMSTEAD=>What's he doing here?
COP=>Says he is the man's doctor... You know...
BUMSTEAD=>I know it's his doctor... I need the file on.. Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.=>Schreber. Yes. Isn't that his doctor?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Yes. An "h".
SCHREBER=>The men in black - they're the killers.
WHITE=>You're a liar!
SCHREBER=>No, it's the truth.
WHITE=>So you're telling me the truth this time? Is that it!
SCHREBER=>If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
WHITE=>Not that again...
SCHREBER=>Everyone get's one - very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything...
SCHREBER=>Anton - I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. I arranged it. It was a lie from the beginning. It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. You have been left - blank.
SCHREBER=>You can change this, all this. But you must take it.
WHITE=>You've been working too hard.
SCHREBER=>Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
WHITE=>Why?
SCHREBER=>Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it.
SCHREBER=>Concentrate. Imagine the syringe rising. Picture it floating above the table.
SCHREBER=>Do it!
WHITE=>It's a trick.
SCHREBER=>No it isn't. You are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and...
WHITE=>Oh, sorry...
MECHANICAL VOICE=>Your - time - is - up.
BUMSTEAD=>Doctor! What brings you here?
SCHREBER=>Just visiting my patient.
BUMSTEAD=>Really? And how is his state of mind?
SCHREBER=>He's seriously disturbed...
BUMSTEAD=>You seem a little edgy. Everything okay?
SCHREBER=>Yes, of course. Everything's fine...
BUMSTEAD=>To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this. Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
SCHREBER=>Loose ends?
VOICE O.S.=>Bumstead!
STROMBOLI=>I need to speak to you. Immediately.
STROMBOLI=>Bumstead, these... er, gentlemen are here to collect White.
BUMSTEAD=>This is highly irregular. I have a right to know.
STROMBOLI=>Yes. That's right. He's ill - he needs expert help.
BUMSTEAD=>I see...
BUMSTEAD=>He's been a little angel...
STROMBOLI=>If you could show them to the holding cell now.
BUMSTEAD=>Yes, sir. I'm sorry... But I don't understand how it was possible. The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
STROMBOLI=>(shouts at cringing
COP)=>How could you have been so stupid?
COP=>I'm sorry, sir.
STROMBOLI=>Alright, get out.
STROMBOLI=>You stay.
STROMBOLI=>Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. This case is very important to me. Just a little warning: I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
BUMSTEAD=>Yes, sir.
NEWS READER O.S.=>...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended.
NEWS READER O.S.=>...and now for a message from LUMP-O food products...
JAPANESE WOMAN=>He's up here! He raped me! Hurry! Before he kills again!
WHITE=>That's me. I'm a shadow.
WHITE=>Do I look like a murderer to you?
WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.=>Yes?... Who is this?... Who's there?...
WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.=>John? Is that you?
WHITE=>Who is this? What do you know about me?
WOMAN=>John.
WOMAN=>Please believe me. It's me, John. Your WIFE. I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you - now you want to just send me away again...
WHITE=>I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
WIFE=>It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
WHITE=>How do you know I'm innocent?
WIFE=>Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
WHITE=>I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
WIFE=>They're dead, John.
WIFE=>You have an uncle. You were very close.
WIFE=>This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you.
WHITE=>What's your name?
ELIZABETH=>I want to help...
WHITE=>Alright. Here...
WHITE=>Know this place?
WHITE=>How do I get there? Tell me.
WIFE=>That's easy. You...
ELIZABETH=>...strange, I forgot.
WHITE=>Yes. Very strange.
THOMPSON=>Go away!
BUMSTEAD O.S.=>Open up, Thompson. It's me...
THOMPSON=>Bumstead?
THOMPSON=>Can't let you in... sorry.
BUMSTEAD=>I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
THOMPSON=>Not that. Anything else.
BUMSTEAD=>You don't look so well... C'mon, let me in Thompson.
THOMPSON=>I can't talk about that. As long as you understand, that's all.
THOMPSON=>Pull up some garbage - make yourself at home.
THOMPSON=>They've taken my mind, my memories...
BUMSTEAD=>What? Who has?
THOMPSON=>Is that your idea of a joke? I don't remember... Take my advice, Bumstead. Get off this case. Now.
BUMSTEAD=>What is going on?
THOMPSON=>Get away! Leave me alone!
THOMPSON=>It's - it's disgusting, I know...
BUMSTEAD=>Jesus! We have to get you to a doctor...
THOMPSON=>No... No doctor...
BUMSTEAD=>But... How long has this been happening?
THOMPSON=>A few days... a few weeks - dunno, I can't remember. Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again... Now, please leave me alone.
MYSTERY MAN=>The line of junction between two edges!
MYSTERY MAN=>We have located him. Now is the time, yes.
MYSTERY MAN=>Let the tuning commence!
COP=>All the same entry wounds. It's definitely him. She lives... lived here. A prostitute.
BUMSTEAD=>The other one?
COP=>His wife.
BUMSTEAD=>Jesus. Small world. Where's the photographer?
COP=>No one available.
YOUNG COP=>They won't come out.
COP=>We'll interrogate them anyway.
COP=>This is the family of the victim - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed...
COP=>Oh, yes...
COP=>They don't speak English...
BUMSTEAD=>How will we interrogate them?
COP=>Well, sir... I don't know exactly.
BUMSTEAD=>It's alright. I won't hurt you.
MISTER BLACK=>I have called this meeting for a purpose, yes? It is clear to you we are - unhappy, yes?
SCHREBER=>Yes, of course. I...
MISTER BLACK=>The tuning failed - when our agents arrived he was gone. He knows things - predicts things. Explain to us, Doctor. Why is the situation this way? Yes?
SCHREBER=>I'm not certain I fully understand myself...
MISTER BLACK=>No excuses, dearest Doctor! Answers. Yes?
MISTER BLACK=>You said this would be containable! Nothing works this time. Why is this so?
MYSTERY MEN=>Why! Why!
SCHREBER=>I - ah - I... it's a little cold in here don't you think?
MISTER BLACK=>We must find him. This is your responsibility.
BUMSTEAD=>Who is it?
MISS CRENSHAW=>Won't say. Says he must talk to you.
BUMSTEAD=>Put it through...
BUMSTEAD=>This is Bumstead. Who is this?
BUMSTEAD=>I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
MISS CRENSHAW=>Yes, sir. Everything?
BUMSTEAD=>All the important stuff. Wrap it up for me.
BUMSTEAD=>Please - I'm in a hurry.
BUMSTEAD=>Why give yourself up?
WHITE=>I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.
BUMSTEAD=>That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
WHITE=>I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there.
WHITE=>People... after me.
BUMSTEAD=>Who?
WHITE=>I don't know who they are.
BUMSTEAD=>Why are they after you?
WHITE=>Don't know that either.
BUMSTEAD=>Don't know much, do you?
VOICE=>What is your name... What is your name...
MISTER BLACK=>You have duplicated the personality, yes.
MISTER BLACK=>I hear a clock in my head, and I like it!
MISTER BLACK=>A world in our likeness!
MEN=>A world in our likeness!
BUMSTEAD=>Please. Not that way. If you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean.
BUMSTEAD=>Everything the department knows about John White is in this. Here. Excuse me for a moment.
BUMSTEAD=>That stuff helpful?
BUMSTEAD=>You're case has been driving me crazy. You see, I pride myself on being thorough. There's too many loose ends with your case. Thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. What do you know about these men in black?
WHITE=>If you shoot them here... you can kill them. They're not people - like us - got insects in their heads... Got any disinfectant?
BUMSTEAD=>Here. Careful with your trousers. That stuff stains.
BUMSTEAD=>Here.
BUMSTEAD=>Any idea what part the Doctor plays in this business?
BUMSTEAD=>Let's try and find out, shall we. Lace is untied.
BARBER=>He with you shortly, sir...
EEEEEEEEK... AHHHHHHH!...=>SHHHHIIIITTTT!... FUUUUCKER!!
BUMSTEAD=>I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you. It started with two little girls. Twins. Used to play with them when I was young. Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why...
BUMSTEAD=>They didn't have faces.
WHITE=>What?
BUMSTEAD=>That's right. Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. No mistake. I just hadn't remembered it that way. Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. That's not all. Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event. Then I would turn the lights off. Sit down in a comfortable chair... And study each detail of this subject.
BUMSTEAD=>Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me...
BUMSTEAD=>Is there anything you haven't told me about this business? Even the most insignificant thing?
BUMSTEAD=>Go on.
WHITE=>Well. The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean. The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
BUMSTEAD=>Why, that's ridiculous. You just...
BUMSTEAD=>We'll get to the bottom of this. I mean it.
BUMSTEAD=>I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. Tall fellow. No hair. Rather pale skin...
SCHREBER=>I don't know what you're talking about.
BUMSTEAD=>That's surprising. He was leaving your office at the time...
SCHREBER=>You are mistaken.
WHITE=>What are you hiding?
SCHREBER=>Nothing. I don't know anything!
SCHREBER=>Please, they'll kill me...
BUMSTEAD=>I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
SCHREBER=>In there.
BUMSTEAD=>Just like that?
BUMSTEAD=>What is this place?
SCHREBER=>You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself.
WHITE=>Look.
SCHREBER=>Put them on.
SCHREBER=>Get in. Hurry.
WHITE=>Where do you think this goes?
BUMSTEAD=>It sure isn't the fun-fair.
SCHREBER=>Follow me, and do exactly as I do.
MEN=>NIGHT OF THE EYE! NIGHT OF THE EYE!
BUMSTEAD=>What?
SCHREBER=>The eye. Master of time and space!
BUMSTEAD=>The Eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye!
BUMSTEAD=>Nothing to it...
WHITE=>Eye... eye, captain!
BUMSTEAD=>Was that for real down there?
SCHREBER=>I'm afraid so.
BUMSTEAD=>What the hell is that?
BUMSTEAD=>Quick. My car.
WHITE=>What now?
BUMSTEAD=>This ocean business... I know where I can find a map. I need to go back to the station. Where will you be?
WHITE=>I'll go see an uncle of mine. Five - one - eight - three - double six - three...
BUMSTEAD=>Good. Uh-oh...
BUMSTEAD=>Take mine.
PUPPET ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!... HA-HA-HA-HA-=>HA!!
BUMSTEAD=>Jump!
TICKET SELLER=>Yeah. That's what I said! What..?
WHITE=>I'm looking for this address.
TICKET SELLER=>Upstairs. Through there.
VOICE O.S.=>John?
MAN=>Are you alright? What are you doing here? Is this one of your jokes, John? It's been so long, I thought you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?
WHITE=>Uncle... Karl.
KARL=>And this is me again about - um - I would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot. Now just behind the wall is the hotel I stayed at - sweet little place...
WHITE=>Yes? Oh, it's you... Yes... My uncle apparently... Just looking at some memories... You have? That's good.
BUMSTEAD=>At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean... The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors - everything just, well, ends - only thing would be drill a hole. But then, I saw it, one door, just one... Inside a tenement building...
WHITE=>Where can we meet?... Alright. Good...
KARL=>Look! This is a good one!
WHITE=>What is that door?
KARL=>Which one?
WHITE=>There. Behind the cabinet. Where does it go?
KARL=>Such a joker! Like your father.
WHITE=>No. Have a look.
WHITE=>You see it?
KARL=>Yes.
WHITE=>Where does it lead?
KARL=>It must be a closet or something.
KARL=>Don't trip over. It's dark up there.
KARL=>John, I didn't see you there.
KARL=>What is that?
KARL=>Filthy beast! Shoo! Go on! Shoo!
WHITE=>No!
BUMSTEAD=>I can't wait any longer...
NURSE=>I'm sorry. I told you, she is being examined...
NURSE=>Mister Bumstead!
SURGEON=>We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs. Yes.
SURGEON=>Ah, Inspector Bumstead! We are glad you are here - I'm afraid we have done all we can. Yes. Your Mother has passed. Yes.
BUMSTEAD=>But she was getting better...
SURGEON=>We are sorry. The cancer - it was fatal.
BUMSTEAD=>She doesn't have cancer.
SURGEON=>We knew that. Yes. Anyway - she is dead.
MYSTERY MAN=>You will obey us, yes. In your mind there is a dark space...
WHITE=>Nice knowing you.
BUMSTEAD=>White?
BUMSTEAD=>Dammit.
STROMBOLI=>Why do you always have to find things out the hard way! Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot? I told you, didn't I? These people are not playing games, Bumstead. They can do anything they want, don't you understand?
STROMBOLI=>Time for that early retirement, Bumstead. Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid.
FIGURE=>Ahhh... it hurts!...
WHITE=>What happened to you?
SCHREBER=>I'm... being... punished.
SCHREBER=>I had to - ahhhh - find you... I.. I...
WHITE=>What is it?
SCHREBER=>We are... living in their dreams...
SCHREBER=>Insect... dreams...
BUMSTEAD=>Gesundheit!
WHITE=>I didn't sneeze.
MORTICIAN=>And who the hell are you?
MORTICIAN=>Over there. Numbers eight to twelve.
VOICE O.S.=>John White...
MYSTERY MAN=>There is nothing, Mister White. Beyond the city. Never has been. Unfortunate. Yes?
WHITE=>How did you know where to find me?
MYSTERY MAN=>We knew you would turn up here eventually... Been waiting for you, yes. Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way...
MISTER BLACK=>Welcome.
MISTER BLACK=>John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes. You wish to confess to these crimes now?
MISTER BLACK=>Very well. The testimony of the prosecutors. Yes.
MISTER BLACK=>Something to say? Ready to confess?
MISTER BLACK=>Speak up. Yes.
MISTER BLACK=>Bring the witnesses.
MISTER BLACK=>You are the accused's parents?
FATHER=>That's right.
MOTHER=>Yes.
WHITE=>Wait a minute...
MISTER SLACK=>You had your turn! Let them speak.
WHITE=>This is insane!
WHITE=>It was them, not me. They killed you.
WHITE=>You have invented all this. History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's - a fiction. You are the authors.
MISTER BLACK=>A fanciful idea, Mister White.
WHITE=>Everyone has a job - a function. Each one teaches you more about your invention. I'm what is called a murderer.
WHITE=>You've given everybody memories, but I missed out. The Doctor saw to that - played your own game. And now...
WHITE=>You're trying to get rid of me.
WHITE=>Why do I threaten you? You're scared aren't you?
MISTER BLACK=>Ah - a plot. Now we have a plot! Very inventive...
MOTHER=>Please, John, you're embarrassing us...
WHITE=>Shut up!
MISTER BLACK=>A book of delusions. Anything else?
WHITE=>But I...
MISTER BLACK=>I see. The verdict, yes...
WHITE=>Wait, this isn't fair...
MISTER BLACK=>Before I pronounce sentence...
MISTER BLACK=>How dare you use your tricks on me!
WHITE=>I didn't realise...
MISTER BLACK=>Shut up, freak! Monster! You are insignificant.
MISTER BLACK=>You'll regret that.
MAN ON PHONE=>Yes, we have a problem here. Shut it down immediately.
MISTER BLACK=>This has all gone too far. Yes, much too far.
FIGURE=>Good as new. Yes. Everything is easier now.
FAT MAN=>It's small but clean... ...and the view's nice. Isn't it?
WHITE=>Yes...
WOMAN=>What's your name?
WHITE=>John... White.
