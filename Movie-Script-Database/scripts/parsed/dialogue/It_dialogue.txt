GEORGE=>You sure it's not too bad out there?
WILL=>Don't be such a wuss. I'd come if I weren't dying. Now get the paraffin.
GEORGE=>In the cellar?
WILL=>You want it to float or not, Georgie? Go on. Storm's not gonna last forever.
GEORGE=>Okay, Willy.
RICHIE=>Willy-boy.
WILL=>Trashmouth.
RICHIE=>Thought you were sick.
WILL=>I am.
RICHIE=>Is it mortal?
GEORGE=>Oh, balls. The power.
RICHIE=>What was that?
WILL=>Nothing. Georgie and I are making a paper boat. Got to go-
RICHIE=>Wait-!
GEORGE=>I'm getting it. I'm going to get it. I'm going in. I'm...
GEORGE=>Can I do some?
WILL=>Okay. Just don't get any on my blankets or Mom'll freak.
GEORGE=>Too cool.
WILL=>There you go. She's all yours.
GEORGE=>She?
WILL=>You're the Captain, ain't ya? Captains call their boats she. Now put on your rain stuff or you'll wind up stuck in bed like your stupid brother.
GEORGE=>Thanks, Willy.
WILL=>Be careful out there!
GEORGE=>Willy's gonna kill me.
PENNYWISE=>Hello, Georgie.
PENNYWISE=>Lost something?
GEORGE=>How did you get down there?
PENNYWISE=>Me? Why the storm of course. Just bleeeew me away. It blew the whole circus away. How'd you like to join the circus, Georgie?
GEORGE=>Is there cotton candy?
PENNYWISE=>Cotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy and bearded women and elephant shit and all the balloons a little boy could want. You like balloons, don't you Georgie?
GEORGE=>I sure do. Do they float?
PENNYWISE=>Float? Oh indeed they do, Georgie. Indeed they do. Everything down here floats. And when you're down here with us...
PENNYWISE=>YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!
LEROY=>Open the gate.
MIKE=>I'm sick of this, dad.
LEROY=>People need to eat. Now open the gate.
MIKE=>How would you feel if you were one of them?
LEROY=>Humans aren't raised to be food.
MIKE=>Everyday, watching them stupidly walk into that killing pen. This isn't a normal kid's life. You won't even let me go to school.
LEROY=>Now why would you want to be in public school with the rest of those people down below, in Derry?
MIKE=>Because I want to be in boring classes with other boring kids and draw pictures in text books and play baseball and go to dances and grind.
LEROY=>I know, son. I get it. But you aren't like those people. We may work with sheep, but those people are sheep. Trust me.
EDDIE=>So how's it work?
STAN RICHIE=>What work? So long suckas!
WILL=>Richie!
EDDIE=>The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah.
WILL=>It makes you officially a man right?
STAN RICHIE=>Kind of. I read verses. From Then a seventh dimensional the Torah. door opens up and Stan here has to slay his Ronin master over a pit of death. He wins his schlong grows like six inches.
STAN=>Shit, I don't need a Bar Mitzvah for that.
WILL=>Just your mom's Cosmo.
EDDIE=>Marie Claire.
RICHIE=>Vogue man. It's all perfumed. I put on my 3-D glasses and it's like you're there.
EDDIE=>Jesus, she's still here?
REMEMBER THE CURFEW.=>7 P.M. DERRY POLICE DEPARTMENT
STAN=>What do you think she's thinking?
WILL=>Maybe she expects her son to just walk out of the school with the rest of us.
RICHIE=>Yeah right, Dorsey Coen's been living in home ec these last three weeks.
EDDIE=>They're not going to find him.
RICHIE=>Sure they will. In a ditch. All decomposed, covered in worms and maggots and smelling like your MOM'S--
TRAVIS=>Sorry chode. Didn't see you.
VICTOR=>Frisbee, fuck nut.
WILL=>You suck, Bowers!
TRAVIS=>You say something?
TRAVIS=>Thought so. You got a free ride this year because of your little brother. But ride's over, Denbrough.
TRAVIS=>This summer's gonna be a hurt train, for you and your faggot friends. Let's roll. We got a lard ass to find.
BEVERLY=>Soooo, you gonna let me go by or is there a secret password or something?
BEN=>Sorry.
BEVERLY=>"Sorry"'s not much of a password. Now "kittyhawk," that's a good one.
BEN=>Ballyhoo?
BEVERLY=>Riproar.
BEN=>Barnburner.
BEVERLY=>If you're worried about Bowers and his merry band of a-holes hassling you, don't. I saw them all leave out front.
BEN=>Thanks.
BEVERLY=>You're the new kid right? I'm--
BEN=>Beverly Marsh.
BEN=>I just know `cuz we were in social studies. Together, in the same class. You know, like the constitution test, and stuff. (realizing he's vomiting
NONSENSE)=>I'm Ben.
BEVERLY=>I slipped in the shower. What's your excuse?
BEN=>I fell on three boxes of donuts.
BEVERLY=>Well, see ya around Ben from sosh class. "Get laid in the shade."
BEN=>Uh, you too, Beverly. "Stay cool."
BEVERLY=>K.I.T.
ZACH=>Hey Champ. Going out to play?
WILL=>Yeah, Dad.
WILL=>Hi, Ma.
WILL=>I got my report card.
EDDIE=>Hi Mom.
WILL=>Mrs. Kaspbrak.
RICHIE=>Ma'am.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Eddie-bear, where are you boys off to?
RICHIE=>Eddie-bear?
WILL=>Just my backyard, Mrs. K. We got a new, uh, badminton set.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Okay. Just don't go rolling around too much on that grass, sweetie. Especially if it's just been cut. You know how your allergies get.
EDDIE=>Yes, ma.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Isn't he cute, boys? So cute.
WILL=>Cutest boy we know, Mrs. Kaspbrak.
RICHIE=>The Miss America of cute boys. Seriously.
EDDIE=>Bye ma.
MRS. STARRET=>Isn't it summer vacation? I would think you'd be ready to take a break from the books.
BEN=>I like it in here. It's--
BEN=>Inspiring.
MRS. STARRET=>Well, even with all this terrible disappearing of kids business, a boy should be with his friends, outside, having fun.
BEN=>I'll try, Mrs. Starret.
MRS. STARRET=>What are all these for anyway?
BEN=>I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have--
ONE-ARMED OLD MAN=>Excuse me, miss?
ONE-ARMED OLD MAN=>Where's the children's section?
MRS. MARSH=>Bev.
BEVERLY=>Yeah, Mommy?
MRS. MARSH=>You had your monthly, yet?
BEVERLY=>What Mommy?
MRS. MARSH=>Bleeding, between your legs?
BEVERLY=>No. Why?
MRS. MARSH=>Soon, soon I figure. And then you'll be a woman.
MRS. MARSH=>When it happens, once every 27 days, you'll bleed, and you'll bleed the most right before the end.
MRS. MARSH=>I want you to go to the pharmacy today. To be prepared. You'll need to buy these.
RABBI=>Are you paying attention?
STAN=>Yes, sir.
RABBI=>Pay attention, son. This is important. This is about you becoming a man.
STAN=>I am. I'm taking this very seriously Rabbi.
RABBI=>Not everyone gets this opportunity, Stanley.
RABBI=>My son, God bless him, might never get a bar mitzvah. Do you realize that?
RABBI=>We may never see him again, he may be dead now. And death is forever, Stanley, you don't come back from death.
STAN=>Rabbi, I need to go pee.
STAN=>Rabbi, can I go pee please?
RABBI=>Of course.
NAKED WOMAN=>You like looking at my body?
STAN=>I... I.
NAKED WOMAN=>It's okay, I won't tell anyone.
NAKED WOMAN=>Do you want to see the rest of me?
STAN=>I should probably be getting back-
NAKED WOMAN=>You're going to be a man soon, won't you? I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
NAKED WOMAN=>Come here Stanley, come float with me.
BEN=>Your hair is winter fire,
JANUARY EMBERS=>My heart burns there, too.
TRAVIS=>Hello hot tits.
TRAVIS=>Gotcha!
SNATCH=>Look at that gut!
VICTOR=>Sounds like a pig. Don't he sound just like a pig?
BEN=>You better quit, I swear.
TRAVIS=>Or what? You'll go crying to mama? I'll give you something to cry about.
TRAVIS=>Go ahead. Yell. You'll be picking your fucking intestines off your sneakers.
TRAVIS=>Okay, tits. It's exam time. First question: when I say `Let me copy' during finals what do you say?
BEN=>Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want!
TRAVIS=>That's good. Now how can we make sure that sticks?
BEN=>I DON'T--
HOCKSTETTLER=>Let me light his head on fire like Michael Jackson.
TRAVIS=>No! Hold him. I'm gonna carve my entire name on his cottage cheese filled ass.
TRAVIS=>Now say it with me. What comes after T?
TRAVIS=>Oh, you're dead, tits.
TRAVIS=>My knife, Goddamn it! I lost my daddy's knife!
RICHIE=>C'mon Eds get your ass down here and help.
EDDIE=>No way. There's sixty million diseases in that stream. It's gray water.
RICHIE=>What's gray water?
EDDIE=>Tell `em Will. Your dad works for the public works.
WILL=>It's like where all the wash water and storm drain runoff goes.
EDDIE=>Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm telling you guys you're splashing around in Derry's toilet.
RICHIE=>Smells alright to me.
WILL EDDIE=>Guys? Seriously. I don't know why we're down here. There's poison ivy and mosquitos and God knows what else could get us sick. Not to mention we're all alone down here. What if we run into that psycho who's been picking off kids.
WILL RICHIE=>Guys-- I overheard my mom talking to my aunt in Bangor. She says it's a sex fiend. Some drifter. But no one from Derry. Couldn't be.
WILL=>Guys! Shut up!
RICHIE=>Whatcha got there Willy boy?
WILL=>Look inside.
RICHIE=>Son of a--
WILL=>Stan, you idiot.
STAN=>Sorry.
EDDIE=>What's the big deal? It's just a sneaker.
WILL=>It's Dorsey Coen's sneaker.
EDDIE=>Shit. This isn't good, guys. This seriously isn't good. We should go.
RICHIE=>How do you think Dorsey feels? Running around these woods with only one friggin' shoe.
WILL=>If he's still running.
STAN=>What if... he's still around here?
WILL=>Dorsey!
RICHIE=>Dorsey!
EDDIE=>Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get in trouble.
RICHIE=>For what?
EDDIE=>I don't know. Disturbing evidence. Contaminating a scene. We should just mark where we found the shoe and leave an anonymous note to Chief Borton. My mom would have a major cow if she knew I was playing down here, I kid you not.
RICHIE=>Shit, Eds you get within twenty feet of a peanut she has a whole herd. I don't want to think what she'll have if you come home with another kid's corpse.
EDDIE=>That's not funny, Richie. That's so not funny. Will, please.
WILL=>I'm with Richie. If I were Dorsey I'd want us to look for me.
EDDIE=>Fine. You guys can do what you want but I'm going. I have no interest in seeing the muddy mangled body of SOME--
RICHIE=>Holy friggin' Moses. What happened to you?
RICHIE=>Heads up, homeschool!
MIKE=>Eat me, townie!
SNATCH=>It probably got washed away, Travis.
TRAVIS=>It ain't been washed away. It's been stolen.
VICTOR=>Stolen, by who?
TRAVIS=>That nigger right there.
ON THESE PREMISES=>AN EXPLOSION TOOK THE LIVES OF 102 SOULS EASTER SUNDAY, 1906. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE
HOCKSTETTLER=>What the fuh...
TRAVIS=>Let's go! That jungle monkey ain't here no more.
HOCKSTETTLER=>I'm staying.
TRAVIS=>Why?
HOCKSTETTLER=>I don't know. I want to see its insides.
HOCKSTETTLER=>You guys want to come?
TRAVIS=>Why the- Hell no. You mental? This place gives me the creeps.
HOCKSTETTLER=>I ain't afraid. Any you ghosts down here can't hurt me.
HOCKSTETTLER=>I seen ghosts. I did them in their butt holes.
PENNYWISE=>Did they float?
HOCKSTETTLER=>I, I- Who's there?
HOCKSTETTLER=>There's no one down here. There's no one that can hurt me.
PENNWISE=>Patrick... Answer me.
PENNYWISE=>Because down here, we all float.
WILL=>Okay Richie, you and...
BEN=>Ben.
WILL=>Ben stay here. We'll get some bandages and stuff.
BEN=>Thanks for helping me.
RICHIE=>You're not the only one on Bower's shitlist.
EDDIE=>Woah, that's a lot of money. Will?
WILL=>All I got. You got an account here don't you?
EDDIE=>You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed.
WILL=>Well we need to do something. That kid out there looks like someone killed him.
BEVERLY=>You consider a diversion?
WILL=>Huh?
BEVERLY=>Your friend there. He has that thingy he always carries around in his cute little fannypack right?
EDDIE=>My EpiPen Jr.?
BEVERLY=>Yeah. For when he spazzes out.
EDDIE=>I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions.
BEVERLY=>Whatever. The point is he has a track record right? Of spazzing out.
EDDIE=>I DON'T--
WILL=>Eds, shut up. She's on to something.
WILL=>Oh no. Eddie! Eddie!
BEVERLY=>I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene!
MR. KEENE=>You guys know the drill, don't you?
WILL=>I'm a pacifist.
BEVERLY=>My mom doesn't like me handling needles.
EDDIE=>Thanks, Mr. Keene. That one was a real shit kicker.
BEVERLY=>Not bad for a bunch of amateurs.
WILL=>We got it!
EDDIE=>Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost.
STAN=>Nothing.
STAN=>What happened to him?
BEN=>Beverly was there?
EDDIE=>Yeah.
BEN=>And she stole this stuff for me?
BEN=>Did she know it was for me?
RICHIE=>I don't think she even knows you're alive man.
BEN STAN=>Yes she does. What's going on in there?
RICHIE=>What do you think? He's handing `em the kid's shoe. It's riveting.
RICHIE=>Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', huh?
BEN=>My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew.
EDDIE=>I think he means you, Big Ben.
BEN=>It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name.
RICHIE=>You're pretty friggin' hard to miss.
EDDIE=>Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too?
RICHIE BEN=>If he creeps in storm drains, Who's Georgie? maybe.
EDDIE=>Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time.
RICHIE=>Will won't talk about it but the kid's arm got ripped clean off in a flash flood or something.
RICHIE=>Cat got your tongue?
STAN=>What?
RICHIE EDDIE=>Why are you so quiet? What's Chief Borton going to do with a shoe?
STAN BEN=>I'm not. I'm listening. A storm drain. Crazy.
RICHIE=>Well?
EDDIE=>What did he say?
WILL=>Nothing. Thanked me for being a good young citizen.
RICHIE=>So let's get outta here. Police stations always make me feel guilty of something.
EDDIE=>Later days.
RICHIE=>Barrens? Don't fag out.
WILL=>Fag you later.
WILL=>I found something today.
SHARON=>You say something honey?
WILL=>That missing Coen boy. I found a clue.
ZACH=>Stay out of it, Will. Let the police handle these things.
WILL=>What about Arcadia?
WILL=>We haven't talked about our park trip at the end of the summer. Usually by now we're all looking at the brochure together. We have so much fun there every--
ZACH=>Enough.
WILL=>What did I say?
SHARON=>Nothing... Your father, it's just too much to deal with right now.
WILL=>I'll mow lawns. Paint fences. Whatever.
SHARON=>It's not that.
SHARON=>Your brother just looked forward to this trip so much. That park was his favorite place in the world.
WILL=>Mine too.
CHILD'S VOICE=>Help me.
CHILD'S VOICE=>Help me, Beverly.
BEVERLY=>Is s-someone there?
CHILD'S VOICE=>We all want to meet you, Beverly.
BEVERLY=>Who are you?
CHILD'S VOICE=>I'm Matthew... I'm Dorsey... I'm Veronica... I'm Georgie... Come play with us down here... Come play with the clown... You'll float, Beverly. Oh how you'll float...
MR. MARSH=>What the devil's gotten into you, girl?
BEVERLY=>The bathroom! Daddy, in the BATHROOM--
MR. MARSH=>Someone peeking at you, Bevvie? Huh?
BEVERLY=>No... the sink... in the sink...
MR. MARSH=>You know I hate gettin' rough with you. I never do when you don't deserve it.
MR. MARSH=>What's my tape measurer doin' outta my toolbelt?
MR. MARSH=>Answer me girl.
BEVERLY=>The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider...
MR. MARSH=>A spider?
BEVERLY=>Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you.
MR. MARSH=>I worry about you, Bevvie. I worry a lot.
MR. MARSH=>You know why I don't drink or smoke or chase after women like other fathers do?
BEVERLY=>Because you love momma?
MR. MARSH=>Not just her, Bevvie. You. You're almost a woman now, too. And I got me all I need right here at home.
WILL=>Hello? Dad?
WILL=>Ma?
WILL=>Georgie?
GEORGE=>Why'd you make me go, Willy?
WILL=>Georgie?
GEORGE=>Help me, Willy.
GEORGE=>You'll float.
ZACH=>Will.
ZACH=>Easy! What's wrong? What's all the noise about?
WILL=>There's a leak in my ceiling. Then I went to check the cellar and its FLOODED AND--
ZACH=>Where's the leak, son?
ZACH=>Dry as a bone, Will. Sure it wasn't just a dream?
RICHIE=>But we got a project we're working on out there.
CHIEF BORTON=>Barren's will be off limits for now, kids. Go on into town and play there.
OFFICER BOWERS=>We've got another one, Chief.
CHIEF BORTON=>Another what?
OFFICER BOWERS=>Kid gone missing.
CHIEF BORTON=>Dear Lord. Who is it?
OFFICER BOWERS=>One of my son's friends. Patrick Hockstettler.
CHIEF BORTON=>The family notified you directly?
OFFICER BOWERS=>Then I did a little investigating of my own. Tell him what you told me, boy.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Tell him, damn it! Tell him who you last saw him with. The negro boy from outside of town. The ones who run the abatoir.
MRS. MARSH=>Darling, sometimes I look at myself in the morning and think the same thing.
MRS. MARSH=>Look at these roots.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Leroy Hanlon?
OFFICER BOWERS=>We need to bring in your boy for questioning.
LEROY=>For what?
OFFICER BOWERS=>Police business.
LEROY=>We need a lawyer?
MIKE=>Dad, it's-
OFFICER BOWERS=>Let's go, boy.
LEROY=>Hey! No need for that.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Search this place, now. It's the perfect place to hide a body if you ever needed to.
LEROY=>This ain't right! You need a warrant, you can't just-
MIKE=>Dad!
OFFICER BOWERS=>Call an ambulance.
RICHIE=>Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy?
BEN=>Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library.
RICHIE EDDIE=>What are you, the "Reading He's a regular Jordy Laforge. Rainbow"?
STAN=>Why is it all, like, people getting killed and missing kids and stuff?
BEN=>I don't know. There's just a lot of that here. Been that way since the original settlers.
WILL=>You have a copy of the Town Charter. Seriously?
BEN=>Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace.
RICHIE=>The entire town?
BEN=>The people, the livestock, everything that was alive.
STAN EDDIE=>Jesus. Holy fuck.
RICHIE=>Aren't you supposed to be Jewish?
BEN=>People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal.
RICHIE=>Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries!
BEN=>It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson.
EDDIE=>Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie-
WILL=>Yeah, it's where Georgie died.
BEN RICHIE=>I'm sorry. I didn't- Good job numb nuts.
WILL=>Don't worry about it. Why do you have all this stuff anyway? I mean. What are you going to do with it?
BEN=>I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess.
RICHIE=>It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right.
WILL=>Who's first.
RICHIE=>Eddie?
EDDIE=>Screw that.
BEN=>I'll go.
EDDIE=>Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water-
RICHIE=>Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house.
BEN=>What's grey water?
STAN=>Don't get him started.
WILL=>I'll go first.
BEVERLY=>Too late.
RICHIE=>What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy?
BEN=>Very funny, Richie.
RICHIE=>I thought so.
WILL=>Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something?
EDDIE=>Haunted how?
WILL=>I keep thinking about Ben's walls.
BEN=>You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here?
WILL=>Yeah. It's strange.
STAN=>Like any town, right? That's been around long enough, bad stuff is bound to happen. I mean, have you read the Torah?
RICHIE=>Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter.
BEVERLY=>Have you been seeing "things" Will?
WILL=>I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy.
RICHIE=>We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here.
WILL=>I saw Georgie last night. Only. It wasn't him.
EDDIE=>Like. In your dreams?
WILL=>No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him.
RICHIE=>That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call.
WILL=>Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know.
STAN=>What did you see Will?
BEN=>The clown?
WILL=>Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth...
STAN=>I saw something, too. In the basement of the synogogue.
RICHIE=>I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos.
BEVERLY=>I need to show you guys something.
BEVERLY=>My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment.
BEN=>Isn't he at work?
BEVERLY=>Sometimes he comes home for a nap.
WILL=>We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you?
STAN=>What does he look like?
BEVERLY=>My Daddy? Mean. Like a drunk.
BEVERLY=>In there.
RICHIE=>Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into?
BEVERLY=>You'll see.
RICHIE=>I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry.
EDDIE=>Oh God. Oh God.
BEVERLY=>You really see it?
RICHIE=>It's like someone slaughtered a pig in here. Or a parent.
WILL=>What happened?
BEVERLY=>The sink. It came out from the sink. My parents couldn't see it. I thought I was going crazy.
WILL=>You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack?
WILL=>Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send him in here.
WILL=>You see it, don't you, Richie?
WILL=>We can't leave it like this. Let's clean it up.
STAN=>What's taking them so long?
EDDIE=>There was a lot of blood.
RICHIE=>All I'm saying is maybe there's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown. You know, like the Joker in a "Dark Knight" comic. Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids.
WILL=>Okay, so how did he put Georgie in my basement?
BEVERLY=>Or blood in my sink?
RICHIE=>I don't know. Who knows how crazy people do things, right?
WILL=>You okay?
BEVERLY=>I am now. Thanks to you guys.
CHIEF BORTON MIKE'S MOM=>Ma'am. Ma'am. His father is in the hospital in critical condition and Ma'am! you, you're supposed to be protecting the children!
CHIEF BORTON=>Ma'am. We were just doing our job, but he's free to go home with you, now.
MIKE'S MOM=>He damn well better be.
OFFICER BOWERS=>You got lucky, boy. Could have been you who disappeared. Be careful next time creeping around old places like that.
MIKE=>I told you who chased me there.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Oh, and he will be punished, don't you worry, I swear on my belt buckle he will.
MIKE'S MOM=>C'mon, Mikey. Your father needs us.
RICHIE=>What happened, homeschool?
OFFICER BOWERS=>Whoa whoa. Where do you crumb snatchers think you're going?
WILL=>We know what's been taking the kids. Chief!
CHIEF BORTON=>It's okay, Butch. Someone try to do something to you kids?
BEN BEVERLY=>Not someone. Something. There's like this spirit.
BEN=>A clown.
STAN=>Or sometimes it's something else.
EDDIE=>Only us kids can see it.
BORTON=>Okay, stop. Is this you Tozier? Did you put them up to this little practical joke.
WILL=>No, we all saw it.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Such wild imaginations. Too bad we can't bottle their little brains. Dry them out and grind them into powder to salt our food. Maybe then we'd see, what was it again?
CHIEF BORTON=>You youngsters realize there's a penalty in Derry for filing a false police report. I don't want to have to call your parents, now.
BEVERLY=>But we're not lying.
CHIEF BORTON=>You have any evidence?
CHIEF BORTON=>That's what I thought. I don't want to hear another word of this, not here, not a whisper of it anywhere. Now go home, all of you. Eat dinner with your families, sleep and have sweet dreams in your pj's. And tomorrow, you're going to go play like normal kids and forget all about this fantasy about murder and monsters. This is an adult matter. You got it?
BEN=>But you adults aren't doing anything!
OFFICER BOWERS=>Watch your tone, boy.
CHIEF BORTON=>I don't see you leaving.
WILL=>I guess we're on our own.
TRAVIS=>Go! Go! Go!
TRAVIS=>God I love the Fourth.
SNATCH=>It's my turn. Pass one back.
MIKE'S MOM=>You'll be okay?
LEROY=>Mom tell you what's the what?
MIKE=>Doctors say it's inside your bones. And spreading.
LEROY=>Your Mom's going to need you to be strong, Mikey. Help keep the abatoir running.
MIKE=>I'll try.
LEROY=>You do or you don't do. No try.
MIKE=>It's my fault.
LEROY=>Stop that, Mike. There's no one to blame here. It's nature taking its course.
MIKE=>You're coming home though, right?
LEROY=>Pull up that seat.
LEROY=>There's something I never told nobody. Not even your mom. Something that I think you should know in case...
MIKE=>In case of what?
LEROY=>When I was about your age. Me and my buddies would go to this place along the canal...
MIKE=>Dad, I'm responsible. You don't need to tell me some long tale about drinking and driving or safe sex. I'll take care of things-
LEROY=>I'm. Not. Done.
LEROY=>This isn't about you, Mike. It's not even about me. It's about Derry. This town is like poison.
MIKE=>Dad?
LEROY=>Shut up and listen to me. There was one night, 1960. I remember because it was August and Chubby Checker just dropped "the twist".
LEROY=>Worse thing I ever seen. And the smell, that awful smell -- all cooked flesh. Somehow we ended up in the water.
LEROY=>Floating in the blackness, I could still hear all them screams. It wasn't until I surfaced that I could see the truth of it all. Of Derry.
MIKE=>What truth?
LEROY=>I saw something, Mikey. Through the smoke and the burning. Something I can't even really explain, but it was there, Dickie saw it, too.
MIKE=>What did you see?
NURSE=>Mr. Hanlon, you ready?
LEROY=>I saw what was really responsible for that fire, Mikey. Not the Legion. See those white boys, they were there, but there was something else, orchestrating `em. Had `em all in a fit and frenzy, moved to his whims. This thing, I don't even know how to describe it...
NURSE=>Mr. Hanlon?
LEROY=>(he grabs Mike's shirt
VIOLENTLY)=>Be careful out there son. Especially by the canal. The water in Derry is no place for no one, especially a youngster like you.
NURSE=>You might want to wait outside.
MIKE=>Somebody! HELP! Let me out! Dad! Mom!
PATRICK=>It's killing your daddy, Mikey. Eating him away.
MIKE=>Shut up.
PATRICK=>A worm inside a rotten apple. We're all apples, Mikey. All of us. You know the thing about apples --
MIKE=>Stop it.
PATRICK=>-- they float.
MIKE=>No!
CHIEF BORTON=>What are you doing here, son?
TRAVIS=>Move.
SNATCH=>Hey, ain't that the little shit your dad gave you a whoopin' over?
TRAVIS=>I'm gonna run him over.
RICHIE=>Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing.
BEN=>Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks.
RICHIE=>You call that a firecracker? This is a firecracker.
BEVERLY=>Nice stick, Richie. How about this.
ALL THE BOYS=>Holy shit!
WILL=>Think that could take "IT" down?
STAN EDDIE=>How? We don't even know what That's a good name for it it is that we're looking for. actually.
RICHIE=>What?
EDDIE=>"IT."
BEVERLY=>I think it depends.
EDDIE=>On what?
WILL=>What we're scared of. It was Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what I care about. It was a naked woman for Stan because he's so afraid of-
RICHIE=>Getting laiiiid.
STAN RICHIE=>Only because your Mom- You really want me to start talking about your Mom? Don't get me started cause it won't stop.
WILL=>Back to point. It showered Beverly in blood cuz...
RICHIE=>Cuz blood always freaks a girl out.
BEVERLY=>Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you?
BEVERLY=>"IT" showered me in blood because I just got my period... and...
RICHIE=>I didn't need to know that.
WILL=>It. It's everything and anything. All our nightmares. All evil, wrapped into one.
BEN=>Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat.
RICHIE=>Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky.
EDDIE=>It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover.
BEVERLY=>Adults just ignore them. But kids, like your brother, Georgie...
WILL=>They want to get closer. See their tricks.
WILL=>Shit. Isn't that-
RICHIE=>Home school.
EDDIE=>They're going to cream him.
STAN=>At least it won't be our problem for a night.
BEVERLY=>That's cowardly, Stan.
BEN=>Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something.
STAN=>How?
WILL=>With these.
TRAVIS=>Got the little fucker now.
VICTOR=>Is that that pussy Denbrough?
TRAVIS=>This night just gets better and better.
WILL=>Don't move.
MIKE=>You nuts?
WILL=>Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks.
MIKE=>We?
WILL=>Not yet... not yet. Now!
BEN=>Fuck.
WILL=>Oh shit. Abort! Abort!
MIKE=>Abort? What does that mean.
WILL=>Run!
BEVERLY=>Woah!
MIKE=>Is that girl for real?
WILL=>Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie!
TRAVIS=>Those little motherfuckers. Get out, get out!
STAN=>Holy hell. What kinda gear do they got?
WILL=>I don't wanna stay and find out.
TRAVIS=>I've been waiting all summer to run into you, Denbrough.
WILL=>Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt.
TRAVIS=>Hurt? When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were in that storm drain with your brother.
BEVERLY=>Will, we need cover--
BEN=>The house. It's our only chance!
EDDIE=>I don't think that's a good idea.
RICHIE=>When do you ever think anything is a good idea?
WILL=>Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while we can, you and Stan see if you can find a way in.
EDDIE=>Really guys, there has to be another option.
RICHIE=>You want to swim?!
EDDIE=>I'm serious. This house--
WILL=>Charge!!!
WILL=>Guys hurry!!!
BEVERLY=>Rock, paper, scissors?
STAN=>I'll go.
BEN=>No. I'll go.
BEN=>Down here!
TRAVIS=>I'm gonna kill you, losers! I swear I'm gonna kill you all.
WILL=>Go! Go! Go!
TRAVIS=>Where are they?
RICHIE=>If we die here I just want to say that fight was friggin' awesome.
WILL=>Shhhhush.
EDDIE=>We shouldn't be here.
BEN=>You okay?
BEVERLY=>It's just a scrape.
STAN=>They can't see the window?
EDDIE=>We shouldn't be here.
RICHIE=>Don't count your chickens.
MIKE=>Something wrong with your friend here?
EDDIE=>We shouldn't be here!
WILL RICHIE=>Eddie? He's afraid of dirt.
BEVERLY=>What is it Eddie?
EDDIE=>There's something I didn't tell you guys.
WILL=>What?
EDDIE=>This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know...
EDDIE=>I saw "IT."
STAN=>Jesus.
RICHIE=>Why do you keep using our teams, guy?
STAN=>Wha?
MIKE=>What does he mean by "IT?"
WILL=>Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it.
MIKE=>I know. I've seen "IT" too.
BEVERLY=>What exactly did you see here, Eddie?
BEN=>Guys, uh--
WILL=>Stairs.
EDDIE=>It's here.
RICHIE=>I'm not going up there.
BEN=>The front door is right there.
EDDIE=>Shit. Guys, look.
MIKE=>There must be a window open.
WILL=>C'mon.
BEN=>Eddie, what are you doing?
WILL=>Eddie!
BEVERLY=>What's happening?!
RICHIE=>Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there.
BEVERLY=>We have to do something.
BEVERLY=>Follow me!
EDDIE=>Guys?
WILL=>Eddie.
EDDIE=>Get me out of here.
WILL=>We tried, we can't get down stairs.
EDDIE=>What do you mean you can't get down stairs?
WILL=>Do you see anything you could use to climb out?
EDDIE=>I- I think I broke my arm.
BEVERLY=>I don't know, Richie.
RICHIE=>You gotta a better idea?
EDDIE=>No. No no no. Will? Help me!
WILL=>What do we do?
BEN=>We can't leave him alone down there.
EDDIE=>Hurry, guys!
EDDIE=>This isn't happening. This isn't happening.
PENNYWISE=>Open your eyes Eddie-bear. I brought you some cracker-jack.
EDDIE=>Go away!
PENNYWISE=>Away? But I just got here? And we're gonna have soooooo much fun, you and me. Now open those peepers.
EDDIE=>No.
PENNYWISE=>Kee-mon Eddie Bear. Don'cha wanna see the show? You're the main event.
PENNYWISE=>You all taste soooooooo much better when you're afraid.
WILL=>Ah, fuck!
MRS. KASPBRAK=>You! You all did this!
MRS. KASPBRAK=>You know how delicate he is!
RICHIE=>We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND--
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Stop it! Just stop it! If it weren't for you boys and that little tramp they'd have nothing against my Eddie-bear... Ohh, where are my keys?
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Eddie's done with you kids, you hear?
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Don't come around here again, you don't deserve him. You're reckless, churlish little boys. This is why your little brother died, William, because you are a LOSER, a reckless reckless reckless loser. God help me if I were one of your parents.
RICHIE=>Well, that went well.
BEN=>Guys, I hate to pile on bad news.
STAN=>No.
BEVERLY=>That can't be true. We just saw "IT."
MIKE=>This is all crazy. Who are you guys anyway?
BEN=>The only losers in town-
WILL=>Who know what's going on.
RICHIE=>Welcome to the club, kid.
AUGUST=>Tilt down to the OVERHEAD shot of what we expect to be "Derry 1988", but instead we see forests, logging trails, a hardscrabble 19th century downtown, and a LOG CABIN SALOON squatting on the edge of the swollen Kenduskeag canal. Smoke billows from its chimney, day drawing down to a misty dark.
WOMAN=>He didn't run away, sir! He's just a child, missing now for more than three days!
WOMAN=>Have you seen my baby, Claude? He's been gone near...
FLOYD CALDERWOOD=>You sitting in Claude?
EDDIE KING=>Please Claude, I just got married last month.
BEN=>And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon.
RICHIE=>The point of telling us was?
WILL BEVERLY=>I think it's pretty obvious. Derry's not just haunted, it's cursed.
MIKE=>Just like my pa was trying to warn me the night I met you guys.
BEN=>That clown, whatever "IT" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared.
RICHIE STAN=>I don't know, man. That Lumberjack. FLAPJACK STORY--
RICHIE=>Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something?
WILL=>Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, "IT's" never going to stop.
STAN=>What do you mean, us, Will? We're just kids.
BEVERLY=>We hurt it at Neibolt. That's gotta mean something.
MIKE=>Everything dies.
WILL=>We can kill it.
RICHIE=>Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from "mom jail" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to "Tales from the crypt."
BEN STAN=>No, no. This is far too I don't want to see "it" whacked for "Tales." again. Ever.
WILL=>I don't think that's a choice, Stan. "IT" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back.
MIKE=>It's only a matter of time one of us is found half eaten in the Barrens. Or worse.
STAN=>I need to study for my bar-mitzvah.
BEVERLY=>He's just scared.
WILL=>We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together.
RICHIE=>Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me.
HAROLD AND RUTH URIS CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO=>THE BAR-MITZVAH OF THEIR SON
STANLEY URIS ON=>SATURDAY, AUGUST 13TH, 1988
SHARON=>Put it back up there! Put it back now!
ZACH=>I just thought, someone else--
SHARON=>I don't care about anyone else. I care about Georgie. I care about my little boy who's gone.
WILL=>Hey.
ZACH=>Willy, we need a minute--
WILL=>Why? To scream at each other more?
SHARON=>This is between your father and me.
WILL=>And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie.
ZACH=>Willy, stop.
WILL=>No. You stop. I hate it. Tip toeing around you guys like I don't exist. Like I'm the one who died and the only one who's still here is Ge--
ZACH=>You okay?
WILL=>What do you care? At least she heard me.
ZACH=>SON--
WILL=>I miss Georgie, too.
ZACH=>We know.
WILL=>Do you? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through.
WILL=>C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face! I'll stick another firecracker in it for Georgie. Blow your whole stupid head off. Send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. Where are you!?
WILL=>Eddie? Eddie you there?
MRS. KASPBRAK=>I thought I took the batteries out of that thing?
WILL=>Eddie? I know where to find--
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Turn it off.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Oh! Dr. Handor. You gave me a fright.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>C'mon in.
DR. HANDOR=>How you feeling, son? Any pain?
EDDIE=>No. Feels fine I guess.
DR. HANDOR=>Kept the cast pretty clean, I see. Didn't you want any of your friends to sign it?
EDDIE=>I'm not allowed to see them.
DR. HANDOR=>Why not?
EDDIE=>My Mom thinks they're the reason I got hurt. She says I'm sensitive and they don't take care of me like she does.
DR. HANDOR=>She means your allergies? Is that it?
EDDIE=>Yeah. Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I ever have an episode.
DR. HANDOR=>Mother knows best. Is that it?
DR. HANDOR=>Eddie, do you know what a placebo is?
SNATCH=>Can I try?
TRAVIS=>Sure. Go put the next target out there.
SNATCH=>You're foolin' right?
TRAVIS=>Do I look like I'm foolin' numb nuts?
SNATCH=>It's not staying.
TRAVIS=>Hold it there, butt cheese.
OFFICER BOWERS=>What the hell is this?
TRAVIS=>Nothing, pa. Just cleaning your gun like you asked.
OFFICER BOWERS=>Cleaning my gun, huh?
OFFICER BOWERS=>Normally I use a rod and cleaner not bullets and whiskey.
OFFICER BOWERS=>You two punks put your sticky little fingers on my firearm here?
VICTOR=>N-N-No sir.
OFFICER BOWERS=>You're not worth the salt you lick boy. I don't know how I let you squirm your way out your momma's womb.
TRAVIS=>Pa, I'm---
OFFICER BOWERS=>Look at him now boys. Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble. Clean your drawers `fore you come inside.
VICTOR=>You okay, Travis?
TO: MR. TRAVIS BOWERS=>FROM: MR. ROBERT GRAY
MIKE=>Patrick was in one of the lockers. All the water bubbled up from there.
WILL=>The sewers.
MIKE=>What?
WILL=>"IT." Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink.
MIKE=>My dad saw it near water, too. The canal.
WILL=>I'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you'll find the same thing. Water. With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape.
MIKE=>Unless you live way out in the sticks like I do. We have to tell the others.
WILL=>Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah. I almost forgot.
MIKE=>I wasn't invited.
WILL=>You are now. Let's go!
MR. MARSH=>Where you think you going girl?
BEVERLY=>My friend's party. I told ma--
MR. MARSH=>You're all prettied up. Who you all prettied up for?
BEVERLY=>No one.
MR. MARSH=>Don't lie to me, Bevvie. You know how I worry about you. I worry a lot.
BEVERLY=>I know daddy.
MR. MARSH=>People in town seen you. Got to sayin' things. Like how my little girl been sneakin' around all summer long with a pack of boys. Only girl to the pack.
BEVERLY=>They're my friends, daddy.
MR. MARSH=>You sure about that, Bevvie?
BEVERLY=>I-- I swear. They're just friends.
MR. MARSH=>Friends? I know what's in them boys minds when they look at you, Bevvie. I know all too well. They want to do bad things. Did you let them do bad things to you?
BEVERLY=>I'm a good girl daddy. Good, just like you raised me.
MR. MARSH=>Is that so? Then what's this?
BEVERLY=>WHERE'D YOU--
MR. MARSH=>You had it squirreled away in your underwear drawer. Why would you want to hide it with your underwear Bevvie? What else are you holdin' out from me.
BEVERLY=>It's nothing, daddy. Just a poem.
MR. MARSH=>Your hair is winter fire,
JANUARY EMBERS=>My heart burns there, too
MR. MARSH=>Sounds lusty to me. Who wrote it. Which one of your boyfriends?
BEVERLY=>I told you I don't have one.
MR. MARSH=>Don't lie to me!
BEVERLY=>Daddy stop. You're hurting me.
MR. MARSH=>You're ma says you're a woman now. You bled. What other womanly things you been doing down in the deep dark woods with those boys, Bevvie.
BEVERLY=>Nothing. Please, daddy. You don't have to worry. I promise. Please!
MR. MARSH=>Let's see then. Prove to me you been good.
MR. MARSH=>Take off your tights.
BEVERLY=>What?
MR. MARSH=>I love you Bevvie. You're special. You're such a pretty girl. But there's plenty of boys happy to roon a pretty girl. Plenty of pretty girls willing to be roont. I need to know if you're intact.
MR. MARSH=>Your tights, girl. Take `em off.
BEVERLY=>Daddy, please.
MR. MARSH=>You'll like it, Bevvie. Be like you're floating.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Placebo? Who told you that? Dr. Handor? He has no right. No right to say you're making up your sickness.
EDDIE=>Not me, momma... You.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>What?
EDDIE=>He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>That's a lie, Eddie! A bold faced lie. You're my treasure. The only thing I want in this world is to see you safe and healthy.
EDDIE=>Then why did you send my friends away?
MRS. KASPBRAK=>They were bad boys. You know that. And you... You were so sick when you were little. So very sick. It hurt me so much. I never want to see you go through that again. And I've kept you healthy, haven't I?
EDDIE=>You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine.
MRS. KASPBRAK=>Eddie-bear, please--
EDDIE=>This is what's going to happen now.
EDDIE=>I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again.
WILL=>Bev. You okay?
BEVERLY=>No. No I'm not.
MIKE=>What happened. Bowers?
BEVERLY=>No. My daddy. He... he...
WILL=>What? What did he do Beverly?
BEVERLY=>I don't know. I don't know if it was him, or...
MIKE=>What?
BEVERLY=>I think "IT" was there, controlling him, I don't know, I can't go back, I can't go back, Will. I don't know WHAT-
BEN=>This storm is crazy. Like the sky's gonna fall.
RICHIE=>Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear.
BEN=>How'd you escape?
EDDIE=>Guess I'm not as weak as I thought.
SNATCH=>Travis?
VICTOR=>Mr. Bowers?
SNATCH=>Holy shit.
SNATCH=>Travis, dude, you okay?
TRAVIS=>It's my gun now.
RICHIE=>What do you mean your dad attacked you?
BEVERLY=>It was like that lumberjack Ben told us about. The one from the Silver Dollar. He had this look. Like someone was pushing him to do it.
WILL=>Not someone. "IT".
EDDIE=>You guys, if "IT" can take over Beverly's parents, why not the rest of ours?
BEVERLY=>I can't go back there guys. He'll kill me. Or worse.
MIKE=>Will knows where to find "IT."
EDDIE=>What do you mean?
WILL=>The sewers. Me and Mike figured it out. That's how it gets around. That's where it lives.
RICHIE=>Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really MEAN--
BEN=>If it means protecting Beverly, count me in.
EDDIE=>Wait, count you in to what?
WILL=>The sewers. We go in. All of us.
RICHIE=>And friggin do what? In this storm?
WILL=>Get rid of "IT" before "IT" gets rid of us, one by one. It doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me.
STAN=>Hey guys. How'd I do?
RICHIE=>I hope your schlong grew those 12 inches cuz you're gonna need it.
STAN=>What do you mean?
WILL=>C'mon!
STAN=>Hold on. How are we-?
RICHIE=>Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you didn't put this sucker on your gift list.
ZACH=>Will, what are you doing in there? Open up.
WILL=>We need to protect each other Stan. The seven of us is all we have. Together "IT" can't hurt us. I promise.
STAN=>How do you know?
ZACH=>Willy, now! We need to talk.
WILL=>I have faith. Just like you.
ZACH=>Damn it, Will!
WILL=>This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized.
BEN=>Oh, fuck!
VICTOR=>Man, this is where Patrick Hockstettler went missing.
SNATCH=>No way I'm going down there.
TRAVIS=>Still have second thoughts?
EDDIE=>Oh my God oh my God!
WILL=>Don't look back!
TRAVIS=>After you.
BEVERLY=>Now what?
STAN=>Uh, guys?
WILL=>There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map.
EDDIE=>Dorsey's other shoe.
RICHIE=>Uh, guys!
MIKE=>Pennywise?
BEN=>Shit, "IT" has a name.
WILL=>Keep moving!
STAN=>Here. Will, over here.
TRAVIS=>I seeeeeeeeeee yooooooouuuu losers!
MIKE=>Hurry!
BEN=>No no no no no! Guys!
TRAVIS=>I'm gonna carve you up, tits. I'm going to stick this blade right up your asshole and split you in two. Feed your ass fat to the friggin' pigs.
BEN=>Oh my God oh my God oh my God.
WILL=>Don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do.
MIKE=>We don't want it to tear.
BEVERLY=>Take off your shoes. You'll be fine. Just move real real slow.
TRAVIS=>No! No no no no! Fuck!
VICTOR=>We'll never fit. We've gotta go back.
TRAVIS=>I need to hear them squeal. Now you'll fit.
EDDIE=>Hurry.
VICTOR=>No. Guys. Wait! Please! Travis has gone insane. I'm not trying to hurt you, just...
VICTOR=>Take me with you!
WILL=>Victor.
BEVERLY=>OH NO-
VICTOR=>Oh god oh god!
TRAVIS=>Good. That's good, Vic. Kill `em. Kill `em all!
RICHIE=>Something tells me we're not in Derry anymore.
BEN=>You think?
EDDIE=>Don't get too close to the edge, Will.
MIKE=>It's up there isn't it? That's where "IT" sleeps.
STAN=>You mean Pennywise.
WILL=>It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it.
BEVERLY=>Guess I'm going first again?
WILL=>Beverly, wait-!
RICHIE=>You still afraid of a little grey water?
EDDIE=>You still wear diapers at night?
WILL=>We all here?
RICHIE=>Mind equals blown right now.
MIKE=>This is nothing like what it looked like from below.
EDDIE=>It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real.
STAN=>We do. Or IT?
WILL=>Guys, the island. Let's swim.
BEN=>Not funny, Richie.
RICHIE=>What?
BEVERLY=>The water. There's something in the water with us.
WILL=>Hurry!
WILL=>Stan what are you doing!
EDDIE BEVERLY=>Stan? Stan, are you okay? Stan!
WILL=>Stan, it's us. You in there buddy?
BEN=>Guys. I don't think this is the best place to hang out right now.
EDDIE=>Stanley, snap out of it.
STAN=>Where am I?
RICHIE=>The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have.
MIKE=>Guys, the water thing. IT's gone.
WILL=>Maybe. Or just changing into something else.
EDDIE=>What do you mean?
WILL=>It's using our fears against us. It wants us to be afraid.
EDDIE=>Because we'll taste better.
RICHIE=>And that's supposed to rally us, Will?
WILL=>We have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. Alright?
WILL=>Ready?
WILL=>My turn.
PENNYWISE=>Welcome to the circus, Willy.
WILL=>I'm not afraid of you, clown.
PENNYWISE=>Your brother wasn't afraid either.
PENNYWISE=>Not until I chewed his little muscles up.
WILL=>Guys?
WILL=>Ahhhh!
WILL=>Come out from the dark then. Come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. C'mon!
PENNYWISE=>Ooooh I'd love to, Will. I'd just love to show you my deadlights. Only you wouldn't understand. And I need you to, Willy, I really really need you to understand what's going to happen to you. What it means for a little kiddie like you... to float.
WILL=>I'm sorry, Georgie.
BEVERLY=>Break into our homes, we break into yours.
BEN=>Charge!
PENNYWISE=>Wait!
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE=>Please, Willy. Please don't hurt me.
WILL=>You're not Georgie.
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE=>I am. I'm in here, Willy. We all are. This is the place we float.
BEVERLY=>Will, it's a trick.
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE=>It's not your fault Willy. Not you're fault I'm stuck here. But you're hurting us all.
MIKE=>It's trying to get to you, Will. Kill it. Kill it now.
WILL=>No! I have to think.
PENNYWISE/GEORGIE=>Mom and dad they should know. They should know it's not your fault. I'll tell `em. I'll tell `em as long as you don't hurt us anymore.
BEVERLY=>Finish him, Will. For all of us. For Georgie.
RICHIE=>I'm taking this fucker out.
WILL=>No.
WILL=>I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick.
GEORGIE=>It's okay, Willy. I know. Everything'll be okay.
WILL=>Hairspray.
GEORGIE=>No! No Willy! Please!
EDDIE=>Did we kill it?
MIKE=>You did it, Will.
RICHIE=>It's miller ti--
WILL=>We've got to get out of here.
RICHIE=>Shit!
WILL=>We'll get out. C'mon.
STAN=>We're going to drown down here aren't we?
EDDIE MIKE=>I'm so cold. All this water. It's still going to win.
WILL=>No. I don't know--
BEN=>We're dead. So dead.
BEVERLY=>Guys, stop it. Focus.
RICHIE=>Now can we celebrate?
BEVERLY=>Will?
WILL=>Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't dead, if it ever returns, we'll come back and fight it together.
MIKE=>But we beat It. We beat the cancer.
MIKE'S MOM=>What are you talking about?
MIKE=>Derry. The clown. It.
MIKE'S MOM=>He's in a better place, Mikey. I know it's hard to believe. But you have to. Remember what your father always said...
LEROY=>See son, everything has a cycle. Just when you think the world couldn't get any colder, something good always grows.
SEPTEMBER=>EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY
ZACH=>Load up!
BEVERLY=>We all pitched in.
EDDIE=>Well Richie mostly.
RICHIE=>I had to mow like five hundred lawns. Stan smoked the clippings.
STAN BEN=>What does that even mean? You gonna open it?
MIKE=>We hear Arcadia's pretty amazing this time of year.
BEVERLY=>Take some pictures for us.
WILL=>Thanks.
SHARON=>Willy c'mon!
