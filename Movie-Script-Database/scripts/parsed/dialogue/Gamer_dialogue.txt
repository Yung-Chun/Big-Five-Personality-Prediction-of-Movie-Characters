SANDRA=>Sandra.
GUARD=>Shut the fuck up.
SANDRA=>Putcher dick away...
GUARD=>Get some.
VOICE=>Eat shit please.
VOICE=>Can't say I didn't try...
VOICE=>Shit! Shit!
VOICE=>Suckage.
KABLE=>My name's Tillman.
KABLE)=>They say you only got three battles left til you get out...
OFFSCREEN VOICE=>Counting down five... four... three... two...
CHIEF OF STAFF=>Do we have the damn interview or don't we?
PRODUCER=>We're cunt hair close -
CHIEF OF STAFF=>I can't blow off the Three-Asian War for "close".
PRODUCER=>All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals... they care about Ken Castle -
CHIEF OF STAFF=>May I hear from Gina please?
GINA PARKER SMITH=>OK, Bob? Bob. You realize Castle has clocked exactly - one - media appearance to date and that was Walters' last interview before she died - NINE FUCKING YEARS AGO!
CHIEF OF STAFF=>Stop menstruating, just tell me we fucking have it -
GINA PARKER SMITH=>We fucking have it!
PRODUCER=>Burger chili fry?
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I'll freak a burger.
VOICEOVER=>First... there was society...
KEN CASTLE=>I ain't complainin'!
VOICEOVER=>Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy - SLAYERS.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Slayers.
KEN CASTLE=>Slayers.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Why isn't it murder?
KEN CASTLE=>Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I see - and has any one of these men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free?
KEN CASTLE=>I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.
PRODUCER=>What'd he say?
GINA PARKER SMITH=>... in an election tainted by suspected digital fraud... let's talk about the so-called generi-cons.
KEN CASTLE=>There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Right...
SUPERNOVA FLARE=>TO:
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Mr. Castle - how the hell does it work?
KEN CASTLE=>Simple.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Geek, geek, geek - come on, Castle, you promised us a demonstration.
KEN CASTLE=>Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see...
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Oh... my god. So cute.
KEN CASTLE=>You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I beg your pardon?
PRODUCER=>This motherfucker is off the charts.
CHIEF OF STAFF=>You realize he could buy our network.
PRODUCER=>Why would he?
BOARD OP=>That's fuckin scary.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Isn't it true that each human that undergoes the procedure will have a distinct IP address -- like a notebook computer or mobile device?
KEN CASTLE=>Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>That's a relief.
KEN CASTLE=>To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control?
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I don't... um...
KEN CASTLE=>Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>We will, Mr. Castle. We will.
KEN CASTLE=>Good little talk.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>My pleasure. Shit, can I tell you? I CAN. NOT. wait for the next Slayers. Kable has been unbelievable. His arms are just so... well, I know it's awful.
PRODUCER=>What the hell is that?
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue.
PRODUCER=>Mr. Castle, we have no idea...
KEN CASTLE=>Shush!
PRODUCER=>Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes... Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in.
KEN CASTLE=>Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>You're bad.
BOARD OP=>He's good.
PORN GIRL=>Wanna blow off a little steam?
FREEK=>Kable. Kable.
KABLE=>My name is Tillman, freak.
FREEK=>Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three.

PRISONER=>Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams...
WOMAN=>You want to get back to them.
KABLE=>Who's talking?
WOMAN=>Sign it.
KABLE=>What?
WOMAN=>Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you.
KABLE=>Why would anyone want my name?
WOMAN=>You don't even know what's going on out there, do you? Damn...
KABLE=>Wait. How did you get this picture? Have you seen them?
TED NUGENT=>Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son.
VOICE=>Oh shit... oh shit...
VOICE=>Wul hello thar...
KABLE=>Turn me around God damn it...
VOICE=>What'd he say?
BROWN SOLDIER=>Who are they... who the fuck are they... who's playing us?
SIMON=>Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm.
FEMALE VOICE=>Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.
SIMON=>Daddy like...
ANNOYING GIRL=>Simon!
SIMON=>Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
ANNOYING GIRL=>You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
SIMON=>Uh huh.
ANNOYING GIRL=>Shut up bitch.
SIMON=>What is that? Aaaa.
SHELLY=>What's up, loser?
SIMON=>Hey sissy.
SHELLY=>Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
SIMON=>Wanna make out?
SHELLY=>You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian.
TWINS=>Simon?
SIMON=>Maybe.
TWINS=>Oh my god, it's really you!!!
SIMON=>Nice.
TWINS=>Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?
SIMON=>Uh, sure.
SIMON=>Here we go.
SIMON=>Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
SIMON=>It's been real.
GUY=>Hey.
GORGE=>Hi.
ANGIE=>Hi.
GUY=>So what's your damage?
GORGE/ANGIE=>You know, just hanging out. Looking to meet people.
GUY=>Lucky you...
DALE=>You met me.
GUY=>You met me.
GORGE/ANGIE=>I'm Nika.
DALE/GUY=>I'm Dale. I like your fur.
GORGE/ANGIE=>Do you want to go somewhere?
DALE/GUY=>We are somewhere.
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>... a new video prank by the subversive group humanz caused a nationwide stir today...
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>All contact between Society City and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over three hours while Castle techs worked to remove what they described as a "Satellite Infection"...
NEWS CO-HOST=>Don't cry for Castle, he can cover that with the change under his couch cushions...
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>On a personal note - that shit was fucking freaky.
NEWS CO-HOST=>Oh - I literally pissed myself.
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>Sounds like fun.
NEWS CO-HOST=>Serious, these humanz cocksuckers are getting out of control, and someone should do something.
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>Moving on to international headlines...
ASIAN PRISONER=>GET IT OUT OF ME...!
GUARD=>What the hell happened to this one?
LIFER=>Look like he escaped.
GUARD=>Back to your Jazzercise, girls...
KABLE=>Freak.
FREEK=>Tillmans.
KABLE=>Who the hell is that?
FREEK=>New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...
HISPANIC GUARD=>Hey Kable.
HISPANIC GUARD=>Who aims?
KABLE=>What?
HISPANIC GUARD=>Who aims... the slayer? Or the player?
KABLE=>Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.
HISPANIC GUARD=>That's tripped.
KABLE=>Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way.
HISPANIC GUARD=>Why?
KABLE=>There's a delay...
HISPANIC GUARD=>Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping...
KABLE=>Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls -
HACKMAN=>Hey. Kable.
KABLE=>Not interested.
HACKMAN=>No. Wait. Look.
KABLE=>Your head ain't on straight.
HACKMAN=>I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
KABLE=>Yeah, probably.
HACKMAN=>That's why they put me here.
KABLE=>- the fuck did you say?
HACKMAN=>On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first...
CASTLE=>He's so perfect.
CASTLE=>Yeah...
CASTLE=>They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
CASTLE=>It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...
CASTLE=>Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con...
CASTLE=>YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
VOICE=>Kable, dude. It's me.
KABLE=>Who?
SIMON=>Simon. I'm playing you, dummy.
KABLE=>How come I can hear you?
SIMON=>It's a mod.
KABLE=>Gamers can't talk to cons.
SIMON=>I know.
SIMON=>It's cool, yeah?
KABLE=>No. Pay attention to the game.
SIMON=>That was sick.
KABLE=>Wait a minute... are you twelve?
SIMON=>I'm nineteen.
KABLE=>Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet?
SIMON=>Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.
FREEK=>Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint...
SIMON=>Gibs.
KABLE=>What?
SIMON=>Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces.
KABLE=>These are real humans, fucker.
SIMON=>Death row psychos, so what? They had it coming.
KABLE=>Guess that goes for me too.
SIMON=>Yeah, but you're different.
KABLE=>Different how?
SIMON=>Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho.
SIMON=>Damn, new area.
KABLE=>That way.
SIMON=>Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run. It's going to suck to see it end.
KABLE=>Are you kidding me?
SIMON=>Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
KABLE=>We should go that way.
SIMON=>There's nothing there.
KABLE=>Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.
SIMON=>Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried.
SIMON=>... shit shit shit!
HACKMAN=>Bye Kable.
KABLE=>Kid's gonna get me killed.
SIMON=>Hey.
KABLE=>Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
SIMON=>What the hell...?
KABLE=>Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me loose.
SIMON=>But-
KABLE=>Find a way.
FREE=>And then: ORDER NOW!
CASEWORKER=>So... Miss Roth.
ANGIE=>Delia. Her name is Delia.
CASEWORKER=>Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
ANGIE=>My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon...
CASEWORKER=>Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.
ANGIE=>I work in society.
CASEWORKER=>Acting, is that what they call it?
ANGIE=>It's a job.
CASEWORKER=>Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything. I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
ANGIE=>Yes, I do. I'm her mother.
CASEWORKER=>We will give your application all the consideration that it merits.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>You like the software?
SIMON=>Software...
HUMANZ BROTHER=>The walkie talkie, playa.
SIMON=>No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said?
SIMON=>To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
SIMON=>You were listening.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.
SIMON=>Alright, then. Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
SIMON=>Huh? What things?
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out... Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.
SIMON=>One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit.
SIMON=>This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. You want to win it, don't you?
SIMON=>Yeah, dude, I intend to.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa.
SIMON=>That... would be cheating.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.
SIMON=>Uhhh...
HUMANZ BROTHER=>The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
SIMON=>I do. I do feel you.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Then let's rock, baby.
WOMAN=>Tillman.
KABLE=>You.
WOMAN=>We know you talked to him... your Player.
KABLE=>You're not a guard... who are you?
WOMAN=>A friend.
KABLE=>I don't have any.
WOMAN=>Listen to me: Simon's going to give you what you want. What you asked him for.
KABLE=>How do you know that?
WOMAN=>I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it.
KABLE=>We'll see.
WOMAN=>No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way.
KABLE=>I need you to get me something.
WOMAN=>What, Kable... what can I get you?
KABLE=>Drunk.
VOICE=>What's he got there?
SIMON=>I can see turning you loose was a great idea.
KABLE=>What happened.
SIMON=>YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
KABLE=>No shit...
SIMON=>Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up...
SIMON=>What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something!
SIMON=>Fuck it.
KABLE=>Blow me.
SIMON=>Dammit!
SIMON=>Kable. Dude. What are you doing?
KABLE=>Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?
HACKMAN=>Fuuuuck!!!!
SIMON=>Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!!
SIMON=>Um.
KABLE=>Ughh, that was the one.
SIMON=>Shit, shit, SHIT!
FEMALE VOICE=>Please stand by... Please stand by... Please stand by...
FRAT GUY=>What just happened?
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>To recap: initial reports are that Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon next to Ken Castle himself - is officially listed as fragged...
NEWS CO-HOST=>That's bullshit.
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>... just one session away from being the first slayer ever to win a full pardon and release.
FEMALE NEWS HOST=>In a NETCAST plagued by technical difficulties and dead spots the report could NOT be confirmed - however KABLE - born John Tillman of Albany, New York and convicted of murder just four years ago - has been removed from Slayers rosters and upcoming events listings.
TRACE=>She's not home.
KABLE=>Who are you?
TRACE=>You asked me that once before.
KABLE=>Your voice...
TRACE=>You should really come with me...
3D-ID=>novelty toy
TRACE=>Hang on.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>You a fool.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>It's a game of deception.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Whatever, that's cuz you got no power...
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Bullshit.
KABLE=>You guys suck.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Kable. Holy shit.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>His name's Tillman.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Whatever. You made it. You're really here.
KABLE=>You're the ones who broke me out?
TRACE=>We only freed your mind.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Your ass followed.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Hey, Kable...
HUMANZ BROTHER=>You got questions.
KABLE=>A few.
HUMANZ DUDE=>The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain...
KABLE=>Alright. Why me?
HUMANZ DUDE=>Because Castle's scared of you.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human.
TRACE=>Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice.
HUMANZ DUDE=>But this is only the beginning.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line.
TRACE=>So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again...
HUMANZ BROTHER=>This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.
TRACE=>The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse?
HUMANZ DUDE=>Hell no.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves.
TRACE=>We can't let that happen.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Gotta bring the man down.
TRACE=>You can help us, Tillman. You have to help us.
KABLE=>I can't help you.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Tillman.
AGENT KEITH=>Guess you remember that day.
SIMON=>Good times.
AGENT KEITH=>Sure. On the outside. Now look at these.
SIMON=>Yeah, um... I need something too.
AGENT KEITH=>Do you now? And what might that be?
SIMON=>Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape.
AGENT KEITH=>Pistachio. They make that?
SIMON=>It's awesome.
BARTENDER=>The usual?
RICK RAPE=>Hi Nika.
ANGIE=>Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?
RICK RAPE=>That was just last month. I was a bad boy.
ANGIE=>Are you still a bad boy?
RICK RAPE=>Urkk.
GORGE/ANGIE=>Please don't kill me.
KABLE=>Don't say that.
RAGE)=>God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker.
GORGE/ANGIE=>I can't.
KABLE=>You can hear me, baby. I know you can.
GORGE/ANGIE=>I love you too.
KABLE=>SHUT UP!!!
KABLE=>I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program...
HACKMAN=>Hi, Kable.
HACKMAN=>Anybody in there?
GORGE/ANGIE=>Come on... do it...
KABLE=>YOU! WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?
KABLE=>You. Run.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I can get you out.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I can't believe it's you. This is... Listen: you can trust me, Kable.
KABLE=>If not...
KABLE=>Now what?
HUMANZ DUDE=>The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>It's an anti-spyware program.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out of me.
TRACE=>That would be like cutting out part of your brain.
KABLE=>How long will she sleep?
TRACE=>We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears.
HUMANZ DUDE=>Thirty minutes... you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot human.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Tillman.
KABLE=>So talk.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Come on.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Ken Castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after.
KABLE=>Yeah. He was.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>The second was you.
KABLE=>The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell, gradual... the new tissue would never break down, never deteriorate. A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were doing the world a favor.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society.
KABLE=>Thank you for the history lesson.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know.
KABLE=>I don't know what to tell you.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>You ain't gotta tell me shit, Tillman. I want you to show me.
TRACE=>Alright. We're ready to rock.
GORGE=>Hooz there?
GEEK LEADER=>Tech support.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>What are we looking at?
HUMANZ BROTHER=>His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>I read something about this. But that tech is supposed to be a decade away...
HUMANZ DUDE=>Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around.
SCOTCH=>Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille.
KABLE=>Scotch.
SCOTCH=>Scotch. I'll tell you what man: this place sucks.
SCOTCH=>They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day... nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add...
SCOTCH=>What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being... they let you out already?
KABLE=>I'm not getting out.
OK.=>Tillman... dude. Are you good?
KABLE=>I'm fine.
SCOTCH=>Uh huh. You don't look good.
KABLE=>I'm sorry.
SCOTCH=>Well, it's not like you ever looked that good...
GINA PARKER SMITH=>What's happening?
SCOTCH=>Tillman...
KABLE=>I can't stop it... can't...
SCOTCH=>Who are you?
KABLE=>I'm sorry...
HUMANZ DUDE=>Not the best commercial for K-soft technology.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>You can say that again.
TRACE=>He made him do it. Castle made him do it.
HUMANZ BROTHER=>A test.
KABLE=>It's you.
ANGIE=>I missed you... so much...
KABLE=>Delia.
TRACE=>Nobody could. *
KABLE=>Where is she?
TRACE=>I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy. She's with Castle.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Tillman!
KABLE=>That's all the story you're going to get.
AGENT KEITH=>Alright, Silverton. Get up and get out.
SIMON=>Cool.
AGENT KEITH=>Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat.
FEMALE VOICE=>No link... no link.
KABLE=>Delia...
KEN CASTLE=>Not bad for video, eh?
KEN CASTLE=>You're awesome.
KABLE=>Castle.
KEN CASTLE=>Kable.
KABLE KEN CASTLE=>I don't care about you. You don't care about me.
KEN CASTLE=>I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is...
KEN CASTLE=>But mine's different. Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it.
KABLE=>Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.
KEN CASTLE=>You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.
KABLE=>You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a shot.
KEN CASTLE=>I think you're missing the point, my man.
KABLE=>No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this... ... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.
KEN CASTLE=>Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...
KEN CASTLE=>Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
SIMON=>Ummm.
KEN CASTLE=>Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?
KABLE=>No.
KEN CASTLE=>Just like last time. Remember?
PONYTAIL GEEK=>There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address.
GEEK LEADER=>Someone on the outside is sending him commands...
KEN CASTLE=>JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS!
GEEK=>Working on it...
KEN CASTLE=>I think it.
KABLE=>Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.
GEEK LEADER=>Oops.
SIMON=>YES!!!
KABLE=>Damn it, kid...
SIMON=>Sorry.
DELIA=>Are you my Daddy Tillman?
KABLE=>Wait.
GEEK=>Pardon?
KABLE=>The nanex. Set us free.
GEEK LEADER=>True dat.
DELIA=>Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken?
TRACE=>This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you do the right thing with it.
GINA PARKER SMITH=>Oh, baby...
KABLE=>You good, sweetheart?
