BOY'S VOICE=>When can I see him?
WOMAN'S VOICE=>When he's well.
6.C0NT. BOY'S VOICE 6.CONT,=>When will he be well? After a moment --
WOMAN'S VOICE=>I don't know. -- and the sound of a door closing. A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend, crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner. And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light.
OPERATOR=>Yes?
SAYER=>When you say people ... you mean living people, . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what?
DIRECTOR=>Living people, yes. Patients.
SAYER=>I ' m here for the research * position . . . in your neurology * lab.
DIRECTOR=>Neurology lab? He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it.
DIRECTOR=>We have an x-ray room. Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems * to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned - *
KAUFMAN=>- The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist. . Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he * knows about the world is wrong. f
DIRECTOR=>A doctor ... doctor. The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands, Sayer's resume.
DIRECTOR=>The Camel Institute. Tell me * about that, anything with patients * there? Or . . . *
SAYER=>Earthworms. The Director isn't sure he heard right.
DIRECTOR=>Sorry? ,
SAYER=>It was an immense project. " I was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms.
SAYER=>I was on it for five years. I was the only one who really believed in it. The rest of them said it couldn't be done. t
KAUFMAN=>It can't.
SAYER=>Well, I know that now. I proved it. The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again.
DIRECTOR=>Maybe before. At Saint Thomas. All research. Earth - ?
SAYER=>Pigs brains . . . theyre quite similar to human brains.
DIRECTOR=>Are they?
SAYER=>Oh, yes . . . three years. As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business being here. He should leave.
SAYER=>Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here. Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background. He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out. But the * director keeps searching the resume.
KAUFMAN=>Thanks anyway.
DIRECTOR=>Back in medical school ... Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says, No, we're not that desperate.
DIRECTOR=>I mean, you couldn't have graduated without some clinical experience. . Sayer hesitates. And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a n od ., v'
DIRECTOR=>Well, there we are, doctor. Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says, We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director.
DIRECTOR=>You do want the job, don't you? Sayer isn't so sure. He thinks about it long and hard . . .
ANTHONY O.S.=>Spent much time in chronic hospitals, doctor? A patient approaches, and, passing Sayer and the orderly who's escorting him , offers - FEMALE PATIENT 1 Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . . .
SAYER=>I guess not. As they pass an old patient in a wheelchair -
ANTHONY=>Hey, how you doing? Dr. Sullivan. Staying on the old patient, he eventually manages, too late -
OLD PATIENT=>Fn ... ie Down the hall in an alcove, Dr. Sullivan glances up long sufferingly from-a.patient~with'.an .Ouij a-board who !.s mumbling, * complaining, unintelligibly. Anthony and Sayer arrrive.
ANTHONY=>Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer;
SULLIVAN=>Not the neurologist, that'd be asking too much. You're not the neurologist.
SAYER=>I think I am. Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it -
SULLIVAN=>Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake. - Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand. 9. OMITTED 9. 10. INT. DAYROOM - DAY 10. A woman in a wheelchair uttering high-pitched screams . Sayer in a lab coat trying to calm her.
SAYER=>Mrs. Cohen?
MRS. COHEN=>Hes here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means.
SAYER=>I 'm here. To examine you.
MRS. COHEN=>Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home.
SAYER=>Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13. OMITTED .
MISS COSTELLO O.S.=>It gets easier. Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all. She's standing in the doorway.
MISS COSTELLO=>You don't think it will, but it does. A moment and she A urns and leaves.
SAYER'S VOICE=>Can you hear me? .
SAYER'S VOICE=>Do you know where you are? Do you remember being brought here? Do you know what has happened? If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere , cut adrift by her illness, living in a private world .
SAYER'S VOICE=>Can you hear me? Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes. Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable. .
SAYERÂ«S VOICE=>Her name is Lucy Fishman . . .
SAYER'S VOICE=>She was found by neighbors with * her sister, several days after the , sister had died . . .
SAYER=>According to the neighbors, * she's never set foot outside her * apartment, has no other living * relatives, and has always been the * way she is now - without any * comprehension or response. *
SAYER=>And yet . . . Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it. And stays there, stiff, still. Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --
DR. KAUFMAN=>A reflex.
SAYER=>If she batted it away I might call that a reflex. She doesn't bat it away, she catches it.
DR. KAUFMAN=>- It's still a reflex.
SAYER=>I'm sorry, if you were right I'd agree with you. Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment. Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.
SAYER=>It's as if . . . having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball. Awkward silence. Eventually--
DR. TYLER=>The "will of the ball?" Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd.
DR. SULLIVAN=>Excuse me. Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room. So does Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.
DR. KAUFMAN=>Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr. Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow?
MISS COSTELLO=>Yes, sir.
DR. KAUFMAN=>Good night. Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy, looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one, doesn't.
SAYER=>One . . . . Two . . . Three . . . Four . . . Five. Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.
SAYER=>What'd I forget?
MISS COSTELLO=>I just wanted to say to you I preferred your explanation. () It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.
MISS COSTELLO=>And that I'll look after things for you until you've "settled in." Good night, doctor. She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard. To it eventually, quietly --
SAYER=>Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection --
SAYER=>Thank you very much.
SIDNEY V.O.=>I am not mad ... not mad . . .
SIDNEY V.O.=>I know the difference between what is real and what is not . . . Beyond a chain-link fence, across the field, on the roof of one of Bainbridge's brick buildings, peering down from the edge of it, coat over his smock, hat on his head, an elderly man.
SIDNEY=>The voice was real.
SAYER=>What did the voice say?
SIDNEY=>"Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat, go up to the roof and jump off."
SAYER=>Did you recognize it as belonging to a person? Or was it just a voice? Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously ... then smiles slyly. *
SIDNEY=>You don't deny it was you. *
SAYER=>Me? Sayer is taken aback. As is Sidney. One of them, and Sidney believes he knows which, is lying or crazy. ' ' * SAYER ' . I do deny it. It wasn't me. It wasn't real. We've only just now met, sir. Â» Sidney, suddenly completely disoriented, withdraws.
SIDNEY=>If that's true . . . I'm in a predicament.
DR. SULLIVAN=>We'd be high up - 40th, 50th floor, nice midtown view - suite * of offices, carpeted, good-looking * receptionist - *
DR. SULLIVAN=>We could have all that ... but we'd miss all this. We'd miss the wards.
DR. TYLER=>The smell of them.
DR. SULLIVAN=>We'd miss this place - We'd miss this . . . Whatever this is. .
SAYER=>Ye .... Sayer glances up at them, having paid attention to nothing they've said, and nods at some other thought. . ' SAYER Yes . . . ,' He leaves his tray where he stands, and heads out of the cafeteria. v
SAYER=>Did you see me when-1 "spoke?" Sidney thinks about it, tries to remember, to summon back the moment in question, to picture it exactly as it happened, or didn't happen.
SIDNEY=>No.
SAYER=>You see me now though.
SIDNEY=>Yes.

STATE OF NEW YORK=>A typed date / AUGUST 2, 1929. The admitting physician's name. The patient's name. And age / 15. An identification number and ward assignment number. As Sayer pulls the folder and closes the drawer of one of several filing cabinets lining the walls of a claustrophobic room, Miss Costello slides open another, locates a particular folder in it and in the folder another admitting form -- The date / MAY 7, 1932. Names and numbers. Another drawer. Sayer pulling another folder. Another admission form ~ Date / DECEMBER 12, 1930. Age of the patient / 22.
MISS COSTELLO=>"Atypical Hysteria," this one. Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44."
SAYER=>There must be more recent files we missed somehow. "Part Twos" to their medical histories. In some other filing cabinet somewhere. . ..
MISS COSTELLO=>NO.
SAYER=>One would think that after a point enough atypical somethings would amount to a typical something. But a typical "what?" Miss Costello, no doubt, has less of an idea than Sayer what the "what" could be.
MISS COSTELLO=>, Doctor . . . would you like to g e t a cup of coffee somewhere? Tea?
SAYER=>Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . . only I've made other plans . . . She nods quickly. She seems, strangely, relieved.
MISS COSTELLO=>Some other time.
SAYER=>Yes.
MISS COSTELLO=>Good night.
SAYER=>Good night. They veer apart to their respective cars.
WAITER=>Tea, right?
SAYER=>P e s . '...- lae The waiter leaves. Sayer glances back into the fish tank at the eel behind the rock, its rock, its home.
JANITOR=>I'm sorry, doctor. I thought someone left the lights on.
SAYER=>They all survived encephalitis years before they came here. In the 1920' s . He taps a finger at the files - the patients' medical histories prior to admission - forms listing childhood diseases and ailments. The janitor, having no idea of course what he means, retreats with his pail and mop, closing the door. 36A. EXT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY 36A. 37. INT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - DAY 37. Sayer displays what he has written on the back of his hand to an assistant librarian: NEJM 4-6-35.
SAYER=>The New England Journal of Medicine, April 6th, 1935. *
OLD DOCTOR=>Pus and pain, that's the final * reward. Pus and pain and obscurity. He's in a small unkept rose garden. With Sayer. *
OLD DOCTOR=>That's the problem with a unique disease. Once it no longer rages, I'm telling you, it becomes very unfashionable. . He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer.
OLD DOCTOR=>What would I be without this thing? A man with a1 shred of dignity le_ft.
SAYER=>Should I get your nurse?
OLD DOCTOR=>God forbid, no. He lights a cigarette, coughs and puts it out.
OLD DOCTOR=>How many have you found there?
SAYER=>Five. So far. I think there may be more. The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing. Finally --
OLD DOCTOR=>How are they?
SAYER=>As you described them. As they were back then. As "insubstantial as ghosts." Only I guess most of them were children then.
OLD DOCTOR=>Yes. Children who fell asleep.
OLD DOCTOR=>Most died during the acute stage of the illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn't be roused. A sleep that in most cases lasted several months. The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell - a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from invisible strings.
OLD DOCTOR=>Those who survived, who awoke, seemed fine, as though nothing had happened. Years went by - five, ten, fifteen - before anyone suspected they were not well. . They were not. A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.
OLD DOCTOR=>I began to see them in the early 1930's - old people brought in by their children, young people brought in by their parents - all of them complaining they weren't "themselves" anymore. They'd grown distant, aloof, anti-social, they daydreamed at the dinner table. I referred them to psychiatrists. The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal- shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside. They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.
SAYER=>What must it be like to be them? On the screen, the young man's eyes, entranced, gaze upward as if trying hard to remember something. Or trying hard to forget it.
SAYER=>What are they thinking? . OLD DOCTOR
SAYER=>We know that for a fact.
OLD DOCTOR=>Yes.
SAYER=>Bec use . . .
OLD DOCTOR=>Because the alternative is unthinkable.
SAYER=>Sorry. .
MISS COSTELLO=>It's different.
SAYER=>Quite. It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it.
SAYER=>Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses.
SAYER=>Could he be saying, "I can't draw a triangle, don't make me"? Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To himself -
SAYER=>Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . .
MRS. LOWE=>Of course not. Not in words.
SAYER=>He speaks to you in other ways. How do you mean? MRS. LOWE i You don't have children.
SAYER=>No. ,
MRS. LOWE=>If you did you'd know. Finished with his hair, she wheels him from the sleeping ward * and into the -
SAYER=>I'd like to examine him again-if that's all right with you. MRS. LOWE , He did well.
SAYER=>In a sense.
MRS. LOWE=>He's very clever. Aren't you, Leonard. . Sayer shows her the perception test "drawing** Leonard made.
SAYER=>Does this mean anything to you? MRS. LOWE . ; It's very good. ' She glances back to Sayer who nods uncertainly. She recognizes. the look on his face; she's seen it before on the faces of more doctors than she cares to remember. ' f
MRS. LOWE=>Well it's abstract, isn't it. Sayer can't bring himself to agree with her.
MRS. LOWE=>That's the problem with all you doctors, you have no imagination. Everything has to be real to you. No longer having any use for him, she pointedly ignores him. Taking the hint, Sayer's wanders off, past Lucy, looking like a statue, holding the paper cup he brought her.
MRS. LOWE=>He slowly got worse. He'd be talking, suddenly he'd come to a stop. After a few seconds he'd finish what he was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer. Sometimes he'd call to me and I'd come in and find him at his desk in a trance. An hour, two hours. Then he'd be okay again.
MRS. LOWE=>One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. "What do you want, Leonard?" She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants. Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs.
MR.S LOWE=>He never spoke again. It was like he'd disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty. Sayer glances away from her to the room itself again.
SAYER=>What'd he do with himself, Mrs. Lowe, those nine years he stayed in this room? She smiles to herself, proudly it seems.
MRS. LOWE=>He read. y
MANN=>When you say you're working with people, you don't mean living people. (
SAYER=>Living people, yes. Patients. Mann just stares. He's a scientist, they both are, and the idea of Sayer working with living people, rather than expired ones laid out on the pathology table, is inconceivable to him.
MANN=>Where?
SAYER=>It's in The Bronx. It's a poor private chronic hospital called M ou nt --
MANN=>Oh, Malcolm, Malcolm, come back, come on. You're a benchman, you're no clinician, why would you lower yourself? Sayer hasn't an answer for him. Â»
SAYER=>How's Hank?
MANN=>How's Hank? He's great, he's brilliant, look at him. Sayer glances away to Hank the monkey, watches him. Mann studies Sayer, chagrined and incredulous.
MANN=>A physician? You? He slaps him angrily across the shoulders with some papers. The monkey completes a complex sequence which opens a chamber revealing an electric train. The animal jumps and hoots with wild glee. Sayer reaches out and presses the button on the stop watch dangling from Mann's neck.
SAYER=>Subtract two seconds off his time.
MANN=>Don't look at me like that. It's for his alphabet lessons. We're busy, Hank, go play solitaire. The monkey obediently goes off in search of a deck of cards. Gesturing at patterns on the EEG --
MANN=>Asleep. First stage normal. Second a little dull. Normal
RM...=>He shrugs, lays out a second EEG, and gestures at patterns on it --
MANN=>Awake. Slightly erratic. No more so than a lot of people walking the streets of New York. I give up, what's wrong with him?
SAYER=>You have them backwards. This is him awake . . . This is him asleep.
MANN=>This is him awake? This is him asleep? Sayer nods. Mann tries, without success, to make some sort of sense out of that.
MANN=>What are you saying? When he's awake, what, he's dreaming?
SAYER=>When there's any brain activity at all, which is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating.
MANN=>And when he's asleep . . . ?
SAYER=>When he's asleep he manages to create a kind of reality. What we might call reality.
MANN=>That's what you think these say?
SAYER=>1 don't know. Mann studies the "waking" EEC He points to its one and only large electrical peak. ;
MANN=>What's this peak? Strobe?
SAYER=>No. This is the strobe. Sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is scribbled in pencil a small "s."
SAYER=>This . . . , / . . . is me saying his name to him. Mann stares rather dumbly at Sayer. Then at Hank the monkey on the floor dealing solitaire.
NURSE=>The patients have all been given their morning medication.
MISS COSTELLO=>Good. Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time. She hands a book to the nurse who spoke , a first edition worn /rom many readings. Margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to Miss Costello.
MARGARET=>"Call me . . . Ish-ma-el . . .
MARGARET=>"Some years ago, never mind how long precisely, having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world . . . " Miss Costello leaves.
SAYER=>Can you hear me, Leonard? I want to hear you speak your name. :
FERNANDO=>. . . not just any music, it has to be the right, music for them. Jazz does nothing for Bert. Only Rose. It's like they're only moved by music that moves them. I'm that w ay .
SAYER=>Yes, so am I. > The moment Fernando takes the record off, Rose stops eating, stops moving. The orderly puts on Mozart and waits. Neither patient moves.
FERNANDO=>I haven't found anything that moves Bert yet.
SAYER=>That's not true.
MS WOMAN=>I wish I had something like that. SSmething that would interest you instead of this stupid boring MS.
MARGARET=>They'll sit there all day like that if I let them. I have to play the first card. Sayer watches her pull a card from one of their hands and place it on the table. All three "wake" and begin throwing down cards, one after another.
SAYER=>Is it a real game I wonder?
MARGARET=>If it is, I don't know it. Maybe it's three different games.
SAYER=>Yes. 62. OMITTED ,
SAYER O.S.=>Leonard?
SAYER=>I'll begin moving the pointer toward the "L." For "Leonard." Once I feel you beginning to move it, I'll stop and you'll take . over. Do you understand? Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful and foolish.
SAYER=>I'm beginning . . . The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons. Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.
SAYER=>Yes, good . . . The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "L" without stopping. It stops on the "R."
SAYER=>No. No, I didn't make myself clear. My fault. I . . . . The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer. It passes the "L" again, reaches the "I" and stops. SAYER ' "., No. No, I . . . . .
SAYER=>Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. . "L." Good. Now the "E." It begins moving again. But not to the "E." To the nK," where it hesitates briefly before moving again.
SAYER=>. . . you're spelling something el e . . . Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to "write": RILKESPA
RILKESPANTHERILKE=>He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a slash between the "S" and the "P," so that it reads: R I L K E s/p A N T H E R BmBJUP*
SAYER'S VOICE=>"His gaze from staring through the bars has grown so weary that it can take in nothing more . . .
SAYER'S VOICE=>"For him it is as though there were a thousand bars, and behind the thousand bars, no world . . .
SAYER V.O.=>"As he paces in cramped circles, over and over, his powerful strides are like a ritual dance around a center where a great will stands paralyzed . . . Moving slowly away from Sayer watching, moving high above him; the place is virtually deserted.
SAYER V.O.=>"At times the curtains of the eye lift without a sound . . . Moving slowly< in on Sayer, unseen in a doorway, staring at Leonard, at the look of contentment on his face. Or is it a look of impotent rage?
SAYER V.O.=>". . . and a shape enters, '.slips thr ough the tightened silence of the shoulders, reaches the heart and dies .i." . ... FADE TO BLACK . '''.'
NEUROCHEMIST=>There's an ordinary medicine with which we are all familiar. An everyday medicine of stubbed toes and bunions and boils. A man at a podium in a modern version of the 1920's basement operating theatre.
NEUROCHEMIST=>And then there is another kind. A medicine that holds out to the afflicted the promise of restored life. He glances to a point above his listeners, and an overhead projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure onto a screen. The neurochemist traces the shadow to its maker in the audience.
SAYER=>Thank you. Yes. Yes, I'm very much interested in your work with this drug. I'm curious if . . .
NEUROCHEMIST=>Doctor ...?
SAYER=>Sayer. I'm curious if you . . .
NEUROCHEMIST=>After I'm through, Dr. Sayer. If you wouldn't mind. Sayer glances around the auditorium. Everyone's looking at him. He grasps the offending hand and holds it in his lap with the other.
SAYER O.S.=>Do you think it's possible that simple Parkinsonian tremor taken to its furthest extreme could appear as no tremor at all? When no one answers, the chemist glances over his shoulder. Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him.
NEUROCHEMIST=>Are you speaking to me? Sayer is. And really wants to know the answer. The chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands.
SAYER=>If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow accelerated - - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone? He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post- encephalitic's, staring. The chemist slowly dries his hands with a paper towel.
NEUROCHEMIST=>Dr. Sayer, yes? I'm a chemist, doctor. I leave it to you guys to do the damage. He drops the paper towel into the trash and leaves
KAUFMAN=>Freud believed in miracles. Prescribing cocaine like it was candy . . . Sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads toward the hospital.
KAUFMAN=>We all believed in the "miracle" of Cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it. Now it's L-Dopa. He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back.
SAYER=>With all due respect, I think it's rather too soon to say that.
KAUFMAN=>With all due "respect," it's rather way too soon. Let the chemists do the damage. The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another. Kaufman disappears into the building.
SAYER=>Did you read the case - the husband who came home to find his wife singing. She hadn't felt like singing in years. Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets down the receiver.
77A.CONT. KAUFMAN 77A.=>I read them all. Soberly. All thirty cases had mild Parkinson's. Your Parkies - if that's what they are - haven't moved for decades. You know better than to make a leap like that, you want to believe there's a connection, that doesn't mean there is one.
SAYER=>What I believe, what I know, is that these people are alive inside.
KAUFMAN=>How do you know? Because they catch tennis balls?
SAYER=>I know it. Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact.
KAUFMAN=>r..iiJi! And what if this drug were to kill them? SAYER - > And what if this drug were to cure them? Somewhere behind Kaufman's eyes Sayer can see, he thinks, a change, or reminiscence, long ago, long buried, of things he once believed or wanted to believe.
KAUFMAN=>How many did you think I ' d let you put on it?
SAYER=>All of them ... some of them ... one of them . . .
KAUFMAN=>One. With the family's consent. Signed. Sayer tries to hide his elation and turns to leave before Kaufman changes his mind.
77A.CONT. KAUFMAN 77A.=>Sayer - Sayer turns. He was almost to the door. He had almost made * it out.
KAUFMAN=>That "immense" project of yours. The myelin? The worms? When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab supervisor? Sayer thinks about lying, but senses Kaufman knows the answer * already and just wants to hear him say it. So he does:
SAYER=>He asked me to leave. . Kaufman nods like, Just checking. And - KAUFMAN . Good luck. Sayer leaves.
SAYER=>People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've "lost their grace . . . " They have to think about the things we just do . . . It has to do with a chemical in the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move more naturally. He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down.
MRS. LOWE=>Leonard has Parkinson's Disease?
78.CONT. SAYER=>No. No, his symptoms ... are like Parkinsons ... and then again they're not. She doesn't understand what he means; there's no reason why she should.
MRS. LOWE=>Then what will this medicine dp. for him?
SAYER=>I don't know what it'll do for him, if anything.
MRS. LOWE=>What do you think it will do?
SAYER=>I don't know.
MRS. LOWE=>What db< you hope it will do?
SAYER=>I hope it'll bring him back from wherever he is.
(O MRS. LOWE=>To what?
SAYER=>To the world.
MRS. LOWE=>What's here for him after all these years? '
SAYER=>You are here. She ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation, all the while staring at the consent form.
SAYER=>I have no idea. What do you say we ease into it with ... what, Â» . fifty milligrams? Ray begins to measure five milligrams.
SAYER=>Let's say a hundred. Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder, removing all but 100 milligrams.
SAYER=>Leonard? Your mother's going to give you some juice. There's medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual. Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat. Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer. And they all wait.
RAY=>Maybe the acid in the orange juice, neutralized it.
SAYER=>Or maybe it's not enough.
SAYER=>I'll try it in milk.
RAY=>Five hundred milligrams.
SAYER=>I'll call if there's any change.
MRS. LOWE=>Yes. Neither really knows what else to say except for good night. She leaves.
MISS COSTELLO=>I'm going home too. If you need me . *
SAYER=>Yes, I'll call. They nod "good night" atT each other and Miss Costello leaves. Sayer slumps into Leonard's wheelchair. lAnd waits.
LEONARD=>It's quiet.
SAYER=>It's late. Everyone's asleep>
LEONARD=>I'm not asleep?
SAYER=>No. You're awake. Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath Leonard's hands.
SAYER=>May I? Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name.
LEONARD=>Me.
SAYER O.S.=>Leonard? Leonard turns to Sayer's voice with an expression of child-like , wonder on his face.
SAYER=>Your mother is here. She appears in the doorway of the room. She's done her hair, her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her "infant son" who is now, "suddenly," a man. As he slowly crosses toward her, she is struck by the fact she must look uÂ£ in order to meet his eyes. He reaches her. Reaches out to her. And she embraces him.
MISS COSTELLO=>My name is Elizabeth. It's a Â» pleasure to meet you. Leonard, standing, reaches for her hand and struggles to pronounce her name correctly. Fighting to keep from crying in front of him, Miss Costello glances to Sayer and Mrs. Lowe.
MARGARET=>How do you do, sir? My name is Margaret.
LEONARD=>Margaret.
LEONARD=>Fernando. How are you?
FERNANDO=>Great, man. How're you?
LEONARD=>Great, too.
RAY=>How do you do, Mr. Lowe?
LEONARD=>Good, sir.
LEONARD=>It's delicious.
FERNANDO=>I wouldn't go that far, Len. Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles.
MISS COSTELLO=>I don't think I could deal with losing 3D years of my life. I can't even imagine it.
MISS COSTELLO=>He does realize it, doesn't he? Sayer nods uncertainly.
SAYER=>He must.
SAYER=>Splendid. Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate that it is not the 1930's.
SAYER=>Can I see you walk the length of the room? * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended. He's not younjg anymore. 98. OMITTED 99. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT 99. Sayer and Mrs. Lowe at Leonard's bedside.
SAYER=>. . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby.
SAYER=>I didn't sleep, did you?
MISS COSTELLO=>Does it look like it? . Sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat.
SAYER=>Do you know if Leonard's awake? She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room.
LEONARD=>Good morning. . His speech is still rather flat, halting.,
SAYER=>Been waiting for me long?
LEONARD=>Yes.
SAYER=>Some things have happened while you've been away. I thought you'd be interested. Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading from it to himself.
SAYER=>You don't have to read them now, Leonard. They're yours. At your leisure. Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like they're gold.
LEONARD=>I used to read quite a lot. Before. SAYER i Yes, I know. .
LEONARD=>Thank you for these. i . Sayer nods that he's welcome.
SAYER=>Have you thought about what you'd like to do today?
LEONARD=>Everything.
SAYER=>I'm not sure I can arrange that.
LEONARD=>Try. Sayer smiles again. For a man who just yesterday learned he has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard seems to have recovered extraordinarily.
SAYER=>Let's approach it this way. What . ". x do you think you'd like to do . 1J first? ..
LEONARD=>I'd like to go outside.
LEONARD=>What a wonderful place The Bronx has become. The music CONTINUES OVER:
THE LIFE"=>and it CONTINUES OVER:
LEONARD=>You just moved here.
SAYER=>Yeah. Well, five years ago. , Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop.
LEONARD=>Your son?
SAYER=>Me, actually. ' ,," t
LEONARD=>You seem uncomfortable.
SAYER=>I probably was. Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged.
SAYER=>Each has a specific purpose.
SAYER=>Those are my normal interior glasses. And spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one. Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses -
SAYER=>That's heavy-gauge metal so when I fall asleep and roll over on them I don't wreck them. They're indestructible. Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together.
SAYER=>As long as I pretty much know ahead of time what I'll be looking ' at, it works out, I don't have to carry all five pairs around.
LEONARD=>What if you just want to go for a walk?
SAYER=>Walks are a problem. Walks are the hardest thing. You just never know. He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and some saltine% on a tray.
SAYER=>I hope you'll forgive the inelegant presentation. I don't entertain much. / .
SAYER=>I can date my interest in science precisely, actually. I'd been * sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across the periodic table of elements. I memorized it. Which I admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort. The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were. Each element had its place, and nothing could * change that. They were secure, no * matter what. * Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than * understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little * exposed.
LEONARD=>You're not married. * It seems to Sayer a non sequitor. *
SAYER=>No. He smiles. Sips his tea. Silence except for the ticking of a * clock somewhere. Then, very matter of factly -
SAYER=>I'm not terribly good with people. I like them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them. Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . . He shrugs. Silence again.
LEONARD=>Eleanor would disagree with you. * Sayer stares at him blankly. He doesn't seem to know who "Eleanor11 is. . *
SAYER=>-~ Eleanor? ^r * LEONARD Miss Costello.
SAYER=>Oh, yes, of course. She's spoken to you about me? Leonard nods. Sayer can't imagine why, nor what she might have said. Fearing the worst --
SAYER=>What'd she say? LEONARD ' That you're a kind man. That you care very much for people. Sayer shifts in his chair uncomfortably. a.
LEONARD=>But you meant normal people. Sayer seems at a loss as to how to respond. The accompanying /til**) silence grows awkward. 7
SAYER=>We should be getting back. Sayer crosses over to the sideboard, to the pairs of glasses, stares at them for several moments, and picks up two pairs. 114. OMITTED 114 114A. EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - DAY 114A. Climbing out of his car, Kaufman sees Sayer striding toward him. He glances to the sky, Kaufman, to God, and silently complains to Him. 115. INT. STAFF CAFETERIA, BAINBRIDGE - LATER - DAY 115 Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen. Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished' meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and Kaufman at a table near the door.
KAUFMAN=>z^ When you say expensive, what are we talking about?
KAUFMAN=>That would be for how long?
SAYER=>About a month.
KAUFMAN=>A month? Sayer nods. Kaufman glances away. Stares blankly at faces at other tables. Back to Sayer.
KAUFMAN=>I can't go before the board with that. I could . . .
SAYER=>I was thinking of speaking to the patrons.
KAUFMAN=>The few patrons this hospital has give what they can.
SAYER=>Well, we'd have to convince them to give more than they*re accustomed to giving.
SAYER=>Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe.
KAUFMAN=>I think you overestimate the effect Mr. Lowe has on people. We're talking about money here. Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware of the silence around them. No one is talking. He glances up as Miss Costello walks by setting something on the table in front of him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word.
SAYER O.S.=>There was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature . . . only vague available motion in the neck . . . no voluntary movement in the limbs . . . A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen.
SAYER O.S.=>Perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking -- which we now know should not have been confused with apathy. * Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his face.
SAYER=>Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, "h .. . " In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. "Less scientific" it reads.
SAYER=>Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello. She nods, "Good, that's better."
SAYER=>The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.
SAYER=>This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something.
LEONARD=>Now?
SAYER'S VOICE=>Whenever you're ready.
LEONARD=>My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . . He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera.
LEONARD=>I'm back.
RAY=>They're volunteers from the : neighborhood.
SAYER=>Wonderful. v 119. 119. OMITTED 120. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY 120. Several empty medicine paper-cups. The "garden of stone," reassembled. Sayer knows better than to sit and wait, that nothing is going to immediately happen, but he sits and waits anyway. As does Miss Costello. As does Leonard and his mother.
VOICE=>Dr. Sayer? Sayer wakes to find a night nurse standing over him.
SAYER=>What is it?
NIGHT NURSE=>It's a miracle.
MIRIAM=>I've been sitting for 25 years, you missed your chance. Miriam and the nurse trailing after her pass in front of a man * with no English trying to explain something to a couple of orderlies. One to the other - . ORDERLY 1 You're Italian, he's Italian, what's the problem? ORDERLY 2 I was born here - X don't speak Italian. Nearby, another man. This one does speak English -
BERT=>I want a steak, rare. I want mashed potatoes and gravy, string beans, a slice of pie and a ' chocolate phosphate. Anthony turns away with the tray he just brought in - broth, jello and juice - and carries it away, passing the "card playing nurse," Margaret.
ANTHONY=>I think I prefer them the other way. Having settled on Margaret: she smiles, glances to "her" patient, Rose, who, staring at her reflection in a hand mirror, tugs at her grey hair.
ROSE=>And some dye. Black.
MARGARET=>Black, are you sure?
ROSE=>And some clothes . . . my. clothes.
ROSE=>Who put me in this?
MAG DA=>... t he garden er, he mus t prune the fruit trees ... the roses . . . I think he's forget . . .
NUR SE=>Miriam ... Miriam . . .
F RANCIS=>. . . I was aware of things, but no thi ng mea nt a nyt hin g, the re w as no connection to me. There was a war . . . ... or two . . .
MISS COSTELLO=>We'll find them for you. We'll track them down. Lucy again, Sayer still at her side.
LUCY=>. . . I called to my sister, but she couldn't hear me. No one could hear me. I was alone . . . And then I woke up. She smiles. Sayer tries to. He hesitates ... but finally can't help asking her -
SAYER=>Lucy, what year is it?
LUCY=>What year is it? You don't know? He shakes his head 'no.' She glances around the place, then leans close to him and whispers -
LUCY MIRIAM O.S.=>DoctorI Doctor! .
MIRIAM=>I walked all the way over there. And back. What a perfect day. The group at the doorway applauds, and it CARRIES OVER:
123A. OMITTED 123A.=>123B. INT- CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 123B. * The corridor, and the sound of a woman's voice, very faint, .* from somewhere unseen: *
PAULA O.S.=>" . . . Like crowds storming the * Bastille ... *
LOLLY=>Hi, Sidney. There's a kind of hush. Conversations, activities cease. Everyone is looking at Sidney. Not knowing what else to say, he manages a hesitant --
SIDNEY=>Hi. i He smiles and crosses toward her, but by the time he reaches her the smile has disappeared. Something troubling has occurred to him. He glances to Sayer and whispers --
SIDNEY=>Is it real . . . or . . . SAYER :
PAULA O.S.=>. . . the Mighty Mets stormed their locker room shortly after nine o'clock on their night to remember - He moves toward the voice, traces it to a crafts area, where a young woman is reading from the sports page to an older man tied to his wheelchair. Though it's doubtful the man is even aware of her presence, she reads to him as if her were, and in the process, draws Leonard into the sound of her words until there are no sounds but her words:
PAULA=>"Released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons, they raised the roof of Shea Stadium - while their fans attempted to dismantle it - in one of the loudest, wildest victory celebrations in baseball : history - " ._ The reverie is suddenly shattered, the real sounds of the hospital rising back up, as Sidney, wild with excitement, bangs through the far doors of the corridor. He sprints past the crafts area, past Leonard, runs the entire length of the corridor, and -
LOLLY=>Hi, Sidney. There's a kind of hush. Conversations, activities cease. Everyone is looking at Sidney. Not knowing what else to say, he manages a hesitant --
SIDNEY=>Hi.
SIDNEY=>Is it real ... or . . .
SAYER=>As real as real can be. Sidney lowers himself to his knees before Lolly and, weeping quietly, rests his head on her lap. She strokes his head.
ANTHONY=>Len - come on. Leonard steps into the elevator, the last one in.
MRS. LOWE=>Sidney's going.
LEONARD=>He's a patient, Mom.
A3 MRS. LOWE MRS. LOWE=>C -j He's not the same kind of patient.
LEONARD=>He's still a patient. You're not a patient.
MRS. LOWE=>I'm your mother. Inside the bus, Miriam, anxious to leave, leans over the driver to honk the horn. Leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and turns away.
MRS. LOWE=>Wait a minute. What on earth have you done to your hair? He's parted it, apparently, on the "wrong" side. She pulls a comb from her purse, recombs it "correctly," straightens his jacket lapels and steps back. '
MRS. LOWE=>There.
LEONARD=>There's your bus. . The public bus, behind her, coming down the street. As she hurries to the corner, Sayer climbs down off the hospital bus.
SAYER=>Ready?
LEONARD=>I've decided not to go. He waves to his mother. Sayer stares at him.
LEONARD=>I'm staying here.
SAYER=>Why? What's wrong?
LEONARD=>Nothing. Wave. He waves again to his mother; she's boarding the public bus. Sayer does as he's told, waves too. Impatient, Miriam honks the horn again.
MIRIAM=>' Let's go, already.
LEONARD=>I'll see you later, have a good time. He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer staring after him. Miriam honks the horn again, and he climbs aboard. The doors hiss shut and driver turns to him.
BUS DRIVER=>Where to? Sayer suddenly realizes he has no idea "where to." He glances over his shoulder at the expectant faces of the patients, all dressed up with nowhere to go. It's up to him . . . His face brightens; he's thought of a good place.
MISS COSTELLO=>Dr. Sayer?
MISS COSTELLO=>It's very hard to keep everyone together, doctor.
SAYER=>Has someone wandered off?
MISS COSTELLO=>You.
PAULA O.S.=>"From the sleek skyscrapers of Wall Street where a tickertape blizzard filled the sky . . . From the doorway, from a distance, Leonard watches Paula across the room with her father, reading to him again from the newspaper:

PAULA=>I don't know if he knows I visit him or not. I don't know that he knows who I am. My mother doesn't think so. She doesn't; come around any more--

PAULA=>Does that make any sense? A slow nod from him . . . *

ANTHONY=>Why?
MISS COSTELLO=>They are. Sayer, taken aback, glances back to Anthony, whose look says, There you go.
SAYER=>I ' d thought about the opera house. Do you think they'd prefer that?

LEONARD=>Bye.
PAULA=>Thanks for talking to me. She steps away toward the door.

MISS COSTELLO=>Not that I know of. I kind of doubt it. Rose gets up and crosses toward Sayer. Seeing her coming, he smiles ... but the smile slowly begins to fade as she sings to him:
ROSE=>You made me love you I didn't want to do it I didn't want to do it . . . Singing as she does it, she pulls him out of his chair. Embarrassed, he resists, but she finally gets on the dance floor. Never more mortified in his life he "dances . . . " And the band finishes the song. '
