DIDN'T YOU?=>Ariel: Nothing - happened. . . . Triton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this? You could've been seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans! Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians! Triton: They're dangerous. Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by some fish-eater's hook? Ariel: I'm sixteen years old - I'm not a child anymore - Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady. As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules! Ariel: But if you would just listen - Triton: Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the surface again. Is that clear? Sebastian: Hm! Teenagers. . . . They think they know everything. You give them an inch, they swim all over you. Triton: Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her? Sebastian: Definitely not. Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss. None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense. No, sir - I'd keep her under tight control. Triton: You're absolutely right, Sebastian. Sebastian: Of course. Triton: Ariel needs constant supervision. Sebastian: Constant. Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble. Sebastian: All the time - Triton: And YOU are just the crab to do it.
