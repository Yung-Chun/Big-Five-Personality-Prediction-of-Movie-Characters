HERBERT=>No. Not my boy!
SNATCHER=>Wake his lordship.
SNATCHER=>The unspeakable has happened. We must speak of it immediately!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What is it, Snatcher?
SNATCHER=>Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>No.
SNATCHER=>They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>A horrible tragedy. Let's deal with it in the morning!
SNATCHER=>STOP!
SNATCHER=>Oh, oof! That's not the worst of it! Next they'll come after...
SNATCHER=>...OUR CHEESES!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>My Gouda!?
SNATCHER=>They'll stop at nothing.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes.
SNATCHER=>Oh, I don't want money.
SNATCHER=>I want one of those.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>A White Hat? You?! Absurd!
SNATCHER=>Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your...
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Very well. Every boxtroll gone. With proof!
SNATCHER=>For a white hat?
SNATCHER=>I will destroy every last boxtroll in this town!
SNATCHER=>Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, the curfew is in force. Don't dawdle or the beasts will tear you limb from limb!
SNATCHER=>They will add your flesh to their rivers of blood and mountains of bones.
SNATCHER=>Child! Do you want to end up like the Trubshaw Baby?
SNATCHER=>Dragged underground and feasted upon one year ago this very night?!
SNATCHER=>Lock your windows! Bolt your doors! Hide anything that is not bolted down.
SNATCHER=>Hide your cheese. Hide your tender and delicious babies!
SNATCHER=>Beware the bloodthirsty monsters! They'll fry your eyes, gnaw on your knees, gobble your gizzards... Beware! BEWARE!
FISH=>Hmm...
FISH=>Oh yeah...
SHOE=>Huh?
SHOE=>Gimme that!
FISH=>Ohhhh...
SNATCHER=>GENTLEMEN!
SNATCHER=>Look at all these boxes left lying about. How curious, how peculiar. I do believe... evil is afoot.
MR. GRISTLE=>HAHAHA. FOOT.
MR. PICKLES=>Huh.
MR. PICKLES=>You ever seen someone's foot be evil, Mr. Trout?
MR. TROUT=>I believe the boss meant evil is nearby, Mr. Pickles.
MR. PICKLES=>My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. I wouldn't say the foot itself was evil.
MR. TROUT=>No, it's just a fancy-man's word for vicinity.
MR. PICKLES=>Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my grandmum. Had to saw her off. The bunion, not my grandmum.
MR. GRISTLE=>Ah, yes. FOOT!
MR. TROUT=>There's one!
MR. PICKLES=>Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your days of evil-doin' are over.
MR. GRISTLE=>BOOM!
MR. TROUT=>You really think these boxtrolls understand the duality of good and evil?
MR. PICKLES=>They must, right? Why else would they hide from us. We are the good guys.
MR. GRISTLE=>Nice! NICE!
MR. TROUT=>Yeah... I suppose we are.
SNATCHER=>MR. GRISTLE!
MR. GRISTLE=>Hmm?
SNATCHER=>ACQUIRE THEM!
MR. GRISTLE=>Acquire! ACQUIRE! HAHAHA!
MR. GRISTLE=>COME BACK AND LET ME HIT YOU!
FISH=>"Eggs?"
FISH=>"Eggs?"
FISH=>"You see Eggs?"
FISH=>"Eggs?"
SPARKY AND BUCKET=>"Over there!"
KNICKERS=>AHHH!!!!
FISH=>"Eggs?"
FRAGILE=>Eggs.
FISH=>"Eggs?!"
FISH=>"EGGS?"
OIL CAN=>"He's up there!"
FISH=>Eggs?
EGGS=>Fish!
EGGS=>Fish?
EGGS=>Do do doo do doo...
EGGS=>Wake up!
EGGS=>OOOH! Hee hee hee.
OIL CAN=>AAAAHHH!
FISH=>BOXTROLLS NEVER TAKE OFF THEIR BOXES!
EGGS=>Ha! Missed me!
SHOE=>Ahh!
FISH=>Oooo!
EGGS=>Oooh!
MR. GRISTLE=>HA HAAA!
MR. PICKLES=>Another villain off the streets!
EGGS=>Wheels!
EGGS=>What?!
FISH=>Hide.
EGGS=>This way.
EGGS=>Shoe! Come on.
WINNIE=>Boxtrolls! They could come eat my face off at any moment. I'd better warn father.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Settle down, men, settle down. Important town business to discuss. First on the docket: more complaints of crumbling bridges.
LANGSDALE=>Speaking of crumbling... is that a new blue cheese I see?
BRODERICK=>Does smell delicious.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>I suppose we could do with a nibble first.
BRODERICK=>Mmm... Pungent...
LANGSDALE=>Complex...
BRODERICK=>I'm tasting notes of... plum!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>(mouth full, reading
DOCKET)=>All good fun, but we do have this school funding initiative to vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of--
BRODERICK=>--Cutting open the Roquefort next?
ALL=>AYE!!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Well, okay, okay. A quick reminder, tomorrow is Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day. And we all know what that means... a performance by Madame Frou Frou.
BOULANGER=>A VISION!
BRODERICK=>Now there's a woman...
LANGSDALE=>... With some cheese on her bones!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>A lady like that is like a fine brie. Raw. Dangerous. Maybe a little stinky, but one taste and you'll be begging for... mmm . . .
WINNIE=>Father!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>WINIFRED!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Winifred go on. Off to bed. Off to bed! Come on, come on.
WINNIE=>But Father! I saw boxtrolls again!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Shoo. Shoo. Shoo.
WINNIE=>They're right outside. They could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment!
WHITE HATS=>Would be a shame to miss this, Portley-Rind!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Yes, yes one moment! Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over grotesque monsters.
WINNIE=>I'm not obsessed! I just can't stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Father? Father.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Mmm hmm. Yes.
WINNIE=>If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me?
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred.
WINNIE=>Father!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What? Uh... White Hat? Right. What.. Oh, seems to have been smudged by a bit of brie. Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash, would you?
WINNIE=>BUT--
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Now gentlemen, I apologize... sorry! Back to important White Hat business... Pass the Camembert!
WINNIE=>I'll give your hat a wash all right.
WINNIE=>Ha!
WINNIE=>Uh oh.
WINNIE=>Who... who's there?
WINNIE=>Who are you, boy?
EGGS=>Boy?
EGGS=>Why would she call me that?
MR. PICKLES=>They're right there, Mr. Trout!
MR. GRISTLE=>We're right behind you. HA hahaha!
SNATCHER=>Hmm. Someone's out past curfew. Very dangerous.
WINNIE=>I... I saw a boy.
SNATCHER=>All I saw was filthy boxtroll monsters.
SNATCHER=>Miss Portley-Rind. Allow me to escort you home.
WINNIE=>I can escort myself, thank you.
WINNIE=>If you'll just give me my father's hat back.
SNATCHER=>Yes, how did this hat find itself aaaaall the way out here?
WINNIE=>The... wind! Blew it, right out the window. Very windy tonight!
SNATCHER=>Hmmm. Must've died down. Suddenly!
WINNIE=>There's no need to go inside.
SNATCHER=>Oh, but as a gentleman, I insist.
SNATCHER=>Lord Portley-Rind!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Did you hear something?
WINNIE=>Can I have the hat back now?
WINNIE=>Please.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What in Gouda's name is going on? Archibald Snatcher?
SNATCHER=>Deepest apologies, your Lordship. But I found something out in the street that belongs to you.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>My White Hat!
WINNIE=>Huh?
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>I'll take that... Now, now, Snatcher one doesn't acquire a white hat by simply-- --picking it up... off the street.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>A white hat indicates privilege, prestige, position! It must be earned.
LANGSDALE=>With Valor!
BOULANGER=>Chivalry!
BRODERICK=>Or being rich! That's how I got it.
SNATCHER=>Oh, don't I know it, sirs.
SNATCHER=>Fortunately, we still have our little... agreeeeement.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Um.. ehhh...
SNATCHER=>When I destroy every last boxtroll in this town, I shall earn my white hat... and join you in the Tasting Room.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Good lord. Not sure who should be more terrified - the boxtrolls or us.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Now, how the devil did my hat get outside in the first place?
SNATCHER=>I was told the wind had something to do with it.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>The wind, eh?
WINNIE=>Father, I'm sorry--
SNATCHER=>Sorry! Can't stay. Too much work to do. Miss Portley-Rind, your Lordship, Sirs. I bid you good night. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again very, very soon.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Hmmmm.. Winnie...
SNATCHER=>Don't forget. I'm a size six-and-a- half. Order ahead.
SNATCHER=>Ugh!
WINNIE=>Father, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to. Well, at first I did, but I think this situation offers a great opportunity for a father and daughter to discuss their feelings--
WINNIE=>--WAIT! I saw something out there. A boy with boxtrolls--
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Not another word.
WINNIE=>But Father I really-
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Bed!
WINNIE=>I did see a boy...
MR. PICKLES=>Hark! Here come The Exterminators!
MR. GRISTLE=>Exterminate! HA ha ha ha!
MR. TROUT=>But don't that sound like we're the villains?
MR. PICKLES=>Huh.
EGGS=>RUN!
MR. PICKLES=>Hark! Here come The Exterminators... OF JUSTICE!
MR. GRISTLE=>WE EXTERMINATE JUSTICE!
MR. GRISTLE=>Faster!
EGGS=>Grab hold!
MR. GRISTLE=>HA HA HA!
MR. PICKLES=>Over there Mr. Trout!
EGGS=>This way!
MR. GRISTLE=>My turn! HA HA!
FISH=>Egg!
FISH=>Eggs! Eggs!
EGGS=>No!
FISH=>EGGGGS!
SHOE=>Bugs for dinner?
EGGS=>Why do we do this, Shoe...
EGGS=>Carry on like everything is normal? They drag us away and we do nothing...
EGGS=>I look like one of them. Sort of.
EGGS=>I'll find you, Fish!
EGGS=>Wow...
EGGS=>Ahh!
EGGS=>AHHHH!!!
PHOTOGRAPHER=>Get yer picture taken with the Trubshaw Baby! A humorous keepsake for this dark and dreadful day!
EGGS=>AHHHH!! Eek.

WINNIE=>I saw a boy with boxtrolls last night! Maybe your audience would like to hear-- OOF!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Stick to ze script, my darlink!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Ten years ago a plot was hatched Where evil was with cunning matched Whoever left their doors unlatched Would find their infant children
SNATCHED=>BY BOXTROLLS
EGGS=>What?!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Oo no Boxtrolls
MADAME FROU FROU=>Trubshaw Senior loved his kid The same as regular father's did If you don't want to share his
PLIGHT=>Make sure that you are locked up
TIGHT=>FROM BOXTROLLS
MADAME FROU FROU=>For this night Baby's Dad Trubshaw Quite forgot to lock his door And as soon as he began to snore The Boxtrolls came in to withdraw
POOR BABY=>Those vile Boxtrolls
MADAME FROU FROU=>So lock your windows, bolt your
DOORS=>Or Boxtrolls with their creepy
CLAWS=>Will take your children in their
PAWS=>And drag them down to feed their
JAWS=>BOXTROLLS
GRISTLE=>RAWR!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Mister Trubshaw went quite wild When he found out he'd lost his
CHILD=>He did what any Dad would do He ran off swiftly to pursue those BOXTROLLS
CROWD=>No! / Behind you!/ Look out man! He's behind you!
MADAME FROU FROU=>"Help, help, help me please won't you?" But the Boxtrolls did what
BOXTROLLS DO=>They snatched him up and began to
CHEW=>Until there was no residue Of Trubshaw.
MADAME FROU FROU=>They pulled him down into their
NEST=>Hardly pausing to digest They left his bones but ate the
REST=>Never be a dinner guest
OF BOXTROLLS=>Oo those Boxtrolls
CROWD=>Booooo!
EGGS=>But she's lying.
MADAME FROU FROU=>And that's the story of the
TRUBSHAW KID=>Don't do what Father Trubshaw did If you see Boxtrolls don't placate
THEM=>Catch 'em and exterminate them BOXTROLLS
MADAME FROU FROU=>Kill those Boxtrolls!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Kill those Boxtrolls!
CROWD=>Kill those boxtrolls!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND/WHITE HATS=>Don't forget about our party tonight, Frou Frou!
WINNIE=>What do you want!
WINNIE=>You're the worst pickpocket I have ever seen.
WINNIE=>Here, buy yourself a book on how to be a better thief.
EGGS=>Wait! I saw you last night.
EGGS=>And they took Fish, and... I don't know where they took him...
EGGS=>Ah!
WINNIE=>You were with the boxtrolls last night?
EGGS=>Yes.
WINNIE=>Whoah! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!
WINNIE=>Father didn't believe me but I KNEW IT! How did you escape?!
EGGS=>We went underground and they--
WINNIE=>Did they drag you down to their hideous caves?
EGGS=>Huh?
WINNIE=>Were there mountains of baby bones and rivers of blood?
EGGS=>What?
WINNIE=>Did they eat your family?
EGGS=>MY FAMILY-
WINNIE=>Did they let you watch?! I mean, make you watch?!
WINNIE=>TELL ME EVERYTHING!
WINNIE=>You bit me.
EGGS=>I need to find the Men in Red Hats!
WINNIE=>You bit me with your mouth.
EGGS=>The Men in Red Hats!
WINNIE=>The boxtroll exterminators? They live down on Curd's Way.
EGGS=>How do I get there?
WINNIE=>Curds Way? Milk turns into it.
EGGS=>It's not true, you know. We don't eat babies!
WINNIE=>We? What do you mean we?
WINNIE=>Come back here! TELL ME EVERYTHING!
MR. GRISTLE=>POKE.
MR. PICKLES=>You ever wonder what they're thinkin' `bout, Mr. Trout?
MR. TROUT=>I imagine they're evaluating their life choices.
MR. PICKLES=>Ah. Wonderin' why they chose to be evil, disgusting monsters instead of good guys like us!
SNATCHER=>Wrong, Mr. Pickles!
SNATCHER=>A boxtroll cannot CHOOSE a new life because a boxtroll does not ASPIRE to be anything more than a weak, lowly pest. But a man -- a great man! And his...
MR. TROUT=>Colleagues?
MR. PICKLES=>Best chums?
SNATCHER=>... stooges ... can choose to change their lives. Our dreams are in our grasp!
SNATCHER=>Let us be dream-graspers, fate- snatchers, destiny-takers! Let us grasp our dreams and shove them down everyone's throat! Am I not right?
MR. GRISTLE=>THROAT!
SNATCHER=>YES!
MR. PICKLES=>That's why your name is the boss, boss!
MR. TROUT=>I'mnotastooge, am I?
SNATCHER=>Now, gentlemen. What better way to dream than to walk in the shoes of those to whom we aspire? Mr. Pickles, fetch the--
MR. PICKLES=>Shoes?
MR. TROUT=>Clogs?
MR. GRISTLE=>BAT!
SNATCHER=>Cheese.
MR. TROUT=>Oh no.
MR. PICKLES=>Oh dear.
MR. GRISTLE=>Nice! Heh heh heh heh heh...
SNATCHER=>Men, don your white hats.
MR. PICKLES=>Are you sure about this, boss? You know what cheese can do to you...
SNATCHER=>(tucking a napkin into his
COLLAR)=>Unless you are referring to how cheese brings men of respect and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what... "Cheese. Does. To. Me."
MR. PICKLES=>That's what I meant then.
SNATCHER=>Marvelous! Then let us begin.
SNATCHER=>ENOUGH!
SNATCHER=>Mmmm!
SNATCHER=>I say, old chaps, it's quite, um... QUITE--
MR. TROUT=>--Aromatic? Oaky? With an undertone of a mother's smile on a warm spring day? Hmm...
SNATCHER=>Yes! Those things! Etcetera etcetera, big words, chummy banter...
MR. PICKLES=>Someone's got the cheese fits again.
MR. TROUT=>Ohhh... Quickly, quietly, get the leeches.
MR. GRISTLE=>QUIETLY!
SNATCHER=>Where is he going? Is he getting more cheese?
MR. GRISTLE=>Quietly!
SNATCHER=>What?
MR. PICKLES=>I think you've had enough for today, boss.
SNATCHER=>Isn't this nice? Chewing the cheddar with the big cheessses. Holding my own-- --With sssophissstication and sssavoir faire!
MR. PICKLES=>Yup. Nothing terrifying about that.
MR. TROUT=>Uh huh huh...
SNATCHER=>Thisss is where I belong!
MR. TROUT=>Spot on, as always, sir.
MR. PICKLES=>You're not wrong, boss.
SNATCHER=>Well not here! In this rotten factory!
SNATCHER=>I belong up there!
MR. TROUT=>I'm agreeing so I don't upset you.
MR. PICKLES=>Very clever.
SNATCHER=>In the tasting room, supping on the choicest cheeses... Everyone in town bowing down to me, like a gentleman, a lord with a white hat!
EGGS=>Fish!
MR. PICKLES=>You've never been wrong, boss.
SNATCHER=>It's a time-honored tradition.
SNATCHER=>Aaaarrgh!
MR. TROUT=>Now, now boss... Don't get yourself all worked up.
MR. PICKLES=>Use your breathing.
SNATCHER=>Stand back peasants! You don't touch your King!
SNATCHER=>King Archibald Snatcher. Yes, I shall be king too, why not?
MR. TROUT=>Stay with us, boss.
MR. PICKLES=>Tell us more about when you'll be king.
SNATCHER=>HE won't let me! That pompous Portley-Rind and his gaggle of giggling sycophants.
MR. PICKLES=>Now, now Boss, you be careful up there.
SNATCHER=>Father always said if you worked hard, you'd get a white hat! And what did he ever get! NOTHING!
EGGS=>Fish.
FISH=>Ahhh!
MR. TROUT=>Hurry Mr. Gristle, were losing him.
SNATCHER=>I've worked my hump off for this town!
MR. PICKLES=>And it's growing back.
SNATCHER=>Wading through wet garbage in the middle of the night, crawling after monsters! What has Portley-Rind ever done. Eat some cheese, run the government, NOTHING!
SNATCHER=>What has Portley-Rind ever done. Eat some cheese, run the government, NOTHING!
FISH=>Eggggs!
EGGS=>SHH!
MR. PICKLES=>Come on down from there, boss.
MR. TROUT=>Just put one giant blob-shaped foot in front of the other.
EGGS=>Let's go... Come on, come on!
SNATCHER=>I'll rip that hat off of Portley- Rind's head... WHOA HOAH!
MR. PICKLES=>Boss, boss!
MR. TROUT=>Boss!
SNATCHER=>I'm alright. Just give me a hand.
MR. PICKLES=>Ugh. Mother of sausages!
MR. TROUT=>Holy meat glove!
MR. TROUT=>Upsy daisy now, boss. Let's get you a nice cuppa tea--
MR. PICKLES=>AAAH! Mister Snatcher!
MR. PICKLES/PORTLEY-RIND=>Huh? ... What is it, Mr. Snatcher?
SNATCHER=>You.
MR. PICKLES/LPR=>Me?
SNATCHER=>GIVE ME THAT HAT!
SNATCHER=>I'll make those brie stuffed pigs bow down to me! I'm going to be somebody!
MR. PICKLES=>AHH! I got him! Do it!
MR. TROUT=>MR. GRISTLE NOW!
MR. PICKLES=>NOW! NOW! NOW!!
MR. GRISTLE=>LEECHES!
SNATCHER=>AHHHHH! UGH. OOF. GAHHH!
EGGS=>Eww! You have got to help me, Fish!
FISH=>Okay.
EGGS=>Uggggh.
SNATCHER=>Oh, hello. Where were we?
MR. TROUT=>We was about to... uhh...
MR. GRISTLE=>Leeches.
MR. TROUT=>... Put that new boxtroll to work. Ain't that right, Mr. Pickles?
MR. PICKLES=>That is correct.
SNATCHER=>Ah yes... right. Open the workshop Mr. Trout!
SNATCHER=>Huh? Where is the beast?
FISH=>Huh?
EGGS=>But.. you're all alive!?
OIL CAN=>Eggs?
BOXTROLL PRISONERS=>Eggs! Eggs! EGGS!
PRISONER=>Huh?
EGGS=>Huh?
PICKLES=>There he is...
SNATCHER=>It can't be. It's not possible. It's not right!
MR. PICKLES=>That's our boxtroll! Give `im back!
SNATCHER=>Don't stand there gawking. Get him!
MR. GRISTLE=>Chase time!
SNATCHER=>Mr. Trout!
FISH=>AHHHHHH!
SNATCHER=>TEN YEARS and NOW you show up?!
OIL CAN=>Eggggs!
EGGS=>What are you doing with them?
SNATCHER=>You'll find out soon enough!
MR. GRISTLE=>Up!
MR. GRISTLE=>I'M FLYING ON A CAGE!
MR. GRISTLE=>HA! RAH!
SNATCHER=>SHOOT MR. PICKLES! Shoot!
MR. PICKLES=>It'd be easier if he'd stop moving!
MR. PICKLES=>Stop moving!
MR. PICKLES=>Thank you.
EGGS=>Boxtrolls don't hurt anyone! Let them go!
SNATCHER=>Yes, well, I need them. They're my ticket to a white hat, Trubshaw Baby!
WINNIE=>TRUBSHAW BABY!?
MR. PICKLES=>Oops.
WINNIE=>I knew there was something strange about you!
SNATCHER=>Miss Portley-Rind! What a surprise!
SNATCHER=>Does your.. does your father know you're here?
WINNIE=>No of course not! But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive!
MR. TROUT=>Sorry, miss.
WINNIE=>What are you doing? Unhand me!
SNATCHER=>Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new victim, miss. And her name is YOU.
SNATCHER=>They're getting away Mr. Gristle!
WINNIE=>What have you dragged me into?
FISH=>Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
EGGS=>RUN!
MR. GRISTLE=>I'm swinging on a chain!
EGGS/WINNIE=>AHHH!
MR. GRISTLE=>Stuck on a manhole!
MR. TROUT=>Oww...
MR. PICKLES=>Don't make no sense. That's evil prevailing over good.
SNATCHER=>If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I've worked for!
MR. TROUT=>You mean, we worked for?
MR. PICKLES=>I think we're all saying the same thing here.
MR. TROUT=>I don't think we are.
SNATCHER=>Bah...
MR. PICKLES=>But, just in different ways.
WINNIE=>Ohh!
WINNIE=>STAY AWAY FROM ME! Someone, help!!! Wealthy girl in danger!
WINNIE=>If you're going to eat me just get it over with. I'm sure I'm delicious.
WINNIE=>Hmm?
EGGS=>It's not just us. All the others are alive too!
EGGS=>We saw them!
WINNIE=>What's going on?!
EGGS=>Oil Can, Wheels, all of them!
EGGS=>Yes!
CLOCKS=>Where are they?
EGGS=>I don't know, but The Redhats have them building something in their factory.
WINNIE=>I said what's going on? Why aren't they ripping out our eyeballs and eating our faces?
WINNIE=>And where are the rivers of blood and mountains of bones?! I WAS PROMISED MOUNTAINS OF BONES!
EGGS=>I TOLD you, we don't eat people!
WINNIE=>Why do you keep saying "we"? You're not one of them! You're a boy!
EGGS=>No I'm not, I'm a boxtroll! Eggs the boxtroll.
WINNIE=>Oh really? Then let's see you fit in your box.
EGGS=>I... I can't right now.
WINNIE=>Mm hmm.
EGGS (DEFENSIVELY}=>I'm long-boned.
WINNIE=>You don't talk like them!
EGGS=>I- I have a speech impediment!
WINNIE=>Your ears aren't pointy!
EGGS=>I slept on them funny!
WINNIE=>Oh for goodness sake. Give me your hand!
WINNIE=>I don't bite.
EGGS=>Hey!
WINNIE=>See? You're not like them.
WINNIE=>You're one of us. You're a boy, Eggs. Or should I call you the Trubshaw baby?
EGGS=>It's not true is it Fish? I'm a boxtroll like you, aren't I?
WINNIE=>See?! I was right! Now admit it, admit you stole him!
FISH=>Gurglegurglegurgle!
WINNIE=>Is he confessing?
EGGS=>He says I was... given to him.
WINNIE=>Ha, right again! I- ...wait, what?
EGGS=>I was given to you?
EGGS=>Who gave me to you?
FISH=>[GURGLE GURGLE]
WINNIE=>What's he saying?
EGGS=>Oh, sorry. He says a long time ago there was a kind man--
EGGS=>-- The one man in town who saw they weren't monsters...
EGGS=>... But builders... like him.
HERBERT=>I've tried adjusting the dongle and there doesn't seem to be any possible solut-- Oh look, you've solved it!
HERBERT=>Who's up for a jelly break?
HERBERT=>I tell you I could eat this stuff for the rest of my life.
HERBERT=>But one night...
SNATCHER=>Come on! I'm being reasonable. I can be unreasonable.
EGGS=>Snatcher wanted him to build something...
HERBERT=>I-- I'm an inventor, not a killer!
EGGS=>And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him...
SNATCHER=>Maybe if I hold on to your son...
HERBERT=>Not my boy!
HERBERT=>RUN! PROTECT MY--UGHH!
EGGS=>And then they...
WINNIE=>They what?
EGGS=>They killed him.
WINNIE=>I think that kind man was your father.
EGGS=>What's a father?
WINNIE=>Um... well... a father is the one who raises you... looks after you. Loves you.
EGGS=>Oh! Like Fish.
WINNIE=>Yes...
WINNIE=>... No. They're supposed to be like that man in the story. Someone who'll do anything to help you. They always listen and never get angry...
WINNIE=>They guide you when you don't know what to do. They're there when it's dark and you're scared or lonely, and they are never, ever too busy to talk to you...
EGGS=>You have a father!
EGGS=>We can tell him I'm the Trubshaw Baby... and the boxtrolls didn't eat me. And he'll stop Snatcher!
WINNIE=>Well, he doesn't really listen to children.
EGGS=>He's a father, isn't he?
WINNIE=>You don't know what he's like.
EGGS=>But he's the only father we have.
EGGS=>Please help us.
WINNIE=>If I agree to help, you have to do exactly as I say.
EGGS=>I promise!
WINNIE=>All right, first thing's first... off with the box.
BOXTROLLS=>AAAAAAAAh!
WINNIE=>Stop that!
WINNIE=>Alright, you petty thieves. Bring me your loot!
WINNIE=>Oh, thanks.
WINNIE=>No.
WINNIE=>This might work.
WINNIE=>No.
WINNIE=>Oh yes!
WINNIE=>No!
WINNIE=>Yes!
WINNIE=>You look like a proper boy.
EGGS=>Me... a proper boy.
WINNIE=>How do we get out of this place?
WINNIE=>AHHHHHHHH!
WINNIE=>Come on, Eggs.
WINNIE=>STOP!
WINNIE=>You don't scratch there in public! That's why they're called... ... privates.
EGGS=>Okay.
WINNIE=>For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands.
WINNIE=>What are you doing?! Put those down!
WINNIE=>Like this.
WINNIE=>The other one.
EGGS=>Oh, right.
WINNIE=>Then you say, "It's a pleasure to meet you."
EGGS=>"It's a pleasure to meet you."
WINNIE=>And you say that even if you're not pleased to meet them.
WINNIE=>Just stick close, okay?
LADY CYNTHIA=>Is that all that is left of the new Roquefort?
EGGS=>Which one is your father?
WINNIE=>Lord Portley-Rind. He's usually making speeches about cheese.
LADY CYNTHIA=>Oh, Winifred!
WINNIE=>Hello, mommy dear.
LADY CYNTHIA=>Oh. Who is this?
EGGS=>I'm Eggs?
WINNIE=>--Bert. Eggsbert. Is a normal name... that he has.
LADY CYNTHIA=>Eggsbert. How nice, I... umm, adore names from the bible.
EGGS=>Its a pleasure to meet you.
WINNIE=>No, no. You kiss a lady's hand.
LADY CYNTHIA=>Darling, it's time to take off that dress and... burn it.
WINNIE=>Don't move. I'll be right back.
EGGS=>But which ones are the ladies?!
LADY BRODERICK=>Oh!
SIR BRODERICK=>Ahem!
EGGS=>It's a pleasure to meet you.
SIR BRODERICK=>Very good.
EGGS=>Even if I don't mean it!
SIR BRODERICK=>What? Well, I never!
EGGS=>And, it's a pleasure to meet you.
LADY BRODERICK=>Nooo!
EGGS=>I was right!
EGGS=>It's a pleasure to meet you... it's a pleasure to meet you... it's a pleasure to meet youuuuu! Oooooh!
SIR LANGSDALE=>[GRUNT!]
SIR LANGSDALE=>Hmm? Well I could just...
EGGS=>Yum. Mmmthatsgood.
FEMALE ARISTOCRAT A=>Eww.
EGGS=>Huh? Oh!
BUTLER=>Ladies and Gentlemen... Lord Portley-Rind!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Distinguished members of the cheese guild. We were here to celebrate the successful fund-raising for a new children's hospital! But my fellow White Hats and I decided the money would be better spent on this. I present: THE BRIEHEMOTH!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Zere you are!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Come. Such a naughty boy! We have so much to discuss. Alone.
EGGS=>YOU'RE SNATC--
MADAME FROU FROU=>Come to snitch on old Snatcher did you?
SIR BRODERICK=>Hello, Frou Frou!
MADAME FROU FROU=>Nice to see you, too!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>You really think Portley-Rind will help a nobody like YOU? In this town, you want help, you've got to help yourself! That's what a man does!
EGGS=>You're a liar! When I tell Winnie's father the truth, he'll-- OOF!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>He'll THANK ME! Because all your little boxtroll friends are going to die - tonight.
EGGS=>What?!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>That will make me the most respected man in this town.
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>They'll have no choice but to give me a white hat.
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>They'll parade me into the tasting room on their shoulders!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>And I'm not going to let that be ruined by some little boxtroll sewer rat.
SIR LANGSDALE=>Yoo hoo, Madame Frou Frou... You promised your snookums a dance!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>I did? I did! Ha! But of course!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>Oooh! Vatch your hands, monsieur!
WINNIE=>There you are.
EGGS=>We have to get to your father!
WINNIE=>You can't just cut through.
WINNIE=>We'll dance!
EGGS=>We'll WHAT?
WINNIE=>Like this. One two three... one two three.
WINNIE=>Just make a box.
EGGS=>You made me get out of my box!
WINNIE=>With your feet, silly!
WINNIE=>That's it, Eggs. You're dancing!
EGGS=>Snatcher is here.
WINNIE=>Who? Where?
SIR BRODERICK=>My turn, Madame.
WINNIE=>Frou Frou?
EGGS=>Winnie!
EGGS=>I uh...
SIR BRODERICK=>Ah ha ha ha!
LADY CYNTHIA=>Ooh!
WINNIE=>Uh oh! EGGS LOOK OUT!
EGGS=>Ahhh!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What is going on here?
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>OWWW!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>NO NO NO NO NOOOO!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What have you done!?
EGGS=>Lord Winnie's Father...
EGGS=>People of the upper world -- Archibald Snatcher has lied to you all!
EGGS=>He told you that boxtrolls are monsters -- that they steal children -- but they don't. They would never hurt anyone. I know because...
EGGS=>Because... I am the Trubshaw Baby!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Do you know how expensive that cheese was?
EGGS=>What?!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>We might as well have built a children's hospital!
WINNIE=>Did you hear a word he said?!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Not now.
WINNIE=>BUT FATHER--
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Have you any idea how long it will take my men to fish it out of the river?!
LANGSDALE=>Ahh. What?
BOULANGER=>Eww... the river?
EGGS=>If you won't listen to me, ask Snatcher himself.
CROWD=>GASP!/ Oh my!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>You have me. I am not a true red head.
LADY CYNTHIA=>Poor woman.
SIR LANGSDALE=>For shame.
CROWD MEN=>How rude! / The lad's fuddled! / An outrage! / The very thought! I saw him bite a bug on a cracker!/ He must hate cheese! / He's a mad man! / I believe her's wearing a lamp shade as a sleeve!
CROWD LADIES=>Nasty boy! / Oh, he's awful! That's the one who crawled under my dress! / I knew he was up to no good the second he goosed me. / My husband is angry so I am too!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>You insult our guest of honor?
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Who are you?!
EGGS=>A proper boy.
WINNIE=>He is with me father.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>You know this... creature?
WINNIE=>He's my friend. What he said is TRUE--
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Enough!
WINNIE=>But...
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Winifred!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>I don't want to see you again, do you hear me?
EGGS=>But he's not a...
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Leave my house. Now!
SNATCHER=>Zees parties are so confusing. No?
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>There, there. You poor, poor dear.
WINNIE=>Eggs, wait!
EGGS=>You said fathers were supposed to help. That they took care of kids.
WINNIE=>Well, they're supposed to.
EGGS=>People are just mean and selfish. They're monsters.
WINNIE=>Not all of us. You aren't.
EGGS=>Well, I don't want to be a boy anymore.
EGGS=>It was a pleasure meeting you.
WINNIE=>Eggs...
EGGS=>And, Winnie, I really do mean it.
BOXTROLLS=>Eggs!
EGGS=>We have to leave the cavern.
EGGS=>We're not safe down here anymore. Come on...
SHOE=>Eggs?
EGGS=>I said, we have to leave now!
EGGS=>Snatcher is planning something! We have to get out of here.
EGGS=>Come on let's go. Now!
EGGS=>Get up! No! NO! (shaking Knickers out of
HIS BOX)=>Don't don't just hide! What are you doing?!
EGGS=>Fish, help me.
EGGS=>NO! I'm not a boxtroll!
EGGS=>I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean it. Please come out. Fish.
EGGS=>He's here.
BOXTROLLS=>AHHHHHHHH!!!!!
SNATCHER=>How's that for an entrance!
MR. PICKLES=>Dramatical!
MR. TROUT=>Don't you mean "dramatic"?
EGGS=>AHH!
EGGS=>Get up! That thing will kill you!
SNATCHER=>My, my, what a surprise. Don't look like your little friends wanna run, does it? How strange, how peculiar. No, wait, it's exactly as I expected!
EGGS=>You have to get up. Please!
SNATCHER=>NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW!
SNATCHER=>Time to earn my white hat!
EGGS=>No!
EGGS=>Fish! Shoe!
EGGS=>NO! Please!
SNATCHER=>Give up, Trubshaw! Boxtrolls lost looooong time ago. These miserable pests will never be a match for a man with dream! MR. GRISTLE!
FISH=>Eggs? Eggs?
SNATCHER=>ACQUIRE THEM!
MR. PICKLES=>Never seen one do that before!
MR. GRISTLE=>THAT BOXTROLL WAS MAD!
MR. PICKLES=>Goodness always triumphs over evil... right Mr. Trout? Mr. Trout?
MR. PICKLES=>I'm still sixty to seventy percent certain that's us. A couple of good guys vanquishing evil and all that.
PRISONER=>Jelly. Jelly!
EGGS=>What the...?
PRISONER=>When I'm good I get jelly. I like jelly. JELLY!
EGGS=>Who are you?
PRISONER=>Who am I? Who are you?
EGGS=>I don't know.
PRISONER=>Boy? Or Boxtroll?
PRISONER=>Dresses like a boxtroll, but, uh... looks like a boy. A boy-troll? Yes, or a box-boy? A new species. Never seen before.
SNATCHER=>(humming... then in normal
VOICE)=>Ohhh... nooo boxtrolls!
SNATCHER=>Trubshaw senior loved his kid, same as regular faaaaathers did....
EGGS=>He's my, you're my... are you my father?
HERBERT=>JELLY!
SNATCHER=>He was once. Won't get much out of him now, though. A decade hanging upside down scrambled his noodles good.
SNATCHER=>Still, did a fine job designing this beauty. Best inventor in town, your dad. Working with the best little builders.
EGGS=>No, no no, don't hide. Fish! Shoe! RUN! Get up, get up and run! Sparky. Sweets, run!
SNATCHER=>Yell all you want, boy. They ain't gonna run. You can't change nature.
SNATCHER=>I'm coming down, men! I want to pull the crushing lever myself! It's the little moments.
HERBERT=>Yes. I see it now! A mutation of nature. Self-imposed metamorphosis. Boxboy! You did it!
EGGS=>I don't understand.
HERBERT=>You changed your nature. Tell them.
EGGS=>I tried. They won't listen.
HERBERT=>You did it. You made you. Tell them. Tell them. Tell them!
HERBERT=>Boxboy! BOXBOY! My son.
EGGS=>Father?
HERBERT=>Son! They can change. They can do it! Tell them.
EGGS=>Fish, Fish, everyone! Listen! I'm a boxtroll and I stopped hiding, so you can too! Stand up for yourselves! We can fight back! Don't be afraid anymore. Sparky! Fragile! Get up! Get up and fight!
EGGS=>Just stand up and take a step. Please! Do it for me!
SNATCHER=>Well, good speech.
EGGS=>No! No! No! NOOOOOO! Fish, Shoe, Sparky...
HERBERT=>Look what you did. Look what you did!
EGGS=>Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They're crushed.
MR. TROUT=>Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded.
SNATCHER=>All but one.
SNATCHER=>Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, come out of your homes! The curfew has been lifted!
TOWNSFOLK BOY=>Whoah! What is it?
SNATCHER=>Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished! Your streets are SAFE!
MR. GRISTLE=>SAAAFE!
MR. TROUT=>Yeah...
SNATCHER=>Join me! Your purger of pests! Your white knight who has taken back the night!
SNATCHER=>Lord Portley-Riiiiind!
SNATCHER=>I come bearing the most delightful news.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this?
SNATCHER=>Show him lads.
SNATCHER=>Flattened to extinction. Every last, slimy one of them.
SNATCHER=>Your lordship, I said I would not rest until I caught every last boxtroll and I am a man of my word.
SNATCHER=>With this boxtroll, I will end their reign of terror.
WINNIE=>EGGS!
SNATCHER=>I'd say that deserves a white hat, don't you?
SHOPKEEPER WOMAN A=>A white hat for Mr. Snatcher!
MALE TOWNSFOLK=>Our hero! / Be-hatify the man!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Yes, well. I'm not sure... We'd have to take a vote...
CROWD=>WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>There's probably some, uh, paperwork... then have a hat shipped in...
SNATCHER=>No. Methinks a deed of this magnitude deserves something a bit more... significant.
SNATCHER=>I want YOUR hat.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>My hat?
CROWD=>WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
SHOPKEEPER WOMAN A=>WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
BOY=>WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
MR. GRISTLE=>CHANTING! CHANTING! CHANTING!
MALE TOWNSFOLK=>WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT! WHITE HAT!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>All right. All right. As soon as that boxtroll is dead, you may have... my... hat.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Yes. And then we can eat cheese together. In the Tasting Room.
MR. GRISTLE=>Haha, FOOT!
SNATCHER=>Do the honors.
MR. PICKLES=>I thought this was all gonna be a show, like with Frou Frou. I brought my mustache and everything.
MR. TROUT=>This really does stretch the limits of the term "hero", doesn't it?
MR. GRISTLE=>HAT!
SNATCHER=>Musician, drum-roll!
SNATCHER=>Mr. Trout! Lower the beast down.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Repeat after me: With this hat, I, state your name...
SNATCHER=>With this hat, I, Archibald Penelope Snatcher...
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>With profound esteem for dairy and dairy products... proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat.
SNATCHER=>(repeating after Portley-
SNATCHER=>Proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat.
WINNIE=>Father! Father!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Not now, Winifred!
WINNIE=>STOP! STOP!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>And henceforth, whereupon and thereupon... the placing of this hat... we shall conclude by... ushering our newest member into a world of privilege, pride, and pasteurized dairy!
MR. TROUT=>I can't, miss. Apologies.
MR. PICKLES=>We're just doing our jobs.
WINNIE=>Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?!
MR. PICKLES=>I knew that's how people saw us.
WINNIE=>You don't have to do this!
MR. TROUT=>She has a point, Mr. Pickles. This could be our chance for redemption.
MR. PICKLES=>A second chapter!
MR. TROUT=>People love a flawed hero!
WINNIE=>Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him go!
MR. TROUT=>Yeah? Yeah.
EGGS=>Huh?
MR. PICKLES=>Redeemed!
MR. TROUT=>Thank you, miss.
MR. GRISTLE=>Ha HA!
WINNIE=>STOP IT!
MR. TROUT=>Watch yourself.
MR. GRISTLE=>Ha Ha HAAAAA!
HERBERT=>Jelly! JELLY! Jelly!
MR. GRISTLE=>Hmm?
HERBERT=>I like Jelly!
HERBERT=>JELLY! Ha ha ha ha!
WINNIE=>FISH!
CROWD / MR. TROUT=>BOXTROLLS! / And they're NAKED! / AAAAAH! / NAKED TROLLS! / EWW! No wonder they wear boxes!
MR. GRISTLE=>OHH! EWW -- NAKED!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>What is going on here?!
SNATCHER=>I... I am befuddled as your lordship! I... I crushed them myself!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Evidently not! That was the closest you will ever come to a White Hat. (THEN, twirling his
MUSTACHE)=>I hope you enjoyed it.
FISH AND BOXTROLLS=>Eggs!
EGGS=>You're alive! You're all alive! But how?! I saw you crushed!
WINNIE=>AHEM?
EGGS=>Oh... sorry. He says they were hiding and then they heard me yelling at them...
EGGS=>... We can fight back! Don't be afraid anymore. Sparky! Fragile! Get up! Get up and fight. Stand up! Fight back. Please! Do it for me!
SNATCHER=>Wow, good speech.
HERBERT=>Boxboy! Look what you did!
EGGS=>You got out of your boxes! You did it!
WORKMAN A=>The boy is friends with a boxtroll?!
SHOPKEEPER LADY=>But boxtrolls are monsters.
WINNIE=>Boxtrolls aren't monsters. They never ate the Trubshaw Baby, he's right there with Fish and--
EGGS=>My father.
WINNIE=>Your father?
HERBERT=>Look what you did.
EGGS=>You were right. Thank you.
HERBERT=>Jelly.
SHOPKEEPER LADY=>Herbert Trubshaw?
MALE WORKMAN A=>The inventor?
SHOPKEEPER LADY=>Alive?
CROWD=>Oh get out of here. / Snatcher said he was killed. / How can that be? / How is this possible? / He lied to us?
SHOPKEEPER B=>Snatcher lied!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>He lied to us and to poor Madame Frou Frou!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Snatcher!
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER=>(taunting in Frou Frou's
VOICE)=>We could've been somezing special, but you've broken our agreement.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Why is he talking like Madame Frou - Oh my God! I regret so much.
SNATCHER=>I'll take my white hat now.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>AHHHH!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>RUN!
ARISTOCRAT MALE A=>The curfew's back on! IT'S BACK ONNN!
CROWD=>AHHHH!
EGGS=>No more hiding, right?
EGGS=>RIGHT?
EGGS=>You built that thing! You can take it apart!
EGGS AND BOXTROLLS=>ROAWRRR!
SNATCHER=>Loooord POORTLEY-RIIIIND! Come out, come out, come out!
SNATCHER=>Whoah whoa.
SWEETS=>Chmeey! @#$%&!

EGGS=>We need to put out the fire!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>AHH!
WINNIE=>Oh Mister Snatcher...
WINNIE=>... how did this hat get alllll the waaayyy out here?
SNATCHER=>You vile little brat!
WINNIE=>Ooh!
MR. TROUT=>Perhaps we can be of some assistance, miss.
MR. PICKLES=>So this is what all the fuss is about?
MR. PICKLES=>What do you think, Mr. Trout?
MR. PICKLES=>`Ere you have a go.
MR. TROUT=>I think white quite suits me.
WINNIE=>Over here!
SNATCHER=>You ungrateful stooges!
MR. PICKLES=>Is this what you wanted, boss?
SNATCHER=>Mine!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Mine!
HERBERT=>JELLY!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>It's not funny! No, no, no!
MR. GRISTLE=>Ohhhh...

SNATCHER=>AHHHHHHH!!!!
EGGS=>Fish, grab hold!
EGGS=>That's right! Pull it over there!
SNATCHER=>YOU FILTHY MONSTER!
EGGS=>AHHHH!
FISH=>Uh oh. IT DOESN'T REACH!
WINNIE=>IT DOESN'T REACH! PULL IT HARDER!
SNATCHER=>(with effort, strangling
EGGS)=>You think you can win and live happily ever after! They'll never accept the likes of us!
WINNIE=>ALL TOGETHER!
MR. TROUT=>Now!
MR. PICKLES=>Pull!
EGGS=>I'm nothing like you. You're the monster!
SNATCHER=>MONSTER?
SNATCHER=>Huh?
WHITE HATS=>WE'VE DONE IT!/ HUZZAH!/ THREE CHEERS FOR US!
SIR LANGSDALE=>We got the cheese. (they see the devastated
SQUARE)=>Lord... Portley-... Rind?
MR. GRISTLE=>UGH! I HAVE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

FISH=>Eggs? EGGS!
CROWD=>YEEEEAAAAYYY!
SNATCHER=>RAWR!!!

MR. PICKLES=>Eww!
MR. TROUT=>Not again.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Winnifred!
SNATCHER=>GIF. ME. MY. HAT.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Well... what about Broderick's hat? It's just as white and fluffy.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Oh take it.
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Just let go of my daughter.
SNATCHER YEAH! ARSHBALL SHNASHER, YOOFINE'LY=>DONE IT!
SNATCHER=>NOW TO THE TASHTING ROOM!
SNATCHER=>Men, don your White Hatsh...
EGGS=>Please, Snatcher, let her go. You don't have to do this--
SNATCHER=>ISH TASHTING TIME!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>I present the tastiest cheese known to man. Made from the milk of the male, lactating fruit bats in Borneo. Aged for centuries in SECRET--
SNATCHER=>Shut up! Enough shtalling.
SNATCHER=>Yesh... rich bouquet, cheesy cheese-like... OW!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>Oh, my Winnikens!
SNATCHER=>You bit me... wif yor... MOUTH?!
EGGS=>Don't do it. It won't change who you are.
EGGS=>Cheese, hats, boxes - they don't make you. You make you.
SNATCHER=>I have made me, boy.
SNATCHER=>This is my dessshhtiny.
SNATCHER=>Mmm, aromatic?... Oaky?... With an undertone of a mother's smile on a WARM SPRING--
BOOOOOM!!!=>He explodes.
WINNIE=>There I was, trapped in his sweaty armpit...
WINNIE=>...Until he swelled like a balloon and.. POP! --
WINNIE=>-- An ocean of guts exploded over us like a hurricane of YUCK!
LORD PORTLEY-RIND=>My little angel. My weird little angel.
EGGS=>Winnie!
WINNIE=>Huh?
EGGS=>Where's Fish?
WINNIE=>(sotto voce, quietly to
EGGS)=>Uhh.
WINNIE=>And now I will tell the heroic story of the Naked Boxtrolls and the Crusher of DOOOOOOM!
SIR LANGSDALE=>It hasn't worked right in years!
SIR LANGSDALE=>I said I like it burnt, then she says well I don't! So here I am.
EGGS=>You guys seen Fish?
EGGS=>Thanks!
SIR LANGSDALE=>Oh. I... I don't think that's a good idea.
EGGS=>Have you seen Fish?
SWEETS=>Mushurgle, mushmoogle, mushmushgurgle...
SWEETS=>Nope.
HERBERT=>Ahh, there he is.
FISH=>Eggs!
EGGS=>Look what I found!
HERBERT=>Brilliant, son!
EGGS=>And now we go like this.
HERBERT=>Ahh. I've missed so much.
MR. TROUT=>Aww, ain't that lovely?
MR. PICKLES=>Yeah... all happy `n tidy.
MR. TROUT=>Like the end of a story, if our lives were a story.
MR. PICKLES=>Not sure what we'd do next, though.
MR. PICKLES=>Hmm.
MR. TROUT=>Just keeping the streets clean...
MR. PICKLES=>Free from evil.
MR. TROUT=>Yep.
MR. PICKLES=>Ya ever think about the universe, Mr. Trout?
MR. PICKLES=>What if our world is just like a tiny speck...
MR. TROUT=>A tiny little speck!
MR. PICKLES=>And there are giants looking down on us?
MR. TROUT=>And every time we move...
MR. PICKLES=>It's actually them moving us.
MR. TROUT=>Seems a bit tedious.
MR. PICKLES=>Like that, just there, me blinking. That would've taken them a day.
MR. TROUT=>Me moving my arm. Five hundred men!
MR. PICKLES=>I mean, none of them are going home. They're having to do this bit. And now this bit. And this bit. I mean, this should stop.
MR. TROUT=>I think it throws up notions of free will.
MR. PICKLES=>It's too much. And then they'd have had to've done me talking about the blink. And it never ends. I think they make a meal of it, to be honest. I don't know how they get the time. They've got to have other jobs. It's more like a hobby. Y'know, like stamp collecting, something you do in your free time.
