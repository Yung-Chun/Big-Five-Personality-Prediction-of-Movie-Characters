WERECHICKEN=>The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
ZEKE=>Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
MAUDE=>Jes' set easy, Zeke. I'll take a look-see.
MAUDE=>Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
MAUDE=>What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
ZEKE=>Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
ZEKE=>What say?
ZEKE=>Get away!' Scat! Shoo!
ZEKE=>Help!... He-elp!
PETER=>Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute?
PETER=>It's Your night to take out the trash.
RAY=>And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
EGON=>Be with you in ... ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
PETER AND RAY=>
PETER=>Thanks, Slimer. I really needed that!
SLIMER=>Sorreee!
RAY=>Egon! The phone!
EGON=>In a minute, Ray.
WINSTON=>Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself. Ghostbusters Central.
WINSTON=>Calm down... Where are you?... We'll be right there.
WINSTON=>Ready for this one? Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
PETER=>Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. Let's roll!
EGON=>I think I've finally perfected it. Watch this, guys. Guys?
RAY=>It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
PETER=>Why? Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
WINSTON=>But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his? He'll be a rich man!
PETER=>Good. Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
ZEKE=>Had big blood-red eyes, it did. Biggest dang chicken I ever seen. Mebbe six feet tall.
WINSTON=>Shouldn't be hard to find.
RAY=>Did it have any distinguishing marks?
PETER=>Ray! It's six feet tall!
PETER=>Thank you, Sir. We'll put out a missing chicken report right away.
PETER=>This one's easy, guys. Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
RAY=>No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
WINSTON=>A werechicken?
PETER=>Get serious, Ray.
RAY=>Then explain those!
SLIMER=>Ow!
RAY=>What'd I tell you, Peter? A werechicken egg! Gimme a hand, Winston!
PETER=>Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
PETER=>...how come there's no PKE reading?
RAY=>I dunno... that is strange.
WINSTON=>Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests. Then maybe we'll have some answers.
RAY=>Oh no, I'm not leavin'. The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
PETER=>I'll take it. C'mon, Slimer.
PETER=>Werechickens.
PETER=>Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you: How about analyzing this?
EGON=>Interesting. That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
PETER=>I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
WINSTON=>Ray, it's gettin' pretty late. Maybe there really isn't any...
RAY=>Shh!
RAY=>It's in there.
WINSTON=>Then let's get it!
WINSTON=>Man, this place is creepy.
RAY=>It's in here -- I can feel it.
WINSTON=>Look out!
RAY=>Something's close. Very close.
RAY=>It is a werechicken!
WINSTON=>Man, he is ugly!
RAY=>Bad choice of words, Winston.
RAY=>Trap out!
WINSTON=>Hang on! That's it!
RAY=>We've almost got him!
RAY=>Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
RAY=>Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife.
WINSTON=>Ray, I just had a thought...
WINSTON=>What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife?
EGON=>Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight. I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
EGON=>But it'll be safe in here.
SLIMER=>Yeah.
SLIMER=>G'night, Egon.
EGON=>Goodnight, Slimer.
SLIMER=>Fooooood.
SLIMER=>Yummy!
PETER=>Slimer! How 'bout some privacy??
SLIMER=>Monster! Inna kitchen!
PETER=>Monster?
SLIMER=>Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
EGON=>Ow!
BABY WERECHICKEN=>
EGON=>What?
PETER=>Egon? Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster.
PETER=>Holy cow!!
ACT TWO=>INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT
PETER=>What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
RAY=>Peter! Wait!
PETER=>Hey!
PETER=>What's wrong with you guys? That thing ate Egon!
RAY=>Peter, that is Egon! The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!
PETER=>You're kidding! Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.
WINSTON=>What happened? He's so quiet all of a sudden.
RAY=>It's the moon!
RAY=>Tonight's the first --
RAY=>-- lunar eclipse in ten years!
PETER=>Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
RAY=>Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
RAY=>Egon?
EGON=>Ray, what is going on?
EGON=>And why am I naked?
SLIMER=>Egon!
PETER=>Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
EGON=>Bad news first.
WINSTON=>You've been turned into a werechicken!
EGON=>A werechicken?
RAY=>Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens! "The werechicken appears during the full moon. Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken." That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
EGON=>I remember the bite clearly. How long will I stay like this?
RAY=>According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
RAY=>"One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."
EGON=>I don't feel well.
PETER=>Take it easy, Egon. You're gonna be fine. Hurry it up, guys!
RAY=>"And one tablespoon of chickenbane."
SLIMER=>No chickenbane!
RAY=>Then we've gotta go with this! C'mon!
PETER=>Come on, Ray!!
PETER=>He's changing again!
RAY=>Quick, Egon, drink this!
EGON=>
WINSTON=>We're too late!
PETER=>What happened?
RAY=>The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
PETER=>Well, we hafta do something!
EGON=>Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
WINSTON=>What was that?
RAY=>The werechicken that bit Egon. It's still out there somewhere.
PETER=>Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else! Un, no offense, Egon.
PETER=>All quiet on the chicken front. How about down there?
RAY=>Not a peep.
WINSTON=>No pun intended.
WINSTON=>That's it!
BOX BOY=>It's in there! A big chicken! It's gotta be ten feet tall!
WINSTON=>Ten feet tall?
BOX BOY=>Maybe fifteen, I dunno. Big! I'm outta here!
RAY=>Let's split up.
WINSTON=>How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
RAY=>We didn't! Come on!
BUTCHER=>A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
WINSTON=>Thirty feet tall?
BUTCHER=>Yeah! Look what it did to those cars!
PETER=>It's how big? Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,...
PETER=>...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
SLIMER=>
PETER=>Ray, you were right! The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
RAY=>On our way, Peter.
JANINE=>Egon! What happened?
EGON=>It's a long story, Janine. Can you get my coat, please? I'm due at the weather board in forty-five... ...minutes.
JANINE=>But what ...? Nevermind.
JANINE=>Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
EGON=>Trust me. I'm of sound mind at least.
PETER=>It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
RAY=>Check! We're almost there.
PETER=>Take over, Slimer!
SLIMER=>Roger!
RAY=>Let's reel him in!
WINSTON=>Trap's full! Somebody forgot to empty it!
RAY=>Whose job was it?
RAY AND WINSTON=>EGON'S!
RAY=>It's gonna blow!
WINSTON=>Peter, get outa here!
PETER=>So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
RAY=>Peter, that's not a bed idea! Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
WINSTON=>Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?
EGON=>Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --
EGON=>... of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.
EGON=>There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or... ...snow.
EGON=>I, er, can explain this, but --
EGON=>What?
PETER=>Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
EGON=>Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
PETER=>Piece of cake.
WINSTON=>What's it doing?
RAY=>It looks like it's about to lay an --
WINSTON=>I don't want to hear it.
EGON=>Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
RAY AND WINSTON=>They did it! All-right!!
MAUDE=>Anyone for dessert?
EGON=>You bet, Maude.
PETER=>Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
EGON=>I'm actually starting to like it.
MAUDE=>No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon?
WINSTON=>Uh-oh.
RAY=>It came from the lab!
WINSTON=>It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
SLIMER=>I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good!
PETER=>Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
