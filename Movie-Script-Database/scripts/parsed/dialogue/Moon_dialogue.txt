SAM=>Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary.
SAM=>Today begins my 154th week on Selene. I officially have two weeks to go before I climb into that Return Vehicle...
SAM=>And blast home.
SAM=>I never dreamed I'd make it this far.
SAM=>There were times, as you know...
SAM=>...when I thought I was going to crack up.
SAM=>But I think I've come out the other side now.
SAM=>In many ways, this place is all about contradictions.
SAM=>It's bleak, it's beautiful.
SAM=>It's barren, yet filled with riches.
SAM=>The earth is thousands and thousands of miles away, but sometimes looks so close I feel like I could reach out and snatch it with my hand.
SAM=>I'm incredibly lonely, yet I'm never alone...
SAM=>Because I have you.
SAM=>And I have Eve. I don't take you guys for granted. You know that now.
SAM=>Please kiss Eve for me. And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer -- seventeen days longer, approximately. I love you both dearly. Bye.
SAM=>Morning, Gerty.
GERTY=>Morning, Sam. How are you today?
SAM=>Fine. Fine. You?
GERTY=>I'm very well. How's your headache?
SAM=>Much better, thanks, pal.
VOICE ON RADIO=>...it's a hot one on the East Coast, temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in New York City --
SAM=>8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. All Harvesters running smoothly this morning. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles; Mark 16.8 miles...
SAM=>Gerty, we've got a live one on Mark. I'm going out now to rope her in.
GERTY'S VOICE=>Okay, Sam.
SAM=>Sam Bell reporting to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam. How goes it? I've got a full container of Helium3 ready to roll. The purity is pretty good, so assuming your last market prices are still relevant I think you are looking at getting about 3 million dollars per kilo with this load. By the time this message reaches you it should be in transit. Otherwise, everything running smoothly. There was a discrepancy between a couple of the N3000 modulators a couple of days ago, but Gerty and I caught it in time, no big deal. Uh...how are things down there?
SAM=>Oh, and I just wanted to thank you for sending out the football feed. Almost felt live! Seriously, I don't mean to be an asshole, but surely replacing one satellite cant be that fucking hard! I haven't been able to have a conversation with my wife... My kid can talk now...! Fuck!
GERTY=>Sam, is everything okay?
SAM=>Everything's fine, Gerty.
SAM=>Why do you ask?
GERTY=>You don't seem like yourself today.
SAM=>It's Tess.
GERTY=>Has something happened?
SAM=>No, not exactly.
GERTY=>Sam, what is it?
SAM=>Something doesn't feel right, that's all.
GERTY=>Sam, it might help to talk about it.
SAM=>Tess isn't responding to things.
GERTY=>Tess isn't responding to things?
SAM=>Right.
GERTY=>What kind of things?
SAM=>A couple of weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when I get back, and that I was thinking of either Mexico or Hawaii.
SAM=>Tess never said anything about it. Three messages she's sent me since...and she's never once mentioned the vacation.
GERTY=>Im sure she can't wait, Sam.
SAM=>That's not the point. This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. I thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away -- with Eve, of course -- we'd take Eve.
GERTY=>Perhaps Tess didn't receive the message?
SAM=>But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that -- I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery -- nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing.
GERTY=>I think her brother did get the position at the University. His name is Christopher, correct?
SAM=>He did?
GERTY=>Yes, I seem to recall he got the position. Professor of Biochemistry, I think. At Syracuse University in New York?
SAM=>How do you know that?
GERTY=>You told me. Some time ago now. Towards the beginning of your time on Selene. When we were starting to get to know each other. You were very happy for your brother-in-law. You danced around the Rec Room, if I remember correctly.
SAM=>Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing lunar sat?
GERTY=>No Sam. From what I understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupiter mission active. I would imagine it would be very expensive to fix.
GERTY=>Sam, are you ok?
SAM=>They need to sort that out. Seriously. I've only got two weeks left. It's not fair on whoever's up here next. Gerty, you tell them to sort it out. It's not healthy.
GERTY=>I will Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
SAM=>Nah. Come on. Let's finish this.
SAM=>I've got another one of those headaches. Can you get me something for it?
GERTY=>Of course. Now?
SAM=>No not now, afterwards.
SAM=>Thanks, pal.
OVERMEYERS=>Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam.
THOMPSON=>According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days.
OVERMEYERS=>Now in response to your question about the communications equipment, the news is not good.
THOMPSON=>Sam, those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought --
OVERMEYERS=>Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation.
THOMPSON=>And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money --
OVERMEYERS=>Lunar doesn't have the budget it once did, Sam, you know that.
THOMPSON=>Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I don't know when --
OVERMEYERS=>We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee, Sam. Genesis 3. That's three buildings over.
THOMPSON=>We're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall. The good news is you'll be home by then, Sam.
OVERMEYERS=>You only have two weeks to go! Congrat--
GERTY'S VOICE=>Sam, a transmission has arrived from your wife.
SAM=>Be right there.
TESS=>Hi Sam. It's me. How are you? I got your last message, it was really great to hear your voice. I know you've been really lonely up there, but in a lot of ways it's been good for you, I think. I hope you don't mind me saying that. I'm proud of you. Hey, someone's got something to say.
TESS=>Eve, it's daddy. What did you want to say to him?
EVE=>Asstraut.
TESS=>Who's an astronaut? Go on!
EVE=>Daddy asstraut!
TESS=>That's right, daddy's an astronaut. Clever girl!
TESS=>She's shy. Uh, Cathy, could you...?
TESS=>It's her birthday next month. I thought we'd get her a play house for the garden. We could even pick it out together.
TESS=>God, I hate these things. Sam, I love you. I'm thinking of you always. I can't wait to see you, sweetheart. Okay. Bye.
SAM=>What's on the menu tonight, Gerty?
GERTY=>Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach.
SAM=>Ribs! Good choice, pal. Fine choice.
SAM=>Oh yeah! Compliments to the chef, Gerty, this is delicious!
SAM=>I'm going to feel that for a while, aren't I, Gerty? Damn it.
GERTY=>Sam, can I ask how it happened?
SAM=>I told you, I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling water on my hand.
GERTY=>You saw something on the TV?
SAM=>Yeah, something on the TV distracted me, Gerty, what's wrong with that?
GERTY=>Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on.
GERTY=>Perhaps you were imagining things?
SAM=>Morning, Gerty.
GERTY=>Morning, Sam. How are you today?
SAM=>Fine. Fine.
GERTY=>How's the hand?
SAM=>It's a little sore.
SAM=>8:19 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 2. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 9.8 Miles...
SAM=>Luke...7.3 miles...wow, better look into Luke...
SAM=>Mark, 11 miles on the button...
SAM=>Gerty, looks like we've got a live one out on Matthew. I wondered what was taking him so long, the old fart. I'm heading out in a few minutes, just going to finish my coffee.
GERTY'S VOICE=>Okay, Sam.
SAM=>Where am I?
GERTY=>Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.
GERTY=>Do you remember what happened?
SAM=>No. I don't remember a thing.
GERTY=>Do you remember me?
SAM=>Yes, of course I remember you, Gerty.
GERTY=>That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
SAM=>How long have I been out?
GERTY=>Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later.
SAM=>Gerty?
SAM=>Gerty?
GERTY=>These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know --
GERTY=>Sam, you're out of bed.
SAM=>I wanted to stretch my legs. What was that?
GERTY=>Not talking. No. We've been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down. I was recording a video message for Central updating them on your progress. Sam, you need to stay in bed. You're not ready to walk around yet.
GERTY=>Excellent, Sam.
SAM=>How much longer do I have to be in here, Gerty?
GERTY=>Sam, you suffered minor brain damage in the crash. This has resulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment.
SAM=>When can I get back to work?
GERTY=>Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back --
SAM=>Terrific.
GERTY=>The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow. But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
SAM=>Gerty, do you know about this?
SAM=>Matthew's got no velocity read- out. He's completely still.
GERTY=>He must have stalled.
SAM=>There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what... I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now....
SAM=>Just give me the word -- or Gerty the word, tell him to unlock the exit doors -- and I'll go out and get Matthew up and running again. That's it. Over and out.
THOMPSON=>Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better.
SAM=>Oh for Christ's sake...
OVERMEYERS=>We don't want you to take any unnecessary risks. You're too important to us.
THOMPSON=>You're to stay put, understand?
OVERMEYERS=>It's an order.
THOMPSON=>It's an order, Sam. From Lunar. Stay put.
OVERMEYERS=>We're going to send a Rescue Unit to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
SAM=>Why?
GERTY=>I'm sorry Sam.
GERTY=>Sam, I am under strict orders not to let you outside.
TESS=>He's kicking...or she's kicking. I'm certain he's a boy. I wish you could feel it. I think we made the right choice, Sam. I really do. We need some time apart. We got stuck. That happens in marriages sometimes. It's nothing terrible. Well listen, I love you lots -- and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye Sam.
SAM=>Fuck it.
SAM=>Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!
GERTY=>What happened?
SAM=>Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look.
GERTY=>There is no damage to the exterior shell.
SAM=>It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh?
GERTY=>Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside.
SAM=>Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok?
GERTY=>Okay, Sam.
SAM=>Gerty! Gerty! Help!
SAM=>Gerty!
SAM=>I found him outside by the stalled harvester. Who is he? What the fuck is going on?
SAM=>Gerty!
GERTY=>We need to get him to the Infirmary.
SAM=>Not until you tell me who he is!
GERTY=>Sam, we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately.
SAM=>Who is he! Who is he!
GERTY=>Hello Sam. How are you feeling?
GERTY=>The Infirmary. You had an accident out by one of the harvesters. Do you remember?
GERTY=>Who did you see, Sam?
GERTY=>You saw a girl out by the harvester? How is that possible?
GERTY=>Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries, but all in all the prognosis is good. I'm happy to see you again.
GERTY=>Yes, Sam?
GERTY=>Yes.
GERTY=>Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired.
GERTY=>Sam, you're out of bed.
GERTY=>Sam Bell.
GERTY=>You are Sam Bell.
GERTY=>Sam, what is it? It might help to talk about it.
GERTY=>We could run some tests. I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident.
GERTY=>I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you. Are you hungry?
GERTY'S VOICE=>Sam, a message has arrived from Central.
OVERMEYERS=>Greetings, Sam!
THOMPSON=>How's our Man? Feeling better?
OVERMEYERS=>You getting lots of rest?
THOMPSON=>Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd better be you bastard.
OVERMEYERS=>Enjoy it while it lasts! We've got good news.
THOMPSON=>The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few free pairs of hands --
OVERMEYERS=>We've managed to secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
THOMPSON=>Rescue Unit Eliza.
OVERMEYERS=>They've been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last couple of months.
THOMPSON=>Eliza's been in transit for the last day....we expect them to reach you in approximately 14 hours.
OVERMEYERS=>Commence to jump for joy!
THOMPSON=>You'll be back to work in no time.
OVERMEYERS=>Eliza is bringing you something special, Sam. Compliments of the company.
THOMPSON=>A hooker!
OVERMEYERS=>No not a hooker. What's wrong with you? It's a little something to drink, Sam, that's all, our way of patting you on the back for all that you've been through.
THOMPSON=>In the meantime, keep resting up, and hang in there.
OVERMEYERS=>Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over and out.
GERTY=>Yes, Sam.
GERTY=>Hello Sam.
GERTY=>Sam, is everything okay?
GERTY=>938 hours.
GERTY=>Approximately.
GERTY=>What is it about Sam that scares you?
GERTY=>I know.
GERTY=>You have changed, Sam.
GERTY=>Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
GERTY=>Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
GERTY=>Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
GERTY=>Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact--
GERTY=>They are memory implants, Sam. I'm very sorry.
GERTY=>Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal. Can I prepare you something?
SAM=>...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm not feeling too hot today -- I'm going to have to continue this later --
TECHNICIAN=>...relax and breathe deeply. The cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to Earth. As you begin to get sleepy, think about the magnificent job you've done, and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
GERTY=>Sam, can I help you with something?
GERTY=>Helping you is what I do.
GIRL=>Hello?
GIRL=>This is the Bell Residence.
GIRL=>I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
GIRL=>Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter. Can I help you?
EVE BELL=>Yes?
EVE BELL=>I'm fifteen. Do I know you?
EVE BELL=>Uh...
EVE BELL=>Dad!
SAM'S VOICE=>What!
EVE BELL=>Dad, there's someone asking about mom...
SAM'S VOICE=>Who's asking about mom?
EVE=>This is the Bell residence.
EVE=>I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
EVE=>Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her daughter. Can I help you?
GERTY=>Of course, Sam, how can I help?
GERTY=>I don't know of a hidden room.
GERTY=>The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones --
GERTY=>I understand the situation is unprecedented.
GERTY=>A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several hours.
GERTY=>I am not permitted to do that, Sam.
GERTY=>Yes.
GERTY=>That is the last thing I want.
TESS=>Come on!
GERTY=>The new clone will be conscious within one hour.
GERTY=>Sam? Where is Sam?
GERTY=>Sam, this is not going to work.
GERTY=>If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. As you know I record everything. If they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger.
GERTY=>I recommend erasing my memory banks. I can reboot myself once you have departed.
GERTY=>I'll require your assistance, Sam.
TESS=>Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!
GERTY=>Okay, Sam.
GERTY=>I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to be.
GERTY=>Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
GERTY=>Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.
GERTY=>Do you remember what happened?
TESS=>What took you so long?
