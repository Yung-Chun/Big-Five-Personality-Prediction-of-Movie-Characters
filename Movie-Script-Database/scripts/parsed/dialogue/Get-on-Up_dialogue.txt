SEMINAR PRESENTER=>Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition.
JAMES=>Where's everybody?
MAVIS=>Mr. Brown. You scared me!
JAMES=>Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'.
MAVIS=>It's Sunday, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>No, it's Tuesday, Mavis.
SEMINAR PRESENTER=>Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different.
SEMINAR PRESENTER=>You can't possibly sell the same monthly premium to just anyone who strolls through your door. If you learn one lesson this weekend, let it be this: We must accommodate the specific condition of the client. Bottom line! Their needs are-
JAMES=>OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there?
SEMINAR PRESENTER=>Excuse me?
JAMES=>I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it?
SEMINAR PRESENTER=>Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar.
JAMES=>I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was?
INSURANCE SALESMAN=>It is. It's fuckin' him.
JAMES=>Something funny?
INSURANCE SALESMAN=>No, sir.
JAMES=>Then why you cats laughing?
INSURANCE SALESMAN=>I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me.
INSURANCE SALESMAN=>I'm telling you that was James Brown.
SEMINAR PRESENTER=>Look, I suggest we just continue... OK. So. How does the program work? Initially, participating dentists undergo an extensive credentialing process which, if approved, allows customers to pay the minimum deductible allowed and the remainder is insured. But with non- participating dentists the cost per visit is much higher and comes completely out of pocket. So some people may want a high deductible because they have more to cover, but most common folks simply want the lowest possible plan... and remember our key takeaway!?
JAMES=>OK listen up people.
JAMES=>Being it's Sunday and all I'm gone ask each of you to imagine you're sittin' in church right now. While today's sermon may be good they's something else on your mind. You realize you gotta take a shit.
JAMES=>Real bad. And you don't want to shit at the church house, naw sir. So you just sit there and think about getting home to your own toilet in your own master bath on Beech Island, South Carolina. I gotta a bidet in my master bath. Love my bidet. And a big pretty oval tub too.
JAMES=>You got a bidet, Sir?
JAMES=>You?
JAMES=>Well you gotta get you one. You all gotta get you a bidet. Are y'all sure its really Sunday today?
JAMES=>What was just saying... Oh, that's right. Yes! You gotta take shit. So, after church, you speed back home and you run like hell to the house scared you ain't gonna make it. But you do. Now imagine unhitching your pants as your open your bathroom door. And then you see me. James Brown. Sittin' on your master toilet taking a break. What would you do?
JAMES=>Good God. Tear up the devil. I'm gone have to get that fixed.
JAMES=>Now I'm a busy man, and I'm guessin' you cats are too. But someone has abused a personal convenience. Now I ask you nicely. I'm gone ask you again. Which one of you gentlefolk hung a number two in my commode?
JAMES=>Was it you, Sir? Was it you?!
INSURANCE SALESMAN=>Don't shoot.
JAMES=>I ain't gone shoot nobody, son.
JAMES=>Ma'am, it was you wasn't it? You took a break in my bathroom, didn't you?
FEMALE SALESWOMAN=>Yes sir, Mister Brown.
JAMES=>Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay.
JAMES=>You had to use the toilet. You saw an opportunity and you took it. Yeah, I got mad but, Lady, you did right by yourself. I've spent my whole life doing right by myself. I'm James Brown and I made a difference.
JAMES=>You cats may not own my records but you can bet every record you have got a piece of me in `em. Ain't nobody singing today that ain't been touched by James Brown.
JAMES=>So, Lady, you did right by yourself. And there ain't no other way to live. You understand me?
JAMES=>You understand me?

BOBBY=>Big momma married you and you were in the pokey before.
MRS. BYRD=>Bobby Byrd!
GRANDPA BYRD=>If I'm going to be forced to have a jailbird in my house I at least like to know what I'm dealing with.
BOBBY=>Grandpa-
JAMES=>No. He got a right to ask. I am a jailbird. I've done wrong and I gotta own up to that.
JAMES=>I stole a man's three piece suit. You want to know me? I tell ya. My daddy is in the army. My momma left when I was five. I'm skinny but I'm strong. I can read a little bit and I like to sing. That's who's sittin' here.

JAMES=>It ain't right. It's too slow. We gotta pick up the pace fellas.
BOBBY=>What are you doing, James? These men been doing this for a long time. We need to listen to them.
JAMES=>I need to come in early..push it. Drive it. Early. Before the beat. Then speed it up, man.
RALPH=>James, this is a ballad. The pace we've set is perfect.
JAMES=>I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep.
BOBBY=>Let's just get it done OK?
JAMES=>But it ain't right.
SYD NATHAN=>What the hell is this Ralph?! Where's the rest of the song?
RALPH BASS=>Syd-
SYD NATHAN=>He just keeps hollering that one word over and over. "Please". "Please" what, Ralph?! Please jerk my dick? What the hell does he want? If he doesn't tell me, you're fired.
RALPH=>Listen, Mr. Nathan. This song-
SYD NATHAN=>I don't hear a song Ralph. A song has verses. A snappy chorus. It's not just some unfortunate nigger pleading. Who needs that? Give me the fucking song Ralph. The song.
RALPH=>It's not about the song.
SYD NATHAN=>What?
RALPH=>It's not the song.
JAMES=>Please! Please! Please.
CROWD=>James Brown, James Brown, James Brown.
JAMES=>Please! Please! Please!
RALPH=>James. I want you to meet somebody.
RALPH=>James, this is Ben Bart. Ben is President of Universal Attractions. New York's biggest booking agency.
BART=>That was a great show last week over in Jersey.
JAMES=>Well thank you Sir, we worked real hard to-
BART=>Not we James. Not the Famous Flames. You. James Brown.
RALPH=>What Bart is saying James is-
JAMES=>I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear.
JAMES=>I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born.
JAMES=>There's some things I'm gonna want.
BEN BART=>Come in Boys. Come in.
BEN BART=>Boys, I have something to show you.
BOBBY=>I don't understand. Is this some sort of mistake?
NAFLOYD=>His Famous Flames?
BABY ROY=>Sir, this ain't right.
BEN BART=>We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home.
NAFLOYD=>James?
JAMES=>Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good.
NAFLOYD=>James Brown. I never liked you. Come on. Let's get outta here..
BART=>So. Do you know what you want James?
YOUNG JAMES=>I know exactly what I want.
SYD NATHAN=>Forget it. King doesn't make live albums. They're too expensive.
JAMES=>I think a live album-
SYD NATHAN=>James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got.
BEN BART=>James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts "Blow it fucker!" in the middle of The Magic Flute.
JAMES=>But, Pop, you know my show.
JAMES=>Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show.
SYD=>Don't need to.
JAMES=>Mr. Nathan-
JAMES=>What are you doing?
SYD=>The "Mashed Potato".
JAMES=>That ain't the "Mashed Potato".
SYD=>Exactly.
SYD=>I can't do the "Mashed Potato". That's your job. That's the show. But what I can do is the business.
SYD NATHAN=>So I stick to what I know. You stick to what you know. And that's the showbusiness.
JAMES=>Book the Apollo. I'm gonna spend my own money on this. Syd Nathan's wrong.
BEN BART=>I'm not going to let you do that, Jimmy.
JAMES=>Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it.
BEN BART=>Forget it, Jimmy. It's too big of a risk. Let's order something to eat.
JAMES=>I don't understand risk?
JAMES=>I don't understand cos I'm just the "show"? Is that all I am to you, Pop? The show? The money?
BEN BART=>Of course not, Jimmy.
JAMES=>Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the "White Devil". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all.
BEN BART=>I'm not the "White Devil". I'm trying to protect you. I'm doing my job.
JAMES=>Pop, look me in the eye.
JAMES=>Pop.
JAMES=>Yeah, I'm the show. But, if I'm spendin' my own money on the show, then I'm gone be the business too.
JAMES=>And after we kill The Apollo, I'll kick over a few bucks to the white devil. Whatever I think he deserves. And If I'm payin' you, Pop, you gone show me how to do it.
BEN BART=>I'll call Nola Sound. They got these new three track stereo recorders from Ampex.
JAMES=>And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers.
BEN BART=>We'll need the band in New York immediately.
JAMES=>And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire.
BEN BART=>Sapphire Blue. Underwear too. How does that sound?
JAMES=>It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold.
JAMES=>C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.
GERTRUDE=>Evening, Mr. Brown. Cold out tonight.
JAMES=>Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line.
JAMES=>You ready Mr. Byrd?
BOBBY BYRD=>Ready Mr. Brown.
FATS V/O=>Are you ready for star time? Thank you and thank you very kindly-
SYD=>We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number!
BEN BART=>I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane.
JAMES=>Watch me.
JAMES=>You know I feel alright. You know I feel alright children. I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight.
FEMALE IN AUDIENCE=>Blow it fuckers!!!
JAMES=>Think...Think...Think...About your bad self...
JAMES=>Thank you. That's very kind of you.
BOBBY=>Gertrude. Get everybody out.
GERTRUDE=>What?
JAMES=>We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again.
BOBBY=>Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown. ...James.
BOBBY=>There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother.
JAMES=>Momma?
JAMES=>Momma it's me. It's me.
SOLDIER=>You know this little nigger?
SOLDIER=>Beat it.
YOUNG JAMES=>But Momma!
SOLDIER=>Get the fuck out of here.
AUNT HONEY=>Don't cry, Little Junior. Don't cry. Now, child, I want you to listen to me. You gone be okay. You hear me? Little Junior, you were born dead. Did you know that?
AUNT HONEY=>When your great Aunt pulled you into this world you were dead. You had gone cold. She slapped your ass hard too but you never drew a breath. Your momma and daddy had to say goodbye to you. But then your Great Aunt breathed in you one last time. And then you turned warm and then you screamed. So loud we heard it all the way here in Augusta. You're special, boy. Cause you got the spirit in you. And that spirit told me you gone be a rich man, Little Junior. And Everybody gone know your name. Ain't nothin' can touch you. You hear me? Nothin'.
92A 92A=>INT. TOUR BUS. DAY. 1964
MACEO=>Who's this?
BOBBY BENNET=>James gone wear that seat out.
MACEO=>Which seat. Her's or the bus?
YVONNE=>I'm Yvonne! I'm a singer. Let me worry about my seat.
BART=>Compliments of Universal Attractions.
JAMES=>This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur.
JAMES=>Gimme the keys. What they payin' you?
JAMES=>This here's a month's pay, help you get yourself another job. I gone drive myself.
JAMES=>Don't mention it. That's six a month goin' somewhere else.
JAMES=>Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you.
BART=>What's that Jimmy.
JAMES=>I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us.
BART=>Just standard Jimmy. Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales. Lets plan a-
JAMES=>-sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show.
BART=>Well let me explain the way it works. When you book a show. Take Chicago. Now our promoter in Chicago is-
BART=>Lenny J Frank. Lenny's the number one promoter in Chicago has been for twenty years.
JAMES=>I don't doubt it.
BART=>Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate, we can account. You know, number one, you're getting top rate and number two-
JAMES=>What if we took the gate? What if we took it ourself.
JAMES=>And still got the show promoted, but better.
BEN BART=>Better than Lenny Franks?
JAMES=>Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations.
BART=>Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because...
JAMES=>You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat.
JAMES=>The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say:
YOUNG RICHMOND DEEJAY=>Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much they pay me?
JAMES=>Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill.
YOUNG RICHMOND DEEJAY=>Screw Payola.
JAMES=>And at the end he gone say..
95A 95A=>ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE. VOICE-OVER OF DEEJAYS ANNOUNCING THE UPCOMING SHOWS OVER.. "MAKE SURE YOU CATCH JAMES AT THE ARENA IN RICHMOND THIS TUESDAY!!! " ETC.
JAMES=>Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone.
JAMES=>He know the guy in the barber shop knows the guy at the pool hall, the guy at the garage.
JAMES=>That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate.
JAMES=>And the best part is, you can put it all through the books. Item. Promoter. What'd you think Pop?
BART=>Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it.
JAMES=>Why not?
BART=>Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show.
JAMES=>It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars.
BART=>And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown.
JAMES=>And there's my next point Pop. Why not?
JAMES=>I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it.
BEN BART=>I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss.
BART=>Po-lice have the same problem.
103A 103A=>INT. THEATER. NIGHT. LATER THAT SAME NIGHT.
JAMES=>Who you play Sax with son?
NEW BAND MEMBER=>James Brown Orchestra, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>What's the rule?
NEW BAND MEMBER=>No hopheads. No reefer heads. No junkies.
JAMES=>Not on the bus. Not backstage. You a talented horn player, son. You gotta keep your game tight. Now you wanna smoke a little groove on your own time, that's yo' business. But we out here to work hard and we gone do just that you dig? Fifty.
JAMES=>Hello pretty thing. You want an autograph?
JAMES=>You want to come with me? So I can sign it somewhere private?
JAMES=>I called you yesterday, you ain't home.
DEDE=>I was home all day.
JAMES=>You were home all day. So why you didn't pick up the phone?
DEDE=>I don't know. What time you call?
JAMES=>I call you at one and quarter past one, then I call you at two. And I call again at three.
DEDE=>You must've wanted to talk to me pretty bad.
JAMES=>Where were you?
DEDE=>Yesterday. I don't know..in the bath?
JAMES=>For two hours?
DEDE=>You want me to take shorter baths? You don't have a phone in the bathroom, James. What you gonna do? Fine me?
JAMES=>I ain't gone fine you, baby. You fine enough already.
DEDE=>Then get over here, Mr. Dynamite.
JAMES=>Got you a phone in the bathroom now.
DEDE=>Keep your eyes closed Bobby. Keep `em closed.
BOBBY BYRD=>They're closed, Dede.
JAMES=>You peekin' brother? OK. OK. You ready. You ready? OK. Open `em. Check it Bobby. Is that something?
JAMES=>That something Bobby? Is that something?
BOBBY=>Yeah brother. That's something.
BOBBY=>Hey Velma.
VELMA=>Hey Bobby.
VELMA=>Teddy got impetigo.
JAMES=>Impetigo?
DEDE=>It's a skin infection.
VELMA=>All that mess round his mouth. That's impetigo. It's highly infectious.
VELMA=>I'm just sayin' Mrs. Brown, I wouldn't go too near Teddy. Not unless you wanna catch impetigo.
DEDE=>Thank you, Velma. I'll consider myself warned.
VELMA=>Warned? Oh, that's a whole other conversation. Welcome to the family.
JAMES=>Listen up. Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane?
JAMES=>You need anything?
VELMA=>I'll let you know. I'm putting a big list together right now.
INTERVIEWER=>Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What exactly do you call your style of music?
JAMES BROWN=>I call it James Brown music. What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a "new bag". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you.
INTERVIEWER=>And what exactly is the groove?
JAMES BROWN=>The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove.
INTERVIEWER=>But how exactly do you define it?
JAMES BROWN=>I just did. See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it.
TEDDY=>"Um Booga Chooca"
JAMES BROWN=>See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand?
INTERVIEWER=>So what's your favorite food?
BART=>Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after.
JAMES=>Day off?
BART=>Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses.
JAMES=>We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg?
BOBBY BYRD=>Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa. That's where we met.
JOURNALIST=>And tell me about James' first band, the Famous Flames.
BOBBY BYRD=>Well there was five of us to start with. Nafloyd Scott, Baby Roy Scott, Sylvester Keels..
JOURNALIST=>And they left...
BOBBY BYRD=>Yeah. They left.
JAMES=>Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg...
BOBBY=>Uh.. The Viceroy. The..
JAMES=>The Regal!
BOBBY=>Yeah. That's it. The Regal.
JAMES=>On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson.
JAMES=>Call `em up, Pop.
JOURNALIST=>Wow. He's got an amazing memory.
BOBBY=>Yeah. James remembers everything.
JAMES=>Hey little man, you been good this year.
LITTLE BOY=>Yes, Mister Brown.
JAMES=>Merry Christmas, Little Man.
DEDE=>Great crowd today, Baby.
DEDE=>You want some dinner?
JAMES=>You stand up in James Brown's yard dressed like that? So every man can see you?
JAMES=>Cover yourself up.
HUSBAND=>Honey, his hands are tied. The pool area has been reserved for a private function.
WIFE=>We're good people and we've paid good money. We didn't come all the way to New Orleans to swim in a pool full of-
HUSBAND WIFE=>Niggers. Entertainers.
VICKI ANDERSON=>You a bad man Bobby Byrd.
VICKI ANDERSON=>Quit lookin' for James Brown and keep your eyes on me, Bobby Byrd.
PEE WEE=>Fella's this is Fred. I thought we'd show him how things work?
PEE WEE ELLIS=>So when I do this.. Means you give it some punch. See. When I dip like this.

ALL=>On the one.
PEE WEE ELLIS=>See? And when I pop his head like this, it mean.
ALL=>Take it to the bridge.
MACEO=>What about when he do this..?
PEE WEE ELLIS=>I ain't ready to tell you that one yet. I'm in control Mr. Parker. Got it. Don't ask about that again.
PEE WEE=>That'll be ten thousand dollars.
PEE WEE=>He's called a rehearsal.
BOBBY=>When?
PEE WEE=>Now. We gotta go get dressed.
MACEO=>You're kidding. Tell me you kidding.
JAMES=>See My great grandmother on my momma's side, she Asian. She got Asian blood. See Asians are a flexible race. You get with an Asian chick? That a whole other story. No spank but they got it baby they got it. Anyway what was I talkin `bout?
MACEO=>Your Chinese knees Mr. Brown.

JAMES=>That's how come I can dance the way I do. Anyway. One. Two. Three. Four. Hit it.
JAMES=>Stop. Maceo. What you doing man? You coming in maybe a little too late. What's the matter son. You lost your feeling?
MACEO=>No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling.
JAMES=>Something wrong, Maceo? Is something wrong, Maceo?
BOBBY BYRD=>James-
JAMES=>You got something to say Mr. Byrd? Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say?
JAMES=>Well then you just HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL Mr. Byrd.
JAMES=>I can't have people HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL. If I can't do it right I ain't gone do it at all. We got to GET ON. GET AHEAD. Now you know the rule.
JAMES=>You late, you off or you hold us up, it's no good, Mr. Byrd. Its gonna cost you 50 dollars.
JAMES=>Now are you ready Mr. Byrd. Are you ready Mr. Byrd?
BOBBY BYRD=>Yes, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>Good. I ain't fattening frogs for snakes. From the top. One Two...
JAMES BROWN=>Quit it. Clyde man. Lets get that POP! Dee.. app..POP! Unnerstand? It drop before you reach the beat. Dig?
MACEO=>Does he mean top of the bar?
PEE WEE=>He means the down beat.
JAMES=>It goin' wrong there Pee Wee, when it rise up.
MACEO=>But Mr. Brown.
MACEO=>We rehearsed it like you told us. We got it like you like it. Jimmy can't do that with the part he's playing. We can change the part if you want.
JAMES BROWN=>Did I say change the part? Don't change the part. How many records you got?
JAMES=>Thank you! I like the part he playin' now. I just want it in a different place.
JAMES=>What's this, Maceo.
MACEO.=>It's a snare, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>A snare what?
MACEO.=>Drum.
JAMES=>Correct.
JAMES=>What's this, Maceo?
MACEO=>Guitar, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>No it's not.
JAMES=>What's that, Pee Wee?
PEE WEE.=>A drum, Mr. Brown?
JAMES=>Now you're getting it.
JAMES=>What's that he's holding.
PEE WEE=>A drum?
JAMES=>You Fellas. What are those shiny things you holding.
EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM=>Drums.
JAMES=>Now we all got our drums. Now when you're playing the drum it don't matter what key you're in, what bar your in or what planet you on. Dig?
MACEO=>But Mr. Brown.
MACEO=>Clyde'll be in a different time to the rest of the band. That doesn't work musically.
JAMES BROWN=>But does it sound good?
JAMES BROWN=>Does it feel good?
JAMES BROWN=>Then it's musical. So play it like I say. From the top.
JAMES BROWN=>Mmmn! Huh! Now that a groove.
MACEO=>Bobby, James Brown's my meal ticket. So I just shut my ears and chomp down his bullshit. But why you soak it up man? You his best friend. You know him for time brother. And he treat you like that. I was you I'd bust him in his damn mouth.
BOBBY BYRD=>I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front.
BOBBY BYRD=>You work so hard at this one thing and then one day you realize it ain't supposed to be you. You can get mad. Try to fight it but if it's God's truth. It's God's truth. James is supposed to be in front. I saw it happen. And the man in front has to BE the man in front. It ain't always pretty but that's the man's responsibility if he wanna stay there. And you and me can't know what that is. We ain't supposed to. So, don't lie to yourself Maceo. Every man in this band walks taller because he with James Brown. Every man in this band believe in himself a little more because he's with James Brown.
MACEO=>You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front?
BOBBY BYRD=>No. But my ears a' open. Open your ears, Maceo. He's a genius. And he's takin' us with him.
JAMES=>Mother, she got to have. Say, you got to have a mother for me. Yeah, popcorn!
JAMES=>Quit it. We missing something.
JAMES=>Pee Wee, get over here by the microphone. And bring that horn box. That's where you keep the wig, right?
PEE WEE=>Mr. Brown?
JAMES=>What is it? Why we stop Henry?
JAMES=>What? What is it?
BOBBY BYRD=>It's King. They shot Dr. King.
121A 121A=>BLACKOUT: SFX: BURNING. SIRENS. GUNFIRE.
BART=>Jimmy, Mayor of Boston's office called. Wanted you to know they've cancelled tomorrow's show at the Garden. For reasons of public safety. He's worried about rioting.
JAMES BROWN=>Tell the Mayor, I sold 30 million records and ninety five percent of them are to the black community. They listen to me. They won't riot
BART=>We have virtual race war looming across the South, Jimmy. Politics, 101? Don't put 10,000 angry blacks together in one place in the middle of a city, and broadcast it live to the world.
JAMES=>Get the Mayor on the phone.
JAMES=>Mr. Mayor, the way I see it, you already lost your next election. You lost it at 7:05 PM Memphis time.
JAMES=>Now tomorrow night, you either got 10,000 angry folks in the Boston Garden, or you got 10,000 angry folks on your front lawn. Take your pick son. Which one you want?
MAYOR=>All of us are here to night to listen to a great talent. James Brown. But we're also here to pay tribute to one of the greatest Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King. So, let us look at each other and pledge that whatever else any other community might do we in Boston will honour Dr. King in peace.
JAMES=>Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together. Give him another round of applause.
JAMES=>Hit it.
MAYOR=>Oh no.
JAMES=>Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine.
JAMES=>Do you wanna dance son? You dance.
JAMES=>C'mon. C'mon now. Y'all go down. Go back down. Don't nobody else come up. Wait a minute. Wait. Ladies and gentleman. This is no way. This is. We are black. We are black. Wait a minute go back. Can't y'all go back down and lets do the show together. We're black don't make us all look bad. Let me finish the show. Step down there. Be a gentleman. Lets represent our own selves. Lets represent our own selves.
JAMES=>Now I ask the police to step back because I figure I could get some respect from my own people. Now we together ain't we. Hit that thing man.
MAYOR=>Holy shit. He did it.
DEDE=>Of course he did.
ARCHIVAL NEWS REPORT=>City officials in Washington DC have praised James Brown. Order has returned to the city hit by rioting largely because of radio and television appeals from the soul singer over the weekend.
JAMES=>In America today you've either got to be an entertainer or a ball player or what? If you poor, young and black, what is there? And you ask me why they on the street? It ain't politics we watchin'. It's economics.
JAMES=>You got kids out there that can't eat, robbing and stealing and doing what they have to do to make it. And if you don't do something about it we gonna lose the country. I go to Harlem, talk to Rap Brown, talk to the Nation they call me a separatist. Here we're on our way to the White House, Pop, and they already calling me an Uncle Tom. So what I supposed to do?
JAMES=>Write a check for Rap so he buy rifles, machine guns, rally on 125th and take it south? What it say to you, a street kid from Augusta, Georgia in the White House?
BART=>It says you kissin' up to the Man James.
JAMES=>You asking me to turn this plane around and stand up the President?
BART=>No. I'm saying who gives a shit. You're already screwed, James. Think about it. If you stand up Lyndon Johnson to go kiss up to the Panthers, you ain't gone be playin' Vegas anytime soon because if they think you can stop a riot, they sure as hell will expect you to start one.
JAMES=>So here I am. Just a sorry soul brother whining inside his private jet, huh?
BART=>Don't be scared my friend. Because if you're scared, it doesn't end well for the black man. Do your thing, James. It's worked for you so far.
JAMES=>I want to go to Vietnam. I want to show unity for the boys out there. The beleaguered, the tired and in the dark.
JAMES=>And we need to bring awareness, and Mr. President, we need to bring the super heavy funk.
JAMES=>Take it and flip it.
JAMES=>Hit it.
JAMES=>Quit it. Bring `em in.
JAMES=>How we all doin'. Hope this ain't too late for you folks.
JAMES=>I brought you all here today so I could tell you something very important. I want you all to know that you can do or be anything you want in this world. Don't let anybody tell you anything different. You understand? When I was a boy I used to shine shoes in front of radio station. Now I own that radio station. You got to build it. And then you gotta learn it... and that's when you earn it.
MACEO=>You think they fuck up he gone take they pocket money.
JAMES=>We ready fellas?
JAMES=>I think about a lot of things. About problems. About solutions. You know one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got in this country...is letting a person feel that they important. Feel that they somebody. It's it. Man can't get hisself together... ...until he know who he is and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from! WHERE WE ALL COME FROM!
JAMES=>Say it loud!
CHILDREN=>I'm Black and I'm Proud!
JAMES=>You the man, Teddy Brown?
TEDDY=>I'm the man, Mr. Brown.
JAMES=>Gertie. The band ready?
GERTRUDE=>They're ready Mr. Brown.
JAMES BROWN=>Don't look like it.
JAMES BROWN=>Come watch how Poppa don't take no mess.

JAMES BROWN=>Y'all act like y'all don't know what time it is. What you doin'?

MACEO=>We asked to get paid on time. We haven't been paid in weeks. We asked for scheduled days off. Every day off we get you make us rehearse.. We asked to get paid for recording but you included it in our salary.

BOBBY=>I can't do this no more, James.
JAMES BROWN=>Damn right you can't do this no more.
BOBBY=>I said I can't do this no more.
JAMES BROWN=>See, the funny part. You say that like it's a big thing. Like "oh my God, Bobby Byrd gone leave James Brown on his own."
BOBBY=>I ain't leaving you on your own, Mr. Brown. You already on your own. Always were.
BOBBY=>Is that God too?
JAMES=>Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside.

SUSIE=>Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that.
SUSIE=>I left because I loved you. I ain't had nothing to make no other choice. I was shamed. I was.
