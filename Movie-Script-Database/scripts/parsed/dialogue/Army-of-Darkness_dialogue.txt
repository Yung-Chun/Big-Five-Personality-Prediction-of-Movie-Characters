ASH=>I first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin. The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection. It was never meant for the world of the living.
ASH=>The book awoke something dark in the woods.
SUPERIMPOSE:=>BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT inscribed on the pages. Illustrations of demonic faces with white eyes. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low through the woods toward the cabin. CAMERA rips through the cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
ASH=>It got into my hand and it went bad. CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
ASH=>So I lopped it off at the wrist. INT. CABIN - NIGHT ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
BLOOD RED CLOUDS=>sweep past the moon.
ASH=>In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole. A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked. A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH recites the incantation from the Necronomicon. EXT. CABIN - NIGHT The Time vortex is created. Trees and a 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
ASH=>...I just didn't plan on coming along. EXT. CABIN - NIGHT Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the funnel-cloud of the Time vortex. INT. TIME VORTEX Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds. He is swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of Time. ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM. The smoke swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the words:
"BRUCE CAMPBELL"=>"Vs" The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
"THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"=>The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING... INT. TIME VORTEX
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK=>its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
ASH=>He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady BEATING of his heart. ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light. The funnel cloud electrifies.
ASH'S BODY=>RIPS at the fabric of Time. EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY All is quiet. Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of a human body flashes briefly and is gone. A moment latter, Ash appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA. EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY ASH falls to the dust. His double barrelled shotgun lands beside him. The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground a moment later.
ASH=>looks up from the dust to behold...
TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN=>in 12th century armor ride up over a hill. They halt before Ash. WARRIOR #1 thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting: WARRIOR #1 Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites! Hail!
ASH=>stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR=>join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
ARTHUR=>the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
ARTHUR'S P.O.V.=>The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back. The handless stump of Ash's right arm. The Shotgun.
A FRIGHTENED ASH=>waves a shaky hand.
ASH=>Take is easy now chief. I don't know how I got here and I'm not lookin' for any trouble.
WISEMAN JOHN=>An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
WISEMAN JOHN=>My Lord Arthur, I believe he is the promised one, written of in the Necronomicon.
ARTHUR=>Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain as...
ASH'S CHEST=>is cut. A thin red gash.
ARTHUR=>He bleeds. As a man bleeds. The one written of in the Book would not bleed.
ARTHUR GESTURES=>and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
ARTHUR=>Likely, he is one of Henry's men. I say to the pit with him! If he is truly the promised one... he will emerge. WARRIOR #2 AND #3 Aye! The pit's a fair test!
GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR=>To the pit with the blackard!
GOLD TOOTH=>charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his jaw. WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN He tumbles from the horse.
ASH=>leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns. LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
ASH=>gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face as he gallops past. The Warrior is sent reeling. TRUCKING SHOT - ASH galloping over a hill. He is almost thrown by the horse, but manages to hang on for dear life.
ASH=>Where the hell they put the stirrups on this thing!!?? CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase. LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
ANGLE ON ARTHUR ARTHUR=>LIEUTENANTS! Fetch me the blackard. TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining Warriors watch for sport. HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN They are gaining an Ash.
ASH=>glances behind him. ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
ASH=>whips his horse.
ASH GIDDYPU! THE FIRST HORSEMAN=>rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
WHOOSH!!! ASH=>ducks the blade.
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>rides up alongside Ash's other flank. He swings and lands the flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
THUNK! ASH=>ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
WHOOSH!=>ASH looks left...
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>winds up for another blow.
ASH=>yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
THE THREE HORSES=>running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>swings.
HIS BROADSWORD=>slams the First Horseman across the face.
THE FIRST HORSEMAN=>is knocked from his steed. TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>turns around and gallops back toward Ash. WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN ride at one another. TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES swinging his Broadsword. TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of his chainsaw arm bracket. FOOMP! He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into place. CLINK! He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over. He curses and yanks again.
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword mightily. The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
ASH=>is knocked from his steed. He tumbles to the dust, narrowly escaping his own horse's hooves.
ASH=>rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
THE SECOND HORSEMAN=>charges and swings his broadsword.
ASH=>raises his chainsaw. CLINK! He deflects the blow. Ash swings
A SWORD HANDLE=>slams against the back of Ash's skull.
ASH=>crumples. He looks up in pain to...
ARTHUR=>above him. The sun over his shoulder.
EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS=>gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
ARTHUR=>Bring the prisoner! The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw are taken from him.
ASH=>No! GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
ARTHUR=>To the castle! WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar. The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners to run alongside them.
WISEMAN JOHN=>Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust. He is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA. DISSOLVE TO: THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN blazing in the sky above the wasteland. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides alongside him.
GOLD TOOTH=>Move along now! DISSOLVE TO: LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff. A drawbridge is lowered. Arthur's warriors ride over it.
CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH=>shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle walls. INT. CASTLE COURTYARD
SHEILA=>a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned. She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur atop his horse.
SHEILA=>M'Lord Arthur! Where is my brother? Did he not ride with you?
ARTHUR=>Eye. And fought valiantly. But last night fell in battle to Duke Henry's men.
SHEILA=>Her face does not immediately register the grief. She attempts to step forward but stumbles. She steadies herself against the stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash. She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks at him as he's dragged along.
SHEILA=>Foul thing! A pox on your throat! Thou art a Murderer! A black Murderer!
VILLAGE WOMEN=>restrain her.
SHEILA=>cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her. VILLAGE WOMAN #1 May you be consoled by their suffering in the pit. THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the ground. This is THE PIT.
ASH=>looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering what they have in store for him.
SHEILA=>stares at him in hatred. THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH eyes Ash curiously. This is Duke Henry the Red.
DUKE HENRY=>You sir, are not one of my vassals. Who are you?
ASH=>Who wants to know?
DUKE HENRY=>I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale. Lord of the Northlands and leader of its people.
ASH=>You ain't leadin' but two things now, pal. Jack and shit. And Jack left town. A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS address the doomed men:
ARTHUR=>There is an Evil that has awakened in this land. And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us. Your people are no better than the foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit! May God have mercy on your souls.
TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN=>crank a massive wench. Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid slides back, revealing a dark hole. The Pit. FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT a echoed wailing rises up. ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS stiffen in fear. AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD
OLD WOMAN=>Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty sons of whores! She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
CAMERA PANS TO...=>HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 as he's thrown down into the pit. He disappears into the blackness. CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH watching with disbelief. We hear the warrior's echoed cry of terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom. CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT looking down into the blackness we hear: HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 I beg of you... by all that's holy! Lower a rope! Lower... Oh, for the love of god! no! NO!!! AIIIIIiiieee! The sound of ripping and scratching. The SHRIEK of terror is cut short as...
A GEYSER OF BLOOD=>erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
ASH=>is frozen in fear.
TOWER GUARD=>There! He's escaping!
ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE=>jerks from the pit to... TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2 making a break for it! He's past the guards, heading for the open drawbridge.
THE TOWER ARCHERS=>spot him and fire arrows.
ANGLE ON PING! PING!=>They bounce off the Warrior's armor. He's makes it to the open drawbridge when...
ARTHUR=>pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow. ZING! He lets it fly. CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow... PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2 The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to a wooden post. He dies standing.
THE CROWD=>Cheers. They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners: CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner in line...
ASH=>turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
ASH=>Hey, I never even saw these assholes before.. He spins to Duke Henry the Red. You gotta tell 'em you don't know me. We never met. Tell him.
HENRY=>I do not believe that he shall listen.
THE WARRIORS=>grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
ASH=>tumbles down into the pit. He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul water at the pit's bottom. He stands and coughs out a mouthful
ASH=>spins to a small sound. INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V. Nothing. Just the mist rising from the water.
ASH=>shifts his glance again.
A SHADOW=>rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
ASH=>doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir. Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes break the surface.
ASH=>spins... but there's nothing there. As he turns back around, he is confronted by...
A FEMALE EVIL DEAD=>It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's face!
CLOSER=>Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It jerks like a marionette as it advances.
ASH SCREAM=>and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit. He tries to scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
THE DEADITE'S HAND=>clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
DOWN ANGLE ON ASH=>He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing. ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured. THE PIT - THE DEADITE grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists. ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA shouts for Ash's death. THE PIT - ASH'S FACE The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash. LONG SHOT - ASH is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
THE DEADITE=>races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
ASH=>cries out in pain.
ASH'S LEGS=>cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat. He flips the beast. ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
THE DEADITE=>grabs Ash by the throat. THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
THE DEADITE=>advances. ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN shouts down at Ash. THE PIT - ASH trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an object falling at him through the glare above. THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION tumbling downward. Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its blade of steel. Ash's Excalibur! ASH - SLOW MOTION summons his strength and leaps upward. LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION Tumbling downward...
HIGH ANGLE- ASH=>ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars past CAMERA. LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
ASH'S STUMP=>snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW=>He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
ASH=>Come on, you blasted piece of-- He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
VERRROOOOOOM!!=>ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw. Blue exhaust billows up from the pit. THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE lunges at Ash.
DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW=>Buzzzzz!!
ASH=>is splattered with black bile.
THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND=>flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast. CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below. ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit. THE PIT - ASH raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite hand. He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH=>Ash decapitates the beast. ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this guy's guts and style.
THE LAST REMNANTS=>of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
ASH=>climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges from the earthen wall before him.
ASH=>slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it back into the water. ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS gasp as...
THUMP! ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM=>comes up, over the edge of the pit. Followed by... THUMP! Ash's bloody hand. Then his bruised face. Covered in the black blood of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet. Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
ASH=>All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants some.
GOLD TOOTH=>look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
ASH=>You want some more? Huh?! Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out to Henry.
ASH=>Now climb on those horses and get out of here. HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS quickly mount horses.
ARTHUR=>Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
ASH=>slaps Henry's horse.
ASH GIDDYUP NOW!! HYAAAH! THE STUNNED CROWD=>parts allowing...
HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS=>to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
ARTHUR=>stares at Ash with hatred.
ARTHUR=>For that, I shall see you dead.
ASH=>removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
ASH=>This is my boomstick. It's a twelve gauge, double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me...
ASH SPINS,=>pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit on the forgotten chain. The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM! The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
ANGLE ON BLAMMITY-BLAM!=>The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it summersaulting down into the pit. THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST echoes off the mountains like distant thunder. SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD look to Ash in reverence.
ASH=>twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH... and holsters it.
ASH=>Bring me your hoo do man. EXT. BLACKBIRDS fly from a barren tree. SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing... EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each twenty feet tall. The remains of an ancient temple. In the center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire. As old Woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames. Nearby, Arthur converses with his four Lieutenants. EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT CLOSE UP - ASH opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter. No sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered. He waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
ASH AND SHEILA=>sits across the flames from Arthur and his men. She bandages Ash's wounds.
SHEILA=>is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
SHEILA=>I pray thee to forgive me. I believed thee one of Henry's men. She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
ASH=>First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me. He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
ASH=>Lady, just leave me alone.
SHEILA=>I'm sorry m'lord. Please understand... T'is a cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only hope against the darkness that has descended on this land.
ASH=>They're mistaken. She stares deeply into his eyes.
SHEILA=>I think not. I feel that there is reason for your being here. It is no accident. 166 WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN 167 approach. They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from Ash.
ASH=>Well what is it? Can you send me back or not?
WISEMAN JOHN=>Only the Necronomicon has the power. A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.
ASH=>The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.
WISEMAN JOHN=>It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one. Other Warriors have tried. Their widows grieve still. We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it. Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.
ASH=>Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home. A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
DOGS=>around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
ASH AND SHEILA=>turn to see...
THE OLD WOMAN=>now standing too close to the fire. Her robes ignites. She does not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir the caldron.
ASH=>His haw drops. He slowly stands as...
THE BURNING WOMAN=>spins sharply to him. Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
POSSESSED WOMAN YOU SHALL DIE!=>Her eyes are bone white. She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit. Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal snarl. With two voice at once;
POSSESSED WOMAN=>YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE NECRONOMICON. WE SHALL FEAST UPON YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
MAN! THE POSSESSED WOMAN=>collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust. CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open! A nasty grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen approach.
WISEMAN JOHN=>kneels and reaches for her.
ASH'S HAND=>clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
ASH=>It's a trick. Get an axe.
THE POSSESSED WOMAN=>awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK. In a frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY=>With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two warriors beneath it.
A GIGANTIC STONE=>topples the next stone.
BOOM!=>Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
BOOM! BOOM!=>Like giant dominoes, they fall.
ASH=>watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
ANGLE ON=>The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA! THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA She SCREAMS! SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES coming toward CAMERA.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! ASH=>does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the stone's deadly path.
ASH AND SHEILA=>rolls across the dusty stone courtyard. CLOSE SHOT - ASH rolls into frame and glances up to see... THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK! WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the ground.
ASH=>rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
ANGLE ON=>The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!=>EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE
THE POSSESSES WOMAN=>SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH! The multi-ton stone crushes her legs to paste. Her legs are pinned but still she battles on, clutching Ash about his throat!
ASH=>gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon. POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
ASH=>grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the monster's oversized throat. She chokes. GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS grab the beast and pull it off of Ash. Arthur comes to meet them. He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
THE POSSESSED WOMAN=>vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
POSSESSED WOMAN=>The Evil lives. Slay me and ten will rise to take my place. All will die. ALL WILL -
CHOP! IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE=>is brought down upon her throat. The possessed body flails and spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
THE HEAD=>rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet. It's eyes pop open!
POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD ---DIE! ARTHUR=>grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness. The head sails away as the laughter receded.
WISEMAN JOHN=>Now. Will thou quest for the Necronomicon?

ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND=>SNAPS open with great force.
ANGLE ON WHOOSH CLANG! ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND=>clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron goblet.
CLOSE ON ASH=>He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.
ASH=>stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with apprehension. The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around her. Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one another and kiss. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY Arthur's castle in the distance. In the foreground, five men
ASH=>He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand. His chainsaw juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back. Ash's cape billows as he rides. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY The Horsemen wind down a trail. Suddenly the horses rear up. The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
ASH=>What's going on?
ARTHUR=>points to... THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits an eerie whistling.
WISEMAN JOHN=>This is the edge of the land ruled by the Dark Spirit. This path will lead you to an unholy place. A cemetery. There, the Necronomicon awaits.
ASH=>anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
THE TWO WARRIORS=>finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...
ASH'S HORSE=>which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves. WARRIOR #1 Lord Arthur, he is supplied. Now I beg of you, let us leave this foul place.
ARTHUR=>A moment.
WISEMAN JOHN=>moves close to Ash.
WISEMAN JOHN=>As thou removest the Book from it's cradle, you must recite these words. Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
ASH=>Clatto Verata Nicto. Okay.
WISEMAN JOHN=>Repeat them.
ASH=>Clatto Verata Nicto. WISEMAN #1 Again.
ASH=>I got it. I got it. I know your damn words. All right? Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back. That's the deal. After that I'm history. Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN=>watch as Ash disappears. IN A SEA OF MIST The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS. A form materializes out of the fog: It is Ash.
CLOSER ON ASH=>He whips the horse.
ASH HAAAAAA! ANGLE ON ASH=>He gallops past. CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick fog. FADE OUT. EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS

CLOSER ON ASH=>He hears a sound and look to...

ASH=>kick his steed and bolts.
THE EVIL FORCE=>sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
ASH=>frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which jut from the ground.
THE EVIL FORCE=>rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks. It burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
ASH=>jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree. He gracefully leaps a second tree. But as he leaps over the third, he is ripped off the horse by a low branch. He falls hard to the mud as the horse gallops off. He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
THE EVIL FORCE=>follows Ash down a wooded trail.
ASH=>running for... EXT. WOODEN SHED a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.
ASH=>comes upon the shed's door. Locked. He heaves his body against it but it won't give. INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
THE EVIL FORCE=>emerges from over the ridge.
ASH=>unscrews his iron hand and holsters it. He slings the chainsaw from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket. Click. He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT that extends from his breastplate. CLICK. He thrusts out his arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life! INT.

THE EVIL FORCE=>draws closer. INT. SHED

ASH=>begins to SCREAM. And the BANGING halts. LONG SHOT - INT. SHED All is quiet. Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence. And that's when it hits. LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE! Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare. INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil Force. Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the Shed, spinning head over heels. Ash rips through other doors, taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors as he flies through the air. EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal wave. EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the other doors. The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to the ground in a stack.
THE EVIL FORCE=>with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods. EXT. SHED- DUSK LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS. All is quiet. We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob turns slightly. The door swings upward and opens... revealing a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self up.
ASH=>enters the Mill.
ASH=>Anybody here?! The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his breath.
ASH=>This place'll do for the night. Get the book in the morning. INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
ASH=>peers through the window. EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill. The wind kicks up. INT. MILL
ASH=>listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force of the gale.
THE WOODEN SHUTTERS=>on the window quietly KNOCK. Ash shivers and rubs his arms for warmth.
ASH=>Damn this cold.
ASH=>looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
GASOLINE=>pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
ASH=>lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the flame for warmth.
ASH=>'least I won't freeze to death. He turns to a tiny sound. WIDE SHOT - ASH behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps past.
ASH=>spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
BLAMITY-BLAM!=>The window is ripped away in a shower of glass. ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW Only the night woods. The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just a tree branch swaying in the wind.
ASH=>reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a crack.
ASH'S EYEBALL=>through the crack in the door. ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond. There is movement. LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill. CLOSE UP - ASH He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks breaking.
ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE=>It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward Ash.
A STARTLED ASH=>leaps aside just in time.
ASH=>snags the horse's reigns.
ASH=>Easy, boy. The horse calms. Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill. ASH'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out. EXT. MILL
ASH=>stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill. INT. MILL
ASH=>races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES=>Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash. From the eight pieces of mirror spring...
EIGHT TINY ASHES=>Two inch high versions of himself. They leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor.
ASH=>is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire. TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3 grab a discarded dinner fork. Like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
ASH=>SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the stove pipe. TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6 lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction. Another leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
ASH=>barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head off.
THE TINY ASHES=>SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter. They jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
ASH=>pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it. TINY ASH #1 is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry him. TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it WHOOSHES past.
FA-THONG! THE FORK=>skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
ASH=>stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front of him by other tiny ASHES. His head slams into a stove pipe. He crumples. He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot stove. SSSSSSssss. He pries his face loose with a spatula.
A BUCKET OF GREASE=>is pushed off a high shelf.
CLANG!=>IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD and spills slippery grease about the floor.
ASH=>with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back and forth on the grease. He stands and tries to dislodge the bucket. He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his path. He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles jutting from it.
BUCKET-HEADED ASH=>SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe. CLANG! Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks. He looks about for the little imps. TINY ASH #2 crouching behind a log attempting to hide. BUT...
ASH=>has seen him. He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash #2 into the stove's fire.
ASH=>Ooops. TINY ASH #2 is burned alive.
ASH=>glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet. TINY ASH #3 is dashing across the open expanse of floor. Ash's gigantic foot comes down to crush the little man. Tiny Ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
RIP!! THE NAIL RIPS=>through Ash's shoe.
ASH=>jerks his leg upward in pain. Ash dances about the place hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
ASH=>awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. Directly above him, on the edge of a table... TINY ASHES #4 AND #5 suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs. TINY ASH #7 AND #8 stand atop Ash's face. They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for air. As he inhales... SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6 is released. TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
ASH=>inhales the living beast whole. He chokes violently. He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. He puts his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no avail. He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are gone. He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to a chair. He goes pale.
ASH=>Nasty little thing's inside me. He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain. Well let's see how you like a little hot water! He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding contents painfully down his throat. He sets down the kettle and waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
ASH=>emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest. Then his arm. He rips back his shirt sleeve. CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
ASH=>watches in horror as...
THE TINY FIGURE=>squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand. The Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed iron hand swings at him.
THE IRON HAND=>connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
ASH=>lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND. But the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head. Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into the opened vice.
THE EVIL IRON HAND=>cranks the vice's handle.
THE VICE=>tightens around Ash's head. Trapped, he looks to...
THE EVIL HAND=>rummaging through a wooden toolbox. It comes upon a crude wooden punch. ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand. But Ash expertly dodges each stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb is super fast motion.
ASH=>with is head still wedged in the vice.
ASH=>Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!! A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose. He emits a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
ASH=>Soon as I get out of this thing
I... YIEEEE!!=>THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
ASH=>No! Not the teeth!
YANK! THE EVIL HAND=>jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for his inspection. It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him. The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust. It scurries from view.
ASH'S HEAD=>struggling in the grip of the vice.
ASH=>Where the hell are ya!?
THE EVIL HAND=>grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
ASH=>I can't see ya!!
HIS EVIL HAND=>raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the right half of his body.
ASH=>No, no--not the poke-- SSSSsssssssss!
ASH=>jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM. He holds up his iron hand. It's back to normal. Again under his control.
ASH=>Okay then. But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His shoulder itches. He scratches it. The Itch grows. It itches madly. He rips back his shirt. Upon his shoulder... THERE
BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!=>THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH. Beneath it, a mouth and nose begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
ASH=>SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill. The CAMERA follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark woods. EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT
ASH=>staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the
ASH=>Dear God, it's growing bigger! THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER. It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil incarnate. He is now a man with two heads!
TWO HEADED ASH=>Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
THE BAD ASH HEAD=>opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
THE GOOD ASH HEAD=>retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
TWO HEADED ASH=>collapses against a tree. Under the light of the full moon we see a terrifying sight:
TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS=>sprout from Ash's body!
A LEG=>rips out of his stomach. Another foot POPS out from his back.
TWO HEADED ASH=>Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor, propelled by his four arms and four legs. Suddenly he stands and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first. He literally splits into two. SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT When it's over, there are two ASHES. GOOD ASH and...
BAD ASH.=>They square off beneath the moonlight. HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES circle one another like wolves.
GOOD ASH=>What... are you? Are you me?
BAD ASH=>WHAT... ARE GOO? ARE GOO ME?!! You sound like a jerk!
GOOD ASH=>Why are you doing this?!
BAD ASH=>Wanna know? 'cause the answers easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash, and yer...
EVIL ASH=>Dances a funny jig around Ash. He SMACKS Ash across the face as he sings:
EVIL ASH=>...Little goody two-
SMACK!=>...shoes, little goody two-
SMACK!=>...shoes, little good--
EVIL ASH=>the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing at his nose.
BLAMMITY-BLAM!=>The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet. WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN blown backwards into a double backflip.
EVIL ASH'S BODY=>slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground, quite dead.
GOOD ASH=>clutching the smoldering shotgun.
GOOD ASH=>Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the gun. LONG SHOT - ASH staring down at the body of his evil self.
ASH=>I know better than to bury you whole. EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes of lightning. The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill. The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
WHOOSSH-WHOOSH! MONTAGE SEQUENCE:=>Ash's hand light a torch.
FRIGHTENED BATS FLY=>from the base of the windmill.
CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT=>across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
CLICK. SNAP. CLINK. THE CHAINSAW=>is switched on. It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
ASH=>falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil twin. He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly task. EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS float past the moon. We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw. EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
ASH=>with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill. Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of an old Oak Tree in the graveyard. Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet as he digs a grave.
ASH=>Now you see what's what. Man's body is his own personal property. Don't anybody try to take that away from him.
ASH=>finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack. As he heaves the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out. INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD It's eyes pop open! It peers up at Ash from the grave. It croaks;
EVIL ASH HEAD=>You'll never get that Book. I will come back for you.
ASH=>Hey, what's that you got on your face?
EVIL ASH HEAD=>Huh? CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it. EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
ASH=>buries it deep. He raises a crude burial marker high above his head;
ASH=>Rest in pieces.
ASH=>backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
THE GRAVEYARD=>in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel GROANS in the gale.
ASH=>This must be it. The cemetery.
ASH=>moves toward the cemetery. ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
ASH=>draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him. He glances down to... ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull. The jaw bone drops open with a squeak.
CLOSE ON ASH=>His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to... THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and shadow.
ASH=>arrives at the foot of the massive stone. UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
CAMERA PANS REVEALING...=>A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING... A THIRD!=>CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL: THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
A BAFFLED ASH=>steps close.
ASH=>Wait. Three books? Nobody said anything about that. Ha! That Wiseman was so busy fillin' me fulla his secret words and phrases and, and, his... bullshit, he forgot to mention anything about that. Like do I take all of 'em of one or 'em, or what? Well... He reaches for the first book and opens it.
ANGLE ON WHOOOOOOSH!!!=>To reveal a black hole. SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of the Book. It begins to suck things into it. CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book. ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing stronger. ASH'S HAND - PUPPET is stretched as it's pulled down into the book. LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
ASH'S PUPPET HEAD=>stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
ASH PUPPET=>A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut. INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to normal.
ASH=>Woah. Wrong book. He turns to study...
THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS ASH=>tries to decide between them. At first he's sure which one it is. Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses the other.
THE BOOK=>moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
ASH=>Huh. Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him! THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book. The Book flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA like a bat! BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
THE BATBOOK=>shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
ASH=>Dear God, help me... ahhh!!! The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
ASH=>pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's pedestal.
ASH=>faces the remaining book. He slowly reaches for it as the wind kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
CLOSE ON BOOK=>It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face! Two empty eye sockets stare out from it. This is the Book of the Dead...
ASH=>bristles in fear.

ASH KLATOO... VERATA...=>NECTtphhhhhhhhhh... He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember. The wind stops. It seems to have worked. He looks about with growing confidence.

THE SKELETAL HANDS=>toss Ash to...
THE ROTTED ARMS=>grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock. Two of the six arms try to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved at him. Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his face toward the skeleton hands.

ASH=>No.. no more... The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
ASH=>Leave me alone! Leave me aHUUU!

ASH=>Hey. We had a deal. You told me, you could clean this thing up, once I got you the book. You said there was a passage in there that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
WISEMAN JOHN=>The passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book. And they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall rule the Earth for one thousand years...Because of you...we are doomed.

A SHATTERED BRIDGE=>abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once spanned. Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs piled eight deep in some places. CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces of iron and bone.
ASH=>....I found that I had slept too long.
ASH=>is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't hear his terrified SCREAM! CUT TO BLACK.
