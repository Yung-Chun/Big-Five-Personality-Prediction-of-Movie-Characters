AN OLD MAN=>I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody tell you you have a handicap.
JOYCE=>Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're... What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad that I made especially for you. Allow me.
MARGE=>You must try this. It's my mother's recipe. Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green thumb. I could use your help.
HOUSEWIFE=>Me, too. There you go.
JOYCE=>Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my house first.
JOYCE=>Haven't you, Eddie?
EDWARD=>I did?
BILL=>Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on.
EDWARD=>I thought it was shish kebab.
BILL=>What?
EDWARD=>I thought it was shish kebab.
BILL=>Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things so literally.
INVENTOR=>Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and the hostess is serving tea "Now, many numerous little questions confront us" "Should the man rise" "When he accepts his cup of tea?" "May lump sugar be taken with the things?"
EDWARD=>Hmm, no.
INVENTOR=>Is it good form to accept a second cup? "Now, should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh should the center crease. Be allowed to remain? It is so easy to commit embarrassing blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to, Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old man from the cape." "Who made himself there, but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's right.
DENNY=>Okay, guys, we're home. shh.
KIM=>I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.
TEENAGE GIRL=>I can't wait to take a shower.
SUZANNE=>And wash off the mildew.
JIM=>If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll sleep in the yard... again.
KIM=>I told you to call to say we're coming back early.
DENNY=>Did you?
SUZANNE=>He'd rather complain.
JIM=>How else can I be the center of the attention? You didn't call your parents.
KIM=>They don't run their house like a police station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See you later.
JIM=>See you later. Bye.
KIM=>Don't forget your arm.
JIM=>Oh, yeah.
DENNY=>Come on, Jim let's go.
KIM=>Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill me.
BILL=>It's all right. It's all right. Go back to bed. It's only Edward. This way.
PEG=>Honey, that was Edward.
KIM=>Who is he? What are you talking about?
PEG=>Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.
BILL=>We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do you like that? It's all made up and everything. There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong? She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in a way in that castle too long. You don't know anything about the wonderful world of teen-age girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten that out.
EDWARD=>What is it?
BILL=>Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a certain age. They develop these gland things. Their bodies swell up. They go crazy.
EDWARD=>Glands?
BILL=>yeah, glands. I try not to think about it Good. Isn't it?
PEG=>Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow we'll fix your room right.
KIM=>Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?
PEG=>Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all alone. You would have done the same thing.
KIM=>Why does he have to stay here?
PEG=>Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He can't help the way he is. Have a little sympathy.
KIM=>I do have a little sympathy.
PEG=>Then let's just say hello and later you can come downstairs and shake his hand.
KIM=>Shake his hand?
PEG=>Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him half to death.
KIM=>I scared him to death?
PEG=>Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a proper introduction. Edward, this is our daughter Kim. Kim, this is Edward who's going to live with us.
KIM=>Hi!
JOYCE=>Eddie. Thirsty? Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear myself think. Momma's precious little baby girl. Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of lemonade?
EDWARD=>Lemonade?
KEVIN=>One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over. They're the sharpest things in the world. They can hack through anything. And...
KIM=>I think they look weird. They give me the creeps.
A GIRL=>You should see the clown in front of Ms. Peter's yard.
EDWARD=>Kim!
KIM=>Oh, no!
A GIRL=>That's him?
JIM=>He's calling you, Kim.
KIM=>Stop it.
A WOMAN=>Edward, you forgot your cookies.
JIM=>Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.
A GIRL=>Let's go.
PEG=>Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had lunch at Jackie's today.
BILL=>Really?
PEG=>She's just had her kitchen completely redone.
BILL=>I'll be darned.
PEG=>New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.
BILL=>Yeah, isn't that wonderful?
PEG=>Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me your mom had her kitchen done too?
JIM=>Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four heads.
PEG=>My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be that rich.
JIM=>No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My father has his own room for his stuff to make sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he won't help me buy my own car.
BILL=>Well, he probably wants you to pay for it yourself. I agree with him. It builds character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking of money, I understand you are not charging for gardening, Edward?
PEG=>Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.
BILL=>Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of life with cookies. You can't buy car with cookies. Am I right, Jim?
JIM=>Ah, that's true, sir. You can't.
A GIRL=>I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't think it's sanitary.
EDWARD=>I'm sorry.
PEG=>Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?
KIM=>No, that's okay. I'll be right back.
HOUSEWIFE=>This can't possibly be my Alexis. She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's gorgeous. Thank you.
PEG=>It won't be long. She has just to decide on the style, and then it will be fine. She just has to decide what style she wants.
JOYCE=>I was hoping for something big and bouffant. Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? Would you cut mine? That was the single most thrilling experience of my whole life.
PEG=>We're getting the head of the company.
KIM=>I'm home.
PEG=>Hi, honey. We're in here.
KIM=>Hi! What did you do to your hair?
PEG=>Edward cut it. Isn't it wild? Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's right here. Great. So then you know all about it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye bye. No wonder she's the head of the company. You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, Edward.
EDWARD=>She had some ideas?
PEG=>You bet she did.
MARGIE=>I'll get that.
MARGIE=>Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you sharpened up.
JIM=>You got it?
KIM=>No, I can't believe this. Do you have a key?
EDWARD=>No.
KIM=>I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.
JIM=>Well, we're stranded.
KIM=>Wow! Thanks.
JIM=>Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in, huh?
TV HOST=>Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward? Yeah, get way over. Stand right up.
EDWARD=>The friends I've made.
TV HOST=>Any other questions?
EDWARD=>I'd like to meet him.
TV HOST=>We'll give that name after the show. Thank you very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.
EDWARD=>Yes, I know.
TV HOST=>I think he'd like that.
PEG=>No matter what, Edward will always special.
TV HOST=>More questions? Stand right up.
TV HOST=>There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.
JIM=>Sure, he does. Right, Kim?
KIM=>Now you got him started.
JIM=>Knock it off, bubble- butt.
KEVIN=>You did it.
JIM=>So?
TV HOST=>How about it? Is there some special lady in your life?
TV HOST=>Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break and we'll be right back after these messages.
KIM=>Why are you laughing? He got hurt.
JIM=>It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!
KIM=>A little shock?
JIM=>I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left nut to see that again.
JOYCE=>Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect. It's just what we've been looking for. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics. All along this row here.
EDWARD=>Peg could sell cosmetics.
JOYCE=>Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the customers. Back in here is what I really want to show you. This is the storeroom for supplies. What I need from you today is to help me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. You just sit down right there. I have some smocks. Would you like me to model them? This is my favorite because it's yellow. And what it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that fall down your neck. Then there's this old purple one, you know, you kind of drape around you like this.
EDWARD=>I like that one.
JOYCE=>You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, you come back here! You can't do that!
BILL=>Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the dash board.
PEG=>I've never seen that.
EDWARD=>Sorry I'm late.
PEG=>Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without you. Here you go.
BILL=>So, Edward, did you have a productive day?
EDWARD=>Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going to be. You could have a cosmetic counter.
PEG=>Wouldn't that be great?
BILL=>Great.
EDWARD=>And then she showed me the back room where she took all of her clothes off.
BILL=>Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty parlor, that's what's going to teach you volumes. There's nothing like running your own business. I've never done it myself, but from what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have. So I guess the bank is going to be your next step, huh?
EDWARD=>The bank?
BILL=>Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started. Nothing to worry about. With your talent and reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.
BANK CLERK=>No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no savings, no personal investment, no social security number. You may as well not even exist. There is no collateral.
PEG=>You know. We already have a second on the house, but don't the testimonials make a difference? Did you see here, the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?
BANK CLERK=>We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a social security card. Establish credit and buy yourself a car. You have the side to advantage. You can get one of those handicapped placards. No problem. Park anywhere you like.
PEG=>I can't believe it. Really, it's just an outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of it. We'll get your money somewhere.
KIM=>But that's breaking and entering.
JIM=>Look. My parents have insurance up the rear. Okay? And all it will cost them is a little hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will have new and better everything.
KIM=>We can't.
JIM=>Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for the stuff.
KIM=>Jim, I don't want to.
JIM=>Well, do you want to ride around in a van like Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever we like? With a mattress in the back?
KIM=>Why can't you just do it?
JIM=>Because my father keeps the damn room locked, and we need Edward to get us in.
KIM=>Why can't you take the key like when he's sleeping or something?
JIM=>Look, you don't understand, everything he handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.
KIM=>What do you mean? That's not true.
JIM=>Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
KIM=>That's not fair.
JIM=>What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any other way.
KIM=>There got to be.
JIM=>Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us to have our own van?
KIM=>Yeah. Jim, the lights are on.
JIM=>Those go on automatically. They've gone for the weekend. I told you. That's right.
DENNY=>This burglar scared.
KIM=>You turned off the alarm. Am I right?
JIM=>Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.
KIM=>I can't believe this is happening.
A GIRL=>Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's house?
KIM=>He's never been here.
EDWARD=>This person stole from you?
JIM=>Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it. Right? Come on. Let's go.
EDWARD=>His parents will make him give it back.
JIM=>Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on.
JIM=>The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.
KIM=>No, Jim. We can't just leave him here.
POLICEMAN=>We know you're in there.
OFFICER ALLEN=>We're in the process of deactivating the system so that you can come out.
KIM=>Denny, turn around!
JIM=>No way!
KIM=>Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell them we were breaking in.
JIM=>I'm not going back there. Okay?
KIM=>We have to go back.
JIM=>No, because my father will prosecute.
KIM=>His own son?
JIM=>Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll kill him.
KIM=>Denny, turn around.
JIM=>No.
KIM=>Turn around. We have to.
OFFICER ALLEN=>Put your hands high in the air so we can see them. Put your hands up!
POLICEMAN=>He's got something in his hands. Looks like knives.
OFFICER ALLEN=>Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon. I'll ask you one more time and this is your last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them. Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to fire.
A WOMAN=>Please. We know him.
OFFICER ALLEN=>Alright, cuff him.
PEG=>But can we see him now?
POLICEMAN=>We'll have to hold him overnight for observation.
PEG=>He has to stay in prison all night?
POLICEMAN=>Pick him up in the morning.
PEG=>Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.
BILL=>What in god's name was going through your mind, son?
PEG=>Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I envied Jim's parents, their money.
BILL=>What were you going to do with that stuff?
PEG=>Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the salon somehow." But I never meant stealing. Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's not the way to get anything.
BILL=>Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that.
PEG=>Why ever did you do this?
OFFICER ALLEN=>Will he be okay, Doc?
PSYCHOLOGIST=>The years in spent isolation have not equipped him with the tools necessary to judge right from wrong. He's had no context. He's been completely without guidance. Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and so forth. Indicate that he's a highly imaginative.
OFFICER ALLEN=>Character.
PSYCHOLOGIST=>It seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.
OFFICER ALLEN=>But will he be all right out there?
PSYCHOLOGIST=>Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.
OFFICER ALLEN=>Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying about you. Watch yourself.
MARGIE=>I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.
JOYCE=>All along I felt in my gut. There was something wrong with him.
MARGIE=>It could have been my house.
HELEN=>It could have been any of our houses.
ESMERALDA=>I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan on him. You didn't heed my warning. but now you will because now you see it too.
PEG=>Edward. You stay here.
REPORTER=>What do you say in your defense?
EDWARD=>Nothing.
PEG=>He didn't want to talk.
REPORTER=>You have to say something.
PEG=>He can't talk right now.
REPORTER=>No comments? No remarks?
REPORTER=>So were you set up? What was going through your mind? One comment.
PEG=>We have to get in the house. We don't want to talk to you. We'll talk to you later.
REPORTER=>One comment.
PEG=>Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at our Christmas party. Before I get you here for your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, you may think that, but you're wrong.
KIM=>You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they? Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you for not telling them about me.
EDWARD=>You are welcome.
KIM=>It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.
EDWARD=>I know it was Jim's house.
KIM=>You did?
EDWARD=>Yes.
KIM=>Well, then why did you do it?
EDWARD=>Because you asked me to.
KIM=>Don't.
JIM=>What's the matter with you? When you are going to stop? I did what I could. My old man think he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail. What more do you want from me?
KIM=>You could tell the truth.
JIM=>So could do. You were there, too.
KIM=>It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do it.
JIM=>But you did do it. I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.
BILL=>Well, we are going to try to help you find a way to replace the drapes and the towels, but our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to be so easy to replace.
KIM=>Dad!
BILL=>Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the street. You find a suitcase full of money. There's nobody around. No human person is in evidence. What do you do? A You keep the money. B You use it to buy gifts for your friends and your loved ones. C You give it to the poor. D You turn it into the police.
KIM=>That is really stupid.
PEG=>Kim!
KEVIN=>I keep the money.
PEG=>Simmer down.
BILL=>Edward?
KIM=>Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That will be fun.
PEG=>You are not seeing Jim tonight?
KIM=>No.
KEVIN=>You know we had a cool show-and-tell today. This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10. maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.
PEG=>Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think your father's finished yet.
BILL=>Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting.
EDWARD=>Give it to my loved ones?
PEG=>Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, bit it's not.
KEVIN=>You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give it to the police.
BILL=>Good thinking, Kevin.
KIM=>Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.
BILL=>We're trying to make things easier for him, so let's cut the comedy for a little while.
KIM=>I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.
BILL=>We're not talking nice. We're talking right and wrong.
KIM=>Shut up.
PEG=>Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong living in his family.
MARGIE=>It is unbelievable that they're having their Christmas party anyway. Are you going?
MARGIE=>He practically raped Joyce, you know threatening her with those knives? It's a miracle she escaped.
HELEN=>I don't have anything against Bill and Peg, but...
JOYCE=>I know, I know. They've got that teenage daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things after what happened to me can you imagine?
HELEN=>What do you say to Peg about the Christmas party?
MARGIE=>I said I hoped. We'd make it.
HELEN=>I lied, too.
PEG=>Edward, do you want to give me that new haircut?
EDWARD=>Again?
PEG=>yes, sure.
PEG=>It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.
KEVIN=>Hi, honey. honey.
EDWARD=>Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone?
KEVIN=>No.
EDWARD=>No, why?
KEVIN=>It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.
PEG=>Other people's feelings?
KEVIN=>I'll be outside.
PEG=>A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. What do you think, honey?
KIM=>More bells?
PEG=>More bells. Okay.
KIM=>Mom, do you really think that we should be having this party?
PEG=>Of course I think we should be having this party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we need is just to calm things down and then everything will just go back to normal. Do you have any more bells, honey?
JIM=>Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go. Freak!
BILL=>Edward, where are you going?
KIM=>Where is he?
JIM=>He tried to hurt you.
KIM=>No, he did not and you know it.
JIM=>Are you nuts? I just saw him.
KIM=>Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you to go. Okay? Just go!
JIM=>Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that? He isn't even human.
KIM=>Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did you see where Edward went?
BILL=>Well. I don't know. He just walked down the street.
KIM=>Well, we have to go find him, mom?
PEG=>You...your father will find him this minute.
BILL=>All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go find him.
HELEN=>Edward! I'm calling the police!
PEG=>All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little cut.
POLICE=>Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands.
PEG=>Oh... Uh...
POLICE=>He's not here. Thank you.
PEG=>Oh, dear.
MARGIE=>Helen, did you actually see him?
HELEN=>Yes, look.
ESMERALDA=>You see, I told you he was a demon.
MARGIE=>Oh, don't start that stuff again.
POLICE=>I'm looking for the man with scissors.
WOMEN=>He went that way. You have to do something about that.
POLICE=>All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle. Just go home.
HELEN=>He's a de... a demon.
WOMEN=>You've got to do something! All right, Let's see. If he's at our house come on, oh...
PEG=>I'm sure your father will find him soon.
KIM=>What time is it?
PEG=>It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?
KIM=>Where are they? God. I hope he's okay!
PEG=>So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us, I really didn't think things through. And I didn't think about what could happen to him, or to us, or to the neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it might be best if he goes back up there. Because at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back to normal.
BILL=>Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see him anywhere.
PEG=>Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the car and go look for him.
BILL=>Where's Kevin now?
PEG=>He's Max'es.
BILL=>Where do you think you're going, young lady?
KIM=>With you guys.
BILL=>No, you're staying here in case somebody shows up!
PEG=>We'll be right back, dear.
EDWARD=>Police!
KIM=>Edward?
EDWARD=>Are you okay?
KIM=>Yes, are you okay?
EDWARD=>Where's everybody?
KIM=>Out looking for you. Hold me.
EDWARD=>I can't.
INVENTOR=>I know it's a little early for Christmas, Edward, but I have a present for you.
JIM=>Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he could do other places.
JIM'S FRIEND=>Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to pass out, or puke or something.
JIM=>Later, first take me to her house.
JIM'S FRIEND=>Come on, don't make me drive.
JIM=>Just do it!
JIM'S FRIEND=>Jesus, maybe she was right about you.
JIM=>Just drive.
JIM'S FRIEND=>Relax.
KEVIN=>See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?
A MAN=>Have they caught him yet?
KEVIN=>Who?
A MAN=>Him, that cripple. Let me know when they do. Let us all you know, okay? Like a good boy.
EDWARD=>Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh!
KEVIN=>Help! Edward help!
EDWARD=>I'm your friend.
KEVIN=>Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help us! Help!
KIM=>Let go of me! Why? Kevin!
PEG AND BILL=>Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened? Edward! Go home! Go home!
PEOPLE=>Somebody call the police! Aah!
KIM=>Jim, stop it. Get off him!
KIM=>Run.
PEG=>Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all right? Let just leave him alone!
POLICE=>Go on, run.
PEOPLE=>What happened? Did you get him? Ok, Is he dead?
POLICE=>It's all over, go on home. There's nothing more to see. What happened out there? It's all over!
PEOPLE=>I want some answers. Where is he?
PEOPLE=>Get back here! I want to ask you something. Do you see him? Wait! I want to ask you... He's in that car. Look at that.
JOYCE=>I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm going! No! That's not a good idea!
EDWARD=>They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin?
KIM=>No, he's okay. He said he was just scared. Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were dead.
JIM=>I didn't.
KIM=>Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself.
JIM=>Hey! I said stay away from her!
EDWARD=>Goodbye!
KIM=>I love you.
A MAN=>Is he in there?
KIM=>He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They killed each other. You can see for yourselves.
OLD KIM=>She never saw him again. Not after that night.
GRANDDAUGHTER=>How do you know?
OLD KIM=>Because I was there.
GRANDDAUGHTER=>You could have gone up there. You still could go.
OLD KIM=>No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would rather want him remember me the way as I was.
GRANDDAUGHTER=>How do you know he's still alive.
OLD KIM=>I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he is. You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up there now, I don't think it would be snowing.
