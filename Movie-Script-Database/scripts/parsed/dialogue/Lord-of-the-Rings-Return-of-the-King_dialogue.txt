DEAGOL=>Smeagol, I've got one! I've got a fish, Smeagol!
SMEAGOL=>Go on, pull it in.
SMEAGOL=>Give us that, Deagol, my love!
DEAGOL=>Why?
SMEAGOL=>Because its my birthday, and I wants it.
SMEAGOL V/0=>They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they called us. They cursed us and drove us away.
GOLLUM=>It's mine! My own. It came to me.
SMEAGOL=>My Precious.
GOLLUM=>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once!
SAM=>Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?
FRODO=>No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
GOLLUM=>Come on, must go, no time ...
SAM=>Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
GOLLUM=>. . . no time to lose, silly.
SAM=>Here.
FRODO=>What about you?
SAM=>I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread.
FRODO=>Sam.
SAM=>Alright. We don't have that much left.
FRODO=>For what?
SAM=>The journey home.
GOLLUM=>Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry! Shhh.
PIPPIN=>I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon, after a hard days work.
MERRY=>Only, you've never done a hard days work.
GIMLI=>You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and smoking.
PIPPIN=>We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good.
GIMLI=>Salted pork?
GANDALF=>Hobbits!
MERRY=>We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard.
TREEBEARD=>Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here ... Locked in his tower.
GANDALF=>And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard.
GIMLI=>Let's just have his head and be done with it. .
GANDALF=>No. He has no power any more.
TREEBEARD=>The filth of Saruman is washing away ... Trees will come back to live here, young trees . . . wild trees.
GANDALF=>Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!
THEODEN=>Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead!
EOWYN=>Westu Aragorn hal.
THEODEN=>I am happy for you.
EOWYN=>You are both honourable men.
THEODEN=>It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
ARAGORN=>No news of Frodo?
GANDALF=>No word ... nothing.
ARAGORN=>We till have time.
GANDALF=>Do we know that?
ARAGORN=>What does your heart tell you?
GANDALF=>That Frodo is alive. Yes - yes, he is alive.
SMEAGOL=>Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them ... kill them both!
GOLLUM=>Shhh! Quiet!
SMEAGOL=>They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
GOLLUM=>And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . . . . . He can do it again.
SMEAGOL=>We must get the Precious. We must get it back.
GOLLUM=>Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.
SMEAGOL=>We lead them to the windy stairs.
GOLLUM=>Yes, the stairs ... and then?
SMEAGOL=>Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . . ... the Tunnel!
GOLLUM=>And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy Orcses.
SMEAGOL=>And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious? .
GOLLUM=>No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . .
SMEAGOL=>And take it for Me!
GOLLUM=>For us . . .
SMEAGOL=>Yes, we, we meant for us . . . Go Hum! Go Hum!
GOLLUM=>The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!
SAM=>, . You treacherous little toad!
GOLLUM=>No! Not! Help! Master!
FRODO=>No, Sam! Leave him alone!
SAM=>I heard it from his own mouth he means to murder us!
SMEAGOL=>Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!
SAM=>You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
FRODO=>Sm. . .
SAM=>Call me a liar! You're a liar!
FRODO=>Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.
SAM=>I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !
FRODO=>I'm not sending him away.
SAM=>You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!
FRODO=>We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.
SAM=>I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.
FRODO=>I know, Sam, I know. You must trust me.
LEGOLAS=>The stars are veiled, something stirs in the east . . . A sleepless malice.
MERRY=>What you doing?
PIPPIN=>I just want to look at it. Just one more time.
MERRY=>Put it back! Put - it - back!
LEGOLAS=>He is here.
MERRY=>Help! Someone help him!
GANDALF=>Fool of a Took!
MERRY=>Pippin!
PIPPIN=>Gandalf! Forgive me.
PIPPIN=>A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!
GANDALF=>Minas Tirith??? Is that what you saw?
PIPPIN=>I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head.
GANDALF=>And what did you tell him? Speak!
PIPPIN=>He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . .
GANDALF=>What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
GANDALF=>There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
THEODEN=>Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
ARAGORN=>I will go.
GANDALF=>No!
ARAGORN=>They must be warned.
GANDALF=>They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another ra ... od Follow the river, look to the black ships. Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
GANDALF=>Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!
PIPPIN=>Where are we going?
MERRY=>Why did you look - why do you always have to look?
MERRY=>You never can.
PIPPIN=>. . . . ,.; I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.
MERRY=>Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks you have the Ring . . . he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here!
PIPPIN=>And you. You're coming with me . . . Merry?
MERRY=>Come on!
PIPPIN=>How far is Minas Tirith?
GANDALF=>Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
MERRY=>Here - something for the road.
PIPPIN=>The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
MERRY=>I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip.
PIPPIN=>But we'11 see each other soon?
MERRY=>I don't know . . . I don't know what's going to happen.
PIPPIN=>Merry?
GANDALF=>Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste.
PIPPIN=>Merry!
ELROND V/0=>Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the Sea . . . The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
ELF ESCORT O.S.=>Lady Arwen?
ELF ESCORT=>We cannot delay.
ELROND=>Arwen?
ARWEN=>You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen.
ELROND=>I looked into your future and I saw death.
ARWEN=>There is also life. ,
ELROND=>That future is almost gone.
ARWEN=>But it is not lost ...
ELROND=>Nothing is certain.
ARWEN=>Some things are certain. If I leave him now I will regret It forever. Ada, it is time.
ARWEN V/0=>Reforge the sword.
ARWEN=>Ada ...
ELROND=>Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
ARWEN=>This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
GANDALF=>We have just passed into the realm of Condor!
GANDALF=>Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
GANDALF=>Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King.
GANDALF=>Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.
DENETHOR=>Perhaps you come to explain this?
GANDALF=>Pippin!
PIPPIN=>I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.
GANDALF=>Get up! My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?
DENETHOR=>You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me.
GANDALF=>Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
DENETHOR=>The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!
GANDALF=>Come.
PIPPIN=>So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?
GANDALF=>You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . . Guard of the Citadel!
PIPPIN=>It's so quiet.
GANDALF=>It's the deep breath before the plunge.
PIPPIN=>I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. L : Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and Sam?
GANDALF=>There never was much hope.
GANDALF V/0=>Our enemy is almost ready, his full strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men as well.
GANDALF=>This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.
GANDALF V/0=>If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.
PIPPIN=>But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
GANDALF V/0=>Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant . . . The one who will lead Mordor's armies in war, the one they say no living man can kill.
GANDALF=>The Witchking of Angmar . . . , . You've met him before . . .
GANDALF V/0=>And Minas Morgul is his lair.
GOLLUM=>The Dead City, very nasty place, full of ... enemies.
SAM=>No, Mr Frodo!
GOLLUM=>Not that way!
SAM=>No!
FRODO=>They're calling me!
GOLLUM=>Hide! Hide!
GANDALF=>We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.
GANDALF V/0=>This war is long planned. Sauron has hated the west through many ages . . . It is a hatred that flows from the depths of time, across the deeps of the Sea.
GOLLUM=>Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!
GANDALF=>The board is set, the pieces are moving.
GANDALF=>Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth!
GOTHMOG=>Quiet!
FARAMIR=>To the river - quick!
GOTHMOG=>Faster!
ORC COMMANDER=>Draw swords!
GANDALF=>Amon Din ... come on . . .
SOLDIER=>The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din is lit!
GANDALF=>Hope is kindled.
ARAGORN=>The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid!
THEODEN=>Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim!
THEODEN=>Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many men as can be found. You have two days ... On the third, we ride for Condor ... and war!
ARAGORN=>You ride with us?
EOWYN=>Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the Court to farewell the men.
THEODEN V/0=>So . . . It is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be decided.
EOMER=>Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to Lord and land!
MADRIL=>We can't hold them. The city is lost!
FARAMIR=>Tell the men to break up. We ride for Minas Tirith.
RANGER=>Nazgul!
FARAMIR=>Take cover!
GOTHMOG=>The age of men is over. The time of the Ore has come.
IORLAS=>Open the Gates! Pull!
FARAMIR=>Mithrandir!
IORLAS=>It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long has he foreseen this doom!
GANDALF=>Foreseen and done nothing!
FARAMIR=>No.
PIPPIN=>You've seen Frodo and Sam?
GANDALF=>Where? When?
FARAMIR=>In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
GANDALF=>. . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
PIPPIN=>What does that mean? What's wrong?
GANDALF=>Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
GOLLUM=>Careful, Master - careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.
GOLLUM=>Come, Master.
SAM=>Mr Frodo!
GOLLUM=>Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?
WITCH KING=>Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all.
GOTHMOG=>What of the Wizard?
WITCH KING=>I shall break him.
G AN DA LF=>Courage is the best defence that you have now.
PIPPIN=>Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me.
DENETHOR=>And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given ...
FARAMIR=>What would you have me do?
DENETHOR=>I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
FARAMIR=>My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
DENETHOR=>Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?
FARAMIR=>You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived?
DENETHOR=>Yes, I wish that.
FARAMIR=>Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead.
DENETHOR=>That will depend on the manner of your return.
SAM=>What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?
SMEAGOL=>Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice.
SAM=>Alright, alright - you just startled me is all. What were you doing?
SMEAGOL=>Sneaking!
SAM=>Fine, have it your own way.
SAM=>It's always dark here -
FRODO=>What? That's all we have left!
SAM=>He took it! He must have!
GOLLUM=>Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!
SAM=>You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?
FRODO=>He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it.
GOLLUM=>What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses! He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not looking!
SAM=>That's a filthy lie!
FRODO=>Sam! Stop it!
SAM=>I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
FRODO=>No, Sam!
SAM=>Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's rest up a bit.
FRODO=>I ' m alright.
SAM=>No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load.
FRODO=>Get away!
SAM=>I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to help!
GOLLUM=>See! See! He wants it for himself.
SAM=>Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.
FRODO=>No, Sam . . . it's you.
SAM=>But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.
FRODO=>You can't help me anymore.
SAM=>You don't mean that.
FRODO=>Go home.
GANDALF=>Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly!
FARAMIR=>Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
GANDALF=>Your father loves you, Faramir! And will remember it before the end.
DENETHOR=>Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
PIPPIN=>Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain.
DENETHOR=>And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!
PIPPIN V/0=>Home is behind, the world ahead, And there are many paths to tread. Through shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow, cloud and shade: All shall fade, all shall fade.
THEODEN=>Grimbold, how many?
GRIMBOLD=>I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord.
ROHAN MARSHALL=>We have three hundred more from Fenmarch, Theoden, King.
DENETHOR=>Where are the riders from Snowbourne?
THEODEN=>Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . .
ARAGORN=>Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
THEODEN=>More will come.
LEGOLAS=>The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..?
EOMER=>They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .
GIMLI=>That road there - where does that lead?
LEGOLAS=>It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door under the mountain.
EOMER=>None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil . . .
GIMLI O.S=>Aragorn!
GIMLI=>Let's find some food.
EOWYN=>There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
MERRY=>Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It isn't even sharp.
EOWYN=>Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.
EOWYN=>To the Smithy .- go!
EOMER=>You should not encourage him.
EOWYN=>And you should not doubt him.
EOMER=>I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach of his arm.
EOWYN=>Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?
GANDALF V/0=>Look to the Black Ships . . .
ARWEN V/0=>I choose a mortal life . . . I wish I could have seen him, one last time ...
GUARD=>King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.
THEODEN=>I take my leave.
ARAGORN=>My Lord, Elrond.
ELROND=>I come on behalf of one whom I love.
ARAGORN=>She stayed?
ELROND=>She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
ARAGORN=>It will not be our end, but his.
ELROND=>You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . .
ARAGORN=>There are none.
ELROND=>There are those who dwell in the mountain.
ARAGORN=>Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one.
ELROND=>They will answer to the King of Condor.
ARAGORN=>Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
ELROND=>The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
