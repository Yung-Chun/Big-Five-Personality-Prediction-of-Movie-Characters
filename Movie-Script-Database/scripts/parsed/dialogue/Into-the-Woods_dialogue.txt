BAKER=>Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods...
BAKER=>And in this village...
BAKER=>... lived a young maiden...
BAKER=>... a care-free young lad...
ANGLE ON JACK=>A spaced-out twelve year-old who is trying to pull his bony cow MILKY-WHITE towards his dilapidated cottage.
BAKER=>... and a childless baker...
BAKER=>... with his Wife-- "
MORE THAN ANYTHING...=>The BAKER takes bread from the oven.
BAKER=>The poor girl's parents had died-- Her two daughters, also blonde, FLORINDA and LUCINDA, appear on the stairwell. They're junior versions of Mom.
FLORINDA LUCINDA=>WHAT, YOU WISH TO GO TO THE
BAKER=>And now she lived with her stepmother...
BAKER=>...who had two daughters of her own. CINDERELLA rises and shyly retreats, but the STEPSISTERS sweep around her menacingly.
PRINCE?!=>They roar in derision.
BAKER=>All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart.
BAKER=>The young lad had no father, and his
BAKER=>Well, she was at her wit's end--
JACK'S MOTHER=>What in heaven's name are you doing with the cow inside the house?
JACK=>I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk.
JACK'S MOTHER=>It's a she! How many times must I tell you? Only shes can give milk!
BAKER=>And then there was a hungry little girl who always wore a red cape... The BAKER turns to see a small hand rise up and snatch one of the BUNS off the counter.
BAKER=>Hey! The BAKER swiftly comes around the counter where a small, plump young girl in a red cape, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD studies the goodies.
STEPSISTERS=>Yes, Mother. They sweep out of the room giggling. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She stands forlornly, studying the mess that awaits her. She closes her eyes and begins to gently sway as if going into a trance.
JACK'S MOTHER'S POV=>Birds flying en masse over their house.
INTO THE POT...=>The BIRDS spread out and begin their task.
JACK=>Bullseye! JACK'S MOTHER was just exiting the house. The CUP falls down, narrowly missing her.
JACK'S MOTHER=>What are you doing? Stop your pretending! She grabs JACK'S sling and pulls him away from the COW.
JACK'S MOTHER=>Now listen to me well, son. Milky-White must be taken to market.
JACK=>Mother, no-- he's the best cow in the
JACK'S MOTHER=>Was. She's been dry for weeks. We've no food or money and no choice but to sell her.
JACK=>But Milky-White is my best friend!
JACK'S MOTHER=>Look at her!
WIFE=>You're certain of your way? As LRRH sings, she begins to help herself to all the buns she can lay her hands on.
HAVE A BASKET?=>The WIFE reaches for a basket, while the BAKER tries to wrest away a bun or two from the girl.
BAKER=>I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these? The WIFE gives the BAKER a look, then hands LRRH a basket.
WIFE=>Now, don't stray and be late!
BAKER=>And you might save some of those sweets for Granny.
KNOW, SHE'S ALREADY DEAD.=>Her path takes her through an ancient GRAVEYARD and on towards the forest's edge.
LUCINDA=>Cinderella!
FLORINDA=>Get up here!
LUCINDA=>We are waiting!
LUCINDA=>(pointing to her
CINDERELLA!=>LUCINDA eyes FLORINDA'S hair.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.=>She stands on the stool and begins fixing FLORINDA'S hair.
FLORINDA=>I know.
LUCINDA=>She means me.
FLORINDA=>No, she didn't! The two STEPSISTERS bicker as CINDERELLA brushes and twists their hair into tight curls:
FLORINDA=>Tighter! CINDERELLA obliges and becomes more aggressive with the hair styling, her emotions building as she thinks to herself:
NICE--=>FLORINDA screams, bringing CINDERELLA back to reality.
FLORINDA=>Ow! Not that tight! Clod! She reels around and smacks CINDERELLA who stands stunned. The STEPSISTERS giggle and snort.
BAKER=>Who might that be?
WIFE=>We have no bread.
WITCH=>I don't want your bread.
BAKER=>Then what is it you wish?
WITCH=>It's not what I wish. It's what you wish. She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her belly.
WITCH=>Nothing cooking in that belly now, is there? And there will never be... She looks away.
WITCH=>Unless you do exactly as I say. In three days' time, a Blue Moon will appear. Only then can the curse be undone.
WIFE=>What curse?
WITCH=>The one I placed on this house!
BAKER=>What are you talking about?
WITCH=>In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was--
WITCH'S POV=>In the moonlight, we see the BAKER'S FATHER, wearing a hunting jacket, scale over the WITCH'S wall and into her garden. From behind a wooden trellis, she WATCHES him as he gathers her greens:
BAKER=>I had a brother?
WITCH=>No. But you had a sister.
BAKER=>Where is she?
WITCH=>She's mine now and you'll never find her! Small price to pay for what else your father stole from me. It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them.
WIFE=>Lost what?
BAKER/WIFE=>Beans?
STOLEN MY BEANS!=>WITCH'S POV - the BAKER'S FATHER scales his way back over the garden wall.
LIGHTNING FLASH!/=>Lights suddenly illuminate the BAKER'S FATHER as if it was a flash from the Hiroshima blast. A look of horror crosses his face.
BAKER=>How could you do that to me?
WITCH=>And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be?
BAKER=>I'm so sorry...
AND QUEENS:=>The WITCH grabs some magical looking beans from a SMALL SATCHEL she carries across her body. She displays them.
JACK=>Why do I have to go to the next village?
JACK'S MOTHER=>Because everyone in this village knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks.
JACK=>But that's cheating.
JACK'S MOTHER=>We're starving, Jack. Don't you understand that? You're not to take less than five pounds for her. Are you listening to me?
JACK'S MOTHER=>How much are you to ask?
JACK=>No more than five pounds. She grabs his ear and squeezes it hard.
JACK'S MOTHER JACK=>Less! Than five. ... than five!
STEPMOTHER=>Ladies. Our carriage awaits! CINDERELLA darts out of the house holding out the bowl of lentils to her STEPMOTHER.
STEPMOTHER=>The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!/
CINDERELLA=>The festival lasts three nights. Surely you can let me be there for one of them.
STEPMOTHER=>The King is trying to find his son a wife -- not a scullery maid! We must be gone!
WIFE=>Here. Take this...
BAKER=>I'm not wearing that.
WIFE=>Why?
BAKER=>It was my father's. You heard what she said. This is all his fault. The BAKER throws the jacket to the ground.
BAKER=>I want nothing to do with him! The WIFE sees that BEANS have spilled out of the pocket.
WIFE=>Look! She picks them up.
WIFE=>Beans. The Witch's beans! We'll take them with us.
WIFE=>I can help you.
BAKER=>No. I can do this on my own.
BAKER=>Now tell me. What am I to return with?
WIFE=>You don't remember?!
WIFE CINDERELLA=>I KNOW -- I'LL VISIT MOTHER'S
WIFE=>(giving him a little
THERE--=>All THREE of them stop with sudden trepidation.
TO MAKE THE POTION--=>QUICK INTERCUTS between the characters:
THE FESTIVAL--!=>The CAMERA slowly rises through the trees as the vast forest swallows up our intrepid travellers.
BAKER=>Deep within the woods, Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her mother. And she visited there so often, and wept so much, that her tears watered it until it had become a magnificent tree. CINDERELLA kneels in prayer.
I WISH...=>She begins to cry.
MUSIC.=>In the reflection, CINDERELLA sees the tree slowly twist and turn taking on the shape of her MOTHER, who looks down upon her.
C'S MOTHER=>What is it that you wish, child? CINDERELLA looks up to see her MOTHER in the tree.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>The wind now blowing the willow tree, its LEAVES begin to rain down on CINDERELLA, turning gold and silver as they swirl around her, transforming her clothes into a beautiful gown. CINDERELLA looks down to see that she is now wearing a pair of shoes literally made of gold leaf. When she looks back up, the tree has now returned to its former shape.
CINDERELLA=>Thank you, Mother. She dashes into the woods.
BAKER=>On her path to Granny's, the little girl suddenly found herself in a very unusual part of the wood.
WOLF'S POV=>Branches and leaves rush by in a blur. Suddenly, the CAMERA stops, and in the distance we see LRRH strolling down a path of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY BREATHING. The CAMERA continues stalking its prey, moving closer towards LRRH through the brush. ANGLE on LRRH, as she continues walking and eating.
WOLF=>Good day, young lady. She turns around and what she sees - through a CHILD'S EYES - is a super-slick, good-looking guy. What she doesn't notice is his curiously low hairline, something of a snout, and a tail peeking from his waistcoat.
LRRH=>Good day, Mr. Wolf.
WOLF=>Whither away so hurriedly?
LRRH=>To my Grandmother's.
WOLF=>And what might be in your basket?
LRRH=>It's bread for Grandmother so she'll have something good to make her strong.
WOLF=>And where might your Grandmother live?
ONE'S ESPECIALLY LUSH,/ DELICIOUS...=>With inhuman speed, he manages to suddenly be back in front of the girl on the path.
YOU'RE TRAVELLING SO FLEETLY.=>He drops behind again, thinking to himself.
SUPPLE--=>Racing ahead and then darting out from a tree.
YOU'RE IGNORING...=>He ushers LRRH off the path to a lush meadow blanketed with exquisite purple flowers and wild berries.
MEAL!=>The WOLF picks a flower and hands it to LRRH.
WOLF=>For Granny.
WOLF=>Goodbye, little girl./ AND HELLO... The WOLF climbs to the top of a precipice where he is silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl.
WITCH=>Why are you standing there?! Go get the cape!
BAKER=>You frightened me! The WITCH swings to the ground.
WITCH=>Get it! Get it! Get it!
BAKER=>How am I supposed to get it?
WITCH=>You go up to the little thing, and you take it.
BAKER=>I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it!
WITCH=>It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects! We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound, swoons with delight. Then:
BAKER=>This is ridiculous! ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over to her.
BAKER=>Hello there little girl.
LRRH=>Hello, Mr. Baker.
BAKER=>Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny?
LRRH=>I ate all the sweets and half the loaf of bread.
BAKER=>So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape?
LRRH=>My Granny made it for me.
BAKER=>Is that right? I would love a red cape like that.
BAKER=>May I take a look at it? He quickly unties it.
LRRH=>No!
BAKER=>I need it badly.
LRRH=>Please -- give it back! They have a tug of war. The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream. ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done, then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her shoulders.
BAKER=>I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way.
LRRH=>I would rather a wolf than you any day. LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot.
BAKER=>What are you doing here? The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket.
WIFE=>You forgot your scarf.
BAKER=>You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods!
WIFE=>I want to help. She goes to tie the WOOL SCARF around his neck but he pulls away.
BAKER=>No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE--
BOTH=>... milk. The WIFE pushes the BAKER in JACK'S direction, then follows.
BAKER=>Hello there, young lad.
JACK=>Hello, sir.
BAKER=>What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest?
JACK=>I was heading toward market -- but I seem to have lost my way.
BAKER=>And what are you planning to do there?
JACK=>Sell my cow, sir. No less than five pounds.
BAKER=>Five pounds!
WIFE=>She must be generous of milk to fetch five pounds?
WIFE=>And if you can't fetch that sum? Then what are you to do?
JACK=>I hadn't thought of that...
WIFE=>Beans? We mustn't give up our beans! Well, if you feel we must...
BAKER=>Huh?
JACK=>Beans in exchange for my cow?
WIFE=>Oh, these are no ordinary beans, son. These beans carry...magic.
JACK=>Magic? What kind of magic?
BAKER=>Magic that defies description.
JACK=>How many beans?
BAKER=>Six.
WIFE=>Five!
JACK=>Could I buy my cow back someday?
WIFE=>Yes.
BAKER=>...possibly. Here. He hands JACK the five beans, carefully dropping them one at a time into the boy's hand. The WIFE quickly takes the SIXTH BEAN and puts it in her pocket.
BAKER=>Good luck there, young lad. As the BAKER takes the cow's leash, JACK wraps his arms around the bony animal.
JACK=>One day, I'll buy you back -- Promise! JACK kisses the cow. The BAKER looks to his WIFE guiltily. Overcome with emotion, JACK runs back into the woods.
BAKER=>Take the cow and go home!
WIFE=>I was just trying to help.
BAKER=>Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit?
WIFE=>No one would have given him more for this creature. We did him a favor. At least they'll have some food.
BAKER=>Five beans?!
WIFE=>Do we want a child or not?
BAKER=>Of course. But...
WIFE=>We have one chance. Don't you see that? And if we fail...
BAKER=>I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father.
WIFE=>Why do you say that?
BAKER=>Because of my father.
WIFE=>You're not him.
BAKER=>I don't know...
WIFE=>If you can't do this for yourself, can't you at least do it for me?
BAKER=>All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own. The BAKER walks away.
R-PRINCE POV=>An exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose bushes, with no entryway, just a lone window at its peak. At the bottom of the tower, the WITCH looks upward:
WITCH=>Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair to me. The PRINCE, hiding within the brush.
R'S PRINCE=>Rapunzel... At the window, the gorgeous young blonde girl, RAPUNZEL proceeds to lower the longest stretch of hair you've ever seen. The WITCH scales up the tower.
BAKER=>The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince."
R'S PRINCE=>Rapunzel... The PRINCE dashes back to his horse and gallops off. The WITCH arrives at the window.
WITCH=>Don't you look lovely today, my dear.
RAPUNZEL=>Thank you, Mother.
WITCH=>I brought your favorite. Blackberries, fresh from the garden.
BAKER=>As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open.
LRRH=>Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps it's all the sweets.
LRRH=>Granny?
WOLF=>Come in, my deary. LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe.
LRRH=>My, Grandmother. You're looking very strange. What big ears you have!
WOLF=>The better to hear you with, my dear. The handsome WOLF flashes a smile that reveals a set of gleaming white FANGS.
BAKER=>And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both.
BAKER=>I can't believe I just did that. LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him.
GRANNY=>Aren't you going to help us skin that beast?
BAKER=>No thanks!
GRANNY=>What kind of hunter are you?
BAKER=>I'm a baker.
LRRH=>Wait a minute. I never thanked you.
BAKER=>You need to be more careful, young lady.
LRRH=>I'm sorry. I should have known better.
EXCITED AND SCARED.=>LRRH relives her nightmare.
WELL, EXCITED AND SCARED./=>LRRH grabs hold of the bed curtains and pulls them around herself.
KNOW,/=>She lands and sees a blurry form in the distance before realizing it is GRANNY.
AND SET US FREE,=>LRRH POV -- A crack of light widens until it's clear that she is seeing a KNIFE opening the WOLF'S STOMACH that creates the blinding light. The BAKER'S EYE peeks through the slit.
HOOD,=>She takes off her cape.
GOOD.=>Mr. Baker. You saved our lives. Here. LRRH hands him the cape.
BAKER=>Are you certain?
LRRH=>Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another with the skins of the wolf.
BAKER=>Thank you. Thank you! Impulsively he gives her a kiss on the cheek and as he leaves, the girl wipes it off.
LRRH=>Yuck!
JACK=>But they're magic -- the man said --
JACK'S MOTHER=>Get your head out of the clouds! She angrily THROWS the beans to the ground.
JACK=>Mother -- no! She turns to grab JACK'S ear, failing to see the electric sparks that flare when the beans strike the ground.
JACK'S MOTHER=>You and your worthless adventures! Will you never learn, Jack?! To bed without supper for you! She storms away. JACK lies on his bed bereft. He sees his sling on the floor and picks it up cradling it as he closes his eyes. THE CAMERA travels to a hole in the wall and looks below to see five bean stalks already growing and intertwining, quickly reaching skyward.
BAKER=>The first night of the festival ball brought Cinderella her wish. The Prince danced only with her, `til he turned and she had slipped away. Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.
C'S PRINCE=>I must find that girl!
WIFE=>Are you alright, miss?
WIFE=>What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue on her way.
CINDERELLA=>Yes.
WIFE=>Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.
STEWARD=>This way!
CINDERELLA=>Please. Don't let them know I'm here. She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls down to the WIFE.
C'S PRINCE=>Have you seen a beautiful young woman in a ball gown pass through?
WIFE=>(Breathless as she
BOWS)=>I don't think so, sir.
WIFE=>I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before!
CINDERELLA=>Thank you.
WIFE=>If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide.
CINDERELLA=>Well, what brings you here -- and with a cow?
WIFE=>Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods.
WIFE=>Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what was he like?
WELL, HE'S TALL.=>The WIFE sits down next to CINDERELLA admiring her dress as they chat.
WIFE=>But why would you run away?
CINDERELLA=>It's not quite what I expected.
WIFE=>Princes, castles, gowns...
CINDERELLA=>I have no experience with those things. We hear the far off CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT from the castle.
WIFE=>But you will return to the Festival tomorrow eve?
CINDERELLA=>Yes... No... I don't know...
WIFE=>You don't know? What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes. (looking to her
SHOES)=>...I mean your slippers.
CINDERELLA=>I must get home. CINDERELLA runs off.
WIFE=>Wait! I need your shoes! The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken off.
WIFE=>Milky-White! The WITCH appears from nowhere.
WITCH=>One midnight gone!
WIFE=>Already?!
WITCH=>Get that cow! The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across the face of the MOON.
JACK=>Good fortune! Good fortune, sir! Look what I have! Five gold pieces.
SKY!=>JACK throws him the bag and begins to scale up the root of the tree.
BAKER=>A giant?
JACK=>So, here's your money, sir! Five gold pieces. Where is my Milky-White?
JACK=>Let's go find them! JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along.
BAKER=>Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell.
JACK=>But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money?
BAKER=>No, no, no! It's not that--
BAKER=>Wait. I didn't say-- But JACK doesn't wait to listen. Taking the EMPTY SACK, he runs off excitedly.
BAKER=>Hey, come back!
BAKER=>What are you doing here?
WIFE=>Well... She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE.
WIFE=>I see you've got the red cape!
BAKER=>Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left.
BAKER=>Two. We've the cape and the cow.
BAKER=>What have you done with the cow?!
WIFE=>She ran away. I never reached home. I've been looking for her all night.
WIFE=>She might just as easily have run from you!
BAKER=>But she didn't!
BAKER=>We were just going to do that. Here. He climbs towards her with the cape.
BAKER=>You can have this--
BAKER=>I don't like that woman.
WIFE=>I'm sorry I lost the cow.
BAKER=>I shouldn't have yelled. Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls. The BAKER'S WIFE starts to speak.
BAKER=>GO!, please -- go. She goes.
R'S PRINCE=>Good brother. I was wondering where you'd gone.
C'S PRINCE=>I have been looking all night for her.
R'S PRINCE=>Her?
C'S PRINCE=>The beautiful one I danced the evening with.
R'S PRINCE=>Where did she go?
C'S PRINCE=>Disappeared, like the fine morning mist.
R'S PRINCE=>She was lovely?
C'S PRINCE=>The loveliest. They dismount and walk their horses through the forest.
R'S PRINCE=>I am not certain of that! I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden. She lives here in the woods.
R'S PRINCE=>Yes! In the top of a tall tower that has no door or stairs.
C'S PRINCE=>Where?
R'S PRINCE=>Two leagues from here, due east, just beyond the mossy knoll near the rose thickets.
C'S PRINCE=>And how do you manage a visit?
R'S PRINCE=>I stand beneath her tower and say, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me." And then she lowers the longest, most beautiful head of hair - yellow as corn - which I climb. The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off.
C'S PRINCE=>Rapunzel, Rapunzel! What kind of name is that? You jest! I have never heard of such a thing.
R'S PRINCE=>I speak the truth! She is as true as your maiden. A maiden running from a prince? None would run from us.
C'S PRINCE=>Yet one has. The PRINCES lead their horses to a stream that cascades into a magnificent waterfall.
WIFE=>Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side.
WIFE=>(in her best princely
BASS VOICE)=>Yes. RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair. The WIFE approaches it gingerly.
WIFE=>Excuse me for this. She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing. She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling some of the hair from her head.
BAKER=>As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in pursuit. SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through wooded path. ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit. The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S attention.
C'S PRINCE=>Over here! CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the ground. CINDERELLA rushes off. The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short, rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into thickets.
C'S PRINCE=>Who is she? Where did she go?
C'S PRINCE=>Don't play the fool, woman!
WIFE=>I was trying to hold her here for you...
C'S PRINCE=>I can capture my own damsel, thank you.
WIFE=>Yes, of course. The STEWARD returns, covered in burrs and looking none too happy.
STEWARD=>No sign of her, my liege.
C'S PRINCE=>Well, what are you waiting for? See if you can find her. The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over.
C'S PRINCE=>The woods can be a dangerous place... She nods to him, out of her depth. He gallops off.
BAKER=>Moo... Moo...... He HEARS sounds off in the distance.
BAKER'S POV=>The STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed opening in the base of a huge tree. We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair bobbing animatedly.
ANOTHER ANGLE=>The BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard.
BAKER=>Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? The STEPSISTERS scream.
STEPMOTHER=>Mongrel! Carry on! She pushes the BAKER off the carriage and he somersaults backwards into the brush. The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock. There is a muffled "Moo..." He jumps up realizing he's been SITTING on the cow.
BAKER=>Milky-White! He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it is his WIFE, he steps out.
BAKER=>I thought you were returning home! The WIFE screams in fright. Then she recognizes him.
WIFE=>Oh! It's you! And you've the cow! She runs to MILKY-WHITE.
WIFE=>Three.
BAKER=>Two.
WIFE=>Three! She shows him the braid of hair around her neck.
WIFE=>Compare this to your corn. He does and it's a perfect match.
BAKER=>Where did you find it?
BAKER=>Three!
WIFE=>And I almost had the fourth, but she got away.
BAKER=>We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then.
WIFE=>We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you?
BAKER=>Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child.
MORE AND WE'RE DONE./=>They sit down next to each other at the top of a small hill and slide down to the bottom together.
JACK=>Stop it! Stop my egg! The BAKER stops the egg and picks it up. JACK stumbles down the hill.
JACK=>Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg!
BAKER=>Where did you get this?
JACK=>From the Giant's hen! The BAKER'S WIFE examines the egg.
WIFE=>A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg.
JACK=>And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces.
WIFE=>Five gold pieces?
JACK=>Now I'm taking my cow. JACK moves to MILKY-WHITE. The distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin to ring out from the castle.
=>Now, I never said I would But you took the five gold sell. pieces.
WIFE BAKER=>You took five gold pieces?! I didn't take, you gave.
WIFE=>Where are the five gold pieces?
JACK=>You said I could have my cow!
BAKER WIFE=>Now I never said you could. I You would take money before a said you might. child?!
BAKER=>No, no, no - it's not how it sounds!
BAKER=>When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower.
RAPUNZEL=>No, no, please!
RAPUNZEL=>No!
RAPUNZEL=>No!
RAPUNZEL=>No!
RAPUNZEL=>I'm no longer a child. I wish to see the world.
WITCH=>I gave you protection and yet you disobeyed me.
RAPUNZEL=>No!
WITCH=>Your prince will never lay eyes on you again. He will never lay eyes on anything again!
RAPUNZEL=>What did you do to him?
WITCH=>It doesn't matter because where you're going, no one will ever see you again. The WITCH lunges at RAPUNZEL with a pair of SHEARS and begins to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek.
GOLDEN EGG.=>He comes across what looks like a WOLF, hunched over on the edge of the brush. He stops... then slowly approaches.
JACK=>Hey there - nice cape! The figure twists around, pulling a knife.
LRRH=>Stay away from my cape or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!
JACK=>Whoa! I don't want it.
LRRH=>My Granny made it for me from a wolf that attacked us. And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.
JACK=>Well, look what I have! A golden egg. He shows her his GOLDEN EGG.
JACK=>I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant.
LRRH=>I don't believe you.
JACK=>It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it.
JACK=>I could.
LRRH=>You could not!
JACK=>I could!
LRRH=>You could not, Mr. Liar!
JACK=>I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see! He runs off.
BAKER=>Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant. Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree. JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.
BAKER=>We've only one day left! I don't know where to start.
WIFE=>You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy.
BAKER=>Right, where do I buy a cow?
WIFE=>You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there.
BAKER=>What are you going to do?
WIFE=>I'm going to get the slipper.
BAKER=>The yellow slipper?
WIFE=>The GOLDEN slipper!
BAKER=>Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it?
WIFE=>I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights.
BAKER=>You think you could get one?
WIFE=>Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here.
BAKER=>Right.
WIFE=>Because we have to if we're going to be together... The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet and look to one another.
WIFE=>What is happening?
BAKER=>The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant...
BAKER=>...as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck. ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally trapped his prey. We FREEZE the action as CINDERELLA considers the situation.
SHOES.=>CINDERELLA lifts her feet out of the shoes and moves to a step with no tar. She pulls one shoe from the tar, and as she goes to pry the second shoe, she stops.
STEPS OF THE PALACE!=>Coming out of the freeze, she quickly leaves one shoe and slips on the other, then dashes off out of sight. The PRINCE picks up the golden shoe from the tar and holds it up triumphantly. He addresses his STEWARD and RETINUE.
C'S PRINCE=>The ball is over. Send everyone home.
STEWARD=>And the Princess?
C'S PRINCE=>She won't get far with one shoe.
CINDERELLA=>Don't come any closer to me!
WIFE=>Please, stop! Just hear me out!
CINDERELLA=>You have attacked me once before.
WIFE=>I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean in exchange for it. Breathless, CINDERELLA stops. Stands defensively. The WIFE pulls out the bean from her pocket and hands it to her.
CINDERELLA=>Magic bean? Nonsense! CINDERELLA tosses it over her shoulder, but they don't see the SPARKS it sets off when it hits the ground and sinks into the earth. She starts to leave.
WIFE=>Wait, please. I haven't much time!
CINDERELLA=>That makes no sense!
WIFE=>Does it make sense that you're running from a prince? The STEWARD approaches on HORSEBACK.
STEWARD=>Stop! You there, stop!
CINDERELLA=>I must go!
WIFE=>(starts to take off a
SHOE)=>Take my shoes. You'll run faster.
HERE--=>CINDERELLA hands the WIFE her GOLDEN SLIPPER.
WIFE=>Thank you! Thank you! CINDERELLA dashes off.
WIFE=>It's mine.
STEWARD=>Lying will cost you your life! The STEWARD snatches the shoe. The WIFE pushes the Steward and grabs the slipper back.
STEWARD=>You will pay for this!
STEWARD=>Sire! I have succeeded in obtaining the other slipper. He holds it up. The WIFE steps forward.
WIFE=>Please give me the slipper, kind Prince, and all will come to a happy end.
C'S PRINCE=>Do as she says, Steward. We only need one.
STEWARD=>Oh... He hands the slipper back to the WIFE. The STEWARD gets onto his horse.
WIFE=>Thank you. Thank you!
C'S PRINCE=>This very night! The PRINCE, STEWARD and RETINUE ride off, leaving the WIFE alone. She looks up to the moon and hurries off. We follow the WIFE'S feet as she scurries past the beginnings of a BEANSTALK CURLING UPWARDS from the ground.
BAKER=>And in her haste, the Baker's Wife took no notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.
STEWARD=>Let it be known that his Royal Highness the Crown Prince will be visiting every house in this village tonight.
STEWARD=>All young maidens are hereby commanded to remain in their home until they are visited by the Royal Guard. CINDERELLA goes to the window and looks out.
BAKER=>As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands.
NEVER NEED TO WALK!=>The STEPMOTHER takes a handkerchief and stuffs it into the girl's mouth and then pulls a large kitchen knife from her pocket and raises it over her foot--
BAKER=>Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs sheepishly.
BAKER=>Lucinda was next.
QUICK SHOTS:=>FLORINDA'S hand over LUCINDA'S mouth. The KNIFE raised up by the mother. LUCINDA'S eyes in fear as we hear a muffled scream and the "WOOSH" of a knife--
BAKER=>Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and
STEPMOTHER=>It's a perfect fit, Your Highness! LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.
C'S PRINCE=>Have you no other daughters?
STEPMOTHER=>Only a little stunted kitchen wench, which her late father left behind but she cannot present herself. She is too dirty. Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears. The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.
C'S PRINCE=>I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere. This is the true bride! The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to his horse. The two of them ride off. FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear a CAWING overhead. They look up, alarmed. BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together, dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them.
BAKER=>As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are all we see.
BAKER=>As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse. The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing.
R'S PRINCE=>Rapunzel? Rapunzel?
ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL=>She looks up and cries with delight when she sees her PRINCE across the water.
RAPUNZEL=>My darling! She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES, until she reaches terra firma and her man. R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground.
R'S PRINCE=>Rapunzel? Is it you? RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to cradle his face, weeping.
RAPUNZEL=>How could she do this to you? EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S blind eye. The PRINCE'S vision is restored.
RAPUNZEL=>What?
R'S PRINCE=>I can see you! The two of them embrace. At the same time, we hear MOOING.
BAKER=>Come on! We don't have any time... Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying the
WIFE=>I've found you! You've got the cow!
BAKER=>You've got the slipper!
WIFE=>We've all four! They hug with delight but are quickly startled by the WITCH who appears in the hollow of a tree.
WITCH=>I see a cow. I see a slipper.
BAKER=>And the cape as red as blood.
WIFE=>And the hair as yellow as corn.
BAKER=>We've done it!
WIFE=>We've got them all. But suddenly the WITCH is suspicious.
WITCH=>Wait a minute!
WIFE=>Of course she is. A desperate glance at the BAKER. He couldn't have screwed this up -- could he?
WIFE=>She has to be! The WITCH walks over and smacks the animal. Flour puffs off its back.
WITCH=>This cow has been covered with flour!
WIFE=>What? You didn't get a real white cow? The BAKER turns to the WITCH.
BAKER=>We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did.
WITCH=>Then where is she?
WIFE=>She's dead.
BAKER=>And we thought you'd prefer a live cow.
WITCH=>Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So show me the dead cow and I'll bring her back to life!
JACK'S MOTHER=>Jack! There you are! I've been worried sick about you! There's a dead giant in our backyard!
JACK=>There is?
JACK'S MOTHER=>You know there is. You could have been crushed!
JACK=>But Mother, look. The most beautiful harp.
JACK'S MOTHER=>You could have been killed coming down that plant. The WITCH, the BAKER and the WIFE hurry towards the leafy mound.
WIFE=>We're running out of time!
BAKER=>It's here...
JACK=>What's happening?
BAKER=>She's going to bring Milky-White back to life.
BAKER=>She's a witch! She can do anything!
JACK=>Wow!
WITCH=>Stand back! They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape, the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves. JACK races over to her.
JACK=>Milky-White. You're back! I missed you so much! The BAKER looks up at the MOON...only a slither left, the rest covered by SHADOW.
BAKER=>It's almost midnight!
WITCH=>Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.
WIFE=>What?
WITCH=>You heard me! Feed them to the cow! The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the animal. The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.
WITCH=>Fill this!
JACK=>I'll do it. She'll only milk for me. JACK begins milking the cow, the others watching intently, but alas, nothing is coming out.
JACK=>Squeeze, pal! You can do it.
WITCH=>Wrong ingredients. Forget about a child!
WIFE=>Wait! We followed your instructions. One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?
WITCH=>Yes.
WIFE=>And two, the cape was certainly as red as blood.
WITCH=>Yes.
WIFE=>And three, the slipper--
WITCH=>Yes.
BAKER=>And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn.
WIFE=>I pulled it from a maiden in a tower
WITCH=>You what?! What were you doing there?
WIFE=>Well, nothing. I happened to be
WITCH=>I touched that hair! I told you! I cannot have touched the ingredients!
JACK=>The corn! The corn!
BAKER=>What? JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.
JACK=>You can use the silky hair of the corn--
WITCH=>Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly! The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair from the corn and feeds it to the cow. JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin. Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN.
WIFE=>It's working!
JACK=>She's milking! The WITCH grabs the chalice.
WITCH=>At last! The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek.. The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine- months-full of pregnancy.
BAKER=>That was quick! The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has been restored to her former self, and she likes what she sees. The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:
BAKER=>And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd. She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over- dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous "fascinator" hat.
BAKER=>Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.
BAKER=>And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. The WIFE shows her the BABY.
WIFE=>Thanks for the slipper. The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met by cheers. The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum. RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE. The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave. The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD quiets.
STEWARD=>Let us cheer the newlyweds as they embark on their happy bliss today, and
BAKER=>And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever...
JACK'S MOTHER=>Jack? Jack...? ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE.
WIFE=>I think so.
BAKER=>And the baby?
WIFE=>Yes, he's fine. There is another AFTERSHOCK. ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs off through the crowd and disappears.
STEWARD=>(speaking into the
HORN)=>Attention! Attention! Let there be no panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince wishes to address his loyal subjects. Attention! The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the horn.
C'S PRINCE=>There's no need for worry. It was an earthquake in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all. As many of you know, we had another little shaker just days ago. I will personally investigate the disturbance. Now everyone, back to your villages, and on with your lives!
BAKER=>But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn.
WIFE=>What's happened? Everything's so different. They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a lush area, now trampled and broken.
BAKER=>Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase?
LRRH=>I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. And now I can't find my Granny's cottage.
BAKER=>What do you mean?
LRRH=>I went down the dell, and I didn't recognize anything. There was no path. Where's the stream? Where's the bridge? Where's Granny?
WIFE=>Calm down.
BAKER=>We can help you find Granny's without the path.
WIFE=>Yes. The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.
WIFE=>Please take him for a few moments. The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.
BAKER=>Why does he always cry when I hold him?
WIFE=>You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.
BAKER=>He doesn't want me. He wants his mother!
WIFE=>I can't take care of him all of the time.
BAKER=>I'll take care of him -- when he's older... They hear COMMOTION in the distance.
WIFE=>Who might that be?
BAKER=>It's the Steward and the royal family.
BAKER=>What brings you into the woods?
STEWARD=>The castle has been destroyed.
WIFE=>No!
STEPMOTHER=>The kingdom is under attack.
BAKER=>What is the Royal family going to do?
STEWARD=>I have no idea! I don't make policy. I just carry it out.
WIFE=>I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. She holds out a hand for LRRH.
WIFE=>You come with us. LRRH takes her hand. But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their footing. The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other. The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE. Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs them.
WIFE=>It's a giant!
BAKER=>A giant woman! Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT. We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her voice matches her size.
GIANT=>Where is the lad who killed my husband?
STEWARD=>There is no lad here!
BAKER=>We haven't seen him. The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.
WITCH=>We'll get him for you right away. Don't move! LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.
LRRH=>It was you who destroyed our house - not an earthquake.
GIANT=>And who destroyed my house? I want him! A great bellow that makes the trees shake. The WITCH moves towards the STEPSISTERS.
WITCH=>Would you like a blind girl instead?
STEPMOTHER=>How dare you? She wants the boy! And then JACK'S MOTHER arrives. Innocently, she asks the worst question possible.
JACK'S MOTHER=>Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran off again and I've been... Everyone stares at her. JACK'S MOTHER does a slow take looking up and discovering the GIANT.
STEWARD=>She's looking for him too.
GIANT=>Give him to me! The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of the way. JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.
JACK'S MOTHER=>Jack is just a lad! We had no food to eat so he sold his beloved cow in exchange for magic beans.
GIANT=>The boy - I want the boy!
JACK'S MOTHER=>You leave my boy alone!
GIANT=>You're making me very angry! The GIANT stomps her foot in anger.
GIANT=>I'm waiting! They all lose their balance. The STEWARD uses his staff to hold JACK'S MOTHER back, trying to silence her.
STEWARD=>Don't make her angry, woman, or you'll get us all killed! But JACK'S MOTHER is in full flow, facing up to the GIANT.
STEWARD=>Stop!
BAKER=>Don't upset the Giant!
JACK'S MOTHER=>You big bully! I'll hide my son and you'll never find him. You'll never, ever...
STEWARD=>Get back woman! The STEWARD forcefully pulls JACK'S MOTHER behind him. She trips and falls.
STEWARD=>The boy is hiding in the steeple tower. You can find him there.
STEPMOTHER=>Yes, that's true.
FLORINDA LUCINDA=>Yes. The steeple tower. We saw him there!
GIANT=>If he is not, I will return tonight and find you! All of you! The GIANT takes off, the power of her footsteps forcing everyone to hold on to one another for safety. The BAKER'S WIFE sees JACK'S MOTHER, who is still lying on the ground. She goes to her.
WIFE=>Look! What have you done to her?
STEWARD=>I didn't mean to hurt her. I was just thinking of the greater good. The BAKER steps forward, taking charge.
BAKER=>Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together.
WITCH=>Not always. The STEPFAMILY leaves.
WITCH=>I don't know where they think they're going. The giant's already destroyed the entire village. Only thing left of my garden are these beans.
LRRH=>What are we going to do now?
WITCH=>We have no choice. Find the boy and give her what she wants.
LRRH=>But if we do, she'll kill Jack.
WITCH=>And if we don't she'll kill half the kingdom! She rushes back into the woods.
JACK'S MOTHER=>Promise me you won't let them get Jack. Promise!
BAKER=>Okay, I promise.
WITCH=>Rapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness.
RAPUNZEL=>Who are you?
WITCH=>Surely you remember?
WITCH=>This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you don't have to be embarrassed by me. You must come with me. There's a Giant in the land. She moves towards RAPUNZEL -- but suddenly the R-PRINCE rides up on his white steed. He jumps off and rushes to RAPUNZEL.
R'S PRINCE=>My darling. Are you all right? Why did you run off?
RAPUNZEL=>I was afraid.
R-PRINCE=>You never have to be afraid. Now come with me.
WITCH=>She's not going with you!
RAPUNZEL=>I will not come with you!
WITCH=>Then you leave me no choice. The WITCH pulls RAPUNZEL behind her and tries to cast a spell on R'S PRINCE. Nothing. She tries again. Still nothing. The PRINCE takes notice of the Witch.
R'S PRINCE=>You! The one who blinded me.
RAPUNZEL=>...and then banished me to an island -- in the middle of a swamp!
WITCH=>I was just trying to be a good mother!
WITCH=>Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him.
RAPUNZEL=>Take me away from here. R-PRINCE pulls RAPUNZEL up onto his horse.
WITCH=>No! Rapunzel!
RAPUNZEL=>Don't you understand? I never want to see you again. Ever! ANGLE ON THE WITCH watching RAPUNZEL ride into the woods.
LRRH=>Jack! Then the BAKER, the BAKER'S WIFE and LRRH appear, still looking for JACK. They come to a halt.
BAKER=>We're never going to find him.
WIFE=>We should fan out. It'll increase our chances.
BAKER=>No. You can't be on your own.
WIFE=>I'll be all right.
BAKER=>What if we get lost?
WIFE=>We'll count our steps from right here.
LRRH=>I'll go, too.
WIFE=>No. You stay with the baby. The WIFE hands LRRH the baby and sits her down.
BAKER=>You would leave our son with her?
WIFE=>Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl.
WIFE=>See?
BAKER=>But what if the Giant comes back...
WIFE=>What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! The WIFE turns and starts walking.
WIFE=>One, two... The BAKER stops her. He unties his SCARF.
BAKER=>Wait! Take this. It might be cold.
WIFE=>One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled;
C'S PRINCE=>Hello.
WIFE=>You must be here to slay the Giant.
C'S PRINCE=>The Giant?
WIFE=>Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst.
C'S PRINCE=>Of course. A giant.
WIFE=>Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh?
C'S PRINCE=>I should think. And why are you alone in the woods?
WIFE=>I came with my husband. We were ... well you see ... it's a long story.
C'S PRINCE=>He would let you roam alone in the woods?
WIFE=>No, actually it was my choice.
C'S PRINCE=>How brave.
WIFE=>Brave?
C'S PRINCE=>Yes./ ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE
DON'T FEEL RUSHED.=>He kisses her. She succumbs for a moment, then pulls away.
WIFE=>Wait one moment, please! We can't do this! You have a Princess!
C'S PRINCE=>Well, yes, I do.
WIFE=>And I have a...baker.
C'S PRINCE=>Of course, you're right. How foolish./
MOMENT.=>As the PRINCE takes her into his arms, we PAN UP to see CINDERELLA'S BIRDS in the branches looking down at them.
BAKER=>Four eighty two... four eighty three...
CRYING)=>I'm sorry, may I be of some service? She looks to the BAKER and immediately turns her head for fear she will be recognized.
CINDERELLA=>The tree has fallen. Mother's grave, destroyed.
CINDERELLA=>I shouldn't complain. I'm sure others have suffered worse after the earthquake.
BAKER=>Earthquake? It's no earthquake -- there's a giant terrorizing the kingdom!
CINDERELLA=>Well, I'm sure the Prince will see to it that the Giant is rid from our land.
BAKER=>Hah, the Prince? No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden.
CINDERELLA=>What?
BAKER=>You look just like the Princess -- but dirty. Oh no, you are the Princess! He drops to his knees and bows.
CINDERELLA=>Please. Please... Get up! I'm not a princess here.
BAKER=>I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
CINDERELLA=>I had to disguise myself. I'm not permitted to leave the palace unescorted. CINDERELLA looks away towards the wreckage of her mother's grave.
BAKER=>If you'd like you can come with me. You will be safe in our company. CINDERELLA thinks for a moment, then nods.
CINDERELLA=>Thank you.
BAKER=>This way.
C'S PRINCE=>I must leave you. She looks at him confused. He walks over to his horse and mounts it.
C'S PRINCE=>Now I must go off to slay a giant. I shall not forget you. How brave you are to be alone in the woods. And how alive you've made me feel. And just like that, he rides off leaving a cloud of dust in his wake.
WIFE=>What was that?/ WAS THAT ME?/ WAS THAT
SHOULDS.=>(she stops for a
NEVER!/ IT'S THESE WOODS.=>She begins retracing her steps.
THE WOODS.=>She stops to catch her breath and make sure she's on the right path.
FOR A MOMENT, THOUGH./=>The WIFE looks in the direction of where the C-PRINCE exited.
WIFE=>One eighty-four... one eighty-three... one eighty-two...
BAKER=>She should be back by now.
LRRH=>She wouldn't get lost.
CINDERELLA=>I'm sure she'll return.
BAKER=>No, I must go and look for her-- They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the scruff of the neck.
WITCH=>Look who I found!
JACK=>You're hurting me! The WITCH continues pulling the boy along.
BAKER=>Let go of him!
WITCH=>I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant.
JACK=>Make her stop!
LRRH=>Leave him alone! LRRH goes to try and pull JACK away from the WITCH. A tussle ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF.
BAKER=>(at the top of his
LUNGS)=>Stop! I said stop!
BAKER=>Where did you find this? The WITCH releases JACK.
JACK=>I'm sorry, sir...
BAKER=>It's my wife's!
JACK=>I'm sorry. I came upon her. She was at the bottom of a cliff...
BAKER=>What are you saying? JACK can't say the words.
CINDERELLA=>How awful...
BAKER=>No. No...! As the truth sinks in.
BAKER=>This is my fault. I let her wander off alone. I should have made her stay with me.
WITCH=>Wake up! When you're dead, you're dead. Now it's time to get this boy to the Giant before we're all-- CINDERELLA and LRRH block her way.
CINDERELLA=>Keep away from him.
LRRH=>No!
WITCH=>This is no time to be soft-hearted! He's going to the Giant and I'm taking him. The BAKER grabs hold of JACK.
BAKER=>Yes! He's the one to blame! It's because of you there's a giant in our midst and my wife is dead!
THE FIRST PLACE!=>This becomes one big game of "tag", the group reconstituting itself as they gang up on whomever they think is the guilty party.
FROM YOU!=>They turn on the BAKER.
REVERSED!=>They march over to the WITCH who stands firm.
IS YOU!=>Moving on CINDERELLA.
THE HARP--YES!=>They turn on LRRH.
WAIT A MINUTE--!=>Every man for himself because there's enough blame to go around.
CINDERELLA BAKER=>
FIRST PLACE--!=>They turn to the WITCH who has her back to them.
BLAME!/ IT'S YOUR FAULT!=>The WITCH turns on them. She is holding the BAKER'S BABY in her arms.
WITCH=>Shhhhhhh!
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.=>She thrusts the BABY into the BAKER'S arms.
WITCH=>No?/ YOU'RE SO NICE./ YOU'RE NOT
JACK=>Maybe I shouldn't have stolen from the Giant...
LRRH=>Maybe I shouldn't have strayed from the path...
CINDERELLA=>Maybe I shouldn't have attended the Ball...
JACK=>Where are you going?
BAKER=>Away from here.
LRRH=>But you said we had to find our way out of this together.
BAKER=>It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart.
JACK=>We need your help.
BAKER=>You don't understand. My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything.
CINDERELLA=>You would leave your child?
CINDERELLA=>But wait...
BAKER'S FATHER=>Son.
BAKER=>What are you doing here?
BAKER=>I don't want to talk to you. It's because of you all of this happened. Go away!
BAKER'S FATHER=>I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.
BAKER=>Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans?
BAKER'S FATHER=>They were there and I wanted them. I didn't think. I was being careless --
BAKER=>-- Selfish.
BAKER=>You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away.
BAKER'S FATHER=>When your mother died, I was... I hated myself and I ran from my guilt and my shame...
BAKER=>... and your son.
BAKER'S FATHER=>Yes, and my son. And I'm sorry for that.
BAKER=>If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it.
BAKER'S FATHER=>I never expected...
BAKER=>Then what do you want?
BAKER'S FATHER=>Aren't you making the same mistake? The BAKER says nothing.
BAKER'S FATHER=>Aren't you running away? (the Baker looks
AWAY)=>Be better than me, son. Do better... The BAKER turns to look at his FATHER, but he is gone. Was he ever there? The BAKER walks angrily along an overgrown path through the woods. He slows, sits down on a tree stump and breaks down, his wife's scarf in his hands. Slowly he calms himself.
JACK=>If there were just some way we could surprise the Giant.
LRRH=>She's too tall to surprise. They look up as a newly determined BAKER returns.
CINDERELLA=>I knew you wouldn't give up.
JACK=>He wouldn't leave his baby.
LRRH=>It looked like he was going to.
BAKER=>Give me my son. The BAKER takes the BABY. The baby begins to cry.
BAKER=>(pulling the baby close to comfort
HIM)=>Hey, hey.
LRRH=>What are we going to do now?
BAKER=>We need to rid this kingdom of the Giant -- together.
BAKER=>She'll be back soon; here's the plan. We're going to feed Jack to the Giant.
JACK CINDERELLA=>What? No!
BAKER=>We're going to use you as bait to lure the Giant towards the tar pit. Suddenly a swarm of BIRDS appears overhead.
CINDERELLA=>The birds can help!
CINDERELLA=>That doesn't matter now! What's important is that we find a way to defeat the Giant.
LRRH=>You can talk to birds?
CINDERELLA=>The birds will do their part.
BAKER=>Okay, we don't have much time.
JACK=>I'm excited.
BAKER=>Here's what we're going to do... The BAKER leads them away from the tar pit.
CINDERELLA=>Your father's being very brave. We're going to be very brave too. The C-PRINCE is passing a nearby path on horseback. He stops when he sees CINDERELLA.
CINDERELLA=>The Giant went in that direction. He rides closer.
C'S PRINCE=>My darling!
CINDERELLA=>I'm well aware of that. He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away.
C'S PRINCE=>My love. What is it?
CINDERELLA=>Maybe I'm not your only love.
CINDERELLA=>If you love me, why did you stray?
C'S PRINCE=>I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more.
CINDERELLA=>If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be?
C'S PRINCE=>I was raised to be charming, not sincere.
CINDERELLA=>I think you should go.
C'S PRINCE=>I'm not going to leave you.
CINDERELLA=>Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant.
C'S PRINCE=>Is that what you really wish?
CINDERELLA=>My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him. He stands there for a moment, then mounts his horse.
C'S PRINCE=>I shall always love the maiden who ran away.
CINDERELLA=>And I the faraway prince. The PRINCE rides off.
BAKER=>Careful, there. Not so fast.
JACK=>You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk. ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking the baby. LRRH returns.
LRRH=>They're in the tree -- over there. We made slings out of my cape. LRRH sits next to CINDERELLA.
LRRH=>I wanted to climb too.
CINDERELLA=>I'm glad you're here to help me. LRRH turns her head away.
CINDERELLA=>What's wrong?
LRRH=>I think my mother and my Granny would be upset with me.
CINDERELLA=>Why?
LRRH=>They said always to make them proud and here I am about to kill somebody.
CINDERELLA=>Not somebody. A giant who's done a lot of harm.
LRRH=>But a giant's a person. Aren't we to show forgiveness?
CINDERELLA=>I know.
ANGLE ON TREE=>The BAKER and JACK position themselves on a limb within the tree.
JACK=>Wait until my mother hears I've slain the Giant.
BAKER=>Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother...
JACK=>What?
BAKER=>She didn't make it.
JACK=>Was she killed by the Giant?
BAKER=>No. It wasn't like that. She was fighting with the Giant, trying to protect you, and she was pushed by the Steward -- and -- she fell.
JACK=>The Steward will pay for this.
BAKER=>No, Jack --
JACK=>After we slay the Giant, I will slay him.
BAKER=>You'll do nothing of the kind.
JACK=>What he done was wrong. He should be punished.
BAKER=>It's not as easy as that.
ALONE--=>They're interrupted by the ominous sounds of the approaching
LRRH=>Here she comes!
BAKER=>Go, Jack! Be careful.
WIDE SHOT=>The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA.
GIANT=>Where is the boy?
LRRH=>We have him.
GIANT=>Where?
JACK=>Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings.
BAKER=>Ready?
JACK=>Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path. Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as she begins to sink.
SERIES OF SHOTS=>-- The BIRDS fly from the trees. -- BAKER'S POV through the tree branches as the BIRDS swarm around the head of the GIANT. -- CINDERELLA and LRRH watch and hear the GIANT'S screams.
CINDERELLA=>Good birds!
LRRH=>She doesn't look happy. -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the
GIANT.=>-- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim. -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK.
LRRH=>Look out Jack! -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down, grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to the GIANT'S forehead. -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway. BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him. The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final deafening THUD.
CINDERELLA=>Where are they?
LRRH=>Jack? Mr. Baker?
CINDERELLA=>Jack?
JACK=>Over here!
LRRH=>Jack!
CINDERELLA=>Oh, be careful, are you alright?
JACK=>Where is he?
CINDERELLA=>He's not with you?
LRRH=>Mr. Baker? All three feverishly look for him.
BAKER=>Jack, Jack!
JACK=>Help me. Help me!
BAKER=>Jack, I'm here. CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER, breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from
CINDERELLA=>Let me take him.
BAKER=>Are you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree.
BAKER=>Now we can all return home.
JACK=>What home? I have no one to take care of me.
LRRH=>And we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you.
BAKER=>-- of course you can come home with me.
BAKER=>If you want to.
CINDERELLA=>I'll gladly help you with your house. There are times when I actually enjoy cleaning.
BAKER=>Here -- give him to me. The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY.
BAKER=>Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey, please, come on, come on, it's okay. I know you miss your mother. The BAKER sits on a fallen tree trunk.
BAKER=>I miss her too. The BABY cries.
BAKER=>Sssh! The BABY still cries.
CHILDREN--=>The BAKER hears his WIFE'S voice. We see her over his shoulder.
BAKER=>Shhhh. As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE disappears. The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE
BAKER WITCH=>Once upon a time...in a far CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU SAY,/ off kingdom...there lay a CHILDREN WILL LISTEN./ small village at the edge of CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU DO,/ the woods... And in this CHILDREN WILL SEE./ AND village lived a young LEARN. maiden...a carefree young lad...and a childless baker...with his wife.
CHILDREN WILL GLISTEN./=>his wife were in their shop
LEARN WHAT TO BE.=>hinges...
ME."/ CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.=>The light of the new dawn streams down on them, framing the newly formed family. As the BAKER continues to tell the story the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS UP overhead to reveal the vast woods, now changed by the Giant's path. The CAMERA then carries us back beyond the woods and to the Village where we see the destruction that has visited it.
