DIANA=>I used to want to save the world...
DIANA=>This beautiful place.
DIANA=>But the closer you get, the more you see the great darkness simmering within.
DIANA=>And mankind? That's another story altogether.
DIANA=>What one does faced with the truth, is more difficult than you think.
DIANA=>I learned this the hard way. A long, long time ago. And now I will never be the same.
ANTIOPE=>Yes, the blow was strong, but Eliana's footwork betrayed her! A battle is like a river-crossing, every step must find a safe spot --
MNEMOSYNE=>Diana!
MNEMOSYNE=>Diana, I see you!
MNEMOSYNE=>Diana, come back!
HIPPOLYTA=>How many times, Diana?
HIPPOLYTA=>Let's get you back to school before another tutor quits.
HIPPOLYTA=>Training? You are training.
HIPPOLYTA=>Your mind is your most powerful weapon. All battles begin here -- -- before they end here --
HIPPOLYTA=>Does she?
ANTIOPE=>I could begin showing her some things. She should at least be able to defend herself.
HIPPOLYTA=>From whom?
ANTIOPE=>In the event of an invasion.
HIPPOLYTA=>Isn't that why I have an army at my command, General?
ANTIOPE=>I pray a day will never come where she has to fight, but you, the wisest of us all, know that one cannot deny their inner nature. A scorpion must sting, a wolf must hunt --
HIPPOLYTA=>She's a child. The only child on the island. Please, let her be so.
ANTIOPE=>But, sister --
HIPPOLYTA=>There will be no training.
HIPPOLYTA=>It's time to sleep.
HIPPOLYTA=>Fighting doesn't make you a hero.
HIPPOLYTA=>Diana... You are the most precious thing in this world to me. So much so, I sculpted you from clay and begged Zeus to give you life.
HIPPOLYTA=>Then I will tell you a new one. One of our people, and my days of battle...
HIPPOLYTA=>So you will finally understand... why war is nothing to hope for.
HIPPOLYTA=>Long ago, when time was new, and all of history was still a dream... the gods ruled the Earth, Zeus king among them.
HIPPOLYTA=>Zeus created beings over which the gods would rule -- beings born in his image -- fair and good, strong and passionate. Zeus called his creation... man. And mankind was good. Another flash of lightning REVEALS MANKIND.
HIPPOLYTA=>But one grew envious of Zeus' love for mankind -- and sought to corrupt his creation.
HIPPOLYTA=>This was Ares. The God of War. The sky splits open and fire rains from the heavens. Men take up arms, falling in line around Ares and becoming his ARMY.
HIPPOLYTA=>Ares poisoned men's hearts with jealousy and suspicion, vengeance and rage. He turned them against one another.
HIPPOLYTA=>And war ravaged the Earth.
HIPPOLYTA=>So the gods made us, the Amazons, to influence men's hearts with love and to restore peace to the world.
HIPPOLYTA=>For a brief time, there was peace, even a unity among the world, as the gods and man fought side-by- side against a great evil.
ANTIOPE=>But it did not last.
ANTIOPE=>Ares refused to give up his hold on mankind. Tightening his grip, he turned them against us.
ANTIOPE=>When Zeus led the gods to our defense, Ares killed them, one-by- one...
ANTIOPE=>.... until only Zeus himself remained.
ANTIOPE=>Your mother, the Amazon Queen, led a revolt that freed us all from enslavement.
HIPPOLYTA=>While Zeus used the last of his power to stop Ares...
HIPPOLYTA=>... striking him such a blow, the God of War was forced to retreat.
HIPPOLYTA=>With Zeus' dying breath, he created this island to shield us from the outside world. Somewhere Ares could not find us.
ANTIOPE=>But in the event he did, Zeus left us a weapon, one powerful enough to kill a God... to destroy Ares before he could destroy mankind... and us... with an endless war.
HIPPOLYTA=>We give thanks to the gods for this paradise.
HIPPOLYTA=>The Godkiller?
HIPPOLYTA=>This is where we keep all the gifts the gods have given us.
HIPPOLYTA=>I pray there will never come a time when it is called to arms. But only the fiercest among us even could... And that is not you, Diana. She takes Diana's hand away from the sword.
HIPPOLYTA=>So you see, my daughter, you are safe. And it is nothing for you to concern yourself with.
ANTIOPE=>You're doubting yourself.
ANTIOPE=>Yes, you are. But you're stronger than you believe...
HIPPOLYTA=>Diana!
HIPPOLYTA=>Training. It seems I am not the revered queen I should be. Disobeyed, betrayed, by my own sister --
HIPPOLYTA=>Take her to the palace.
ANTIOPE=>You left me no choice, Hippolyta. You neglect your duty if she cannot fight.
HIPPOLYTA=>You speak of a time that may never come. He may never return! He could have died of his wounds.
ANTIOPE=>You think I don't wish that were true?! You feel it in your bones, just as I do. Ares is still alive... He is out there... and it's only a matter of time before he returns.
HIPPOLYTA=>The stronger Diana gets --
ANTIOPE=>Nobody wants this less than I. I love her as you do. But this is the only way to truly protect her.
HIPPOLYTA=>She is to never know the truth about what she is and how she came to be. You will train her harder than every Amazon before her.
ANTIOPE=>Hippolyta --
HIPPOLYTA=>Five times harder -- ten times harder. You will train her until she is unconquerable.
ANTIOPE=>Come on, Diana. You're stronger than this.
HIPPOLYTA=>Get up, Diana.
ANTIOPE=>NEVER let your guard down! Your opponents will have no honor. They will strike at you from behind! They will attack without provocation!
ANTIOPE=>Show me the Amazon you are! Or was I wrong to put such faith in you?
HIPPOLYTA=>What have you done?
DIANA=>I'm sorry --
ANTIOPE=>Stay back.
GERMAN LIEUTENANT=>Where did this fog come from?
GERMAN COMMANDER=>Find the plane.
STEVE=>Wow.
DIANA=>You are a... man?
STEVE=>Yes, I mean -- Yeah. Do I not look like a... where am I?
DIANA=>You are on Themyscira.
STEVE=>Thema-- say it again?
DIANA=>Who are you?
STEVE=>I'm one of the good guys, and those are the bad guys.
STEVE=>Y'know... Germans.
DIANA=>Germans?
STEVE=>We gotta get out of here.
HIPPOLYTA=>Diana!
HIPPOLYTA=>Step away from her! NOW!
STEVE=>Where are their guns?
STEVE=>Do they only have arrows? We need guns. Because the Germans have guns. Lots and lots of --
STEVE=>Get down!
DIANA STEVE=>NO! Keep your head down!
STEVE=>Stay here!
ANTIOPE=>Omicron formation!
ANTIOPE=>SHIELD!
STEVE=>Diana!
DIANA=>Antiope!
DIANA=>No! Please no!
ANTIOPE=>Diana. The time has come... you... you must...
DIANA ANTIOPE=>What!? Antiope!! The Godkiller, Diana, go --
DIANA=>Go where? Antiope! No!
HIPPOLYTA=>Sister!
HIPPOLYTA=>You!
DIANA=>Mother, no! He fought at my side against the invaders.
MENALIPPE=>Typical. The man fights against his own people.
STEVE=>They weren't my people.
MENALIPPE=>Then why do you wear their colors?
ARTEMIS=>Tell us!
STEVE=>I -- I'm not at liberty to say.
MENALIPPE=>What is your name?
STEVE=>I can't tell you that, either.
VENELIA=>We should kill him right now and be done with it.
PHILIPPUS=>He dies now and we know nothing about why they came here and who they are.
STEVE=>Ladies, I'm sorry. I can only tell you one thing about me: I'll never talk.
STEVE=>My name's Captain Steve Trevor. Pilot... American Expeditionary Forces. Serial number 8121941. That's all I'm at liberty to s--
STEVE=>Seconded... to British Intelligence. What the hell is this thing, anyway?
DIANA=>The Lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.
MENALIPPE=>It is pointless -- and painful -- to resist.
HIPPOLYTA=>What is your mission?
STEVE=>Whoever you are, you're in enough danger as it is. You shouldn't --
HIPPOLYTA=>What is your mission?
STEVE=>I'm a spy.
STEVE=>British Intelligence got word that the leader of the German Army, General Ludendorff, was visiting a secret military installation in the Ottoman Empire.
STEVE=>I posed as one of their pilots, then flew in with them.
STEVE=>According to our intel, the Germans had no troops left, no money, no munitions of any kind...
STEVE=>... but our intel was wrong. The Germans had the Turks making bombs for them. And not just bombs...
STEVE=>New weapons. Invented by Ludendorff's chief psychopath. Dr. Isabel Maru.
STEVE=>Boys in the trenches call her `Dr. Poison.'
STEVE=>From what I saw... if Dr. Maru was able to complete her work, millions would die. The war would never end. I had to do something...
STEVE=>Dammit.
STEVE=>I was on my way back to London when the Germans shot me down...
STEVE=>But if I can get those notes to British Intelligence in time, it might make a difference... ... stop millions more from dying... Stop the war...
DIANA=>War? What war?
STEVE=>... The War to End All Wars. Four years, twenty-seven nations, twenty-five million dead -- soldiers... and civilians...
STEVE=>... Innocent people. Women and children. Slaughtered. Their homes -- villages -- looted, burned. Weapons deadlier, more horrifying than you can imagine. Like nothing I've ever seen... It's like... ... like the world is going to end.
HIPPOLYTA=>Take him to the infirmary.
PHILLIPUS=>Should we let him go?
HIPPOLYTA=>And risk him bringing more men to our shores. Phillipus...
DIANA=>Mother -- ?
PHILLIPUS=>We can't hold him forever, my Queen.
DIANA=>Excuse me, Mother. But after everything the man said... this must be Ares.
SENATOR ACANTHA=>What are you talking about, child?
DIANA=>Forgive me, Senator Acantha, but... the man called it a war without end. Millions of people already dead. Like nothing he's ever seen. Only Ares could do such a thing. We cannot simply let him go. We must go with him.
HIPPOLYTA=>We are not deploying our army and leaving Themyscira defenseless to go and fight their war!
DIANA=>It is not their war. Zeus created man to be just and wise, strong and passionate.
HIPPOLYTA=>That was a story, Diana. There is much you do not know. Mankind is easily corruptible.
DIANA=>But Ares is behind that corruption. It is Ares who has these Germans fighting. And stopping the God of War is our foreordinance --
HIPPOLYTA=>We must care to our wounded, honor our fallen!
DIANA=>Themyscira has seen death for the first time, Mother. Ares must not be allowed to threaten us again. We know only too well what happens if he finds us -- and he will. Never again shall we be enslaved. And now mankind must be freed. As Amazons this is our duty!
HIPPOLYTA=>You are not an Amazon like the rest of us, Diana.
HIPPOLYTA=>You don't know war like we do.
DIANA=>You may be afraid to face Ares, Mother, but I am not.
HIPPOLYTA=>Afraid? You know nothing of fear, child. Nothing of war. Nothing of pain. Nothing of sacrifice. So you will do nothing. Your Queen forbids it.
EPIONE=>Is it true you saved his life?
DIANA=>Who told you that?
EPIONE=>He did. What will the Queen do with him? Will she kill him?
STEVE=>Didn't hear you come in./Didn't hear you knock.
DIANA=>Would you say you're a typical example of your sex?
STEVE=>I like to think of myself as... above average.
DIANA=>What is that?
STEVE=>It's a watch.
DIANA=>A watch.
STEVE=>My father gave it to me. Been through hell and back with him, and now me, and it's still ticking.
DIANA=>Why?
STEVE=>Because it tells time. So, I know when to wake up, work, eat, sleep.
DIANA=>You let this little thing tell you what to do?
STEVE=>Do you mind if I ask you a couple hundred questions?
STEVE=>What is this place?
DIANA=>Themyscira.
STEVE=>I caught that before. I mean what is this place? How come I've never heard of it? Who the hell are you people? How do you know English?
DIANA=>We speak hundreds of languages. We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.
STEVE=>Funny, because I understand even less now than before you walked in.
STEVE=>Hey, I didn't get to say it earlier... but thanks for dragging me out of the water.
DIANA=>Thank you for what you did on the beach.
STEVE=>So... Are you here to let me go?
DIANA=>I'm sorry... It's not up to me. I tried. I even asked them to send me with you --
DIANA=>-- or anyone. An Amazon. The Amazons.
STEVE=>The Amazons?
DIANA=>It is our sacred duty to defend the world... and I wish to go. But my mother will not allow it.
STEVE=>Can't say I blame her. The way this war is going, I wouldn't let anyone I care about near it.
DIANA=>Then why do you want to go back?
STEVE=>I don't think want is the word, but... I've gotta try. My father used to say.
STEVE=>`You see something wrong in the world, you can either do nothing, or you can do something. And you already tried nothing.'
STEVE=>Nice outfit.
DIANA=>Thank you. Now I will show you the way off the island. And you will take me to Ares.
STEVE=>Deal.
STEVE=>I'm leaving in that?
DIANA=>We are.
STEVE=>We're leaving in that?
DIANA=>Do you not know how to sail?
STEVE=>Of course, I know how to sail. Why wouldn't I be able to sail? Just haven't since I was a kid -- She nods, motions to the boat with encouragement.
DIANA=>Then there's nothing to be afraid of.
DIANA=>What?
DIANA=>I can't stand by while innocent lives are lost. If no one else will defend the world from Ares, I must. I have to go --
HIPPOLYTA=>I know.
HIPPOLYTA=>Or at least I know that I cannot stop you. There is so much... so much you do not understand.
DIANA=>I understand enough. That I'm willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. Like you once did...
HIPPOLYTA=>You know that if you choose to leave us, you may never return. Once you leave this island, its location will fade from your memory...
HIPPOLYTA=>This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history -- make sure you are worthy of it.
DIANA=>I will.
HIPPOLYTA=>Be careful in the world of men, Diana, they do not deserve you.
HIPPOLYTA=>You have been my greatest love. Today you are my greatest sorrow.
MENALIPPE=>Should you have told her?
HIPPOLYTA=>The more she knows, the faster he will find her.
DIANA=>How long until we reach the war?
STEVE=>The war? Well, which part? The Eastern Front in France is 400 miles long -- from the Alps to the Atlantic. Then there's the Dolomites in Italy, Turks in Arabia -- there used to be a Russian Front but they quit last year so they could kill the Tzar and have a revolution.
DIANA=>Where the fighting is the most intense then. If you take me there, I am sure I will find who I'm looking for.
STEVE=>Who's that?
DIANA=>Ares.
STEVE=>Ares? As in the God of War?
DIANA=>The God of War is our responsibility. Only an Amazon can defeat him. With this.
DIANA=>And once I do, the war will end.
STEVE=>Look, Princess, I like your spirit, and maybe you know something I don't, but this war is so sprawling, there's nothing the two of us can do about it. But we can try to get to the men who can.
DIANA=>You're looking at the person who can. And after I find and destroy Ares, the German armies will be freed from his influence -- and they will be good men again.
STEVE=>I'm starting to understand why your mother didn't want you to leave. How much do you really know about the rest of the world?
DIANA=>The world of men? I know all there is to know about them -- from the great books.
STEVE=>The great books. Those books explain why there are no men on that island? Or kids?
DIANA=>I was raised on the island.
STEVE=>Just you? Sheltered upbringing.
DIANA=>My mother sculpted me from clay. I was brought to life by Zeus.
STEVE=>Oh. Well, that's not how babies are made where I come from.
DIANA=>You refer to reproductive biology.
STEVE=>I refer to more than that.
DIANA=>Ah. The pleasures of the flesh.
STEVE=>You know about that?
DIANA=>Of course. I've read all twelve volumes of Clio's Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.
STEVE=>All twelve, huh? You bring any of them with you?
DIANA=>You would not enjoy them. They came to the conclusion that men are essential for procreation, but when it comes to pleasure... unnecessary.
LUDENDORFF=>How long until we are operational?
CAPTAIN=>Two days, sir.
LUDENDORFF=>You have until tonight, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>Sir, the men have had no food. No sleep.
LUDENDORFF=>Do you think I've had food or rest, Captain? Do you hear me making excuses? Your men are weak. Complacent. You've spoiled them. You've let them forget that an attack can come at any time -- from any quarter -- so let's you and I remind them, shall we?
LUDENDORFF=>Doctor. Are you making progress?
MARU=>Not enough... It is over, General. Germany is giving up.
48A CONTINUED: 48A MARU=>Von Hindenburg has recommended the Kaiser sign the armistice. We have run out of time.
LUDENDORFF=>Once the Kaiser sees your newest weapon, he will never sign the armistice.
MARU=>But without my book...
LUDENDORFF=>We will get your book. But I believe in you, not it. I KNOW that you CAN and you WILL succeed. It is what you were put on this Earth to do.
MARU LUDENDORFF=>Something did come to me last night. For you... It has been a long journey. I need...
MARU=>A different type of gas. To restore your strength. General Ludendorff takes the capsule, examines it.
MARU=>And make you into the god you are.
MARU=>General... I have it. And if it is what I think... it's going to be... terrible.
LUDENDORFF=>And our war will swallow this world... Forever.
STEVE=>Good morning. We got lucky, caught a ride. Made good time.
STEVE=>Welcome to jolly ol' London.
DIANA=>It's hideous.
STEVE=>Eh. It's not for everyone.
STEVE=>Diana!
DIANA=>Why are they holding hands?
STEVE=>Well, because they're... together.
STEVE=>No, we're not together... I mean, like that. Look, we need to go this way.
DIANA=>Because this is the way to the war?
STEVE=>Technically, that's the way to war.
DIANA=>Then where are we going?
STEVE=>I have to get this notebook to my superiors.
DIANA=>I let you go, you take me to Ares. We made a deal, Steve Trevor. A deal is a promise. A promise is unbreakable.
STEVE=>Oh, boy. Okay... Dammit. Come with me to deliver this, then we'll talk about getting you a train ticket.
STEVE=>I need to change. And you...
DIANA=>What are you doing?
STEVE=>We need to get you some clothes.
DIANA=>Why?
STEVE=>Because you aren't wearing any.
DIANA=>What do these women wear into battle?
STEVE=>Well, women don't exactly --
DIANA=>A baby.
STEVE=>And that one wasn't made out of clay.
VOICE=>It's true! You're alive!
ETTA=>Well, thank God for that! I thought you were dead this time, I really did, then I got your call -- He was gone for weeks! Not a word. Very unlike him.
ETTA=>Hello. I'm Etta Candy. Captain Trevor's secretary.
DIANA=>What is a secretary?
ETTA=>Well, it means I do everything. I go wherever he goes. Do whatever he tells me to do.
DIANA=>Where I'm from, that's called slavery.
ETTA=>Ooh, I like this one. It does rather feel like that sometimes. But the pay's good and he's almost never here.
ETTA=>We've got our work cut out for us.
DIANA=>Is this what passes for armor in your country?
ETTA=>Of a sort. It's fashion. Keeps our tummies in.
DIANA=>Why must you keep them in?
ETTA=>Only a woman with no tummy would ask that question.
ETTA=>Conservative, but not entirely... un-fun.
STEVE=>At least try it on.
ETTA=>Oh, my! Aren't you terribly cold out here where everyone can see... everything? Let's get you into a nice, warm, private dressing room, shall we?
DIANA=>How can a woman possibly fight in this?
ETTA=>We fight with our principles. It's how we got the vote.
ETTA=>Not that I'm opposed to engaging in a bit of fisticuffs when the situation calls for it, mind you!
ETTA=>There we are. Very nice.
DIANA=>So itchy. And it's choking me.
ETTA=>I can't say that I blame it.
STEVE=>Where is she?
ETTA=>Trying on outfit number two hundred and twenty-six.
DIANA=>Why is everyone staring? Is it because I can barely breathe in this?
STEVE=>Etta, the whole point was to make her less conspicuous.
ETTA=>Really, Steve? All it takes is a pair of specs, and suddenly she's not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
DIANA=>Thank you.
ETTA=>Right then, I'll take the rest of this. Good luck, I'll take these back to the office and meet you both later.
ETTA=>It really doesn't go with the outfit.
STEVE=>It'll be safe. You can trust her. I don't think we're going to run into Ares at the meeting.
DIANA=>Please. Protect it with your life.
ETTA=>... Who wouldn't?
STEVE=>Come on.
DIANA=>What is it?
STEVE=>Hopefully nothing.
STEVE=>Quite a reception.
STEVE=>Where did I put that thing?
STEVE=>Stay behind me!
STEVE=>Or not.
STEVE=>How'd you do that?
ETTA=>I thought you looked suspicious.
ETTA=>Where do you think you're going?
DIANA=>I am sorry. You are clearly under his control. Let me help you get free. Tell me where he is... Where will I find Ares?
DIANA=>He's dead.
STEVE=>Stay here.
SIR PATRICK=>Gentlemen! Germany is a proud nation who will never surrender. The only way to end this war and restore world peace is to negotiate an armistice.
STEVE=>Colonel!
STEVE=>Sorry. Phillip! Phil!
SIR PATRICK=>Our only aim at this moment -- must be to achieve peace at any cost.
SIR PATRICK=>Gentlemen, I beg you, please, if you'll just hear me out --
DIANA=>Why will they not let him speak? He's talking peace.
STEVE=>That's why they won't let him speak.
DIANA=>But if they want to stop the war, isn't that foolish? Are they fools?
STEVE=>Most of `em.
COLONEL DARNELL=>Trevor?! What the hell were you thinking bringing a woman into the council chamber?
STEVE=>I'm sorry, sir, but the intel I've brought back is very time sensitive. We were attacked by men looking for it on the way here. One of Maru's notebooks.
STEVE=>We need to get it to Cryptography. And I need an immediate audience with the Generals --
COLONEL DARNELL=>You don't just rush in here, like this, and demand an audience with the cabinet. Cryptography takes time and --
SIR PATRICK=>Captain Trevor! Sir Patrick emerges from the auditorium, making his way over to the threesome.
SIR PATRICK=>I'd heard you were lost on one of your missions, yet here you are. And you've brought a friend.
COLONEL DARNELL=>Our deepest apologies for the interruption, sir --
SIR PATRICK=>Nonsense.
SIR PATRICK=>Thanks to this young woman, the room was finally quiet enough for me to get a few words in. Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.
DIANA=>Diana, Princess of --
STEVE=>Prince, Diana Prince. We... she and I... we work together. She helped me get this notebook here. From Maru's lab --
SIR PATRICK=>`Dr. Poison' herself? My God... I suggest we assemble the war cabinet so they can tell us more.
LUDENDORFF=>Congratulations, Doctor.
COLONEL DARNELL=>Cryptographers had no luck. It seems like a mixture of two languages.
DIANA=>Ottoman and Sumerian.
DIANA=>Surely someone else in this room knew that.
GENERAL HAIG=>Who is this woman?
STEVE=>She's my... secretary.
GENERAL HAIG=>And she speaks Ottoman and Sumerian?
STEVE=>She's a very good secretary.
GENERAL HAIG=>See her out.
COLONEL DARNELL=>If this woman can read it, sir... we should hear what she has to say.
DIANA=>Thank you. It's a formula... for a new kind of mustard...
DIANA=>Mustard gas. Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.
DARNELL=>Gas masks would be useless against hydrogen.
DIANA=>The book says they plan to release this gas at... the front... Front of what?
STEVE=>General, you have to find out where they're making this gas. Burn it to the ground. Destroy it.
COLONEL DARNELL=>Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium --
GENERAL HAIG=>We can't be seen sending troops into German-occupied Belgium when we're negotiating their surrender.
STEVE=>Sir, I saw this gas with my own eyes. All the men on the front line could die on both sides unless you --
GENERAL HAIG=>That's what soldiers do, Captain. Diana's shocked by the callousness. Sir Patrick looks at her apologetically.
GENERAL HAIG=>What? Would you have us abandon the front altogether?
STEVE=>Pull the troops out. Send me in. With some strategic support, I could take Ludendorff and his operation out myself.
GENERAL HAIG=>Are you insane, Trevor? I can't introduce rogue elements this late into the game.
STEVE=>But, General --
SIR PATRICK=>Now more than ever, the armistice is of paramount importance, we must get it negotiated and signed. That is the surest way of stopping the war.
GENERAL HAIG=>You will do nothing, Captain Trevor. That's an order.
STEVE=>Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
DIANA=>I don't.
STEVE=>Diana. I know it's confusing --
DIANA=>It's not confusing. It's unthinkable.
GENERAL HAIG=>I'm sorry, who did you say this woman was?
STEVE=>She's with me. With us.
DIANA=>I am not with you. You would knowingly sacrifice all those lives? Do they mean less than yours? Where I come from Generals don't hide in their offices like cowards. They fight alongside their soldiers. They die with them on the battlefield.
STEVE=>Diana. Enough. My apologies, sir.
DIANA=>You should be ashamed! All of you.
STEVE=>Diana, wait!
DIANA=>That's your leader? How could he say that? Believe that? And YOU! Was your duty to simply give them a book? You didn't stand your ground! You didn't fight!
STEVE=>Because there was no chance of changing his mind! Listen to me --
DIANA=>This is Ares and he isn't going to allow a negotiation or a surrender. The millions of people you talked about? They will die. My people? They're next!
STEVE DIANA=>If you just listen to me -- How can you call yourselves good men?
STEVE=>WE'RE GOING ANYWAY!
DIANA=>What? You mean you were lying?
STEVE=>Diana, I'm a spy. That's what we do. Now are you coming or not?
DIANA=>How do I know you're not lying to me right now?
STEVE=>I'm taking you to the front. And we're probably going to die.
DIANA=>You have no faith in yourself.
STEVE=>This is a terrible idea... Come on. If we're going to get to the front on our own... we're gonna need reinforcements.
DIANA=>These are the reinforcements? Are these even good men?
STEVE=>Relatively good.
DIANA=>Relative to what?
SAMEER=>... In Africa, gentlemen, we had no such luxuries...
SAMEER=>But the luxuries we have now. It's like we can't stop making money. My uncle, the Prince, and I would keep it all, but we want to extend the opportunity to a few good soldiers --
STEVE=>Which Prince was that? I need to talk to you, Prince Madras Angora Cashmere...
SAMEER=>You bugger. I been greasing those peacocks all night... My goodness gracious, that's a work of art.
STEVE=>Sameer. This is Diana.
SAMEER=>Diana, call me `Sammy.' Please.
DIANA=>Sammy. Please.
STEVE=>Sameer's a top undercover man. Can talk the skin off a cat in as many languages as you.
DIANA=>[He doesn't look that impressive to me?]
SAMEER=>[You do to me. Your eyes, as soft as your smile...]
DIANA=>[And your eyes look like they want something.]
SAMEER=>[I know Chinese, too, tricky girl.]
DIANA=>[But can you recite Socrates in Ancient Greek?]
STEVE=>Where's Charlie?
DIANA=>At least this Charlie is good with his fists.
STEVE=>That's not Charlie.
STEVE=>That's Charlie. The two GRUNT at one another in Scottish slang, but the Bruiser sees Charlie's got friends -- and quickly leaves. The surprisingly cheerful CHARLIE gets to his feet.
STEVE=>All right, Charlie?
CHARLIE=>Steven. May God put a flower on your head.
DIANA=>What were you fighting about?
CHARLIE=>I mistook his drink for mine.
DIANA=>This man is no fighter.
STEVE=>Charlie here's an expert marksman. He shoots people.
SAMEER=>From very far away.
CHARLIE=>They never know what hit `em.
DIANA=>How do you know who you kill if you can't see their face?
CHARLIE=>I don't. Better that way.
DIANA=>My aunt warned me about men like you.
CHARLIE=>Ain't the first time I heard that, lassie.
DIANA=>You fight without honor.
CHARLIE=>Don't get paid for honor.
SAMEER=>What's the job, Trevor?
STEVE=>Two days tops. We need supplies and passage to Belgium --
CHARLIE=>What's the going rate?
SAMEER=>Better be good pay.
SAMEER=>[And perhaps a picture of your lovely face. Something to keep me alive.]
DIANA=>[You won't need a picture. I'm coming with you.]
SAMEER=>What is this?
STEVE=>We're dropping her off at the front.
SAMEER=>Dropping her off?
CHARLIE=>No offense, cherie, but I don't wanna get killed helping a girl out of a ditch, ya know what I mean?
BRUISER=>You got your friends. These are mine.
SAMEER=>I am both frightened and aroused.
CHARLIE=>When aren't you?
ETTA=>There they are.
ETTA=>Hello, all! Sorry, I'm late. I got waylaid by --
DIANA=>Sir Patrick!
ETTA=>That's what I was going to mention.
SIR PATRICK=>Sit, gentlemen. Please, sit.
SIR PATRICK=>I assume you're here planning something that's either going to get you court-martialed or killed.
STEVE=>I assume you're here to stop us.
SIR PATRICK=>No. Not that I like any of this. As one of your American authors, Thomas Paine, so eloquently put it, `I prefer peace. But if trouble must come let it come in my time, so that my children can live in peace.'
SIR PATRICK=>Now nothing can jeopardize the armistice talks, but... I also believe in insurance. I'm here to help you. Unofficially, of course. What's your plan?
STEVE=>If there is another weapons facility, find it and destroy it. Along with Ludendorff and Maru.
SIR PATRICK=>Etta will run the mission out of my office, to allay suspicion.
ETTA=>Run the mission, sir?
SIR PATRICK=>It's enough for a few days.
STEVE=>Thank you, sir.
DIANA=>The gas, Ludendorff, Maru... You realize they are all symptoms. Ares is the disease. And once I find him, none of this will matter.
STEVE=>I'll take you to the front, but I can't make any promises about finding `your friend' any more than I can Santa Claus.
DIANA=>You won't need to. I'll know him when I see him.
STEVE=>Train leaves in a few minutes.
STEVE=>Hungry?
DIANA=>It's cold.
STEVE=>It's ice cream.
DIANA=>It's wonderful. You should be very proud.
STEVE=>Forget the countries or the territory or the Generals. This is what we're really fighting for.
STEVE=>We've got to get a move on. Chief won't wait.
DIANA=>Chief?
STEVE=>Smuggler. Very reputable.
DIANA=>A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler?
STEVE=>Careful, I might get offended.
DIANA=>I wasn't referring to you.
STEVE=>I went undercover and pretended to be something else, I shot people on your beach, and I smuggled a notebook. Liar, murderer, smuggler. You still coming?
DIANA=>The gas will kill everyone... everything.
DIANA=>What kind of weapon kills innocents?
STEVE=>In this war? Every kind.
THE CHIEF=>You're late.
STEVE=>Chief!
SAMEER=>It's good to see you.
CHARLIE=>Aye.
THE CHIEF=>Who is this?
THE CHIEF=>Niitangio, Napi.
DIANA=>I am Diana.
THE CHIEF=>Where did you find her?
STEVE=>She found me.
DIANA=>I plucked him from the sea --
STEVE=>It's a long story.
STEVE=>British tea for the Germans. German beer for the British.
STEVE=>Edgar Rice Burroughs novels for both sides.
CHARLIE=>And guns.
THE CHIEF=>It's not even very good beer.
STEVE=>Ludendorff was last seen at the front -- -- near the Somme. Front's about three miles away. Chief will get us there.
THE CHIEF=>Then it's another day to safely cross it.
STEVE=>As soon as we have daylight, we move. I'll take first watch.
CHARLIE=>No need. I'll take it. I never sleep on the job!
DIANA=>Strange thunder.
THE CHIEF=>German seventy-sevens. Guns. Big ones.
THE CHIEF=>That's the front out there. The evening hate.
DIANA=>So... who do you fight for in this war?
THE CHIEF=>I don't fight.
DIANA=>You're here for profit then?
THE CHIEF=>Nowhere better to be.
DIANA=>Nowhere better to be than a war you don't take a side in?
THE CHIEF=>I have nowhere else and no side left. The last war took everything from my people. We have nothing left. At least here, I'm free.
DIANA=>Who took that from your people? Chief cocks his head to the side. How could she not know?
THE CHIEF=>His people.
DIANA=>You're safe. What did you see?
CHARLIE=>I'm fine, `right? Bloody broad.
THE CHIEF=>He sees ghosts.
STEVE=>You're going to get cold. Here.
DIANA=>No, I'm --
VON HINDENBURG=>You were absent at the council meeting, General.
LUDENDORFF=>You've begun negotiating the terms of the armistice.
VON HINDENBURG=>On the Kaiser's behalf.
LUDENDORFF=>But on your insistence.
LUDENDORFF=>We can easily win this war still... If only you had faith in me.
VON HINDENBURG=>We don't. There are shortages of food, medicine, ammunition. Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives.
LUDENDORFF=>One attack and the war is ours. As we speak, my chemist and her team are --
VON HINDENBURG=>We stand against you and your witch, Ludendorff! Enough! Twenty-four hours from now this war will end. It is over.
LUDENDORFF=>For all of you.
MARU=>The mask won't help.
LUDENDORFF=>Yes, but they don't know that.
LUDENDORFF=>It's time to stage our demonstration for the Kaiser.
DIANA=>Those animals. Why are they hurting them?
CHARLIE=>Because they need to move. Like us.
DIANA=>But I can help them!
CHARLIE=>There's no time! C'mon, woman.
WOUNDED SOLDIER=>Oh, God. God, help me! Please.
DIANA=>That man... He's injured.
SAMEER=>There is nothing we can do about it, Diana. We must keep moving.
DIANA=>Where are we?
STEVE=>You wanted me to take you to the war. This is it. The front lines.
DIANA=>But where are Ares' men -- the Germans?
CHARLIE=>Couple hundred yards that way. In a trench like this one.
SENTRY=>Chief! Oi! Chief's back!
TRENCH OFFICERS=>Chief!/Welcome back!/Nick of time!
MARIE=>[The Germans took everything -- homes, food... the ones who couldn't escape... they took as slaves.]
DIANA=>[Where did this happen?]
DIANA=>We need to help these people.
STEVE=>We need to stay on mission.
THE CHIEF=>And there's no safe crossing for at least a day ahead.
CHARLIE=>Then what are we waitin' for?
DIANA=>But these people are dying, they've nothing to eat. And in the village... Enslaved, she said. Women. Children.
STEVE=>There's nothing we can do about that.
DIANA=>How can you say that? What is the matter with you?
STEVE=>This is no man's land, Diana. It means no man can cross it. This is the worst point on the entire front. This battalion has been here for nearly a year and they've barely gained an inch because on the other side are Germany's deadliest soldiers. Pointing machine guns at every square inch of this place. This is not something you can cross. It's not possible.
DIANA=>So we do nothing?
STEVE=>We are doing something. We can't save every person in this war. Besides, it's not what we came here to do.
DIANA=>No, but it's what I'm going to do.
STEVE=>DIANA, NO!!!
CHARLIE=>How the hell'd she do that?
STEVE=>She's drawing their fire! Let's go!
DIANA=>We're not finished yet.
DIANA=>Stay here. I'll go ahead.
STEVE=>Go!
STEVE=>Bell tower.
STEVE=>Charlie!
SAMEER=>You don't miss.
CHARLIE=>Bloody scope... lens is cracked.
DIANA=>Is there a way inside?!
STEVE=>There is if you jump!
DIANA=>It's too high.
DIANA=>For all his talk of murdering people from afar, your shooter can't shoot.
SAMEER=>Not everyone gets to be who they want to be all the time. Me, I wanted to be an actor, not a soldier. But I'm the wrong color.
DIANA=>He doesn't charge them?
SAMEER=>Money isn't the only profit. Everyone's fighting their own battles, Diana. Just as you are fighting yours.
STEVE=>Veld. Tiny village. It's probably not even on the --
ETTA=>Found it.
STEVE=>Have you found Ludendorff's operation?
ETTA=>Not yet, but we've located him. And lucky you, he's only a few miles away -- at German High Command.
STEVE=>German High Command?
ETTA=>Intel reports Ludendorff is hosting a gala -- a last hurrah before the Germans sign the Armistice. The Kaiser himself will be there. As will Dr. Maru.
STEVE=>Actually, that gala's perfect cover --
SIR PATRICK=>Captain Trevor, you are under no circumstances to attend that gala tomorrow night. We cannot risk jeopardizing the Armistice.
DIANA=>You shouldn't be worried about upsetting the peace accord. Ares would never let that happen...
STEVE=>What is it?
DIANA=>Of course... It makes complete sense. Ares developed a weapon, the worst ever devised.
STEVE=>Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
DIANA=>No. I mean Ares. Ludendorff is Ares.
SIR PATRICK=>Steve?
STEVE=>Sir, this is our chance to find the gas and learn how Ludendorff plans on delivering it. Maybe our only chance. Our last chance --
SIR PATRICK=>I forbid it. Do you hear me? Steve?
STEVE=>I'm sorry, sir, you're breaking up.
SIR PATRICK=>Steve? Are you there -- ?
STEVE=>Drinks later, Sameer. I need you to rustle up me a German uniform.
SAMEER=>Already done. Now you two need to relax. There's nothing we can do until tomorrow. You said it yourself, Steve.
DIANA=>It's bitter.
STEVE=>It's an acquired taste.
STEVE=>It has hints of different flavors, if you look for them.
STEVE=>You did this.
DIANA=>We did.
STEVE=>You have dancing on `Paradise' Island?
DIANA=>Dance on Themyscira is more --
STEVE=>Interpretive?
DIANA=>Precisely. Perhaps you'd better show me.
STEVE=>Excuse me?
DIANA=>If I'm going to a gala, I'll need to know how to --
STEVE=>You're not going to the gala.
DIANA=>Of course, I am. Why wouldn't I?
STEVE=>Because you don't know how to dance, for one thing.
DIANA=>I would argue that they don't know how to dance.
DIANA=>You're awfully close.
STEVE=>That's kinda the point.
DIANA=>Ah. I see.
STEVE=>It's a snowfall.
DIANA=>It's magical.
STEVE=>You're right.
DIANA=>Is this what people do when there are no wars to fight?
STEVE=>This and other things.
DIANA=>What things?
STEVE=>I don't know. They... make breakfast.
DIANA=>What else?
STEVE=>Read the newspaper. Go to work -- They... get married. Maybe have babies, grow old together.
DIANA=>What is it like?
STEVE=>No idea.
DIANA=>Maybe... once I defeat Ares and war ends forever... there will be time to learn about... all kinds of things.
STEVE=>God, I hope you're right.
SAMEER=>The villagers gave them to us.
THE CHIEF=>A gracious gift.
SAMEER=>They called us heroes.
DIANA=>You are.
STEVE=>Guys, I'm fully aware that I said this job was two days --
THE CHIEF=>You would get lost without us.
SAMEER=>Yeah, we know Diana's capable of looking after herself, but I'm worried you wouldn't make it.
STEVE=>There's no more money, boys.
SAMEER=>We've been paid enough. The Chief nods, but Diana spots Charlie's hesitation.
DIANA=>If you're coming, Charlie, perhaps you'll sing more for us. I enjoyed it very much.
SAMEER=>Ah! Don't encourage him!
CHARLIE=>She's a real life Amazon?
CHARLIE=>That's the craziest story I ever heard!
SAMEER=>Wait. There's a whole island of women like her? And not a single man among them? How do we get there?
STEVE=>You're not their type.
CHARLIE=>You're all going daft.
STEVE=>It's true... every word.
SAMEER=>And she thinks Ludendorff is Ares? The God of War?
CHARLIE=>And only by killing him will the war end?
SAMEER=>You saw what she did out there. The way she charged that machine gun nest. The way she took out that tower. Maybe it's true!
CHARLIE=>You don't really believe all this rubbish, do ye?
STEVE=>How the hell are we gonna get in?
THE CHIEF=>The way in is through the gate.
CHARLIE=>Thank you, Chief, for that ancient tribal wisdom, that's very helpful.
CHARLIE=>If you could get through the gate I only see one guard at the door to distract.
STEVE=>It won't look at all suspicious when I come sauntering out of the woods on foot --
DIANA=>I could get in.
STEVE=>You're not going in. It's too --
DIANA=>Dangerous?
STEVE=>I know how to do stealth -- been doing it my whole life. I'll follow them to wherever they're working on the gas or better yet find out where it is.
STEVE=>Plus, we can't make a scene.
DIANA=>I can be stealthy.
STEVE=>Diana, what you're wearing doesn't exactly qualify as `undercover.'
SAMEER=>I don't know, I'd say she was pretty under covered.
STEVE=>There's no way to get you in. Let me scout it and report back. Worse case, we follow Ludendorff when he leaves and you can use that magic lasso of yours to get him to tell us where it is.
DIANA=>But as long as he's still alive --
STEVE=>You can't go into German High Command and kill anyone! You have to trust me, Diana.
STEVE=>Where did that come from?
THE CHIEF=>Field over there is full of them.
SAMEER=>Can I drive it? Lemme drive it. I'll be your chauffeur!
STEVE=>Diana. Please, stay put.
CHARLIE=>We should scout the area. In case we need to beat a hasty retreat. What do you think, Diana?
CHARLIE=>Uh-oh.
SAMEER=>Steve...
SAMEER=>... they have invitations.
SAMEER=>Dhanyavaad, Sahib. The Colonel and I wish many blessings and all manner of other things to fall upon your head --
STEVE=>And your head's empty! He wants my invitation, you idiot!
SAMEER=>I must apologize a thousand thousand times, my masters, for my most horrid, wretched, and unworthy soul has lost the Colonel's invitation!
STEVE SAMEER=>We drive hours through this I am a snail! No, a bug! mud and filth! You're a No, the dung of a bug -- disgrace!
SAMEER=>Blessings be upon us.
STEVE=>Keep the car running, Sahib. And no joy riding.
FAUSTA=>I am not spending the entire evening out here, you idiots. Move your cars! I said, move!
FAUSTA=>What are you supposed to be?! Ha! Out of my way.
FAUSTA=>What are you doing? Guards -- ?!
DIANA=>That was... fun.
MARU=>They're starting to ask where Von Hindenburg and the others are.
LUDENDORFF=>Soon it won't matter.
MARU=>But, General --
LUDENDORFF=>We continue as planned. Now go. I have people to tend to beyond you.
STEVE=>Excuse me.
MARU=>I don't drink. Have we met?
STEVE=>No, but I've been watching you. Following your career, I mean. You're Dr. Isabel Maru. The most talented chemist in the German Army. I'm a fan.
STEVE=>I hope I'm not crossing a line. I hear you and General Ludendorff are very close.
MARU=>We work well together, yes.
STEVE=>I'm sure he provides a great deal of support for you and your work, but having someone like me behind you -- I could provide a lot more.
MARU=>And who are you?
STEVE=>A man who would show you the appreciation a genius like yourself deserves.
STEVE=>I love fire, don't you? It's like a living act of entropy. The ultimate weapon of destruction, reminding us that, in the end, everything returns to the ash it once came from. There's something reassuring about it. I see all of that in your eyes.
STEVE=>Perhaps you could show me what you're working on. I hear it's extraordinary.
MARU=>I appreciate your interest in my work, but I am loyal to General Ludendorff. Besides, I see now your attention is elsewhere.
LUDENDORFF=>Enjoying the party?
DIANA=>I confess, I'm not sure what we're celebrating.
LUDENDORFF=>A German victory, of course.
DIANA=>Victory? When I hear peace is so close?
LUDENDORFF=>`Peace is only an armistice in an endless war.'
DIANA=>Thucydides.
LUDENDORFF=>You know your Ancient Greeks. They understood that war is a god. One that requires human sacrifice. Her heart pounds.
LUDENDORFF=>And in exchange, war gives man purpose. A chance to rise above his petty, mortal little life and be better than he is.
DIANA=>Only one of the many gods believed in that... and he was wrong.
LUDENDORFF=>You know nothing about the gods --
LUDENDORFF=>My apologies. You'll excuse me. Enjoy the fireworks.
DIANA=>What are you doing?
STEVE=>You agreed to wait.
DIANA=>You agree to do things all the time then don't do them. Let me go --
STEVE=>You can't kill Ludendorff inside German High Command. The Armistice won't be signed.
DIANA=>It won't matter --
STEVE=>What if you're wrong, Diana? What if there is no Ares?
DIANA=>You don't believe me.
STEVE=>I can't let you do this.
DIANA=>What I do isn't up to you.
STEVE=>Diana!
STEVE=>The gas.
DIANA=>The village.
SAMEER=>They're cheering.
SAMEER=>Diana!
THE CHIEF=>What did they fire?
STEVE=>It was Ludendorff.
CHARLIE=>I see him.
STEVE=>Wherever he goes you follow him.
SAMEER=>How will you find us?!
THE CHIEF=>I know how.
DIANA=>No. Oh, no, no, no.
STEVE=>Diana.
DIANA=>They're dead. They're all dead. YOU DID THIS!
STEVE=>Diana, I'm sorry --
DIANA=>You stopped me from killing Ares when I had the chance. You murderer! You killed these people!
STEVE=>No, I --
DIANA=>STAY AWAY FROM ME!
DIANA=>Everything you've said to me is a lie. But I see the truth now. It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted. It's you, too. It's all of you.
DIANA=>I will find Ares and I will kill him.
STEVE=>It's a signal from The Chief. They followed Ludendorff --
STEVE=>Diana?!
LUDENDORFF=>Nice to see you again. This is a surprise.
LUDENDORFF=>But I have things to do.
DIANA=>You know why I'm here. I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta.
LUDENDORFF=>As magnificent a creature as you are, you are no match for me.
DIANA=>We'll see about that.
DIANA=>I, daughter of Hippolyta, came here to complete the mission of the Amazons by taking your life, and ridding mankind and my people of you -- forever!
STEVE=>Diana!
STEVE=>Diana?
DIANA=>I killed him. I killed Ares but nothing stopped. You kill the God of War, you stop the war.
STEVE=>Right... Then we've got to do something about it.
DIANA=>No! Steve. All of this should have stopped. The fighting. It should have stopped. So why are they doing this?!
STEVE=>Diana, I'm sorry... I know you thought -- I hoped it, too -- but I knew --
DIANA=>You knew what?!
STEVE=>That it might not be that simple.
DIANA=>But Ares is dead. They don't have to do this anymore. So why would they?!
STEVE=>Because maybe people aren't... just good, Diana. Ares or no Ares. Maybe it's... just them.
DIANA=>No... It can't be... Everything I saw? They were killing each other. Killing people they can't even see... Killing children. Like it was nothing... It had to be him!! It can't be them!
STEVE=>Diana, sometimes people are complicated --
DIANA=>My mother was right. She said `the world of men don't deserve you.' That's why she left. They don't deserve our help.
STEVE=>It's not about whether they deserve it or not. It's about what you believe. You think I don't get it? All I've seen out there? I wish I could tell you that there was one `bad guy' to blame. Maybe we're all to blame. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to do better. And if you believe this war should stop, Diana, if you want to stop it, then help me stop it. Now.
STEVE=>If we don't, they're going to kill thousands more.
STEVE=>Don't give up on them. Don't give up on me.
STEVE=>Please. We gotta go... I have to.
SAMEER=>Where's Diana?
STEVE=>We're on our own.
DIANA=>Steve?
DIANA=>Who's there? What are you doing?
VOICE=>I've been waiting for you to see the truth.
DIANA=>Sir Patrick?
SIR PATRICK=>You're right, Diana. They don't deserve our help. They only deserve destruction.
DIANA=>You're him. You.
SIR PATRICK=>I am. But I'm not what you thought I was. You blame me, but the truth is... ... all of this -- I did none of it.
CHARLIE=>I can't see where they're taking the gas.
SAMEER=>Wherever Diana is, I think we're gonna need her.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>I am not your enemy, Diana. I am the only one who truly knows you. And who truly knows them as you now do. They have always been, and always will be weak, cruel, selfish, and capable of the greatest horror...
DIANA=>I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta... and I am here to complete her mission --
DIANA=>The Godkiller...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>The Godkiller? Oh, child. That is not the Godkiller. You are. Only a god can kill another god.
DIANA=>I --
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Zeus left the daughter he had with the Queen of the Amazons as a weapon to use against me.
DIANA=>You lie!
DIANA=>I compel you to tell me the truth!
ARES=>I am.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>I am not the God of War, Diana. I am the god of truth... All I ever wanted was to show my father how evil his creation was. But he refused.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Mankind stole the world from us. They ruined it, day-by-day.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>And I, the only one wise enough to see it, was left too weak to destroy them myself...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>All these years, I've struggled. Whispering into their ears...
SIR PATRICK=>Ideas. Inspiration. For weapons. Formulas. But I don't make them use them... they start these wars on their own.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>All I do is orchestrate an armistice I know they will break, in the hope they will destroy themselves. But it's never been enough... When you first arrived I was going to end you, Diana. Then I felt something I haven't for thousands of years. Stronger.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>It was your power. Healing me more than you could ever hurt me.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>And I knew that if only you could see what the other gods couldn't...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>All the suffering. All the pain and destruction they create. You would join me.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>We could return the world to the paradise it was before them. And there would be absolute peace, Diana. Forever.
DIANA=>No... No, I'd never be a part of that.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Oh, Diana... my dear sister... I don't want to fight you -- -- but if I must...
CHARLIE=>Hurry up! They're onto us!
STEVE=>Sammy, let's go!
DR. MARU=>Forget about them! Come on, move! Go now!
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Oh, my dear. You have so much to learn.
CHARLIE=>What are we going to do?
STEVE=>There's not much we can do... if that's what I think it is.
STEVE=>But we can stop that plane.
CHARLIE=>If we radio ahead? We can ask Air Corps to shoot her down.
STEVE=>No, if it crashes, it'll wipe out everyone for fifty square miles. We gotta ground it.
SAMEER=>Bad news. It's on a timer. If we ground it here, same thing.
STEVE=>Is it flammable, Chief?
THE CHIEF=>Yeah, she said it was hydrogen? It's flammable.
STEVE=>I need you guys to clear me a path to that plane.
CHARLIE=>No, Steve!
SAMEER=>Steve!
DIANA=>What?
THE CHIEF=>Don't shoot! The whole thing could go!
CHARLIE=>Come on, this way! Steve!
DIANA=>Steve!
STEVE=>I have the plane.
CHARLIE=>But, Steve --
STEVE=>You destroy the lab! Go!
SAMEER=>If we go in there, we're not coming back.
PILOT=>You hit that, we all go up. The co-pilot nods, puts his gun away -- spots another weapon. The co-pilot rips a FIRE HATCHET off the wall, swinging it hard. Steve dodges the hatchet -- then slams his fist into the co-pilot, sending him back against the GAS BOMBS --
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Is that all you have to offer me?
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>It is futile, sister. But keep trying.
DIANA=>Steve...
DIANA=>Steve...
DIANA=>NO!!!!
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Yes, Diana. Don't stop...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Do it... fight.
SIR PATRICK=>You came here with such hope and determination and look at you now. Mankind did this to you. Join me in the fight... and we can destroy them forever!
SIR PATRICK/ARES SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Look at her and tell me I'm WRONG. Take her. And then take them all...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>She is the perfect example of these humans. And unworthy of your sympathy in every way.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>Destroy her, Diana.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>You know she deserves it, they all do!
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>See the truth for yourself!
STEVE=>Diana...
STEVE=>Diana! I have to go.
DIANA=>What are you saying? Steve, whatever it is, I can do it. Let me do it --
STEVE=>No. It has to be me. I can save today, you can save the world. I wish we had more time.
DIANA=>What?
STEVE=>I love you.
DIANA=>You're wrong about them...
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>NO!
DIANA=>They're everything you say, but so much more.
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>LIES!
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>They do not deserve your protection.
DIANA=>It's not about deserve...
DIANA=>It's about what you believe... and I believe in love --
SIR PATRICK/ARES=>I WILL DESTROY YOU! THEN I WILL DESTROY THEM!
DIANA=>Good-bye, brother.
ETTA=>You saved everyone.
DIANA=>Steve did that.
CHARLIE=>Did Etta tell you? That General whats-his-name, you know --
ETTA=>Haig.
CHARLIE=>He only went and made us all spies! Oops. We're off to Petrograd! Oops.
ETTA=>There's a revolution going on. Even Chief's coming. You should, too.
DIANA=>I don't think so.
SAMEER=>Behind all beauty, all wisdom, there is pain. You must take your pain and make it beautiful.
DIANA=>Where did you read that?
SAMEER=>I didn't. You taught us that.
DIANA=>I used to want to save the world.
DIANA=>To end war and bring peace to mankind.
DIANA=>But now I've touched the darkness that lives in between the light. Seen the terrible things men do to each other in the name of hatred... and the lengths they'll go to for love. And now I know that only love can truly save the world. So I stay and I fight and I give for the love I know can be. This is my mission now. Forever.
VENELIA=>My Queen --
HIPPOLYTA=>I know. The Mother Box... it has awoken. Alert everyone.
HIPPOLYTA=>Something terrible is coming. SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
