SOLDIER=>Captain...!
CAPTAIN=>Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near. Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over.
CAPTAIN=>You! Over here!
CAPTAIN=>Preacher...
CAPTAIN=>The one with the gun...
PREACHER=>Reload!
AGONIZED VOICE=>RETREAT!!!
PREACHER=>Colonel -­ Colonel, do you copy?!
THE COLONEL=>Who is this?
PREACHER=>Preacher -- it's Preacher, sir -- !
THE COLONEL=>Where are you, soldier? I need your position.
PREACHER=>I don't know -- !
THE COLONEL=>What do you see?
PREACHER=>I can't see anything! We lost a lot of men, sir -- the captain is dead!
THE COLONEL=>You're in command now.
PREACHER=>Command, sir? I think it's just me by myself now!
THE COLONEL=>By yourself?
PREACHER=>Sir, I don't think I'm gonna make it...! I'm sorry -- I'm so sorry!
THE COLONEL=>I understand, soldier. Just kill as many as you can.
PREACHER=>...it's... Alpha Omega.
LANG=>Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us.
MAURICE=>[Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.]
PREACHER=>You're him... You're Caesar.
PREACHER=>We've been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere...
TRAVIS=>Just kill us already...
LANG=>Shut up, man --
TRAVIS=>What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us --
CAESAR=>I... did not start this war.
CAESAR=>The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. I only fight now... to protect apes.
TRAVIS=>Yeah? What about him? And we got ten more just like him.
CAESAR=>I know these apes. They followed Koba... They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive.
RED=>I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything.
RED=>He say: first Caesar die... then you all die.
CAESAR=>[Get him out of here.]
LUCA=>[What should we do with them?]
PREACHER=>You're letting us live...?
CAESAR=>Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die.
MAURICE=>[Do you really think they'll give him the message?]
CAESAR=>They are the message. I showed them mercy. He will see we are not savages. Let's hope this works. They are getting closer...
WINTER=>[Red attacked me! He got away!]
WINTER=>[I'm sorry...]
CAESAR=>Why didn't I see, Maurice?
MAURICE=>[See what?]
CAESAR=>That Koba could not forgive what humans did to him when he was their prisoner. That he would seek revenge. I should have known.
MAURICE=>[No one could have known how much darkness was living inside of him.]
BLUE EYES=>[Hello, Father...]
CAESAR=>Welcome home, Rocket. You look tired.
ROCKET=>[It was a long journey --]
BLUE EYES=>[Father, we found something!]
CAESAR=>Come inside!
BLUE EYES=>[Mother...!]
CORNELIA=>[Cornelius, don't you recognize your brother?]
CORNELIA=>[Someone else missed you too...]
BLUE EYES=>[This is it, Father. We can start over. A new home.]
CORNELIA=>[What is beyond those mountains, son?]
BLUE EYES=>[A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.]
WINTER=>[We must leave tonight!]
LAKE=>[Tonight? That's impossible!]
WINTER=>[How much longer can we wait? Soldiers are getting closer!]
BLUE EYES=>[Winter...]
WINTER=>[Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!]
BLUE EYES=>[I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...]
CAESAR=>Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely.
CAESAR=>There were two of you. But we are many.
MAURICE=>[The woods are filled with soldiers.]
BLUE EYES=>Father... We must try.
CAESAR=>I know, son. More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer.
CAESAR=>We will find a way out...
CAESAR=>Apes together strong.
BLUE EYES=>[Can't sleep?]
BLUE EYES=>[Trust me, father. This is a risk worth taking.]
CAESAR=>[I am so proud of you.] [I love you, son.]
CAESAR=>[Stay here. Protect your mother and brother.]
LUCA=>[Sorry, Caesar.]
CAESAR=>[How many others on patrol?]
LUCA=>[Five? Six--?]
CAESAR=>[Get them! Rocket too!]
FEMALE SOLDIER=>Lima-two to command. Colonel, intel's good. I'm in the target area. Are you close?
SOLDIER=>Lima-four to command. Colonel, did you get him--?
CAESAR=>Rocket! What happened?!
ROCKET=>[I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!]
THE COLONEL=>99, target acquired!...
THE COLONEL=>...Repeat, target is down! I got him. Let's go! I can get out from here!
THE COLONEL=>Get me out! Now!!
SPEAR=>[Luca! We can't find Winter. He wasn't at his post.]
MAURICE=>[He was scared. Could he have turned against us?]
LUCA=>[Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us. I'm sorry. He was in my command.]
CAESAR=>My youngest son... Have you found him yet?
LUCA=>[We're still looking.]
MAURICE=>[Let's help them search.]
CAESAR=>Cornelius... you're safe now, son.
CAESAR=>You loved my son. Look after his brother until I return.
LAKE=>[You're not coming with us?]
CAESAR=>No.
MAURICE=>[Caesar! You're not going after them?!]
CAESAR=>Not them... Him.
MAURICE=>[Caesar, you are our leader! We can't leave without you!]
CAESAR=>You must. The soldiers will be back soon.
CORNELIUS=>[Father!]
CAESAR=>When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me. That may give you the best chance to get out of the woods. Until then, be safe.
LUCA=>[The soldiers' camp is always moving. My guards think they know where it is. Let me take you.]
ROCKET=>[You'll need me to back you up.]
CAESAR=>No.
ROCKET=>[Please... I know what it's like... to lose a son.]
CAESAR=>I might not make it back.
MAURICE=>[That's why I'm coming. To make sure you do.]
LUCA=>[This is where the guards thought they might be. There are always fires burning.]
MAN=>I'm just gonna... put this down --
LUCA=>[Is he out here alone?]
ROCKET=>[Maybe he's a deserter?]
CAESAR=>Look around. Take what we can use.
MAURICE=>[Something wrong with her. I don't think she can speak.]
CAESAR=>Come.
MAURICE=>[She'll die out here alone.]
CAESAR=>We cannot take her.
MAURICE=>[I understand...] [But I cannot leave her.]
MAURICE=>[Must be where they bury the dead.]
CAESAR=>Looks like some were killed here.
LUCA=>[They burned their things too.]
MAURICE=>[Why would they kill their own men?]
LUCA=>[Did you find the Colonel...?]
CAESAR=>Winter...
BOYLE=>Donkey. Over here.
RED=>Ok -- Ok... He come...
BOYLE=>Hey! Hey! You stupid-- !
A VOICE=>Come on, Boyle...
BOYLE=>Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go.
BOYLE=>Get me a new bowl.
CAESAR=>Where is the Colonel?
WINTER=>[He's gone.]
CAESAR=>...Gone?
WINTER=>[This morning. He took many soldiers with him.]
WINTER=>[Men are coming down here ­- from their base in the north. The Colonel and his soldiers are going to meet them at the border.]
CAESAR=>What border? Why?
WINTER=>[I don't know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.]
WINTER=>[Please... I know I betrayed you. But can't you see? We'll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...]
CAESAR=>My son... my wife... are dead.
ROCKET=>[Winter had it coming!]
LUCA=>[Caesar had no choice!]
MAURICE=>[So what do we do now?]
ROCKET=>[Wait for the soldiers to leave. Follow them to the Colonel.]
CAESAR=>...Koba?
KOBA=>Ape... not kill ape...
MAURICE=>[The soldiers are going!]
CAESAR=>[Is that them up ahead?]
ROCKET=>[Looks like they stopped!]
CAESAR=>[Don't let them see us!]
ROCKET=>[What are they shooting at?!]
CAESAR=>I don't know...
ROCKET=>[They're gone...]
CAESAR=>What is that...?
CAESAR=>Why... did they shoot you?
MAURICE=>[He can not speak either...?]
CAESAR=>Help me get him up...
MAURICE=>[What is wrong with them...?]
MAURICE=>[Where could they have gone?!]
CAESAR=>Winter said they were heading to a border...!
LUCA=>[Yes, but which way is that?!]
SCRAWNY CHIMP=>Bad... ape... Bad ape...
ROCKET=>[Who are you?]
LUCA=>[Where are you from?]
LUCA=>[I don't think he understands.]
ROCKET=>[I don't recognize him. He's not one of us.]
CAESAR=>Are you... alone here?
BAD APE=>Cold...?
BAD APE=>Cold.
BAD APE=>I see girl. Think... you human. But you... apes. Like me!
CAESAR=>You... live here?
BAD APE=>Long time. Long, long time.
BAD APE=>Home. Old home.
CAESAR=>Are there more like you? More apes? From zoo?
BAD APE=>Dead. All dead. Long time.
BAD APE=>Humans get sick... Apes get smart...
BAD APE=>Then humans kill apes. But not me... Not me. I run.
CAESAR=>You learn to speak...?
BAD APE=>Listen to human...
BAD APE=>"Bad ape! Bad ape!"
BAD APE=>No... No touch.
MAURICE=>[Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.]
BAD APE=>Here! Eat, eat! New friends. Special day.
CAESAR=>Where did you get this?
BAD APE=>Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick.
BAD APE=>Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead.
CAESAR=>Bad humans...? Soldiers?
BAD APE=>Soldiers.
ROCKET=>[An old, deserted military camp on the border...?]
LUCA=>[Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?]
CAESAR=>Is it far? Can you take us?
BAD APE=>Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back!
CAESAR=>Please. You must take us.
BAD APE=>No! Can not take! Can not take!
BAD APE=>Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here. Look, look!
BAD APE=>You stay here. Eat. Rest. With me.
BAD APE=>Here. You keep.
BAD APE=>Who is...?
BAD APE=>Child.
CAESAR=>I don't know.
BAD APE=>But she... with you?
CAESAR=>She has no one else.
BAD APE=>I see you look at her. Just now. Look sad.
BAD APE=>You... have child?
CAESAR=>I had two. But one was killed. By human.
BAD APE=>Oh... Soldier?
BAD APE=>I had child...
BAD APE=>You think... you will find him... at human zoo? Soldier?
CAESAR=>I don't know... Maybe.
BAD APE=>Then... maybe I take you.
MAURICE=>[Thirsty.] [Thirsty.]
BAD APE=>There...
CAESAR=>[Luca, let's take a closer look.] [Stay here. Keep them safe.]
LUCA=>[What are they doing?]
CAESAR=>I don't know...
LUCA=>[What's that? A patrol?]
CAESAR=>Don't see riders...
ROCKET=>[I saw them from up there... Coming for you...]
LUCA=>[At least this time... I was able to protect you...]
MAURICE=>[I know how much you have lost... But now we have lost another.]
MAURICE=>[Please... it's not too late to leave this place. To rejoin the others.]
ROCKET=>[Luca gave his life! We can not turn back -- !]
MAURICE=>[Caesar...]
CAESAR=>They must pay...
MAURICE=>[Now you sound like Koba.]
CAESAR=>...Koba? You know nothing. My wife and son were killed. And now my friend. You call me Koba...?!
CAESAR=>I did not ask you to come. Any of you. This is my fight. I will finish it alone... Go now. Join the others.
CAESAR=>What happened?
SPEAR=>[They came out of nowhere, attacked us... We were sure they would kill us all -- but the Colonel stopped them!]
SPEAR=>[There was madness in his eyes! He said they would use us, before we died.]
CAESAR=>Use you...?
SPEAR=>[They've been forcing us to work!]
CAESAR=>What... kind of work...?
CAESAR=>Wait -- my little son -- is he here...?
THE COLONEL=>Grant and Lee... Wellington and Napoleon...
THE COLONEL=>Custer... and Sitting Bull. You're probably not much of a reader. But this is... this is a big moment. This is... beyond... historic.
THE COLONEL=>Where were you...? We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren't with them.
THE COLONEL=>I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot.
THE COLONEL=>Have you finally come to save your apes?
CAESAR=>I... didn't know they were here. I came for you.
THE COLONEL=>I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...?
CAESAR=>My... family.
THE COLONEL=>I'm sorry. I was there to kill you.
THE COLONEL=>My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human... How did you know I was here?
CAESAR=>I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here.
THE COLONEL=>Joining me...?
CAESAR=>To finish us off... for good.
THE COLONEL=>Who told you that?
THE COLONEL=>Ok, let's go.
RED=>Ok -- ok, Kerna...!
TOWER GUARD=>Evening, Colonel!
THE COLONEL=>Any more trouble tonight?
TOWER GUARD=>No, sir -- not anymore --
THE COLONEL=>You could use a haircut there, son. You too, soldier.
BOTH TOWER GUARDS=>Sir, yessir!
LAKE=>[Forgive them. We've been through much.]
CAESAR=>I will find some way to get us out of here. I promise...
LAKE=>[You don't know what this place is like.]
CORNELIUS=>[Father...!]
SOLDIERS=>MAKES THE GRASS GROW!!
SOLDIERS=>MAKE THE BLOOD FLOW!!
SOLDIERS=>AND THE END!!
LAKE=>[We haven't had food or water since we got here...]
CAESAR=>[Why do they need a wall...?]
BOYLE=>HEY! HEY!
CAESAR=>LEAVE HIM!!!
THE COLONEL=>...Ok. Back to work.
CAESAR=>Apes need food. Water.
THE COLONEL=>Please. Tell them to work.
CAESAR=>Give them food and wat--
THE COLONEL=>Tell them.
THE COLONEL=>Five... Four...
THE COLONEL=>Three... Two...
THE COLONEL=>String him up, donkey.
BAD APE=>Bad place...
BAD APE=>Bad, bad place.
BAD APE=>What? What you see...?
ROCKET=>[Must save them! But how?]
MAURICE=>[Must think! What would Caesar do?]
BAD APE=>Oh no!
BAD APE=>Why so small?
BAD APE=>Ohhhh...
PREACHER=>Alright -- that's good.
PREACHER=>Look, I owe you one, so let me set you straight here, ok? I think he respects you, he does... that's why you're still alive. But believe me, he can do a lot worse than this. I've seen it. You do not want to agitate the man. Understand? So just...
CAESAR=>What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone?
CAESAR=>No matter what you do... you'll never be one of them. You let them call you "donkey"... You are ape.
RED=>Koba right. You think you know better... than rest of apes. But look you now. You nothing.
RED=>Kerna... want see you.
THE COLONEL=>Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall.
CAESAR=>Apes... need food... water.
THE COLONEL=>They'll get food and water when they finish the work.
CAESAR=>Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish.
THE COLONEL=>You know you're very emotional. What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?
PREACHER=>C'mon --
CAESAR=>The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they?
CAESAR=>I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle...
THE COLONEL=>I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive.
THE COLONEL=>No. They won't be joining me.
CAESAR=>They are against you?
THE COLONEL=>They... fear me.
CAESAR=>Why...?
CAESAR=>Because you kill your own men?
CAESAR=>We found bodies. Something wrong... with these men.
THE COLONEL=>Jesus Christ... you are impressive.
THE COLONEL=>Well, you paint quite a picture. What you must think of me.
CAESAR=>I think... you have no mercy.
THE COLONEL=>You came here to kill me. Were you going to show me mercy?
CAESAR=>I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace. And you killed my family.
THE COLONEL=>Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?
THE COLONEL=>You're much stronger than we are. And you're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us, that's the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now.
THE COLONEL=>Ten months ago, we sent out recon units to look for your base. They found nothing. My own son was a soldier with one of the groups. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became... primitive. Like an animal. They contacted me, said they thought he lost his mind, that the war was too much for him. But then the man caring for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking. That the virus that almost wiped us out -- the virus every human survivor still carries ­- had suddenly changed... Mutated.
THE COLONEL=>And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts... not unlike what you all used to be. You talk about mercy...? What would you have done?
THE COLONEL=>Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child. He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear.
THE COLONEL=>I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might've been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too. Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That's when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past.
CAESAR=>You killed them too...?
THE COLONEL=>What did I do, Preacher?
PREACHER=>You severed their heads, sir.
THE COLONEL=>Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves.
THE COLONEL=>This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain. This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we'll become your cattle.
THE COLONEL=>Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't you.
CAESAR=>How many... will be coming?
THE COLONEL=>Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you.
THE COLONEL=>I didn't mean to kill your son...
THE COLONEL=>But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... then I'm glad I did.
PREACHER=>HEY -- HEY-HEY-HEY!!!
THE COLONEL=>So emotional!
THE COLONEL=>I can see how conflicted you are. You're confused in your purpose. You're angry at me because of something I did that was an act of war. But you're taking this all much too personally.
PREACHER=>...sir --
THE COLONEL=>What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me?
THE COLONEL=>Or is killing me more important...?
PREACHER=>Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man...
CAESAR=>If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can.
PREACHER=>Leave? What are you talking about?
CAESAR=>You are not like him.
PREACHER=>He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now.
PREACHER=>C'mon, kong.
MAURICE=>[How is he?]
LAKE=>[You look weary.]
CAESAR=>[Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.]
PREACHER=>Get off!
MAURICE=>[How will we get in? Humans everywhere.]
ROCKET=>[Must get in somehow...]
BAD APE=>"In"...? "In"?
BAD APE=>No -- no go in -- !
BAD APE=>Friends! Friends! No go in -- no go iiii--
BAD APE=>Thank you, friend -- thank you --
LAKE=>[You saved our lives...]
MAURICE=>[Sick humans must have tried to escape underground!]
BAD APE=>No no no -- no climb -- !
BAD APE=>No, no! Where you go?!
BAD APE=>What? What you see...?
ROCKET=>[Must be under the camp by now!]
MAURICE=>[Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?]
BAD APE=>Ohhhh no, friend...
BAD APE=>He --
BAD APE=>No!
BAD APE=>No no no... no no no...
CAESAR=>Koba...
KOBA=>Sleep...
KOBA=>Let go... You cannot save them... They will all die here...
CAESAR=>No...
KOBA=>Yes... Join me...
THE COLONEL=>If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him. Keep him separate from the others.
BAD APE=>IN! She go IN!
THE GIRL=>[Thirsty...?]
APE=>[Apes together strong.]
MAURICE=>[If humans see her, they will kill her...]
THE COLONEL=>How many are out there? Are there others?
THE COLONEL=>Sweep the area. Put him in the pen.
ROCKET=>[Feeling better?]
ROCKET=>[Good. Then we can talk about escape.]
THE COLONEL=>For two years we've fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we've been waging all this time is against ourselves.
THE COLONEL=>They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world.
THE COLONEL=>Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they'll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...? And you can tell them, you fought... viciously... for a gentler world.
THE COLONEL=>Send him up to the quarry. Alone.
THE COLONEL=>Boyle! His cuffs.
THE COLONEL=>What is this...?
THE COLONEL=>How did this get in there?
PREACHER=>I really don't know, sir...
THE COLONEL=>Get him to work.
ROCKET=>[37.]
LAKE=>[55.]
TANKER GUARD=>That's high enough, kong!
CAESAR=>[37 steps to the adult cage... 55 to the children.]
RED=>You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow... when wall is done.
CAESAR=>His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you.
RED=>I save myself.
CAESAR=>Is there anything left... of you to save?
MAURICE=>[You are very brave.]
MAURICE=>[Brave.]
THE GIRL=>[...Brave?]
THE GIRL=>[Ape?]
THE GIRL=>[Me...? Ape?]
MAURICE=>[You are...]
MAURICE=>Nova.
BAD APE=>Come! Come see!
BAD APE=>...35 ...36 ...37.
BAD APE=>What now?
BAD APE=>What.
BAD APE=>Ohhh no. No no no... Noooo--
BAD APE=>Ok.
ROCKET=>[This is the ape I told you about.]
LOOK-OUT=>[Thank you.]
BAD APE=>...Bad Ape. Bad Ape... Bad Ape...
ROCKET=>[What's wrong?]
ROCKET=>[There's a problem.]
ROCKET=>[We can't dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!]
LAKE=>[If we don't dig further, we'll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?]
LAKE=>[We have to keep looking down there, see if there's another way to reach the children...]
CAESAR=>[We must leave tonight!]
CAESAR=>[We'll have to get the children out above ground!]
ROCKET=>[How...?]
BOYLE=>Hey -- you animals!
BOYLE=>Who did that?!
BOYLE=>SONUVA--!!!
BOYLE=>You...
THE COLONEL=>Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor.
THE COLONEL=>You apes are so strong... I wonder... what kind of world you would have built... on our graves.
THE COLONEL=>You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together.
CAESAR=>...Malcolm?
THE COLONEL=>I think that was his name, yes.
CAESAR=>He... was a friend.
THE COLONEL=>He said you were remarkable. More than just an animal...
THE COLONEL=>you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant. He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you.
CAESAR=>What... happened to this man?
THE COLONEL=>I shot him.
THE COLONEL=>What's going on here?
ROCKET=>[...What was that?]
ROCKET=>[Do you think he knows we're up to something?]
ROCKET=>[Now?]
CAESAR=>[Wait till he turns out his lights.]
ROCKET=>[The sun will be up soon...]
CAESAR=>[We go now. Or die trying.]
CAESAR=>I love you, son...
BAD APE=>It's ok, little ones... come, come.
BAD APE=>Go! Go go go...!
ROCKET=>[Hurry! Let's go!]
ROCKET=>[Caesar, what's wrong?]
CAESAR=>By the time the sun rises, you'll all be on your way... to a new home. Hurry, you must go.
ROCKET=>[Without you? No...]
CAESAR=>Maurice was right. I am like Koba. He could not escape his hate... And I still cannot escape mine. He took too much from me.
CAESAR=>Go...
SOLDIER=>Holy shit -- they're here!!!
COLONEL! COLONEL!!!=>OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER!
SOLDIER=>I CAN'T! IT'S BLOCKED FROM INSIDE, SIR!
SOLDIER=>I DON'T KNOW, SIR! WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE COLONEL ALL NIGHT!
PREACHER=>Jesus Christ...
PREACHER=>THE APES!!! THEY'RE GONE!!!
BAD APE=>Hurry! Go go go!
ROCKET=>[Let me through!]
GUNNER=>LOOK!!! THE APES!!!
GUNNER=>Kill them, man!!! Kill them all!!!
GUNNER=>...Donkey -- DONKEY!!!
