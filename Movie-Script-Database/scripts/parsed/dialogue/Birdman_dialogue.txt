MAN=>How did we end up here? This place is a fucking dump.
MAN=>Smells like balls.
MAN=>We don't belong in this shithole.
RIGGAN=>Sam, I can't--
SAM=>Dad? What kind of--
SHUT UP!!!=>What kind of flowers did you say you wanted?
RIGGAN=>Alchemillas. Or something soothing that smells nice. Listen I can't--
SAM=>It all smells like fucking Kimchi!
RIGGAN=>Then whatever looks nice. Anything but roses. No roses.
KOREAN=>Flowers don't need you touch! They need you buy!!!
SAM=>I hate this job.
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS=>Riggan, they're starting scene five. We need you on stage.
RIGGAN=>Shit... Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He hurries out...
STAGE HAND=>Mr. Thomson.
RIGGAN=>Steve.
STAGE HAND=>It's Daniel.
RIGGAN=>Okay.
JAKE=>How's it going, buddy.
RIGGAN=>Great. It'd be even better if I could get Ralph to stop acting like he's in an educational video for syphilis... The camera moves off of them and onto...
LESLEY=>He loved me.
RALPH=>Yeah. He loved her so much he tried to kill her.
LAURA=>He tried to kill you?
LESLEY=>No. Okay, well, he did beat me up one night. He dragged me around the living room by my ankles, yelling "I love you, I love 10/29/14 / 4.
LESLEY=>you, bitch." What do you do with a love like that?
RALPH=>How is that-- That is not love and you know it. Why do you insist on calling it--
LESLEY=>You can say what you want, but I know what it was.
RALPH=>What about you, Nick? Does that sound like love to you?
RIGGAN=>Sorry I'm late. I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute.
RALPH=>Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is... The kind of love I'm talking about, you don't try and kill people.
LESLEY=>It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't care what anybody says. He was ready to die for it.
RALPH=>Ask her what he did after she left him.
LESLEY=>He shot himself in the mouth. But he screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.
RALPH=>Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.
LAURA=>How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in the mouth?
RALPH=>He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived like fugitives those days. I never knew-- 10/29/14 / 5.
RIGGAN=>Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How many times do I have to-- Fugitives are scared. Give me more of that.
RALPH=>We lived like fugitives those days...
RALPH=>...I never knew if he was going to come out of the bushes or from behind a car and just start shooting.
RALPH=>The man was crazy. He was capable of anything.
LAURA=>Christ. What a nightmare...
RALPH=>He used to call me at the hospital and say... "Son of a bitch. Your days are numbered."
RALPH=>Too much? Little bit? I just wanted to give you a range, so you could--
LAURA=>Holy shit. 10/29/14 / 6.
LESLEY=>Is he breathing?
JAKE=>Someone call 911! Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.
LAURA=>Is that blood coming out of his ear?
JAKE=>Where are you going?
LESLEY=>Okay, he's breathing. What did he have for lunch?
LAURA=>Did anyone call for help?
ANNIE=>Wake up! Wake up!
CREW MEMBER=>Grab his legs. I got the top.
JAKE=>Don't move him! Wait for the ambulance. For the love of God! I could get a black audience in this theater faster than a doctor!
JAKE=>Where are you going? We'll have the understudy ready to rehearse in five-- 10/29/14 / 7.
RIGGAN=>Forget the understudy. We have to postpone the preview.
JAKE=>What are you-- It's a full house. We would have to refund all the--
RIGGAN=>Then do it. A crew member passes in the opposite direction.
CREW MEMBER=>How's Ralph?
RIGGAN=>He'll be fine.
JAKE=>Wait. Wait. Fuck. Wait.
RIGGAN=>Listen to me. It was going to be a disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear was the most honest thing he's done so far.
JAKE=>He's not that bad.
JAKE=>Okay, he's fucking horrible. But--
JAKE=>You have the press in your dressing room in a few hours. How are we--
RIGGAN=>I'll make something up.
RIGGAN=>Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't an accident.
JAKE=>What do you mean?
RIGGAN=>I-- I made it happen.
JAKE=>Oh. Okay. Are you drunk?
RIGGAN=>Find me an actor. A good actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman...
JAKE=>He's doing the third Hunger Games.
RIGGAN=>Michael Fassbender?
JAKE=>Doing the prequel to the X-Men prequel. They arrive at Riggan's dressing room.
RIGGAN=>What's his name? Jeremy Renner...
JAKE=>Who?
RIGGAN=>The... the Hurt Locker guy.
JAKE=>Yeah. He's an Avenger.
RIGGAN=>Fuck. They put him in a cape, too? Look, I don't care. Find me someone. Riggan enters...
JAKE=>Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got a case.
RIGGAN=>Then make him go away.
JAKE=>How do you suggest I do that?
RIGGAN=>You're my lawyer, my producer and my oldest friend. We are going to make this work. Now just get out there and do what you were born to do.
JAKE=>What's that?
RIGGAN=>I have no idea. But I have faith. Now go away from me.
JAKE=>Do you think we should--
BLOND WOMAN=>...and when we come back, an exclusive interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells us about the billion-dollar Iron Man franchise. The talented actor invited us onto the set of Iron Man 3...
MAN=>That clown doesn't have half your talent and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man get up.
RIGGAN=>"Breathing in, I embrace my anger. Breathing out, I smile to it."
BIRDMAN=>Embrace it. Kiss it. Turn it around and fuck it in the--
RIGGAN=>Not now!
LAURA=>Can I come in?
RIGGAN=>No.
LAURA=>Okay. Two words. Shia La Beouf.
RIGGAN=>That's three words.
LAURA=>It's two.
RIGGAN=>Get out.
LAURA=>I love you.
LAURA=>I take it we're not going to dinner anymore?
RIGGAN=>I don't have an actor.
LAURA=>I don't have a life.
RIGGAN=>Laura...
LAURA=>Fine. Whatever. You remember at Joan's when you asked me to come do a Broadway play with you? You said it would be fun... 10/29/14 / 11.
RIGGAN=>Go away.
LAURA=>So far? No fun.
BIRDMAN=>Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting the fuck out of here before we humiliate ourselves. That would be fun.
GABRIEL=>Why does somebody go from playing the lead in a comic book franchise to adapting Raymond Carver for the stage?
GABRIEL=>I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes said, "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry detergent commercials and comic strip characters." It's a big leap you've taken...
RIGGAN=>Well... Absolutely. As you said... that Barthes said... Birdman, like Icarus...
CLARA=>Hang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which Birdman was he in?
GABRIEL=>Roland Barthes was a French philosopher, who--
CLARA=>Oh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been injecting yourself with semen from baby pigs?
RIGGAN=>What?
CLARA=>As a method of facial rejuvenation.
RIGGAN=>Who told you that?
CLARA=>It was tweeted by... @prostatewhispers.
RIGGAN=>It's a lie.
CLARA=>I know. But did you do it?
RIGGAN=>No!
GABRIEL=>Are you afraid at all that people will say you're doing this play to battle the impression that you're a washed-up super hero?
RIGGAN=>No. I'm not. And that's exactly why 20 years ago I refused to do Birdman 4.
HAN=>Birdman 4??? You do Birdman 4???
JAKE=>Okay. That's enough for today. Thank you for coming. We're expecting some great pieces from you...
JAKE=>Publicity guys are trying to get you a Times feature. Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the wall.
JAKE=>So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you I wouldn't do that.
RIGGAN=>I don't want to look at it anymore.
JAKE=>That was a present from the crew. Don't fuck with those guys, they're union.
RIGGAN=>I don't care.
JAKE=>So... How'd it go?
RIGGAN=>Great.
JAKE=>Did they ask about Ralph?
RIGGAN=>Nope.
JAKE=>Good. He did it, you know? The motherfucker threatened to sue us. Didn't even wait to get out of the hospital.
RIGGAN=>And, what did you say? 10/29/14 / 14.
JAKE=>What'd I say? I said, "You motherfucker. You're threatening me? ME? I swear to god, you fuck, I so much as get a letter from a lawyer, the press'll get the pictures we got off your computer."
RIGGAN=>What pictures?
JAKE=>The guy has a thing for nuns... in diapers. What do you care? You shouldn't have any knowledge about it anyway. The important thing is that I made him go away.
RIGGAN=>Right. That's great.
JAKE=>Yeah, it's fantastic. One problem. We don't have an actor. And if we cancel the first preview the press will smell the blood. We can't afford to lose any more money. At all.
RIGGAN=>What do you want me to do?
JAKE=>We pay an understudy, let's use the understudy.
RIGGAN=>No.
JAKE=>No? Riggan, listen to me. Our dream actor is not going to knock on that door and say: "Hey fellas, when do we start?"
LESLIE=>Can I talk to you for a second?
RIGGAN=>Yeah. What's up?
LESLIE=>Did you find another actor?
RIGGAN=>No.
LESLIE=>Okay. Well... Mike's available.
RIGGAN=>He is?
JAKE=>Mike who?
RIGGAN=>I thought he was doing--
LESLIE=>He was. He quit. Or got fired.
JAKE=>Mike who?
RIGGAN=>Which one? Quit or fired?
LESLIE=>With Mike it's usually both.
JAKE=>Mike Fucking Who?
LESLIE=>Shiner.
JAKE=>Yes!
RIGGAN=>Jake...
JAKE=>Yes! How do you know Mike Shiner?
LESLIE=>We share a vagina.
RIGGAN=>You think he'd want to do it?
LESLIE=>Yeah.
JAKE=>How do you know?
LESLIE=>Because he said he'd want to do it.
JAKE=>Yes!
RIGGAN=>Jake. Hang on a minute.
JAKE=>Ask me if he sells tickets.
RIGGAN=>Does he sell tickets?
JAKE=>A shitload of tickets. Now ask me if the critics like him?
RIGGAN=>Do they like him?
JAKE=>They want to spooge on him.
RIGGAN=>Hey.
JAKE=>Leslie...
LESLIE=>Right on his face.
JAKE=>Everything for a reason, right?
RIGGAN=>You think he'll be able to come tonight?
LESLEY=>I can call him and find out.
JAKE=>I'll call his agent.
JAKE=>Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a fresh copy of the script. We're gonna have a "put in" tonight.
ANNIE=>Who?
JAKE=>You'll find out...
MIKE=>Intimidating. Isn't it?
MIKE=>Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson.
RIGGAN=>Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike. I appreciate it.
MIKE=>Hey. This is what we do. So, you wrote this adaptation?
RIGGAN=>I did.
MIKE=>And you're directing the adaptation and starring...
RIGGAN=>I am.
MIKE=>Ambitious.
RIGGAN=>Thank you.
MIKE=>Why don't we do a bit of it?
RIGGAN=>Hey, I wasn't expecting you to--
MIKE=>First preview is tomorrow, right?
RIGGAN=>Yeah, but you can go on with the script until you feel comfortable--
MIKE=>Let's just do some of it.
RIGGAN=>Take a look at page twenty--
MIKE=>Yeah. I don't need that.
RIGGAN=>What?
MIKE=>I don't need the script. Just give me a cue.
RIGGAN=>What are you talking about?
MIKE=>Feed me a line.
RIGGAN=>I don't-- What? 10/29/14 / 19.
MIKE=>Feed. Me. A line.
RIGGAN=>"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is that love is absolute."
MIKE=>Am I saying that love is absolute? "Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about is. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- Well, you don't try to kill people.
RIGGAN=>How do you know the lines?
MIKE=>I have a thing, a whatever, a gift. Come on, I helped Lesley get off book. Hey, give me that cue again.
RIGGAN=>"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't know the man. I've only heard his name mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know. You'd have to know the particulars. But I think what you're saying is--"
MIKE=>Okay, can I-- Do you mind if I--
RIGGAN=>No, go ahead.
MIKE=>Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong person to ask." What's his intention? Is he fed up with the topic? Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe? Then four sentences all say the same thing... "I didn't even know the man." 10/29/14 / 20.
MIKE=>"I've only heard his name mentioned in passing." "I wouldn't know." "You'd have to know the particulars." First of all, particulars? What are you, my grandmother? But the point is, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY, WE FUCKING GET IT. Make it one line. "I didn't even know the guy." Right? ...
RIGGAN=>You pretty much know my lines too, huh?
MIKE=>Can we-- Are we doing something here? Come on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me again.
RIGGAN=>"I'm the wrong person to ask--"
MIKE=>Oh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong person to ask?" That's another fuck you. "Don't put me on the spot. Don't make me self conscious about my marriage when my wife is sitting right here..." See? Give it to me. Give me a good fuck you. Come on...
RIGGAN=>Okay, let me--
MIKE=>Come on. Give it to me right now. Fuck me. Right now. Right here. Let's do it.
RIGGAN=>Okay, yeah...
MIKE DO IT! RIGGAN=>"Hey. I'm the wrong person to ask, okay? I didn't even know the guy. So what's your point?"
MIKE=>"What's my point?"
RIGGAN=>"What's your point? What are you saying? Spit it out. You're saying, what? That love is an absolute?" 10/29/14 / 21.
MIKE=>"Yeah! Alright? The kind of love I'm talking about is absolute. The kind of love I'm talking about you-- Well, you don't try to kill people.
MIKE=>So what do you think, boss? Do I have a job?
RIGGAN=>What do you think?
SAM=>Larry needs to see him for a fitting.
MIKE=>I'm gonna take that as a yes. And you are...?
RIGGAN=>That's my daughter, Sam.
MIKE=>Right. Yeah. I can see it around the... She doesn't look anything like you. And your job is...?
RIGGAN=>She's my assistant.
MIKE=>Your assistant... And can you speak?
SAM=>Yup. I can even 'sit', 'stay' or 'roll over' if you have any treats.
RIGGAN=>Welcome aboard, Mike.
MIKE=>Thank you, Captain.
MIKE=>I'm Mike Shiner, by the way.
SAM=>I know who you are. I saw you in 'Hothouse' at the Geffen. It was... great.
MIKE=>That ass is great.
SAM=>Dude. Seriously?
MIKE=>This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious.
LARRY=>Oh, thank the Lord and pass the biscuits! I finally have an actor to dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner.
MIKE=>How're you doing, Larry?
LARRY=>Better, now that you're here. Take off your clothes.
MIKE=>You gonna stand there?
SAM=>This is the theatre, honey. Don't be so self-conscious. Larry searches for a few costume pieces.
LARRY=>Okay. I'm gonna have to start from scratch, with less than twenty-four hours... Let's see if these--
LARRY=>Holy-- What is happening? Where are your underpants?
MIKE=>At home, under the bed, I think.
LARRY=>Okay. Everything is too small.
SAM=>Yeah, you're not kidding.
LESLEY=>Oh, that's nice... Forgive him, Larry. Mike's like my five year old son. Neither one of them has clean underwear...
LARRY=>Or pubic hair, I imagine. Okay, well, I can take out the suit but we're going to need some new pants and shirts. 10/29/14 / 24.
LARRY=>And underwear...
LESLEY=>This is too small. What the hell are you doing?
MIKE=>Waiting for Larry to finish.
LARRY=>I'm finished.
MIKE=>Okay, well, then I'm just standing here with my balls out.
LESLEY=>Get dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging around, and I don't need her to walk in here and--
MIKE=>Leslie...
LESLEY=>No, Mike. You haven't seen her. She's always hanging around, just-- I don't-- Watching everyone. It's creepy. It's--
MIKE=>Les...
LESLEY=>I don't know if the drugs fried her brain or what, but I don't need her running to her father saying you showed her your junk.
MIKE=>Okay, then we should probably get her out of here.
LESLEY=>Oh, God. Really?
MIKE=>Hey, Sammy...
SAM=>It's Sam.
LESLEY=>Fuck.
LESLEY=>I didn't mean--
SAM=>It's cool. He's a handful, huh?
LESLEY=>Almost.
LESLEY=>Jesus... How is it you always manage to find a new way to humiliate me?
MIKE=>To be fair, you make it really easy.
LESLEY=>What the hell was she doing here?
MIKE=>She brought me.
LESLEY=>And stayed???
MIKE=>I know, right? She's a little--
LESLEY=>Look at me, Mike. This is Broadway. I'm here. Finally. And I'm begging you, if you love me, please, do me a favor... don't fuck it up.
MIKE=>Come here.
MIKE=>Play with my balls...
MIKE=>I won't fuck it up... Probably! Larry reappears holding some clothes. We follow him out...
RIGGAN=>I don't care, sign it.
JAKE=>Listen to me.
RIGGAN=>No you listen to me--
JAKE=>I can't afford to listen to you...
LARRY=>I'm gonna need to go shopping again.
JAKE=>Fucking sew something, you old fuck!
RIGGAN=>I don't care. Give him what he wants.
JAKE=>His agent is asking for almost four times what we were paying--
RIGGAN=>Then go into the reserve.
JAKE=>The reserve is gone. You spent it on the fog. And those fake trees... 10/29/14 / 27.
RIGGAN=>It's a dream sequence, it--
JAKE=>And three union midgets that dance around like--
RIGGAN=>You're not supposed to call them midgets--
JAKE=>The reserve is gone!
RIGGAN=>Listen to me, you didn't see what I just saw. But you will, at the preview tomorrow. Look, get the contract done. I'll get the money.
JAKE=>When???
LAURA=>Hey, is it true? Shiner?
RIGGAN=>He's in.
LAURA=>Holy shit! When can I meet him?
RIGGAN=>He's in a fitting with Larry. Lesley comes down the hallway.
LESLEY=>I'm going to Starbucks. You guys want anything?
RIGGAN=>I'm fine. How's Mike?
LESLEY=>Did you talk to your daughter?
RIGGAN=>No. 10/29/14 / 28.
LESLEY=>He's great.
LAURA=>Honey, your tits look like fucking anjou pears in that top!
LESLEY=>Okay, well I'm gonna-- Thank you.
LAURA=>And that ass. Like two eggs in a hanky!
LAURA=>Okay, I was going to tell you this over dinner, but everything-- I have some news too.
RIGGAN=>Good or bad? Cause right now--
LAURA=>I missed my last two periods. I think it's happening this time.
LAURA=>Is that good or bad? Riggan...?
RIGGAN=>It's good. It's great. She smiles, her eyes filled with emotion. Riggan smiles back, and nods absently.
LAURA=>Say something else...
RIGGAN=>You're pretty sure it's mine?
LAURA=>Well, let's see. There's you. Jake. That masseuse wore a condom so... Yes, it's yours... idiot.
LAURA=>Are you excited?
RIGGAN=>Yeah.
LAURA=>Me too. Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across the face. Riggan looks at her, confused.
RIGGAN=>What--?
LAURA=>You're not funny.
LAURA=>First preview tomorrow. Here we go!
ANNIE=>Cue 34 and 35. Go. 10/29/14 / 30.
ANNIE=>Places.
RIGGAN=>Okay.
MIKE=>The maniac shot himself right in front of us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital.
LESLEY=>I'll never get that image out of my head. Right before he did it, his eyes-- they were so sad... lonely.
LAURA=>Did you have to treat him?
MIKE=>I didn't have to. But I did. He was in bad shape. His head swelled up to like twice the size of a normal head. I'd never seen anything like it. And I swear to God, I hope I never do again.
RIGGAN=>He's good.
ANNIE=>He's incredible. I think he's drinking real gin.
RIGGAN=>What?
MIKE=>Ask Nick what real love is. He'll agree with me. You watch.
LESLEY=>Why don't we just head to the restaurant?
LAURA=>Don't get him started, Mel. You haven't seen how he's been lately. He's been depressed. I'm worried about him. He's been--
RIGGAN=>Been what? I'll tell you what real love is. This happened a few months ago. And it ought to make us ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love.
LAURA=>Nick, for God's sake. Are you getting drunk?
RIGGAN=>I don't have to be drunk to say what I think.
MIKE=>Nobody's drunk. We're just having a few drinks.
LESLEY=>You've had more than a few.
RIGGAN=>What are you, counting?
LAURA=>Don't you talk to her like that. Don't talk like a drunk if you're not--
RIGGAN=>Shut up. For once in your life. Will you do me a favor and shut up for a minute? Like I was saying... There's this old couple, had a car wreck out on the interstate. Some drunk kid plowed his dad's pick up into their camper.
RIGGAN=>Fucking teenager. By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night...
RIGGAN=>When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.
RIGGAN=>I mean... It was killing him. Killing him that he--
MIKE=>I'm tired of this shit.
MIKE=>What the fuck is this? Water?
RIGGAN=>It was killing the old bastard...
MIKE=>Did you just give me water?
RIGGAN=>Come on, Mike.
MIKE=>Come on what?
RIGGAN=>Take it easy. You're drunk.
MIKE=>Of course I'm drunk! I'm supposed to be drunk! This is Carver, man! The guy lost a piece of liver every time he wrote a page! If I'm supposed to drink gin then bring me fuckin gin! I mean, you fucked the time period! You took all the good lines for yourself! At least let me--
MIKE=>Oh, okay. Seriously? You people are pathetic. Put the cell phones down and join the real world! Will somebody please just live in the real world?!! He crosses to the refrigerator.
LAURA=>Where's he going?
LESLEY=>Mike, cut it out.
MIKE=>Look at this. It's all fake. The milk is fake. The butter is fake.
MIKE=>Your performance is fake. Hey! There's chicken. Real chicken. The only thing real up here is the chicken. So I'm gonna stick with the chicken.
MIKE=>Hey, this is good bird, man! Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a panicked Annie.
RIGGAN=>Get Mike out of here.
ANNIE=>How do you want me to do that?
RIGGAN=>I want him gone.
JAKE=>No.
RIGGAN=>What?
JAKE=>We can't do that.
RIGGAN=>What are you-- Of course we can do that. It's our show.
JAKE=>Riggan, listen to me--
RIGGAN=>No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there?
JAKE=>It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night.
RIGGAN=>We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and--
JAKE=>Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. We can't afford to lose a preview. We can't afford to lose money. We can't afford to lose Mike. This is about being respected, validated, remember? That's what you told me. That's how you got me into this shit. Now, you're the director. Get him under control. These are not the nineties anymore.
RIGGAN=>Holy Fuck!
MIKE=>You were good...
RIGGAN=>Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes.
SYLVIA=>What the hell was going on up there?
RIGGAN=>I didn't know you were here tonight.
SYLVIA=>That guy's an asshole, huh?
RIGGAN=>What are you doing here?
SYLVIA=>Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with--
RIGGAN=>No, I mean here. Now.
SYLVIA=>Well. I know how much this means to you, so--
RIGGAN=>I appreciate that.
SYLVIA=>So, how's it going?
RIGGAN=>The play?
SYLVIA=>No, you and Sam.
RIGGAN=>It's good. It's the same.
SYLVIA=>Do you talk to her?
RIGGAN=>We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here.
SYLVIA=>You understand where her head is at right now.
RIGGAN=>Of course.
SYLVIA=>She's trying to stay away from everything and everyone that got her into rehab in the first place, but...
RIGGAN=>...I know, Sylvia...
SYLVIA=>...But that's all she had. So she's--
RIGGAN=>I really do get it.
SYLVIA=>I know you're caught up in all this stuff, but--
RIGGAN=>Stuff...
SYLVIA=>You know what I mean. Riggan... You don't have to be a great father right now, you just have to be one.
RIGGAN=>Yeah. Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.
LAURA=>Oh, sorry.
SYLVIA=>So how is that going? Is she and Sam--?
RIGGAN=>I don't wanna talk about it. 10/29/14 / 38.
SYLVIA=>You're drinking?
RIGGAN=>I'm having a beer.
SYLVIA=>Okay... He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to take out the wig.
RIGGAN=>So, what's going on with you?
SYLVIA=>Me? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess. I'm going back to teaching.
RIGGAN=>I'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu house.
SYLVIA=>Wh-- I'm sorry?
RIGGAN=>I'm thinking about--
SYLVIA=>No, I heard you. I just need a second to-- That's gonna be Sam's house. Why would you-- What? For this play?
RIGGAN=>I need the money.
SYLVIA=>Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?
RIGGAN=>What do you want me to say? My health lasted longer than the money... Go figure that out.
SYLVIA=>Riggan... What's going on?... Look at me.
RIGGAN=>I have a chance to do something right. And I have to take it. I have to.
SYLVIA=>It's funny. I was sitting here waiting for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't remember why we broke up. Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said.
RIGGAN=>The last time I flew here from LA, George Clooney was sitting two seats in front of me. With those cuff links, and that... chin. We ended up flying through this really bad storm. The plane started to rattle and shake, and everyone on board was crying... and praying. And I just sat there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam opened that paper it was going to be Clooney's face on the front page. Not mine. Did you know that Farrah Fawcett died on the same day as Michael Jackson?
RIGGAN=>Why did we break up?
SYLVIA=>You threw a kitchen knife at me...
SYLVIA=>...and one hour later you were telling me how much you loved me. Just because I didn't like that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn didn't mean I did not love you. But that's what you always do. You confuse love with admiration.
SYLVIA=>It's your house, so do what you want with it. Just make sure you're there for our daughter.
RIGGAN=>I will.
SYLVIA=>You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan. She exits. Painful silence... until...
BIRDMAN=>We should have done that reality show they offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter. Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would have watched that.
RIGGAN=>Shut up.
BIRDMAN=>Where are we goin'?
RIGGAN=>Leave me alone.
ANNIE=>The sun bed is here.
RIGGAN=>What does that mean?
ANNIE=>It means there's a sun bed out there being delivered to in here.
RIGGAN=>Who ordered a sun bed?
ANNIE=>Mike. He says it's for his character. Carver's red necks, "people of the land". Part of his process and that shit.
RIGGAN=>Let's go. Walk.
MIKE=>Where are we going?
RIGGAN=>To get you some coffee. Have I done anything to disrespect you?
MIKE=>Not yet.
RIGGAN=>I have a lot riding on this play.
MIKE=>Is that right?
RIGGAN=>People know who I am, and--
MIKE=>Bullshit.
RIGGAN=>Mike--
MIKE=>Bullshit. People don't know you. They know the guy in the bird suit. They know the guy who tells those quaint, slightly vomitous stories on Letterman.
RIGGAN=>Well, I'm sorry for being popular, but that-- 10/29/14 / 42.
MIKE=>Popular? POPULAR?... Oh God, popularity is just the slutty little cousin of prestige.
RIGGAN=>Okay, I don't even know what that--
MIKE=>My reputation is riding on this play. And that's... That is...
RIGGAN=>A lot?
MIKE=>A lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This doesn't work out for you, you get to go home to your studio pals and jump right back into that cultural genocide you guys are perpetrating. "There's a douchbag born every minute". That was P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich inventing the circus. And you and your pals know nothing's changed, and whatever toxic shit you make people are still gonna pay to see it. But, after you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll still be making my living on the stage. Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions, complex emotions.
RIGGAN=>Right. Is that what tonight was about then? Wrestling with "complex emotions"?
MIKE=>Tonight was about making it alive. About making it bleed. This isn't the Warner Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and this is how we do things.
RIGGAN=>Where are you going?
MIKE=>They have coffee in here.
MIKE=>Thanks, Tommy.
RIGGAN=>People were laughing in our faces.
MIKE=>Tonight they were laughing, tomorrow they'll be... be.. tweeting about us. Fuck `em. Who cares??? These are the people who pay half price to watch us rehearse. Stop fucking caring!
RIGGAN=>We're doing Raymond Carver. This play is a drama. This play is--
MIKE=>You don't know what this play is. These are previews. This is where we find out what the play is.
MIKE=>You see that woman over there? The one that looks like she just licked a homeless guy's ass? Nothing matters until she writes five hundred words about us in the New York Times.
RIGGAN=>That's...
MIKE=>Tabitha Dickinson. Yes. And, believe it or not, the only thing that matters in theater is whether she likes us or not. She does, we run. She doesn't, we're fucked.
RIGGAN=>She does look like she licked a homeless guy's ass.
MIKE=>Do me a favor, don't get your panties in a twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town. And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about you around here.
LADY=>You're Riggan Thompson, right?
HUSBAND=>We're sorry to interrupt...
LADY=>Would you mind terribly if we got a picture?
RIGGAN=>Of course. It's no trouble at all.
LADY=>Would you mind?
LADY=>The button right on top there.
KID=>Who is this guy?
LADY=>Come on, Billy. He used to be like Batman.
LADY=>I think you screwed that one up. Take another one.
LADY=>God bless you, darlin'. You're very sweet. And handsome!
HUSBAND=>We really appreciate it. An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey.
MIKE=>Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.
RIGGAN=>See you tomorrow.
MIKE=>Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.
RIGGAN=>A long time ago, I did a play back in high school in Michigan. He was in the audience. He sent this backstage after.
MIKE=>"Thank you for an honest performance. Ray Carver." What is this?
RIGGAN=>And that's when I knew I was going to be an actor.
RIGGAN=>Why is that funny?
MIKE=>He wrote it on a cocktail napkin.
RIGGAN=>So...
MIKE=>He was drunk.
TABITHA=>You headed to Hollywood, Mike?
MIKE=>Hollywood's headed here, Tabby.
TABITHA=>Good luck with that.
MIKE=>"A man becomes a critic when he can not be an artist, in the same way that a man becomes an informer when he cannot be a soldier." Flaubert, right?
TABITHA=>He's a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird suit.
MIKE=>Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna get on stage and risk everything. What're you gonna be doing?
TABITHA=>Don't you ever worry that I'll give you a bad review?
MIKE=>Oh, I'm sure you will. If I ever give a bad performance. Ms. Dickinson.
TABITHA=>Mr. Shiner.
RIGGAN=>What're you still doing here?
SAM=>Nothing. I'm-- Nothing. Your costumes are hanging in your room.
RIGGAN=>Great...
SAM=>I got the coconut water you wanted. If you want me to get--
RIGGAN=>Hey.
SAM=>What?
RIGGAN=>I'm not sure if I said thank you.
SAM=>For what?
RIGGAN=>All of it. You've been doing a good job. And I've been...
SAM=>Yeah.
RIGGAN=>So, I just wanted to say that-- What is that?
SAM=>What...?
RIGGAN=>That smell.
SAM=>I don't--
RIGGAN=>Look at me.
SAM=>What are you--
RIGGAN=>Look at me.
SAM=>Dad...
RIGGAN=>You have to be shitting me... Where is it?
SAM=>Could we not do this?
RIGGAN=>What is this?
SAM=>That is chunky peanut butter that happens, by the way, to have Omega--
RIGGAN=>This.
SAM=>Oh. That's pot.
RIGGAN=>Sam.
SAM=>Alright, just relax.
RIGGAN=>Relax? What the hell are you doing?
SAM=>Protecting myself from cataracts?
RIGGAN=>You can't do this to me!
SAM=>To you?
RIGGAN=>SHUT UP! You know what I'm talking about.
SAM=>Yeah. You're talking about you. What else is new?
RIGGAN=>Don't try to--
SAM=>What? Make it about me? I wouldn't dream of it.
RIGGAN=>Listen to me. I'm trying to do something that's important...
SAM=>This is not important.
RIGGAN=>It's important to me! Alright? Maybe not to you, or your cynical playmates whose sole ambition is to end up going viral and who, by the way, will only be remembered as the generation that finally stopped talking to one another. But to me... To me... This is-- God. This is my career, this is my chance 10/29/14 / 50.
RIGGAN=>to do some work that actually means something.
SAM=>Means something to who? You had a career before the third comic book movie, before people began to forget who was inside the bird costume. You're doing a play based on a book that was written 60 years ago, for a thousand rich, old white people whose only real concern is gonna be where they go to have their cake and coffee when it's over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake of art. It's because you just want to feel relevant again. Well, there's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day. And you act like it doesn't even exist! Things are happening in a place that you willfully ignore, a place that has already forgotten you. I mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You make fun of twitter. You don't even have a Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't exist. You're doing this because you're scared to death, like the rest of us, that you don't matter. And you know what? You're right. You don't. It's not important. You're not important. Get used to it.
LAURA=>In the days before Nick's depression really started to eat away at him, he had no idea I was pregnant. And I never intended on telling him. I guess we make choices in life, and we choose to live with them. Or not. I didn't want that baby...
LAURA=>...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not because I didn't love the-- The idea of it. But because I just wasn't ready to love myself. There's a certain distance to it all now. A wistful distance. Underscored by a gentle breeze and the sound of the birds... laughing at the whimsy of it all.
MIKE=>Hey, Les...
LESLEY=>What?
MIKE=>I'm hard.
LESLEY=>No, you're not. It's just that sometimes you don't consider other people's feelings.
MIKE=>No. I'm hard. Feel.
LESLEY=>Oh, you gotta be kidding.
MIKE=>Let's really do this. Let's fuck.
LESLEY=>Are you crazy? No.
LESLEY=>Cut it out...
LESLEY=>I'm serious, Mike. Stop!
MIKE=>I'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel. A knock on a door.
RIGGAN=>Terri! Terri!
RIGGAN=>Terri! I know you're in there!
RIGGAN=>Terri???
LESLEY=>Ed!
LESLEY=>What are you doing here? Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she notices the erection herself.
RIGGAN=>Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you. I worshipped you...
MIKE=>Listen Ed, I know this is hard but-- More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues...
RIGGAN=>Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.
LESLEY=>Eddie! Please!
RIGGAN=>What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?
LESLEY=>Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun. She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful.
LESLEY=>Just look at me. I was drowning. I was not capable of-- You deserve to be loved. You do.
RIGGAN=>I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...
MIKE=>Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love you anymore.
RIGGAN=>You don't, do you?
LESLEY=>No...
RIGGAN=>And you never will...
LESLEY=>I'm sorry.
RIGGAN=>I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't exist. None of this matters.
MIKE=>Just, keep your voice down...
LESLEY=>You have to be shitting me. You can't get it up in six months... 10/29/14 / 55.
LESLEY=>...and now you try to fuck me in front of eight hundred strangers???
MIKE=>What do you want from me? I have to feel it. You know that. I told you that from the--
LESLEY=>Oh, fuck you... Music begins and the curtain rises. The audience applauds as Lesley and Mike stride onto the stage and take their bows, smiles plastered on their faces.
MIKE=>...I was in the moment...
LESLEY=>I told you to stop. You fucking animal.
MIKE=>But... You were incredible.
LESLEY=>What is wrong with you?
MIKE=>Listen I'm sorry, alright, I--
LESLEY=>I want your shit out of the apartment.
MIKE=>Can we--
LESLEY=>No we can't. Maybe up here you're Mr. Truth, Mike. But in the real world, where it counts, you're a fraud. How's that for truth? You... dick.
LAURA=>What's going on?
LESLEY=>He's an asshole.
LAURA=>What did he do now?
LESLEY=>Oh, nothing. He just tried to fuck me in front of a full house.
LAURA=>Oh, my God...
LESLEY=>Right?
LAURA=>That's kind of hot.
LESLEY=>Why don't I have any self-respect?
LAURA=>You're an actress, honey.
LESLEY=>I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of being a Broadway actress since I was a little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a Broadway actress. I'm still just a little kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell me I made it.
LAURA=>Hey. You made it.
LESLEY=>I did?
LAURA=>Sadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake motel bed, in front of--
LESLEY=>Shut. Up. Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley.
RIGGAN=>Is she okay?
LAURA=>She's gonna be fine.
RIGGAN=>None of this is your fault. You're beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?
LESLEY=>Okay.
RIGGAN=>Okay.
LESLEY=>That was very sweet.
LAURA=>Yeah. Laura is suddenly teary.
LESLEY=>What's wrong?
LAURA=>Nothing. Two years, he's never said anything like that to me.
LESLEY=>Hey. You're smart. And beautiful. And talented. And I'm lucky to have you. Okay?
LAURA=>We're gross.
LESLEY=>We are. Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face...
LESLEY=>What are you doing?
LAURA=>Nothing. Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems confused. A few seconds of silence. Then...
LESLEY=>Do it again.
MIKE=>Can we talk about this like two--
LESLEY=>FUCK YOU!!!
MIKE=>Okay, well, you're not ready. Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and...
MIKE=>That was hot.
MIKE=>Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a plastic toy. And it still has the red plug in the barrel. You look like a seven year old when you're holding it. I'm not threatened by it at all.
MIKE=>Have some self respect and get a new one. That was a fun crowd, huh?
MIKE=>I don't think it's high enough.
SAM=>Me neither.
MIKE=>So, what are you doing up here?
SAM=>Adrenaline. Just came out of rehab. Closest I get to a drug.
MIKE=>You were in rehab?
SAM=>Yeah.
MIKE=>Cool.
SAM=>It wasn't all Dr. Drew or anything, but that dude from American Pie was there.
A VOICE=>Juuump!
SAM=>Eat me!
A VOICE=>Okay. Jump on my face!
SAM=>I love this city.
MIKE=>Yeah.
SAM=>Why do you act like a dick all the time? Do you just do it to antagonize people?
MIKE=>Maybe...
SAM=>You really don't give a shit if people like you or not...
MIKE=>Not really.
SAM=>God, that's cool.
MIKE=>Is it...?
SAM=>Hey. Hey...
MIKE=>What?
SAM=>Let's play a game.
MIKE=>A game?
SAM=>Yeah.
MIKE=>What are you, eight?
SAM=>What are you, seventy-eight? Truth or dare...?
MIKE=>You gotta be--
SAM=>Truth or dare?
MIKE=>Truth.
SAM=>The first time we met, you made a comment about my ass. Why'd you do it?
MIKE=>Because you have a great ass, and I noticed it. So, I said it. Truth or dare?
SAM=>Dare.
MIKE=>Really...
SAM=>Uh-huh.
MIKE=>There's a bald guy about to walk by down there. Spit on his head.
SAM=>No!
MIKE=>You said dare.
SAM=>Truth.
MIKE=>Too late.
SAM=>Happy?
MAN=>Fuck you!
SAM=>Truth or dare?
MIKE=>Truth.
SAM=>You're boring.
MIKE=>Truth.
SAM=>Do you want to fool around with me?
MIKE=>No.
SAM=>Really? Why not?
MIKE=>That's a second question.
SAM=>It's a second part.
MIKE=>I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.
SAM=>That didn't seem to be a problem for you on stage.
MIKE=>Nothing's a problem for me on stage.
SAM=>I wanna ask another question...
MIKE=>You just asked--
SAM=>One more.
MIKE=>Go 'head.
SAM=>If you weren't afraid. What would you want to do to me?
MIKE=>I would want to pull the eyes out of your head...
SAM=>...That's sweet...
MIKE=>...And stick them in my skull, and then look out at this street and see it the way I saw it when I was your age.
SAM=>G'night, Mike.
RIGGAN=>What now? Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front of Riggan.
LAURA=>Don't kill the messenger.
LAURA=>He's an asshole.
BIRDMAN=>He's fooling you. 10/29/14 / 65.
RIGGAN=>Shut up.
LAURA=>I didn't say anything.
RIGGAN=>Fuck. This is it? This can't be it.
LAURA=>Page twelve.
RIGGAN=>"Riggan Thompson, better known as the face of the Birdman films, tries not to lay an egg on Broadway..." Where's the rest of it?
LAURA=>There is no rest of it.
RIGGAN=>They didn't use the photo I sent them.
LAURA=>What photo?
RIGGAN=>The one you liked. The one you said I look like a young Jack Nicholson.
LAURA=>Don't worry about it. Someone'll be using that to pick up dog shit tomorrow.
RIGGAN=>How can you be so calm about this?
LAURA=>What are my other choices?
RIGGAN=>Aren't you scared at all?
LAURA=>About what?
RIGGAN=>About being humiliated out there.
LAURA=>It won't be the first time I've been humiliated.
RIGGAN=>I bet it won't.
LAURA=>You're an asshole. She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns back to Riggan...
LAURA=>By the way... I'm not pregnant. So there's one thing you don't have to worry about.
BIRDMAN=>That pretentious, little, theater fuck is stealing your thunder.
MIKE=>What the fuck is going on!
RIGGAN=>Get up!
MIKE=>Back away.
RIGGAN=>Get up. Riggan slaps Mike on the arm.
MIKE=>Ow, fuck that hurts!
RIGGAN=>So, Carver is the reason you became an actor?
MIKE=>What?
RIGGAN=>This is my play! I did the work. I raised the money. I arrange the press.
MIKE=>They called me for an interview. I said-- I don't know, I said the first thing that came to mind. Jesus, we got the cover of the Arts section!
RIGGAN=>You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section. The first thing that came to mind? Right. Cause that's you. Mr. Natural. Mr. Fuck the scene, just stare at my massive hard-on. Because that's the truth of the moment.
MIKE=>You think it looked massive?
RIGGAN=>Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard on my stage unless I tell you to.
MIKE=>Your stage? This stage belonged to a lot of great actor's, pal. But you are not one of them.
RIGGAN=>So, you wrote your own lines?
MIKE=>Ow. Fuck. Yes I did.
RIGGAN=>You changed a few words, and mumbled a little, you self absorbed prick.
MIKE=>Look who's talking...
RIGGAN=>Let me tell you something, you spiteful nobody piece of shit.
MIKE=>Nobody? My hard-on has already fifty thousand views on youtube.
RIGGAN=>Fifty thousand views? A cat playing with a dildo has more than that.
MIKE=>I don't care.
RIGGAN=>Yes you do. Everybody says: "Mike is so honest". "So truthful".
MIKE=>Ouch. Fuuuuuck. Cut the shit! Riggan corners Mike against the wall.
RIGGAN=>You said in the interview that your father was a drunk, like Carver. Is that true Mike? Is it really true?
RIGGAN=>Because my father was. My father was a mean fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But we were okay with the beatings. You know why? Because at least when he was beating us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out to his tool shed...
RIGGAN=>That sonofabitch would smile and say, "Do you want to kneel down and unbuckle my belt? Or do you want me to take it off and use it?" I learned how to make myself numb. But my sister-- My little sister...
MIKE=>Jesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I didn't-- That's fucking horrible...
RIGGAN=>Yeah. It's also not true. See? I can pretend too, you little dick!
RIGGAN=>Don't fuck with me, Mike.
MIKE=>You're crazy...
RIGGAN=>You have no idea what I'm capable of. You understand me? Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket.
RIGGAN=>Working with Riggan Thomson is like waltzing with a monkey?
RIGGAN=>Let's go. Put your hands up.
MIKE=>Don't you want to go put on your tights and your--
MIKE=>What are you gonna do? You gonna get rid of me? Huh? What do you think my friend Tabitha is going to write in the Times after you get rid of me?
BIRDMAN=>You are lame, Riggan. Rolling around with that third rate actor in an 800 seat shithole like this.
RIGGAN=>Breathing in, I feel my rage. Breathing out, I embrace my mental formations.
BIRDMAN=>You're going to let that poncey theater fuck threaten you?
RIGGAN=>Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I ignore my mental formations. This is a mental formation. This is a mental form--
BIRDMAN=>Stop that shit. I am not a mental formation. I am "you", asshole.
RIGGAN=>Leave me alone.
BIRDMAN=>You were a movie star, remember? Pretentious, but happy...
RIGGAN=>I was not happy.
BIRDMAN=>...Ignorant but charming. Now you are a tiny bitter cocksucker.
RIGGAN=>Shut up! Stop whining! I was miserable!
BIRDMAN=>Yeah. But fake miserable. Hollywood miserable.
BIRDMAN=>What are you trying to prove? Huh? That you're an artist? You're not.
RIGGAN=>Fuck you!
BIRDMAN=>Fuck you, coward! And fuck those critics that made you quit. Our franchise grossed billions worldwi--
RIGGAN=>And billions of flies eat shit everyday! So what? Does that make it good? And I don't know if you've noticed, but that was 1992! Look at me! This is what's left! This! This! I'm fucking disappearing! I'm the answer to a fucking trivial pursuit question.
RIGGAN=>What part of that don't you get? You're fucking dead.
BIRDMAN=>We are not dead. We're--
RIGGAN=>Stop saying 'we'! There is no 'we'. I am not you. I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.
BIRDMAN=>No. You're Birdman. Because without me, all that's left is "you". A sad, selfish, mediocre actor, grasping--
BIRDMAN=>What the hell did you do that for? I liked that poster.
BIRDMAN=>It's always 'we' brother.
RIGGAN=>Fuck you! Fuck you!
RIGGAN=>What's up?
JAKE=>Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't you rest a little bit?
RIGGAN=>Yeah. Sure.
JAKE=>Last preview, buddy. We're almost there.
RIGGAN=>Okay.
JAKE=>How ya doin?
RIGGAN=>Good. Great.
JAKE=>Good. That's good. The, uh, money came through. I just have to transfer it to the account.
RIGGAN=>Oh, that's terrific...
JAKE=>Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that. You know I'm proud of you, right? This took balls. And you did it.
RIGGAN=>I can't do this anymore, Jake.
JAKE=>What?
RIGGAN=>I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted.
JAKE=>It's a joke, right? Good one, Riggan.
RIGGAN=>I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me.
JAKE=>What are you--? Listen. There's a three block line of people waiting to see you. We are sold out. It's a full house.
RIGGAN=>Really?
JAKE=>Yes. And the French embassador is coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia, with one of his wives. And... I wasn't going to tell you this, but-- Martin Scorsese. He's casting for his new film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This is between you and me.
RIGGAN=>Okay. I'll be ready.
LESLEY=>How is he?
JAKE=>He'll be okay.
LESLEY=>Poor creature.
LAURA=>Is it true? Scorsese?
JAKE=>Yes. And the new Pope too.
LAURA=>You're an asshole, Jake.
JAKE=>I'm the one keeping this boat afloat.
LESLEY=>So there is no line of people out there?
JAKE=>I don't know. Now go and get ready. That's your job. I'll better invest in a taco truck, or a strip joint near the airport.
LESLEY=>Are you okay?
RIGGAN=>Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving. He cleans his hand against his trousers.
LESLEY=>I just want to say I'm sorry.
RIGGAN=>For what?
LESLEY=>I knew what Mike was capable of, and I brought him in, anyway.
RIGGAN=>You did good.
LESLEY=>Tomorrow's my first opening night on Broadway.
RIGGAN=>Mine too.
LESLEY=>And I want you to know that, whatever happens, I'll always be grateful to you for that.
RIGGAN=>Me too. It's going to be great. Full house.
MIKE=>For fuck's sake, just jump already.
SAM=>How did you know I'd be up here?
MIKE=>I didn't. I was just hoping.
SAM=>Where's Lesley?
MIKE=>Moving on.
SAM=>Smart girl...
MIKE=>I appreciate that. A beat.
SAM=>Ready for the last preview? Who did that to you?
SAM=>Could have been anybody, I guess. I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley. He barely says no, smiling, and lights a cigarette. She understands.
SAM=>Oh, don't tell me...
MIKE=>What's the worst thing he ever did to you?
SAM=>He was never around, so...
MIKE=>That was--?
SAM=>No. That was-- Who gives a shit. It was the way he tried to make up for it by constantly trying to convince me I was special. What about you?
MIKE=>My dad?
SAM=>Yeah.
MIKE=>He pretended I was his son.
SAM=>So, what happens now?
MIKE=>I have no idea...
SAM=>Yeah...
MIKE=>He was right, though.
SAM=>About what?
MIKE=>About your being special. You're hanging around here trying to make yourself 10/29/14 / 78.
MIKE=>invisible behind that fragile little fuck up routine. But you can't. You're anything but invisible. You're big. And you're sort of this really great mess, a candle burning at both ends, and no amount of booze or pills is gonna hide that.
MAN'S VOICE=>Jesus Fuck!
SAM=>It's a good thing you're an actor and not a writer cause that little speech was just like, Oprah... Hallmark... R. Kelly bad. She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away. When she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame.
SAM=>Truth or dare?
MIKE=>Truth.
SAM=>No.
MIKE=>Truth.
SAM=>No. Truth or dare?
MIKE=>Do you have any idea where you're going?
SAM=>Absolutely not.
MIKE=>What now...?
SAM=>How do you do it?
MIKE=>What?
SAM=>How do you go out there and pretend to be someone else in front of all those people?
MIKE=>I don't pretend. Not out there. Just about every place else, but never out there.
SAM=>Good to know.
MIKE=>What are we doing here?
SAM=>What do you mean?
MIKE=>I mean, what are we doing here?
SAM=>Adrenaline... They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage...
RIGGAN=>Fucking teenager.
RIGGAN=>By the time I got to the hospital, the kid was dead. He was off in a corner laid out on a gurney. We took the old couple up to the O.R.. They were a mess. We worked like hell on them for most of the night...
RIGGAN=>When we were done, we wrapped them in full body casts. The husband was depressed. Even when I told him his wife was gonna pull through, he was still depressed. So, I got up to his mouth hole and asked him, and he told me it was because he couldn't see her through the eye holes. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.
LESLEY=>That's terrible. Perfect. And terrible.
RIGGAN=>Yeah. So I guess what we have to ask ourselves is... What do we talk about when we talk about love?
LESLEY=>Mel and I have been together five years, been married for four. But it was Ed who taught me something no one else could... He taught me what it felt like to really feel loved. And the terrible thing is that if something happened to Mel or myself, if something happened to either one of us tomorrow, I think the other one would grieve for a while, you know, but then would go 10/29/14 / 81.
LESLEY=>out and love again, have someone else soon enough. All this-- All of this love we're talking about... it would just be a memory. Maybe not even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean, I don't know anything. And I'm the first one to admit it.
DRESSER=>That was amazing!
LAURA=>It's actually going well.
RIGGAN=>Yeah. Hey. I think we have to talk.
LAURA=>No. We don't.
RIGGAN=>Right. We will eventually, though, `cause that's the only way I get to say I'm sorry. I really am.
LAURA=>We could've made good parents.
RIGGAN=>Horrible. We would've been just--
LAURA=>Awful. Would have raised, like...
RIGGAN=>...a serial killer...
LAURA=>...or Justin Bieber. 10/29/14 / 82.
LAURA=>I'm not really the housewife type anyway. I thought I could be a mom. My body seems to disagree.
LAURA=>You were right. This was fun. Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention. We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side. They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully grabs her ass.
RIGGAN=>You have a cigarette?
STAGE HAND=>You need a light?
RIGGAN=>Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out, I ease myself.
TOURIST=>Hey, aren't you...?
RIGGAN=>I'm sorry. I can't really--
TOURIST=>Riggan Thompson! Holy Shit! Let me get an autograph.
TOURIST=>Come on, man. Don't be a dick. Let me have an autograph.
MAN ON STREET=>Birdman!
TOURIST=>Dude! You fuckin' rock!
LADY=>Can we take one picture?
RIGGAN=>Are you kidding me?
LADY=>One picture...
LADY=>Get next to him!
RIGGAN=>Give me a fucking break, lady.
WOMAN ON STREET=>He looks so old in person.
MAN ON STREET=>You suck!
RIGGAN=>Fuck you!
CROWD=>Bird-man! Bird-man! Bird-man!
RIGGAN=>Jesus Christ! What're you doing here?
RALPH=>Waiting for Jake. This is Mr. Roth, my attorney.
MR. ROTH=>We're pursuing financial remuneration for the injuries Mr. Pinkus suffered while rehearsing your--
RIGGAN=>I have a play to do. 10/29/14 / 85.
RALPH=>I'm going to ruin you!
OLD USHER=>I'm sorry sir, you're going to have--
RIGGAN=>Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri!
LESLEY=>Ed! What are you doing here?
RIGGAN=>Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you...
MIKE=>Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
RIGGAN=>Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.
RIGGAN=>Shut up!
LESLEY=>Eddie! Please!
RIGGAN=>What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?
LESLEY=>Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
JAKE=>Yeah. What?... No no no no no no no. Wait there. I'm coming out in--
JAKE=>No. Wait. Wait for me. I'll be there in a second. What is that, a threat? What wheelchair? Wait. Don't hang up. Mr. Roth, we can discuss-- Hello?... Hello?...
SAM=>Dad...?
RIGGAN=>Hey. How ya doin'?
SAM=>Are you okay?
RIGGAN=>Why?
SAM=>I don't know. You seem--
RIGGAN=>I'm good. This is good. You want some?
SAM=>I'm good.
RIGGAN=>Great. Great.
SAM=>So. Opening night, tomorrow.
RIGGAN=>Yeah.
SAM=>That's exciting, huh?
RIGGAN=>Yeah. Well... I don't know. The previews have been a train wreck. We haven't been able to get through a performance without a raging fire... or a raging hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke. Oh, and also, this play feels like a miniature, deformed version of myself that keeps following me around, hitting me in the balls with a tiny hammer. Sorry, what was your question?
SAM=>Never mind... Tonight wasn't bad. It was weird. But that's sort of cool. People seemed to like it. 10/29/14 / 88.
RIGGAN=>What are you doing? Some homework?
SAM=>No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they made us do this.
RIGGAN=>Really...
SAM=>Yeah. These dashes, represent the six billion years the planet has existed. Each dash represents 100 years.
SAM=>And this... ...is supposed to represent the entire time us humans have been here. One hundred and fifty thousand years. That's it. I guess they were trying to remind us that that's what all our egos and self- obsession are worth.
RIGGAN=>I was a shitty father, wasn't I?
SAM=>No. You were a-- You were fine. He stops chewing and stares out.
RIGGAN=>Fine... You're right. I am just "fine". Adorably mediocre.
SAM=>Dad!
RIGGAN=>What? 10/29/14 / 89.
RIGGAN=>Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.
SAM=>It's okay. You just destroyed the entire human race in one blow.
SAM=>Dad. Do you know you're becoming a trending topic?
RIGGAN=>Really? What does that mean?
SAM=>350,000 views in less than an hour. Believe it or not, this is power.
RIGGAN=>It's for you.
RIGGAN=>Go ahead...
SAM=>Are you...?
RIGGAN=>Go.
RIGGAN=>Let me have another one.
BARTENDER=>You got it.
BARTENDER=>That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.
RIGGAN=>I got it. She's a friend of mine.
RIGGAN=>That was twenty years before I put on that damned costume.
TABITHA=>I don't care.
RIGGAN=>I'm just saying, when you come tomorrow night, I want you--
TABITHA=>It doesn't matter.
RIGGAN=>What are you--
TABITHA=>I'm going to destroy your play.
RIGGAN=>You haven't even seen it. I don't-- Did I do something to offend you?
TABITHA=>As a matter of fact you did. You took up space in a theater which otherwise might have been used on something worthwhile.
RIGGAN=>But you don't even know if it's--
TABITHA=>That's true. I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview, but after the opening tomorrow I'm going to turn in the worst review anybody has ever read. And I'm going to close your play. Would you like to know why? Because I hate you. And everyone you represent. Entitled. Spoiled. Selfish. Children. Blissfully untrained, unversed and unprepared to even attempt real art. Handing each other awards for cartoons and 10/29/14 / 92.
TABITHA=>pornography. Measuring your worth in weekends. Well, this is the theater, and you don't get to come in here and pretend you can write, direct and act in your own propaganda piece without going through me first. So, break a leg.
RIGGAN=>What has to happen in someone's life, for them to end up becoming a critic?
RIGGAN=>Whatcha writin'? You reviewin' a play? Was it good? Bad? Did you even see it? Lemme read.
TABITHA=>I will call the police.
RIGGAN=>No you won't. Let's read your review! "Callow". A label. "Lackluster". Label. "Marginalia". Sounds like you need penicillin to clear that up. None the less... label. All labels. You're a lazy fucker aren't you? Epistemological vertigo?
RIGGAN=>You know what this is? You don't, do you? You can't even see it if you don't label it. You mistake those sounds in your head for true knowledge.
TABITHA=>Are you finished?
RIGGAN=>Nothin' about intention, structure, 10/29/14 / 93.
RIGGAN=>technique. Just crappy opinions backed up by crappy comparisons. You're incapable of writing more than a couple of paragraphs, and you risk nothing of yourself. Well, I'm an actor and this play has cost me everything. So you can take your cowardly, malicious, shittily written reviews and shove them up your... ...wrinkly, tight ass.
TABITHA=>You think you're an actor? Eddie! Eddie the waiter approaches the table.
WAITER=>Yeah, Mrs. Dickinson?
TABITHA=>Give us some Shakespeare.
WAITER=>No problem. Got anything in mind?
TABITHA=>The Scottish Play. Act five...
WAITER=>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools. The way to dusty death...
WAITER=>...Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is 10/29/14 / 94.
WAITER=>a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury... Signifying nothing.
TABITHA=>Thank you, Eddie.
WAITER=>You got it.
TABITHA=>You're no actor. You're a celebrity. Let's be clear on that.
TABITHA=>I'm going to kill your play. She walks away. Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him out onto...
A49 A49=>Night turns into day. The sounds of the city disappear and birds begin to sing. The branches now caressed by golden shafts of morning sun. Finally, we tilt down slowly and find...
BIRDMAN=>God. You look like shit, brother. You get that mongoloid look when you're hung over, don't you?
BIRDMAN=>Let's go. Get up. It's a beautiful day.
BIRDMAN=>Stand up! Forget about the times. Everyone else has. So you're not a great actor... Who cares?!! You're much more than that. Fuck! You tower over all these theater douchebags. You're a movie star! A Global force! Don't you get it?
BIRDMAN=>You spent your whole life building a reputation and a bank account, and now they're both blown. So what? Fuck it. We make a come back. Something huge. Take what belongs to us. Take back the spotlight. Magazine covers and billboards. Happy meals with Birdman dolls. Remember that? That's who you are. That's who we are!
BIRDMAN=>C'mon, buddy. Tell me we're going back to the big leagues. Let's do this. Shave off that pathetic goatee, and put the mask back on! Batman my balls. We'll start a new franchise. Birdman: Phoenix Rising. Trust me! A billion world wide. Swear to God.
BIRDMAN=>Do you hear me? You can do anything! You're an icon! 10/29/14 / 96.
BIRDMAN=>You're bigger than life. You save people from their boring, miserable lives...
BIRDMAN=>...You make them jump, laugh, cry, shit their pants... All you have to do is snap your fingers and...
B50 B50=>Riggan snaps his fingers, once, twice, and the bank suddenly explodes. The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over. Fire. An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman.
BIRDMAN=>That's what I'm talking about! That is cool! Explosive! Big, fast, loud! Look at them. They love that shit! They starve for blood and action, not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical bullshit!
C50 C50=>We hear a loud roar, and the camera pans to discover a huge alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt. Birdman uses his powerful blow to send the alien flying away.
BIRDMAN=>And when you shout "whooaa!"... ...it explodes in the eardrum of millions. Your power is unlimited.
BIRDMAN=>You glimmered on 3000 screens, over 5 continents, in 47 countries at the same time. You are ubiquitous. You're a God! You can do it again. You can soar above all of them. 10/29/14 / 97.
BIRDMAN=>There you go, you mother fucker! See? Gravity doesn't even apply to you.
BIRDMAN=>Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to do this. We have to end it on our terms. With a grand gesture.
BIRDMAN=>We'll go back. We'll show them how much they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus. Sacrifice...
BIRDMAN=>Let's go back one more time and show them what we're capable of. You can do it. You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're...
A GUY'S VOICE=>Birdman!
GUY=>Dude, what are you doing?
GUY=>You okay, buddy? Do you want me to call someone?
LADY=>Is this for real, or you're shooting a film?
RIGGAN=>A film.
LADY=>Oh, you people are full of shit.
GUY=>I'm calling 911.
RIGGAN=>One more time...
GOOD NEIGHBOR=>Hi, sir. Can I help you? You should be careful.
RIGGAN=>Sorry. Can't talk. I'm late. Music.
GOOD NEIGHBOR=>Are you alright? Do you want me to call someone? Do you know where to go?
RIGGAN=>Yes. I know where to go. 10/29/14 / 99.
F50 F50=>Riggan jumps, and the camera jumps after him. He rapidly falls toward the street, toward the asphalt. But in his face there is no fear. No. He spreads his arms again and...
USHER=>Mr. Thomson. I think you forgot to--
RIGGAN=>Stop the music.
USHER=>I beg your pardon?
MAN=>It's really good.
WOMAN=>I know. I can't believe it...
SYLVIA=>Wow, that is just NASCAR hot.
SYLVIA=>I just wanted to come say hello. It's going great out there. You're so good. I mean it. You're-- I really mean it.
RIGGAN=>Come here. Sit next to me.
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS=>This is your five minutes.
SYLVIA=>Do you need to--?
RIGGAN=>I'm fine. Sit.
SYLVIA=>Look at all these roses.
SYLVIA RIGGAN=>You hate roses... I hate roses...
SYLVIA=>Are you okay? You seem-- I don't know, you seem abnormally calm.
RIGGAN=>I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of the day observing how beautifully this pile of dirty clothes was lit by the warm afternoon sun. So beautiful. Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's meditation posture.
SYLVIA=>Oh yes. God is those purplish light dots I see between my eyes and my eyelids.
RIGGAN=>You know? I have this voice that talks to me and tells me the truth. It's comforting, and scary.
SYLVIA=>I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say that.
RIGGAN=>Okay.
SYLVIA=>You wouldn't believe the crowd outside. They said, some people paid up to 500 dollars a ticket.
RIGGAN=>You wanna hear something funny?
SYLVIA=>Sure.
RIGGAN=>Do you remember our last anniversary party?
SYLVIA=>Seriously? You're going to ruin a nice moment with that?
RIGGAN=>Do you remember the party?
SYLVIA=>The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed? Yeah, it rings a bell.
RIGGAN=>Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part for a minute.
SYLVIA=>Gladly.
RIGGAN=>After you threw the guests out of the house, and the furniture out of the window. You locked yourself in the bathroom.
SYLVIA=>I remember. Why are we--
RIGGAN=>I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach for a while. Just... staring out at the ocean.
SYLVIA=>Riggan...
RIGGAN=>Until I walked straight into the water and tried to drown myself.
RIGGAN=>I was in up to my chest when I felt the first one. On my back, like somebody was holding a frying pan against me. And then my chest, and my legs. The water was full of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the water, and I started rolling around the sand like a maniac... crying.
SYLVIA=>You said it was a sunburn.
RIGGAN=>And you believed me.
SYLVIA=>To be honest, I didn't give a shit.
RIGGAN=>I love you. And I love Sam.
SYLVIA=>I know.
RIGGAN=>I never should have video taped Sam's birth. First of all because you and Sam both look like shit in that video. But mostly because I missed the moment. I should have just been there with the two of you. Present in my own life. So I'd have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of it.
SYLVIA=>You have Sam.
RIGGAN=>No, I don't.
SYLVIA=>Listen, she's just--
RIGGAN=>No, I understand. She needed a father and she got one shamefully successful youtube video. Pretty pathetic.
SYLVIA=>Shhh... There are more pathetic things than that. That mustache, for example. She kisses him.
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS=>Places for act two. Places.
SYLVIA=>Riggan...
RIGGAN=>You should get back to your seat. You don't want to miss what's next.
RIGGAN=>Twenty little leopards laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty little leopards laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty little leopards... laughed.
TECHNICIAN=>Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.
RIGGAN=>I don't need it.
RIGGAN=>Terri! Terri! I know you're in there! He barges through the door and onto... 10/29/14 / 105.
LESLEY=>Ed! What are you doing here?
RIGGAN=>Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for you-- I worshipped you...
MIKE=>Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--
RIGGAN=>What's wrong with me? Why do I end up having to beg people to love me?
LESLEY=>Ed. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
LESLEY=>Just look at me. I was drowning. I was not capable of-- You deserve to be loved. You do.
RIGGAN=>I just wanted to be what you wanted. Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...
MIKE=>Put down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love you anymore.
RIGGAN=>You don't, do you?
LESLEY=>No...
RIGGAN=>And you never will...
LESLEY=>I'm sorry.
RIGGAN=>I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't exist. None of this matters.
RIGGAN=>Pum.
RIGGAN=>Pum.
MAN=>Bravo!
BIRDMAN=>You won't be hearing from him anymore.
MAN=>Is he...?
BIRDMAN=>He's gone. 10/29/14 / 107.
HOST=>What do we talk about when we talk about Riggan Thomson? When we come back, more on the actor who two nights ago shot himself during the opening performance of his new Broadway play...
JAKE=>Is he...?
SYLVIA=>He's awake.
JAKE=>I thought I lost you, buddy. Thank god you're a horrible shot! What the hell happened? I was watching you up on that stage, and all of a sudden you get that goofy look in your eye, and you were just like--
SYLVIA=>What the hell are you laughing about? He tried to-- What is wrong with you? 10/29/14 / 108.
JAKE=>I'm happy, okay? He's alive. My best friend is alive. And he is the man of the hour!
RIGGAN=>What is that?
JAKE=>You did it.
SYLVIA=>You have to be shitting me... She wrote a review?
JAKE=>Read it.
SYLVIA=>I don't believe this...
JAKE=>Read it out loud!
SAM=>"Thompson has unwittingly given birth to a new form that can only be described as supra-realism. Blood was spilled both literally and metaphorically by artist and audience alike. Red blood. The blood that has been sorely missing from the veins of the American theatre..." You're happy about this?
JAKE=>Happy? I'm fucking euphoric. This is the-- This is the kind of review that turns someone into a living legend.
SYLVIA=>He tried to-- He shot the nose off his face!
JAKE=>He's got a new nose! And if he doesn't like that one, we'll get him another one. We can use Meg Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn on the tv. There are people praying for him all over the country. They're lighting candles in Central Park. He did it. You did it! The play's gonna run forever. It's gonna open in London, in Paris... The studios will call us again. We'll get book offers.
SYLVIA=>How do you know all that? You can see the future?
JAKE=>Yes.
SYLVIA=>Did you see that coming? You're so full of shit, Jake.
JAKE=>Why aren't you saying anything? This is what you wanted wasn't it? Riggan, this is what you wanted.
RIGGAN=>It's what I wanted.
JAKE=>Okay, listen. You're gonna get hit with a "brandishing a weapon" charge. If anybody talks to you, it was an accident and we're doing an internal invest--
JAKE=>This is a hospital you motherfucker!
SYLVIA=>Is that what it was? An accident? Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.
SAM=>Alchemillas.
SAM=>Are you actually smiling? What's so funny?
RIGGAN=>I can't smell them.
RIGGAN=>What are you doing?
SAM=>I'm posting this picture on your Twitter page.
RIGGAN=>Very funny...
SAM=>Set it up today.
RIGGAN=>You're joking.
SAM=>I'm not.
RIGGAN=>Let me see the picture.
SAM=>Absolutely not. You look hideous.
RIGGAN=>Thanks a lot.
SAM=>I'm just kidding. No, I'm not. You look hideous. You already have 80 thousand followers. In less than a day. And I'm about to scare the shit out of them.
RIGGAN=>Let me see.
SAM=>No. Done.
SAM=>Now, I'm going to find something to put these flowers in.
RIGGAN=>I do look hideous.
SAM=>Dad?
SAM=>Dad...?
