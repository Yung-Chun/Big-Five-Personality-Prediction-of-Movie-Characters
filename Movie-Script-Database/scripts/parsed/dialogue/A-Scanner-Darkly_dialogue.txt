BOB ARCTOR=>Lately, Jerry Fabin stands all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor says there are no bugs in his hair.
NURSERY CLERK=>Eating the bushes? Could be aphids.
JERRY FABIN=>Aphids! Of course. Y'know, I started with "A" in my cyclopedia, yet somehow I must've skipped right over aphids. It does start with "A", right? Aphids?
NURSERY CLERK=>Yes. Yes, it does, sir.
JERRY FABIN=>Boy, those fuckers can really bite.
NURSERY CLERK=>Aphids don't bite people.
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey, Jerry, I was in the neighborhood looking to score, and I thought -- What the fuck are you doing in the shower with the goddamn dog?
JERRY FABIN=>I got to get the aphids.
CHARLES FRECK=>I don't see any aphids. What's an aphid?
JERRY FABIN=>It eventually kills you. That's what an aphid is.
JERRY FABIN=>They're in my hair and my skin and my lungs. The goddamn pain is unbearable. I'm gonna have to go to the hospital.
CHARLES FRECK=>How come I can't see them though?
JERRY FABIN=>I'll find an especially big one, cause they're hard for many people to see.
CHARLES FRECK=>Wow! That is a big one!
JERRY FABIN=>Help me find more for the doctor to see.
CHARLES FRECK=>What do we get for these? I mean, does the doctor pay a bounty or something? A prize? Any bread?
JERRY FABIN=>I get to help perfect a cure for them.
JERRY FABIN=>Hey, man, you continue while I take a leak and like that.
CHARLES FRECK=>Jerry, these bugs sort of scare me. I don't like it here by myself.
JERRY FABIN=>You're a chickenshit bastard, Freck.
CHARLES FRECK=>Couldn't you --
JERRY FABIN=>I got to take a leak and like that!
CHARLES FRECK=>I'm afraid out here, man.
JERRY FABIN=>Then go fuck yourself, man!
CHARLES FRECK=>Do these fuckers bite?
JERRY FABIN=>Yeah they bite! They're aphids!
CHARLES FRECK=>Can I wash them off and wait for you?
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>Gentlemen, we have a wonderful opportunity this afternoon. The county of Orange has provided us with the chance to hear from -- and put questions to -- an undercover narcotics agent from the Sheriff's Office.
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>Now you will notice that you can barely see this individual becuase he is wearing what is called a "scramble suit", which he wears during most of his daily activities of law enforcement. Due to potential corruption within the Sheriff's Department, even this gallant officer's co-workers and superiors must not know his "street" identity.
BOB ARCTOR=>Nitwits. Pathetic, soulless morons.
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>This man -- whom we will call Fred, because that is the code name under which he reports the information he
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>So let's hear it for our vague blur!
FRED=>If you saw me on the street, you'd say, "There goes a weirdo freak doper." And you'd feel aversion and walk away.
FRED=>I don't look like you. I can't afford to. My life depends on it.
FRED=>I am not going to tell you first what I'm attempting to do as an undercover officer. I'm going to tell you... ... what I am afraid of.
BOB ARCTOR=>What I fear, is that our children, your children and my children...
BOB ARCTOR=>But not too little to be addicted...
BOB ARCTOR=>... calculatedly addicted, for profit, by those who would destroy this society. We do not yet know who these animals are who pray on our young, but one day we will.
VOICE FROM CROWD=>Sock it to 'em!
FRED=>We believe there is one source for Substance D and a diversified distribution system making it accessible in all major drug using areas. It my job as an undercover officer to attain the confidence of low level dealers and work my way up through the network to arrive at the drug's source. Now, the profits for...
BOB ARCTOR=>Well, it isn't the profits anyhow. It's something else... what you see ...
BOB ARCTOR=>If you were a diabetic, and you didn't have the money for insulin, would you steal to get the money? Or just die?
HEADPHONE VOICE=>I think you'd better go back to the prepared text, Fred.
BOB ARCTOR=>I forgot it.
HEADPHONE VOICE=>Riiight. I'll read it to you. Repeat it after me, but try to make it sound casual. "Each day the profits flow. Where they go we will soon determine."
BOB ARCTOR=>I got a block against this stuff.
HEADPHONE VOICE=>"Then retribution will swiftly follow. And at that moment, for the life of me, I would not be in their shoes."
BOB ARCTOR=>You know why I've got a block against this stuff? Because this bullshit is what gets people on dope.
FRED=>"D" is for Substance D. Which is for Dumbness, Despair, and Desertion, the desertion of your friends from you, you from them, everyone from everyone, isolation and loneliness and hating and suspecting each other. D is finally death. Slow Death, we... ... we the dopers call it...
BOB ARCTOR=>... Slow Death. From the head on down. Well, that's it.
HEADPHONE VOICE=>See me in my office when you get back.
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>I forgot to tell you that Fred asked me in advance to make this lecture primarily a Q and A forum with only a short introductory statement. So any questions?
FAT BUSINESSMAN=>Oh, wait, it appears Fred has something else to say. Good, then. Please.
BOB ARCTOR=>Just this. Don't kick their asses after they're on it. Half of them, especially the girls, didn't know they were getting on anything at all. See, the pushers dissolve some reds in a glass of wine, they give the booze to an underage little chick, she passes out, then they inject her with a mex hit -- half heroin, half Substance D. Thank you.
SECOND VOICE FROM CROWD=>How do we stop them, sir?
FRED=>Kill the pushers.
CHARLES FRECK=>Can you lay about ten Deaths on me?
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Christ, I'm looking to score myself.
CHARLES FRECK=>Christ. Christ. Christ Christ Christ.
CHARLES FRECK=>Fucking goddamn fuzzmobile. What was I doing? Was I weaving? I don't even know.
CHARLES FRECK=>What I'll do is pull over when I see a parking space. That's it: pull over like I was gonna pull over anyway. Like it's totally normal to pull over. Like I'm going to a store. That's perfect. Real people do that all the time.
CHARLES FRECK=>Fuck. Fucking fuzz. Now I'll never be able to pull back into traffic.
CHARLES FRECK=>Fox... fox... not a fox... fo...hey, I know that fox!
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey!
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey!
CHARLES FRECK=>Donna!
CHARLES FRECK=>Aren't you Bob Arctor's old lady?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No. Get lost.
CHARLES FRECK=>Sure you are. I met you at his place.
CHARLES FRECK=>Jeez. I just...
CHARLES FRECK=>One night me and Bob and another chick had some old Simon and Garfunkel tapes. You were filling caps with high-grade Death, then you laid one on each of us.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I thought you were going to knock me down and bang me.
CHARLES FRECK=>No. I just wondered if you, like, wanted a ride or... Bang you on the sidewalk? In broad daylight?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I thought you might pull me into a doorway or something.
CHARLES FRECK=>I know you. Besides Arctor would snuff me if I did that.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Well, I didn't recognize you. I'm sort of nearsighted.
CHARLES FRECK=>You want a ride where you're going?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You'll bang me in the car.
CHARLES FRECK=>Nah. Besides I can't get it up these days. Must be something they're adulterating all the stuff with.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>That's a neat-o line, but I've heard it before. Everybody bangs me. At least they try to. That's what it's like to be a chick.
CHARLES FRECK=>That really sucks.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I'm suing one guy right now for molestation and assault. We're asking punitive damages in excess of forty thousand.
CHARLES FRECK=>How far he get?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>A hand around my boob.
CHARLES FRECK=>That's not worth forty thousand.
CHARLES FRECK=>Listen, you got anything to sell? I'm really hurting.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I can get it.
CHARLES FRECK=>Tabs, though. I don't shoot up. Needles are a bummer to me.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Sixty dollars a hundred.
CHARLES FRECK=>Jeez, man, that's a burn.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>They're super good. Take my word.
CHARLES FRECK=>All right. A hundred, then.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Cool. How do I get in touch?
CHARLES FRECK=>Charles B. Freck --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>V. Freck?
CHARLES FRECK=>Charles Freck. She corrects the name. Freck notices that her writing is a slow and childish scrawl. It makes him sad. Then he steals a glance at her breasts as she writes.
CHARLES FRECK=>658-4412.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I think I remember you now.
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey, you want to go with me to see Jerry Fabin? I'm hauling some of his stuff over to the Number Three Federal Clinic where they took him last night.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I better not. Jerry thinks I contaminated him originally with those bugs.
CHARLES FRECK=>They're aphids.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yeah, well, then he didn't know what they were.
BOB ARCTOR=>Fucking McDonaldburger's is taking over.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Hello?
BOB ARCTOR=>Donna. How you doin'? It's Bob.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Oh. Hi.
BOB ARCTOR=>How's your head today, man?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Eh. I was bumtripped this a.m. by my boss. This gray hair bilked us out of ten bucks. So my boss says it's coming out of my paycheck!
BOB ARCTOR=>Hey, can I get anything from you?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I don't know.
BOB ARCTOR=>Ten. Just ten.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yeah, okay. I'll come over tonight. Hey, I have this book I want to show you. About wolves.
BOB ARCTOR=>Oh, wow.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You know what the male wolf does when he defeats a foe? He doesn't snuff him. He pees on him! Then he splits.
BOB ARCTOR=>I peed on some people today.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No kidding? How come?
BOB ARCTOR=>Metaphorically peed, I mean.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Not the usual way?
BOB ARCTOR=>What I mean is, I told this group of...
BOB ARCTOR=>... biker-types, at the Foster's Freeze. I was cruising around and they said something raunchy, so I turned and said something like --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You can tell me, even if it's super gross. You have to be super gross with biker-types.
BOB ARCTOR=>I told 'em I'd rather ride a pig than a hog.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I don't get it.
BOB ARCTOR=>Well, a pig is a chick that --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Oh. Okay, well I get it. Barf. Oh, I forgot to tell you, your roommates, Ernie What's-His-Name and Barris, came into the shop today looking for you.
BOB ARCTOR=>They didn't try me at my job, did they?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I dunno. They said they wanted to use your cephalochromoscope and it didn't work. So Barris took it apart --
BOB ARCTOR=>The hell you say --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>And apparently it's been sabotaged. The wires cut, and sort of weird stuff like that. Barris said he'd --
BOB ARCTOR=>Fuck Barris! That cephscope cost me nine hundred dollars. I need to get home right now. But I gotta... Oh, fuck, man. Fuck fuck fuck Barris!
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You gotta what?
BOB ARCTOR=>I gotta run an errand and like that.
BOB ARCTOR=>The S.O. believes Spade Weeks has lost himself inside New-Path by posing as a junky. New-Path strips junkies of all
NEW-PATH GIRL=>Can I help you?
BOB ARCTOR=>I'm in a bad place. I wanna turn myself in for treatment.
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey, Barris, I'm thinking of turning myself in to New-Path.
JIM BARRIS=>No shit.
CHARLES FRECK=>But it's tough, that cold turkey thing they do. They watch you night and day so you don't snuff. But they never give you anything, like a doctor will, like Valium or like that.
JIM BARRIS=>Hey, what kind of bread is this on the patty melt, anyway?
CHARLES FRECK=>Look on the menu. It explains everything.
JIM BARRIS=>If you go into New-Path, you'll experience symptoms that emanate up from the basic fluids of the body, specifically those located in the brain. By that I refer to the catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and serotonin. You see, Substance D functions this way: it interacts with the catecholamines in such a fashion that involement is locked in at a subcellular level. Biological counteradaptation has occurred. Nine-grain wheat.
NEW-PATH GIRL=>You look like hell, mister.
WAITRESS=>So is everything good, fellas?
JIM BARRIS=>Say, is your name Patty?
WAITRESS=>No. It's Beth.
CHARLES FRECK=>I wonder what the left one's called.
WAITRESS=>I'm sorry, hon?
CHARLES FRECK=>No. Nothing.
JIM BARRIS=>The waitress we had last time was named Patty. Same as the sandwich.
WAITRESS=>That must have been a different Patty from the sandwich. I think she spells it with an i.
JIM BARRIS=>Everything is super good.
WAITRESS=>Oh, oh, fuck me, Barris. Fuck me...
CHARLES FRECK=>Everything is not good with me. I got a lot of problems nobody else has.
WAITRESS=>Oh, no. That's too bad.
JIM BARRIS=>More people than you think have such problems. This is a world of illness, and getting progressively worse.
WAITRESS=>Oh, oh, oooh oh, Barris...
WAITRESS=>So would you guys like to order dessert? We have fresh peach pie.
CHARLES FRECK=>No! No, we don't want any dessert!
CHARLES FRECK=>Fruit pies are for old ladies anyway.
BOB ARCTOR=>This place is the only hope I could think of. I had a friend come in here. A black dude, in his thirties --
NEW-PATH GIRL=>You'll meet the family later. If you qualify. You have to be bad off to be let in here, mister.
BOB ARCTOR=>I am bad off.
NEW-PATH GIRL=>It's going to be super rough. You'll gnaw your pillow. You'll foam at the mouth. You'll dirty yourself the way sick animals do.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay, but listen, this black guy, my buddy, goes by the name of Spade, did he make it here? I sure hope he didn't get picked up by the pigs on the way over.
NEW-PATH GIRL=>There are no one-to-one relationships at New-Path. You'll learn that.
JIM BARRIS=>Tell me, why the debate regarding turning yourself in for residence therapy at a drug rehab facility?
CHARLES FRECK=>My friend Jerry Fabin and his aphids.
JIM BARRIS=>Fabin was a special case.
CHARLES FRECK=>There's another reason. I'm running low again, and I can't stand this always running low and not knowing if I'm ever going to score again. Actually, though, I may have a new source. That Donna chick.
JIM BARRIS=>Oh, Bob's girl.
CHARLES FRECK=>His old lady.
JIM BARRIS=>No. He never got into her pants.
CHARLES FRECK=>Really? Can't Bob get it on?
JIM BARRIS=>It's possible Donna's on junk. Her aversion to bodily contact -- junkies lose interest in sex, you see, due to their organs swelling up from vasoconstriction. And Donna shows inordinate failure of sexual arousal, not just to Bob, but to... other males as well.
CHARLES FRECK=>I never shot smack. Needles are a bummer to me.
JIM BARRIS=>But... I can show you how to lay Donna for ninety-eight cents.
CHARLES FRECK=>I don't want to lay her. I just want to buy from her.
JIM BARRIS=>Donna does coke. Anybody who would give her a gram of coke she would undoubtedly spread her legs for.
CHARLES FRECK=>I wish you wouldn't talk that way. Besides who has the money to procure a gram of coke?
JIM BARRIS=>I, my friend, can derive a gram of coke for a total cost to me of under one dollar. From a product readily available at your neighborhood 7-11.
CHARLES FRECK=>That's bullshit.
CHARLES FRECK=>Which 7-11 store do you prefer to shop at? The one on Lincoln is nice.
JIM BARRIS=>That's a fine 7-11.
CHARLES FRECK=>Although what about the one on 8th? They have the wider aisles. A more spacious shopping experience.
JIM BARRIS=>Let's not forget the one on Katella with the foxy cashier to hit on.
CHARLES FRECK=>What's with Bob's cephscope, his prize possession of the entire world?
JIM BARRIS=>Oh, it's been sabotaged by person or persons unknown.
JIM BARRIS=>Behold, what they've deliberately done is mix the cocaine with oil so it can't be extracted -- they cleverly call it benzocaine -- but my knowledge of chemistry is such that I know precisely how to separate the two.
CHARLES FRECK=>This is super unreal. I'm flipping.
JIM BARRIS=>Now I'll freeze it, which causes the cocaine crystals to rise to the top because they are lighter than air.
JIM BARRIS=>Than oil, I mean.
JIM BARRIS=>The terminal step I keep to myself, but it involves an intricate methodological process of filtering.
CHARLES FRECK=>Even if you do get a gram of coke out of thisl, I can't use it to get into Donna's pants. That's like buying her.
JIM BARRIS=>You give her a gift she gives you one. The most precious gift a woman has.
CHARLES FRECK=>You're talking about Bob Arctor's girl, Barris. He's my friend and the guy you and Luckman live with.
JIM BARRIS=>There's a great deal about Bob Arctor you're not aware of. Your view is simplistic and naive, and you believe about him what he wants you to.
CHARLES FRECK=>I do not.
HANK=>That covers Barris and Freck. Let's see, I guess we can write Jerry Fabin off.
FRED=>I read his EEG analysis. Fabin's over.
HANK=>Good riddance. Any luck locating our missing pusher friend Spade Weeks?
FRED=>New-Path wouldn't tell me shit. They're very protective of their own.
HANK=>Junkies, ex-junkies. It's a club. What about Donna Hawthorne?
FRED=>I keep pumping her for more and more Death. Pretty soon she'll have to refer me up to her source.
HANK=>Fine. And what's Arctor up to?
BOB ARCTOR=>Bob Arctor? He's not doing anything much. Working at his nowhere Blue Chip Stamp job, dropping a few tabs of meth cut with Death during the day.
HANK=>That's not what I hear.
BOB ARCTOR=>What do you mean?
HANK=>We have a tip that Arctor has funds above and beyond what he makes at the stamp redemption center.
FRED=>No shit, Hank. Is that true?
HANK=>And according to this information, Arctor comes and goes mysteriously. Have you observed any of this?
FRED=>Most likely he's with his chick, Donna.
HANK=>Most likely? You're supposed to know.
FRED=>Yeah, it's Donna. He's over there banging her day and night. But I'll let you know. So, who's the informant?
HANK=>Hell, we don't know. No voice print. He used one of those rinky-dink grids.
FRED=>Christ, it's that burned-out acid head Barris doing a schizy grudge job on Arctor's head. I wouldn't give him the time of day as an informant.
HANK=>We don't know it's Barris. Anyway, there may be more to Barris than meets the eye. We're looking into him. Nothing I feel would be of use to you, at least so far.
FRED=>Well, it's one of Arctor's friends.
HANK=>Yeah. Undoubtedly a vengeance burn trip. But we need to know why Arctor's making these kind of enemies.
FRED=>Hank, I don't see this as an avenue of
HANK=>So I'm taking you off Spade and, for the time being, I'm assigning you primarily to observe Bob Arctor.
FRED=>You're assigning me to watch Arctor?
HANK=>Covertly funded, covertly engaged, Fred. It's worth checking into.
BOB ARCTOR=>Fine. So I assume this means you'll be bugging Arctor's house and car?
HANK=>With the new holographic scanner system. This way you can study Arctor's every move on the tapes, and report back to us in detail.
FRED=>Sounds good, then.
HANK=>Good. You'll need to get Arctor and the boys away from the house so we can install the equipment.
CHARLES FRECK=>Why do you need a silencer, anyway, Jim? I mean, they're illegal.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Law abidance has always been of the utmost concern to Jim Barris.
JIM BARRIS=>In this day and age, with the kind of degenerate society we live in and the depravity of the individual, every person of worth needs a gun at all times. To protect himself.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Just shut up and fire off the great eleven cent silencer of our times.
CHARLES FRECK=>That's some silencer, man.
JIM BARRIS=>What it did was augment the sound rather than dampen it. But I almost have it right. I have it in principal, anyhow.
CHARLES FRECK=>How much is a gun like that worth?
JIM BARRIS=>Not much. Thirty bucks. I'll sell it to you.
JIM BARRIS=>You really ought to have one to protect yourself, Freck, against those who would harm you.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>There's a lot of those. I saw in the L.A. Times yesterday, they're giving away a free transistor radio to those who would harm Freck most successfully.
TELEVISION JINGLE=>It's real, it's Coke, it's really, really real. Really really really...
WIFE=>Popcorn and Cokes, guys?
DAUGHTERS=>Yay, Popcorn and Cokes!
BOB ARCTOR=>AH, FUCK!!
WIFE=>Honey?
BOB ARCTOR=>FUCKING POPCORN POPPER! FUCK!
WIFE=>Oh my God!
BOB ARCTOR=>That pain, so unexpected, so undeserved, cleared away the cobwebs in my head. I didn't hate the popcorn popper, I hated my wife and kids.
BOB ARCTOR=>FUCK!
BOB ARCTOR=>I hated my backyard,...
BOB ARCTOR=>... my front yard,...
BOB ARCTOR=>... my power mower.
BOB ARCTOR=>All the elements that made up my life were right there. And nothing new would ever happen. Like a little plastic boat that would sail on forever, without incident, until it finally sank, which would be a secret relief to all.
BOB ARCTOR=>So I ended that life and started this one. Now I dwell in a ugly world...
JIM BARRIS=>This one will be totally soundless.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Jesus, Barris. Y'know, you're supposed to be fixing the cephscope. Bob's lying in his bed right now thinking you're fixing his cephscope.
BOB ARCTOR=>Now I dwell in an ugly... disordered world. But this very disorder... permits... the... unpredictable to --
BOB ARCTOR=>Yeah?
BOB ARCTOR=>Come in, Barris.
JIM BARRIS=>Hey, Bob. I thought you'd be sleeping.
JIM BARRIS=>I am here to inform you, Bob, that I have formulated an initial theory as to who may have systematically damaged your cephscope with malice and may do it again.
JIM BARRIS=>You.
BOB ARCTOR=>Why the fuck would I screw up my own cephscope?
JIM BARRIS=>No, no. You... ... are looking at the person who did it. That was my complete, intended statement, which I was not allowed to utter.
BOB ARCTOR=>You did it?
JIM BARRIS=>I mean it's my theory that I did it. Under post-hypnotic suggestion. With an amnesia block so I wouldn't remember
BOB ARCTOR=>Oh, Jesus, Barris. Go fuck yourself.
JIM BARRIS=>Don't you see, Bob, I've got the advanced, specialized, technical, electronic skills. I have access, because I live here. It all fits. What I can't figure out is my motive.
BOB ARCTOR=>How about, you're a fucked-up lunatic?
JIM BARRIS=>I might have been hired by secret forces. It could be as big as that, Bob. As huge as that.
BOB ARCTOR=>Get lost.
JIM BARRIS=>Oh, hold on, Bob. I forgot something. I forgot my antihistamine capsules.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Jim Barris does not have allergies.
BOB ARCTOR=>You guys track down Andy and the hot scope. I'll pick you up in two hours.
JIM BARRIS=>And where are you off to?
BOB ARCTOR=>Dropping in on a friend.
JIM BARRIS=>Mysterious Bob Arctor.
BOB ARCTOR=>While in Long Beach today I checked in on Kim, an addict acquaintance who lives with dealer Dan Blake. My intention was to get the latest on Blake, but also to strand Barris and Luckman down here long enough for the scanners to be installed.
KIMBERLY=>Yes?
BOB ARCTOR=>It's me, Kimberly. Bob Arctor.
BOB ARCTOR=>Are you alone?
KIMBERLY=>Dan and I had a fight and he split.
BOB ARCTOR=>He beat you up?
KIMBERLY=>Thank God he didn't have his knife. His case-knife, which he now carries in a sheath on his belt.
KIMBERLY=>Why are you here, Bob? I'm bummed, I really am.
BOB ARCTOR=>Do you want him back?
KIMBERLY=>Well... Who knows?
BOB ARCTOR=>How long can you go without?
KIMBERLY=>Maybe. Maybe. Another day.
BOB ARCTOR=>Can't you get it anywhere else? Y'know the name of Dan's supplier? Maybe you could deal directly.
KIMBERLY=>I dunno.
KIMBERLY=>Is that him? Fuck. Red '79 Torino?
BOB ARCTOR=>Yeah.
KIMBERLY=>Probably has his case-knife with him. Y'know, he keeps it in a sheath on his belt now.
BOB ARCTOR=>You should call the police.
KIMBERLY=>No phone.
BOB ARCTOR=>Kim, he'll kill you.
DAN=>Open the fucking door!
KIMBERLY=>No. I'm with someone.
DAN=>Fine! I'll slash your tires!
DAN=>I'll slash your tires, your fucking tires! And then I'll kill you!
KIMBERLY=>I got to stop him! I don't have insurance!
BOB ARCTOR=>Tires aren't...
KIMBERLY=>My tires!
BOB ARCTOR=>That's what he wants you to do.
KIMBERLY=>Downstairs. They have a phone! Let me go!
KIMBERLY=>I'm calling the police. My tires! One of them is new!
KIMBERLY=>Open, please? Please? I need to call the police. Please let me call them.
BOB ARCTOR=>Thank you.
KIMBERLY=>Hi, yeah, my boyfriend and me got into a fight because of these cowboy boots which were worth seven dollars. See, I said, they're mine, and he says, no, they're mine 'cause you gave them to me as a present. And I say but I bought them. Which makes them mine. Right? So he grabs 'em and I grab 'em, and I rip the backs of them with this can opener and... yes, I'll hold.
ARCTOR=>This must be bad on you.
OLD MAN=>It goes on all the time, them fighting, him saying he'll kill her.
OLD WOMAN=>We should have gone back to Denver. I told you that.
OLD MAN=>These terrible fights. On and on. Smashing things and screaming. And what's worse, every time --
OLD WOMAN=>Yes, tell him about that.
OLD MAN=>Every time we go out, shopping or to mail a letter, we step in... what dogs leave.
OLD WOMAN=>Dog doo.
BOB ARCTOR=>Dog shit. All that misery and that's what really upset them.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You ought to pass that truck, man. The humper's hardly moving.
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS=>Slow down!
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS=>What the fuck?! What are you doing?!
JIM BARRIS=>What the hell happened, Bob?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>The linkage from the pedal to the carb fell apart.
BOB ARCTOR=>Shouldn't this locking ring hold the nut in place?
JIM BARRIS=>The idle screw has been turned all the way out. So when the linkage parted, the override went up instead of down.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Could it screw itself all the way out like that accidentally?
JIM BARRIS=>No. A special tool would be needed. A couple, in fact. I have the tools to fix this, but back at the house.
JIM BARRIS=>So we'll have to get to gas station and borrow tools from them.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Hey, man, did this happen by accident or was it done deliberately? Like the cephscope.
JIM BARRIS=>It's hard to say. You should've cut the ignition as soon as you realized what happened.
BOB ARCTOR=>For a second I couldn't figure it out.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>MOTHERFUCKER! Somebody did this intentionally! They fucking almost killed us!
BOB ARCTOR=>Maybe this is what's fucking us up, messing up our brains.
JIM BARRIS=>Dope can't screw up a carb-idle adjustment, my friend. You'd better take at least three of these. They're primo, but mild.
BOB ARCTOR=>Put the fucking snuffbox away!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Hey, do you smell something, man? A clue? Some engine smell that --
BOB ARCTOR=>Dog shit! Do you smell dog shit?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>No. Were there any psychedelics in that dope?
BOB ARCTOR=>It's an illusion, right? There's no dog shit smell. How could there be dog shit in the eng...
BOB ARCTOR=>Dog shit! Dog shit! Oil. Spilled oil. Thrown oil. That's all. Maybe a leaky head gasket.
BOB ARCTOR=>Dog shit! Fuck! It is dog shit!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Hey, man, you're getting a flashback.
JIM BARRIS=>Free theater tickets.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Now just take it easy. Nobody got killed and now we're warned. It's okay. It's okay. Everything's okay.
JIM BARRIS=>Hey, Bob, want a lump of dog shit? To chew on?
BOB ARCTOR=>What, Jim? What'd you say?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Leave him alone, man. Fuck off.
BOB ARCTOR=>What did Barris say just now? What the hell exactly did he just say?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I don't know, man. I can't figure out half the things he lays on people.
BOB ARCTOR=>You goddamn Barris! I know you did it, screwed over the cephscope and now my car! You kinky freak mother bastard!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Take it easy, Bob.
BOB ARCTOR=>I know it's him, man. I know.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>That doesn't make any sense. He'd have snuffed himself too.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What was in those tabs you gave us?
JIM BARRIS=>Hell, I took some too. And so did you. Didn't give us a bad trip. Besides it was so soon. Your stomach can't even absorb --
BOB ARCTOR=>YOU FUCKING POISONED ME!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I wonder what's been going on back at the house.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You know, this proves, Bob, that somebody is out to burn you real bad. I just hope the house is still there when we get back.
BOB ARCTOR=>Yeah, I hope.
JIM BARRIS=>Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that, gents.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Christ, Barris, they may have ripped off everything we got, or stomped all our animals, or --
JIM BARRIS=>But I left a little surprise for anyone entering the house. An electronic surprise, if you will.
BOB ARCTOR=>What kind of surprise? It's my house, Jim, you can't start rigging up --
JIM BARRIS=>Easy. Be cool.
BOB ARCTOR=>Well, what is it?
JIM BARRIS=>If the front door is opened, my tape recorder starts recording.
BOB ARCTOR=>You should've told me.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What if they come in the window or through the back door?
JIM BARRIS=>To increase the chance of them making their entry via the front door, I providentially left it unlocked.
BOB ARCTOR=>Well, they're not going to expect it to be unlocked, so they'll go in the window.
JIM BARRIS=>But I put a note on the front door.
BOB ARCTOR=>You're jiving me.
JIM BARRIS=>Yes.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Are you fucking jiving us or not? I can't tell with you, man. Is he jiving us or not, Bob?
BOB ARCTOR=>We'll see when we get back. If there's a note on the door and it's unlocked, we'll know he's not jiving us.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>But they'd probably take the note down and lock the door after vandalizing and robbing us. So we'll never know. It's that gray area again. Damn it!
JIM BARRIS=>Of course I'm kidding, guys! Only a psychotic would leave the front door open with a note on it.
BOB ARCTOR=>So what did you write on the note, Jim?
JIM BARRIS=>I wrote: "Donna, come on in, the door's unlocked. We..." The note's to Donna.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>He did do that. He really did it.
JIM BARRIS=>This way, we'll know who's been messing with us, Bob. And that is of prime importance.
BOB ARCTOR=>Jesus, Barris.
JIM BARRIS=>Interesting. Everything is exactly as we left it. They're very clever.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Well, Barris, I can see you're right. There was definitely someone here. You see, the scrupulous covering-over of all signs they otherwise would've left testifies to their -- Barris, you're one paranoid fuck.
BOB ARCTOR=>Strange how, now and then, paranoia can link up with reality.
JIM BARRIS=>Look at this!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>A still-hot butt. It sure is.
BOB ARCTOR=>My God, who was here?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Wait, this is what's hot. They lit a joint. But what'd they do? What the fuck did they do?
JIM BARRIS=>That roach may not be a slip-up. Maybe they were here specifically to plant dope, then phone in a tip later. Maybe there's dope planted all over this house. We're going to have to go through and get this place clean.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I'll check the wall sockets. You take apart the tv and stereo.
JIM BARRIS=>Wait. If they see us scrambling around before the raid --
BOB ARCTOR=>What raid?
JIM BARRIS=>-- then we can't allege, even though it's true, that we didn't know the dope was there. Maybe that, too, is part of their ingenious plan.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>We're fucked! We can't do anything!
BOB ARCTOR=>Did you forget about the recorder, Jim?
JIM BARRIS=>Oh yes. The tape should be extremely informational at this point. Well, it probably wouldn't ultimately have proven that important.
BOB ARCTOR=>Forget to turn it on, did you?
JIM BARRIS=>No. The first thing they did upon entering was switch it to "off".
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>It's off? Fuck! Those fuckers.
JIM BARRIS=>They made their move swiftly, before so much as an inch of tape pasesd through the recording head.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Now what? Now what the fuck do we do?
JIM BARRIS=>You know, Bob, there is one thing you could do, although it would take time.
BOB ARCTOR=>Sell the house?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Does anybody know a good realtor?
JIM BARRIS=>I've got an acquaintance in the field.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>We should probably act fast, man.
JIM BARRIS=>We don't know how fast they're gonna swoop down on us.
BOB ARCTOR=>What reason should we give for selling?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Yeah, we can't tell the truth. We need a shuck. Barris, what's a good shuck?
BOB ARCTOR=>We'll just flat out say there's narcotics planted all over the place and since we don't know where, we decided to move out and let the new owner get busted instead of us.
JIM BARRIS=>No. I don't think we can afford to be that up front. Bob, you say you got a job transfer.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Where to, though? Where the fuck to?
JIM BARRIS=>Cleveland.
BOB ARCTOR=>I say we tell them the truth. In fact, we can put an ad in the Times: "Modern, three bedroom tract house, two bathrooms for easy flushing, with high grade dope stashed in all rooms." It's a selling point.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>But they'd be calling asking what kind of dope, and we don't know. Man!
JIM BARRIS=>Or how much. Prospective buyers might inquire about the quantity.
BOB ARCTOR=>They appear to have us.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Christ, this is awful!
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Hey, I came in, like the note said. I waited for you for awhile, then I crashed. Why are you guys yelling?
BOB ARCTOR=>Did you smoke a joint? Before you crashed?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Of course. Otherwise I can't sleep. You shouldn't leave your place unlocked like that. You could get ripped off and it would be your own fault. That's the main reason I came in when I saw the note. Somebody ought to be here if the place is unlocked with a note on it.
BOB ARCTOR=>How long have you been here?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Well, you could've taken down the note, locked the door, and left.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Approximately thirty-eight minutes. Hey, Bob, I got that wolf book, if you want to see it. It's got a lot of heavy shit in it.
JIM BARRIS=>Life is only heavy and none else; heavy that leads to the grave. For everyone and everything.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Did you say you were selling the house? Or was that me dreaming?
BOB ARCTOR=>Shit, I hope it was you dreaming.
HANK=>Here are the locations of the eight scanners. We transmit to a safe house down the block from Arctor's.
FRED=>That's where I do playback?
HANK=>Yeah. And we use also use it for playback on five other houses. So you'll be bumping into other undercover people. Always wear your scramble suit.
FRED=>Fine.
HANK=>Make note of the scanner locations. If they need servicing, you can take care of it while you're at Arctor's. As long as nobody's around.
FRED=>I'll have to edit myself out, so you won't see who's fixing the scanners.
HANK=>Right. Although we assume you're Barris, or Luckman, or Freck, or Arctor or Donna Hawthorne --
FRED=>Donna?
HANK=>So don't edit yourself from all tapes, or we'll deduce who you are by process of elimination. Leave yourself in in places. Be creative. Have fun.
FRED=>Okay.
HANK=>This will help greatly in determining what the hell Arctor's up to.
FRED=>We don't know he's up to anything.
HANK=>We've got more recent information. There is no doubt any longer: Arctor's a phony, a three dollar bill. So keep on him until we have enough to arrest him and make it stick.
FRED=>You think he's high up in Death distribution?
HANK=>What we think isn't of any importance to you. You report; we evaluate.
FRED=>Well, Arctor is doomed if he's up to anything. And I have a hunch from what you say that he is.
HANK=>We should have a case on him soon. Then we can seize his house. I think you'd like it. It's rundown and dirty, but it's big. Nice yard. The installation crew reported it has excellent possibilities.
FRED=>For what?
HANK=>Well, the living room gives a view of the intersection, so passing vehicles could be graphed and... but Burt What's-his-face, who headed the crew, felt that it'd been allowed to deteriorate so badly that --
FRED=>Deteriorate in what way?
HANK=>The roof.
FRED=>The roof's perfect.
HANK=>Interior and exterior paint. The condition of the floors.
FRED=>Bullshit. It's all fine.
HANK=>Then you recommend we acquire it after Arctor's arrested and loses title?
FRED=>I have no opinion.
HANK=>You're not splitting yet. You have to report to room 203.
FRED=>Hank, if this is about the Lion's Club speech, I've already explained --
HANK=>This is something different.
FRED=>Yes.
FRED=>Look, about the Lion's Club --
FRED=>You think I'm an addict?
FRED=>I see a Coke bottle, I guess.
FRED=>Is this about the Lion's Club speech?
FRED=>Getting what?
FRED=>I don't think I'm getting that.
FRED=>Okay.
FRED=>A sheep.
FRED=>I'm sorry, what did you say?
FRED=>Nothing. I'm guessing it's not a sheep. But was I close at least?
FRED=>It's what? What did you say it is?
FRED=>Oh. How can you tell?
FRED=>Okay. I see it now. What does it mean that I saw a sheep? Does it mean that I'm crazy?
CHARLES FRECK=>Okay okay okay. So I go to Barris, "Hey, Barris, I bought a methedrine plant today," and he goes... "Methedrine is a benny, like speed, la la la. It's made synthetically in a lab la la la. It isn't organic like pot. There's no such thing as a methedrine plant, like there is a pot plant." Then I go... "I meant I inherited forty thousand dollars from an uncle and purchased a plant in this guy's garage where he makes meth. It's a factory. Plant in that sense... ' Okay okay, I don't have the phrasing exactly yet, but when I lay this on Barris, man, I'm going to get him so good.
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey, Jim, I bought a meth plant today.
JIM BARRIS=>How big?
CHARLES FRECK=>What do you mean?
JIM BARRIS=>How big a plant?
CHARLES FRECK=>Um, well... like, what do you mean?
BOB ARCTOR=>How much you pay, Freck?
CHARLES FRECK=>Uh, about ten bucks.
BOB ARCTOR=>Jim could've gotten it for you cheaper.
JIM BARRIS=>They're practically giving meth plants away.
CHARLES FRECK=>This is a whole fucking garage! A factory! It turns out a million pills a day!
JIM BARRIS=>All that for ten bucks?
BOB ARCTOR=>Where's it located, Freck?
CHARLES FRECK=>Not around here. Hey, fuck it, you guys.
BOB ARCTOR=>What about the carb?
JIM BARRIS=>Bent choke shaft. The whole carb needs to be rebuilt.
BOB ARCTOR=>Why is it bent?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I phoned and they're checking to see what a rebuilt carb will set you back. Hey, Freck.
CHARLES FRECK=>Hey.
BOB ARCTOR=>Freck bought a meth plant today.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Cool. How big?
CHARLES FRECK=>Fuck off.
JIM BARRIS=>You could put a four barrel on instead of a two, while you're at it.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>It would idle too high. And it wouldn't upshift.
JIM BARRIS=>The idling jets could be replaced with smaller jets. And he could watch his rpms with a tach. Usually just backing off the gas pedal causes it to upshift if the automatic linkage doesn't do it.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>If he tromped down heavy on the step- down passing gear to get a lot of torque suddenly on the freeway, it'd downshift and rev up so high it'd blow the whole engine.
JIM BARRIS=>The tach needle would jump and he'd back off.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>While passing a big semi? He'd have to blow the engine up or he'd never get around what he was trying to pass.
JIM BARRIS=>Momentum would carry him past.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What about uphill?
JIM BARRIS=>What does this car weigh, Bob?
BOB ARCTOR=>About a thousand pounds.
JIM BARRIS=>Well, you're right then. It wouldn't have much interia mass. A thousand pounds traveling eighty miles an hour --
BOB ARCTOR=>That's a thousand pounds with passengers, a full tank of gas, and a carton of bricks in the trunk.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>How many passengers, Bob?
BOB ARCTOR=>Twelve.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>That's six in the back and six --
BOB ARCTOR=>No. Eleven in the back and the driver alone up front. The extra weight is in the back so it doesn't fishtail.
JIM BARRIS=>This car fishtails?
BOB ARCTOR=>Unless you get eleven people in back.
JIM BARRIS=>Be better, then, to have two three hundred pound bags of sand in the trunk. Then the passengers could be distributed more comfortably.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What about one six hundred pound bag of gold, Jim?
JIM BARRIS=>If you bastards wouldn't rappity-rap on like a bunch of speed freaks, I could complete my computations and tell you how this car with its weight would handle a four barrel carb. So shut the fuck up, you assholes!
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I'm going to read to you now, Barris. "He to whom it is given to see Christ more real than any other reality...
JIM BARRIS=>What?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>"...than any other reality in the World, Christ everywhere present and everywhere growing more great, Christ the final determination and plasmatic Principle of the Universe --"
BOB ARCTOR=>What is that, Luckman?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Teilhard de Chardin. "... that man indeed lives in a zone where no multiplicity can distress him and which is nevertheless the most active workshop of universal fulfillment."
CHARLES FRECK=>Cool it, you guys.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Out of the way, Freck. I'm going to coldcock Barris into tomorrow for talking to his betters like that.
JIM BARRIS=>I hear the phone ringing about the carb. I'll get it.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I was just kidding.
CHARLES FRECK=>What if he comes back with his gun and silencer?
CHARLES FRECK=>Look, I'm splitting.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Naw, stay, man, you're a brother.
CHARLES FRECK=>Naw, I'm cutting out.
JIM BARRIS=>It was a wrong number, man.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Hey, what's the hammer for, Jimmy-Boy?
BOB ARCTOR=>To fix the engine. What else?
JIM BARRIS=>Thought I would bring it with me, since I was indoors and noticed it.
CHARLES FRECK=>I'm gonna split. I'll see you guys.
BOB ARCTOR=>The most dangerous kind of person is one who's afraid of his own shadow.
CHARLES FRECK=>Did Bob mean me afraid of my own shadow? But that was turning into a super-bummer. Where's the chicken into not wanting to be around that? Everything's changing, man. Used to be cool to hang out. Now its totally dark.
CHARLES FRECK=>Jerry! Jerry! Let me in, man, I'm truly bummed! I wanna talk!
CHARLES FRECK=>Fuck! I can't believe I forgot Jerry's dead. What is wrong with me?
CHARLES FRECK=>Fuck, I can't believe I forgot Jerry's not dead. What is wrong with me?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You seem mellow, Bob. Having to spend a hundred bucks on a new carb wouldn't make me mellow.
BOB ARCTOR=>I'll cruise the streets until I come across an Olds, then unbolt the carb. Like everyone else I know.
JIM BARRIS=>Especially Donna. That chick steals everything she can carry.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I'll tell you a Donna story. One day she put a quarter in a stamp machine and it kept spitting out stamps, till she had like eighteen thousand stamps.
JIM BARRIS=>At what individual price per stamp?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Fifteen cents per individual stamp.
JIM BARRIS=>That's twenty-seven hundred dollars, if my arithmetic is correct.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>And so what's Donna gonna do with so many stamps? She can barely write...
BOB ARCTOR=>The scanners will have miles of this tripped-out garbage. But it's not the stuff that happens while I'm here that matters. It's what goes on while I'm gone. So I'll split. Then I'll see what these three clowns are up to.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>So she ripped off the whole stamp machine and remounted it, like, somewhere where the postal authorities wouldn't spot it and...
BOB ARCTOR=>What if I see some awful truth about the people I care about on these tapes? What if I see Donna climbing in the window and ripping me off, or destroying my stuff? Or some weird, nightmarish world beyond the mirror...
JIM BARRIS=>You realize our taxes were raised by her stealing those stamps? It's one thing to steal auto parts, but when you steal from Uncle Sam --
BOB ARCTOR=>I'm going out to score some beans. Luckman, is your Falcon running?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>No. I don't think so.
BOB ARCTOR=>Barris?
JIM BARRIS=>I wonder, Bob, if you can handle my car? By that mean there are --
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Fuck, Barris. It's an ordinary six cylinder. The parking lot jockeys park it all the time, for God's sake.
JIM BARRIS=>There are certain secret devices which have been incorporated --
BOB ARCTOR=>I'll walk.
JIM BARRIS=>It's just that it has certain secret --
BOB ARCTOR=>Forget it. If I tried to drive your car, I'd press the wrong button and float up over the greater L.A. area.
JIM BARRIS=>I'm glad you appreciate my position.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You're fucked, Barris. You know that?
FRED=>Would if I could, but this is live.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Fucking McDonaldburger commercials.
FRED=>Jesus fuck! Barris!
FRED=>Barris?! Barris!!
JIM BARRIS=>Operator, I need, I'm not sure, is it called the inhalator squad or the resuscitation squad?
OPERATOR=>Is someone unable to breathe, sir?
JIM BARRIS=>It is, I believe, cardiac arrest. Either that or involuntary aspiration of a bolus within the --
OPERATOR=>What is the address, sir?
JIM BARRIS=>The address, the address. let's see...
FRED=>Christ! Just --
JIM BARRIS=>Uh, thank you. No assistance is needed after all. Good morrow.
JIM BARRIS=>You okay, Ernst?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>I must've gagged. Did I pass out?
JIM BARRIS=>Not exactly. You did go into an altered state of consciousness for a few seconds. Probably an alpha state.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Fuck. I shit myself.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What were you doing while I was lying there, jacking off?
JIM BARRIS=>You saw me on the phone, summoning the paramedics. I moved into action immedi --
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Balls.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Did I scare you? Heh heh.
BOB ARCTOR=>I just did a freaky number, not like a fantasy trip, but... So I'm kinda --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I have your stuff.
BOB ARCTOR=>My stuff?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Your Death.
BOB ARCTOR=>Fucking Barris. You know how he kills you? He doesn't. He waits until a situation arises where you die, and he just sits there. In fact he sets you up to die. I don't know how exactl --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Do you have the money?
BOB ARCTOR=>What?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I need the money right now.
BOB ARCTOR=>Sure. Yeah.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I don't like Barris, and I don't trust him. He's crazy. And you're crazy when you're around him. You're crazy right now.
BOB ARCTOR=>I am?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yeah.
BOB ARCTOR=>Donna, I know I can count on you to tell me if I'm getting weird or crazy or like that. Okay?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Hey, you wanna take me to a concert at Anaheim Stadium next weekend?
BOB ARCTOR=>Right on. Yeah. That sounds --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I'm gonna bring some really oily hash and get really loaded. But you have to wear something neat, not those funky clothes you sometimes wear.
BOB ARCTOR=>I'll wear whatever you say.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I'm taking us to my place. And you do have the money and you'll give it to me. Then we'll drop a few of the tabs and kick back. Maybe you could buy a fifth of Southern Comfort and we could get bombed as well.
BOB ARCTOR=>Oh, wow. That sounds good.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You know what would be cool tonight, is to go to the Torrance Drive-in. They're showing all eleven Planet of the Apes movies. From 7:30 to 8:00 tomorrow morning.
BOB ARCTOR=>Can a drive-in show movies in the morning?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I haven't seen all the Ape movies in years. And the last one for longer than that, the one where they reveal
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Stay on the newspaper. I just had the rug shampooed.
BOB ARCTOR=>Do you ever throw anything away?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Someday I'm gonna get married and I'm going to need all this stuff. When you get married, you need everything there is.
BOB ARCTOR=>How much of what you've got did you buy and how much did you steal?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Buy? What do you mean "buy"?
BOB ARCTOR=>Like when you buy dope. Like a dope deal. When I mean by "buy" is an extension into the greater world of business transactions of what we have present now, with us, as dope deals.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I think I see what you're saying.
BOB ARCTOR=>Like when you rip off those Coca-Cola truck you tailgate. That's stealing.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No. It's a form of barter.
BOB ARCTOR=>Donna, look, you're gonna get caught, and if you got drugs in your car when they catch you, there's nothing I can do to protect you then.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You protect me? What are you talking about?
BOB ARCTOR=>Nothing. I just... Please take care.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>The Coca-Cola company is a capitalist monopoly. No one else can make it but them. That's fucking wrong. C'mere, I'll supercharge you.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay, cool.
BOB ARCTOR=>I love you, Donna.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yeah, I can dig it, you being in love with me.
BOB ARCTOR=>Hey, Donna, man, do you like cats?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Dripping little things. Moving along about a foot above the ground.
BOB ARCTOR=>No. On the ground.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Drippy. Behind furniture.
BOB ARCTOR=>Little spring flowers, then?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yes. Little spring flowers. With yellow in them. That first come up.
BOB ARCTOR=>Before. Before anyone.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Yes. Before anyone stomps on them and they're gone.
BOB ARCTOR=>Yeah. You know me exactly, Donna. You can read me. No one knows me but you.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No more.
BOB ARCTOR=>What's wrong?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Nothing.
BOB ARCTOR=>Donna, can I put my arm around you. I want to hold you, okay?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No, you're too ugly.
BOB ARCTOR=>What?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>No! Look, I snort a lot of coke; I have to be super careful because I snort a lot of coke.
BOB ARCTOR=>Ugly? Fuck you, Donna.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Just leave my body alone.
BOB ARCTOR=>Sure. Yeah. You better believe it.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I don't like people to grope my body! I have to watch out for that because I do so much coke. Someday I'm gonna go over the Canadian border with four pounds of coke in my snatch. I'll say I'm a Catholic and a virgin.
BOB ARCTOR=>I'm taking off.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You don't have your car. I'll drive you, man. But you can see why I have to protect my snatch --
BOB ARCTOR=>You're too stoned to drive and you never let anyone else drive that little roller skate of yours.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>That's because no one else can fucking drive my car! Nobody else ever gets it right, no man especially! Driving or anything else! Listen, you had your hands down into my --
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I'm dreadfully sorry I hurt your feelings. Okay? I was out of it.
BOB ARCTOR=>Too ugly.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Sometimes I get really spaced. You wanna come back? Or what? You wanna go to the drive-in? What about the Southern Comfort? C'mon, I'm sorry.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>That sure is good hash though, huh?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You know what I'm going to do someday, Bob? I'm going to move north to Oregon and live in the snow. Have a little house and a vegetable garden.
BOB ARCTOR=>You'll have to save up for that.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>He'll get me that. What's-his-name.
BOB ARCTOR=>Who?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Mr. Right. He'll drive an Aston- Martin and take me north in it. And that's where the little old fashioned house will be in the snow.
BOB ARCTOR=>You sure this'll happen?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>It's in the cards.
BOB ARCTOR=>Hey, man, can I go with you? To Oregon? When you do take off finally?
BOB ARCTOR=>Here you go.
CONNIE=>Thanks, man.
CONNIE=>Do you have a toothbrush I can use. Aw screw it -- teeth are teeth. I'll brush 'em. You gotta ...
CONNIE=>Who are those guys rattling on and on out there? Jabber-jaws. They live here with you, I guess.
BOB ARCTOR=>Two of them do.
CONNIE=>You're queer?
BOB ARCTOR=>I try not to be. That's why I've arranged this transaction with you.
CONNIE=>Yes, I suppose I'm about to find out.
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Yeah?
JIM BARRIS=>This is Jim.
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Who?
JIM BARRIS=>With the beard. Green shades. Leather pants. I met you at that happening at --
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Oh, right. Yeah. That guy. Jim.
JIM BARRIS=>Say, have I scored. Psylocybe Mexicana. A rare hallucinogenic mushroom used in South American mystery cults thousands of years ago. You fly, become invisible, understand the speech of animals --
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Truly? How much?
JIM BARRIS=>Five dollars a cap.
FRED=>Mushrooms he seems to have picked locally.
FRED=>What's the statute violation?
FRED=>Hi, Bob.
BOB ARCTOR=>Hi.
JIM BARRIS=>How'd you make out with little Miss Big Tits?
FRED=>Fuck off, Barris.
BOB ARCTOR=>Fuck off, Barris.
JIM BARRIS=>Bob, I'm sorry if I offended you.
BOB ARCTOR=>Where's Luckman?
JIM BARRIS=>He left with your jack, so I assume he's off to knock over pay phones.
BOB ARCTOR=>My axle jack?
JIM BARRIS=>Y'know, I have a sure fire way you could get into the pants of Little Miss Big Tits. For under one dollar.
BOB ARCTOR=>Either you pay up your back rent or get to work fixing my godamn cephscope!
JIM BARRIS=>Yes. About that, Bob. I've already ordered resistors --
JIM BARRIS=>Yeah?
JIM BARRIS=>Yes, this is Robert Arctor.
JIM BARRIS=>Oh, yes, I've been meaning to call you, but I've had a severe bout of intestinal flu, with loss of body heat, pyloric spasms, cramps...
BOB ARCTOR=>Barris portraying Arctor as coming off heroin.
JIM BARRIS=>I just haven't been able to get it together to make that little twenty dollar check good, and frankly I don't intend to make it good.
JIM BARRIS=>You heard me correctly.
JIM BARRIS=>Think what you want. Turn out, tune out, and good-bye.
FRED=>Get me a name and address on this.
OPERATOR=>Englesohn Locksmith, 1343 Harbor in Anaheim, Loverboy.
BOB ARCTOR=>Barris up to something: pretending to be me... writing rubber checks on my account... representing me as a heroin addict. BUT WHAT IS HE UP TO?
FRED=>Arctor must've burned Barris pretty bad to deserve this display of malice.
FRED=>Yeah. I'm there.
FRED=>I suppose I can lay it on that one. Without him flashing on me. He's docile.
FRED=>That can't be right. Arctor has never done it with Donna. Has he?
OLD LADY=>Yes sir? Good morning.
BOB ARCTOR=>Hi, I'm here...
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>Ihr Instrumente freilich spottet mein/Mit Rad und Kammen, Walz' und Bugel:/Ich stand am Tor, ihr... The scene shifts back. Maybe a hiccup's worth of time has passed.
BOB ARCTOR=>... to pay for a check of mine the bank returned. It's twenty dollars.
OLD LADY=>Oh. All-rightey.
OLD LADY=>Mr. Arctor, is it?
BOB ARCTOR=>Yes, I am Mr. Arctor. Nobody else is.
OLD LADY=>Okay, sir. That'll be twenty dollars.
BOB ARCTOR=>I'm sorry about this, but by mistake I wrote the check on a closed account.
BOB ARCTOR=>Also, I'd appreciate if you'd tell your husband --
OLD LADY=>My brother Carl.
BOB ARCTOR=>I'd appreciate if you'd tell your brother that I was distraught when he called and I apologize for that, too.
OLD LADY=>I believe he said something about that, yes.
BOB ARCTOR=>Any extra charge?
OLD LADY=>No extra charge.
BOB ARCTOR=>I was distraught because a friend of mine had just passed-on suddenly.
OLD LADY=>Oh dear.
BOB ARCTOR=>He choked to death alone, in his room, on a piece of meat. No one heard him.
OLD LADY=>You know, Mr. Arctor, more deaths happen from that than people realize. I read that if you're dining with a friend and he doesn't talk for a long time, you should ask him if he can, beacuse he may be strangling.
BOB ARCTOR=>Yes. That's true. Thanks. And thanks about the check.
OLD LADY=>Well, I'm sorry about your friend.
BOB ARCTOR=>Yes. He was the best friend I had.
OLD LADY=>How dreadful. I'll tell Carl. And thank you for coming all the way down.
BOB ARCTOR=>Thank you. And thank Mr. Englesohn for me. Thank you both so much.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay then, thank you.
BOB ARCTOR=>A perfect forgery. Barris has my handwriting down. How many checks has he written on my account? Evil genius bastard.
BOB ARCTOR=>What if I, Bob Arctor, wrote this check myself and just don't remember?
BOB ARCTOR=>I'm sorry to bother you again, ma'am, but I was just wondering what address do you have for that service call?
OLD LADY=>Just a minute, Mr. Arctor, I'll check.
OLD MAN=>Is that Arctor?
OLD LADY=>Yes, but Carl, don't say anything. He came in just now --
OLD MAN=>Let me talk to him.
OLD LADY=>Mr. Arctor? It says here it was in Santa Ana. On Main Street.
BOB ARCTOR=>Yeah, I lost my ignition key. 34881 Main Street, Santa Ana...
BOB ARCTOR=>So, Arctor's the forger, not Barris! Not deliberately, but because his brain is slushed on dope. All their brains are...
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>Der wurme gleich' ich, der den Staub Durchwuhlt,/Den, wie er sich im Staube nahrend lebt,/Des Wandrers Tritt... Back to normal as a car passes with a faulty muffler.
BOB ARCTOR=>... slushed and mutually interacting in a slushed way.
BOB ARCTOR=>But what is Arctor up to? Clearly the Sheriff's Office has some good reasons to focus their investigation on him. No doubt reasons I know nothing about. My job is to report, theirs to evaluate.
BOB ARCTOR=>Fucking waste of a perfectly good house. A family could live here, for Christ's sake. Oughta take it away from this fuck.
BOB ARCTOR=>Nobody home, I guess.
BOB ARCTOR=>What does a scanner see? Does it see into the head? Into the heart? Does it see into me clearly or darkly? I hope clearly, because I can't any longer. I see only murk inside and out.
BOB ARCTOR=>Any given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and...
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>Weh! steck' ich in dem Kerker... INT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY
CHARLES FRECK=>It is no problem how to kill yourself in the circles in which I hang. When life becomes more and more depressing as you watch those you know falling apart from drug use, just take a large quantity of reds.
CHARLES FRECK=>Wash 'em down with a bottle of cheap wine.
CHARLES FRECK=>The hard part is choosing the correct artifacts to be found on you by later archaeologists. So they know from which stratum you came and where your head was at when you did it.
CHARLES FRECK=>I will be found with Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" open by my side to prove I have been a misunderstood superman rejected by the masses and so, in a sense, murdered by their scorn.
CHARLES FRECK=>Also, an unfinished letter to Exxon protesting the cancellation of my gas credit card. That way I will indict the system and achieve something by my death. Over and above what the death itself achieves.
CHARLES FRECK=>Perhaps a connoisseur wine is in order on such an auspicious occasion.
CHARLES FRECK=>You'll soon be sorry, Exxon, you ever tangled with Charles B. Freck! Junior!
BOB ARCTOR=>Any given man sees only a tiny portion of Weh! steck' ich in dem Kerker noch? Verfluchtes the total truth, and very often, in fact almost perpetually dumpfes Mauerloch...
FRED=>What the fuck is he talking about?
BOB ARCTOR=>Wo selbst das liebe Himmelschlicht he deliberately deceives trub durch gemalte Scheiben bricht!
FRED=>He's playing head games with us. He's shucking us. The fucker!
BOB ARCTOR=>I'll be dipped.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Hi, what's happening, Bob?
BOB ARCTOR=>I drove by the Maylar Microdot Corporation building.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You're shitting me.
BOB ARCTOR=>One of the employees had evidently tracked the inventory out on the heel of his shoe. So they were all in the parking lot with many little magnifying glasses.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Any reward?
BOB ARCTOR=>They had a reward, but they lost that, too. It was a little tiny penny.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>How large is the Maylar Microdot Corporation building?
FRED=>Pathetic, soulless nitwits.
BOB ARCTOR=>About an inch high.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Well, then how can you tell when you drive past it, if its only an inch?
BOB ARCTOR=>They have a really big sign.
FRED=>Jesus.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What's the sign look like?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Y'know how can you smuggle microdots into the U.S.? Barris told me. I'm not supposed to say, cause he's putting it in his book, "Simple Ways to Smuggle Objects into the U.S. and Out, Depending on Which Way You're Going."
BOB ARCTOR=>Oh, just tell me.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>You smuggle it with a shipment of dope. Like heroin. The microdots are so small no one would notice.
BOB ARCTOR=>That's a decent idea.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Barris had this other idea for smuggling dope. You know how the custom guys, they ask you to declare what you have?
BOB ARCTOR=>Right.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Well, you take a huge block of hash and you carve it in the shape of a man. Then you hollow out a little section and put a wind-up motor in. And a cassette tape. And just before it goes through customs, you wind it up and it walks up to the man, who says, "Do you have anything to declare?" and it says, "No, I don't," and keeps on walking.
BOB ARCTOR=>You put a solar battery in it, it could keep walking for years. Forever.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>What's the use of that?
BOB ARCTOR=>Imagine an Eskimo village. And this six foot block of hash worth... What would it be worth?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>A billion dollars?
BOB ARCTOR=>More. Two billion. So these Eskimos are chewing hides when this six foot block of hash comes walking through the snow saying, "No, I don't" over and over again.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>They'd wonder what it meant by that.
BOB ARCTOR=>Legends would spring up.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Can you imagine telling your grandkids, "I saw with my own eyes a six foot block of hash appear and walk past, worth two billion dollars, saying, "No, I don't." His grandchildren would have him committed.
BOB ARCTOR=>But, see, legends build. So in a few centuries it would be, "In my forefathers' time, a ninety foot high block of extremely good quality
BOB ARCTOR=>Afghanistan hash worth eight trillion dollars came at us dripping fire and screaming, "Die, Eskimo dogs!" And we fought and fought with it and finally killed it with our spears.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>The kids wouldn't believe that either.
BOB ARCTOR=>Kids never believe anything anymore.
FRED=>Yeah?
TELEPHONE VOICE=>Fred, we've processed your tests. We need you to come back for the full battery. Tomorrow at three. Do you remember the room number?
FRED=>Um... okay.
TELEPHONE VOICE=>It's 203. Are you all right, Fred? Any confusion? Difficulty identifying persons or objects? Does anything you see appear inverted or reversed? Any space-time or language disorientation?
FRED=>Um, what? I just... what exactly have you processed... that is, is this in regard to the Lion's Club speech?
TELEPHONE VOICE=>We'll take all that up tomorrow, Fred.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>... this guy appeared on tv, claiming to be a world-famous imposter. He said he'd posed at one time or another as a great surgeon, a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle research physicist, a Finnish novelist, a deposed president of Argentina...
BOB ARCTOR=>He got away with it? Never got caught?
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>See, the guy never really posed as any of it. He only posed as a world- famous imposter. Turns out he just pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he read about this actual world-famous imposter, and he thought, I can pose as all those things, then he thought, hell, I'll just pose as an imposter. Save a lot of time, a lot easier. Made almost as much money as the real imposter with books and movie rights.
JIM BARRIS=>We see imposters in our lives, now and then. But not posing as physicists.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Narks, you mean. Yeah, I wonder what a nark looks like?
BOB ARCTOR=>It's like asking what an imposter looks like. I asked a hash dealer who'd been busted once what the nark who busted him looked like --
JIM BARRIS=>Looked just like us.
BOB ARCTOR=>More so. The dealer dude told me the nark had longer hair than we do. I guess the moral is, stay away from guys who look like us.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>Narks give me the creeps.
BOB ARCTOR=>How could a guy do that is what I want to know, pose as a nark?
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS=>What?
BOB ARCTOR=>Shit, I'm spaced. Pose as a nark.
ERNIE LUCKMAN=>POSE AS A NARK? POSE AS A NARK?
BOB ARCTOR=>My brains are scrambled today. I better go crash.
FRED=>Posing as a nark. What does Arctor mean?
CHARLES FRECK=>I've been burned. These are not reds, but rather some freaky psychedelic, the likes of which I have never seen.
CHARLES FRECK=>Fuck. You're going to read me my sins, aren't you?
CHARLES FRECK=>And it's going to take a hundred thousand million hours, isn't it?
CREATURE=>We are no longer in the mundane universe. Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly throughout eternity.
CHARLES FRECK=>Know your fucking dealer, man.
CREATURE=>November 14, 1962, 3:08:23 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister Evelyn on the left side of the head when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:27 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister on the left arm when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:32 pm: you did...
FRED=>Okay.
FRED=>This is the different one.
FRED=>Thank you. Thank you all very much.
HANK=>Fred, is that you?
FRED=>Yes.
HANK=>Fred, this is the informant who phoned in about Bob Arctor.
HANK=>We challenged him to appear in person and he did. Do you know him?
FRED=>Sure I do. You're James Barris, aren't you?
HANK=>His i.d. shows him to be, yes.
FRED=>What does he want?
JIM BARRIS=>I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of a large, secret covert organization, well-funded, with arsenals of weapons at their disposal, probably dedicated to the overthrow --
HANK=>That part is speculation. We want to know what your firsthand evidence is.
FRED=>Have you ever been in a mental hospital, Mr. Barris?
JIM BARRIS=>No, I have not, sir, ever been in a --
FRED=>Will you sign a sworn notarized statement regarding your evidence?
HANK=>He already has, Fred.
JIM BARRIS=>My evidence, gentlemen, which I mostly don't have with me today, consits of tape recordings I have made of Robert Arctor's phone conversations.
FRED=>What is this covert organization?
JIM BARRIS=>I believe it to be political in nature, and against this country.
FRED=>And what is Arctor's relationship to Substance D?
JIM BARRIS=>When you examine my evidence, you will undoubtedly conclude that Substance D is produced by a foreign nation determined to overthrow the U.S., and
HANK=>Can you tells us the name of anyone else inside this organization?
JIM BARRIS=>A Miss Donna Hawthorne. On various pretexts he goes over to her place and colludes with her regularly.
FRED=>Colludes? What do you mean?
JIM BARRIS=>I've followed him in my car, sir.
FRED=>She's his girl!
HANK=>You think there's nothing to this?
FRED=>Let's look at his evidence.
HANK=>Bring us your evidence. Maybe we should send an officer with him to retrieve it.
JIM BARRIS=>There's one more thing. Mr. Arctor is addicted to Substance D. His mind is deranged now. He's become dangerous.
FRED=>Dangerous.
JIM BARRIS=>He's already having episodes such as occur with brain damage from Substance D. Deterioration in the corpus callosum.
HANK=>This kind of unsupported speculation is worthless. We'll send an officer with you to collect your evidence.
JIM BARRIS=>But, sirs --
HANK=>We'll arrange for an officer out of uniform, so it won't be conspicuous.
JIM BARRIS=>I might be murdered. Mr. Arctor is, as I say --
HANK=>We appreciate your extreme risk, Mr. Barris. If your information is of significant value in obtaining a conviction, then naturally --
JIM BARRIS=>That's not why I'm doing this. The man is sick. Brain damaged from Substance D. The reason I am here --
HANK=>We don't care why you're here. We only care if your evidence amounts to anything. The rest is your problem.
JIM BARRIS=>Thank you, sirs. Thank you very much.
FRED=>Yes.
FRED=>Uh-huh.
FRED=>Okay. Thank you.
FRED=>Why do I have two gas gauges?
FRED=>Will these go away? These gas gauges?
FRED=>Wait. I'm confused. Are you saying it is organic, or --
FRED=>Half a gas gauge? What would that be like?
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>Look, I can't talk. I'll call you back.
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>This can't wait.
HANK=>Fred?
FRED=>Yeah. Sorry I'm late. I just...
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>Well, what is it then?
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>We intend to...
HANK=>Would you identify the voices for us?
JIM BARRIS=>The female's voice is a Miss Donna Hawthorne. The male is Bob Arctor.
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>... half of Southern California tomorrow night. The Air Force Arsenal at Vandenberg AFB will be hit for automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>What about that disorientation drug the bikers ripped off for us? When do we carry that crud up to the watershed area to --
TAPE RECORDER VOICE=>The organization needs the weapons first. The drugged water supply is step B.
JIM BARRIS=>I can identify the biker gang also.
HANK=>You have more material of this sort?
JIM BARRIS=>Much more. Much much more. Much much much much much --
HANK=>Okay, great. What I'm going to do, Mr. Barris, is impound this material here for further study. You will be held in custody, charged with giving false information. This is, of course, only a pretext for your own safety, but the formal charge will be lodged anyhow. Is that satisfactory?
HANK=>What's your response, Fred, to Barris's evidence so far?
FRED=>Is that my medical report, Hank?
FRED=>Well, I think the little Barris played sounded genuined to me.
HANK=>Oh, it's a fake, Fred, for Christ sake.
FRED=>You might be right. But I don't agree. Um, so what does my medical report --
HANK=>It says you're completely cuckoo.
FRED=>Completely?
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>Wie kalt ist es in diesem unterirdischen Gewolbe!
HANK=>Maybe two brain cells still light up.
FRED=>Out of how many, would you say?
HANK=>I don't know. I understand brains have a lot of cells.
HANK=>I'll tell you what I'd do, Fred. I wouldn't go into a federal clinic. I'd get about six bottles of good bourbun, go up into the hills, and just stay there till it's over.
FRED=>They tell me it may never be over.
HANK=>Then never come back. Can you drive?
FRED=>My...
HANK=>We can get somebody to drive you.
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>Ein Engel, der Gattin, so gleich, der fuhrt, mich zur Freheit ins...
FRED=>Sure. Thanks. Tell me, Hank, what do you think of me now, now that I've burned out?
HANK=>I think you're a very good person.
FRED=>Thank you very much.
HANK=>You want a cigarette?
FRED=>No. I'm quitting them, too. I'm quitting everything.
HANK=>Good for you. It's like I tell my children --
FRED=>I have kids, too. Two little girls.
HANK=>I don't believe you do. You're not supposed to.
FRED=>Maybe not.
HANK=>I don't think you're going to make it in the mountains, even if we get someone to drive you. Where else would you like to go?
FRED=>I don't know. I don't know.
HANK=>What about over to Donna Hawthorne's? I know you're close.
FRED=>How do you know that?
HANK=>By a process of elimination we were able to determine you're Bob Arctor.
FRED=>Arctor? I'm Bob Arctor? But he's ugly!
HANK=>Nevermind. It's not important. Get me a Donna Hawthorne at... Where does she work?
FRED=>Uh, Thompson Jewelers. I'm Arctor?
HANK=>... at Thompson Jewelers. We should probably get you to a hospital. Barris poisoned you. It was really Barris, we were interested in. That's why we set up the scanners. He's into something heavy and sick, and it has to do with guns.
FRED=>So, wait, you used me to get to Barris?
HANK=>We had to get to him, Bob. He's bad news. We couldn't tell you. We were afraid you'd spill the beans.
FRED=>You fuckers. You fuckers.
HANK=>Hey, Donna? This is a buddy of Bob's. He's in a bad way. I'm not jiving you. So could you pick him up, ...
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Before we go to New-Path, Bob, I thought maybe we'd drive into the hills, y'know, look at the city lights.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Let's sit a few minutes.
BOB ARCTOR=>Do you have any hash?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>C'mon, let's get off the road a little bit. In case of cops.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Here.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>I guess we never know what's in store for us.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Did you know this dude Tony Amsterdam?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>After he saw God, he felt really good, for around a year. Then he felt worse than he had ever felt before in his life. Because one day it came to him, he was never going to see God again. He was going to live out the rest of his life, fifty years maybe, and see nothing but what he had always seen. He realized he was going to have to live on and on with no purpose. Just a lump of flesh grinding along, eating, drinking, working, sleeping, crapping --
BOB ARCTOR=>Just... like... the... rest... of us.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>That's what I told him. We're all in the same boat, and it doesn't freak us out. But he said, "You don't know what I saw."
BOB ARCTOR=>Did... he say what it was like?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Spars. Showers of colored sparks. In the air. Going up the wall. Wherever he looked. The whole world
BOB ARCTOR=>What was on the other side?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>He said it was always nighttime. Moonlight and water. Nothing ever changed. Water like blank ink and a beach. He was sure it was ancient Greece, that the door was a weak link in time. Later when he couldn't see it anymore, he became so frustrated with the noise and lights and motion in this world. He'd tell everyone he met that he lost everything.
BOB ARCTOR=>I've lost everything.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>There was a woman on the island. More like a statue. Of the Cyrenaican Aphrodite. In the moonlight. Pale and cold.
BOB ARCTOR=>He should've gone through while he had the chance. You only get one chance.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>He didn't have the chance, Bob. It was a promise. Something to come. Something better a long time in the future. They show us trailers now. So we'll hold out.
BOB ARCTOR=>That's what you're trying to do. With me now. Show me a trailer. So I'll hold out.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You're a good man. You've been dealt a bad blow. But life isn't over for you. I care for you a lot. I wish...
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>You're a good and kind person. And this is unfair, but it has to be this way. Try to wait for the end. Sometime, a long time from now, you'll see the way you saw before.
COP=>Would you stand, you first, miss, and show me your identification, please?
COP=>You're a fed?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Keep your voice down.
COP=>I'm sorry.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Just fucking take off.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Bob? We've got to get started.
BOB ARCTOR=>I can't make love. My thing's disappeared. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>C'mon, they're expecting us. I have to sign you in.
BOB ARCTOR=>But what'll I do if my thing's disappeared? Will they still take me?
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>They'll take you.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>It's a person.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>It's easy to win. Anybody can win.
MOTORIST=>You want a ride, miss?
GEORGE=>All right, Bruce, what you'll be doing here first is the bathrooms.
GEORGE=>The floors, the basins, and especially the toilets. There are three bathrooms, one on each floor. Okay, Bruce?
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
GEORGE=>You feel you know how to clean a bathroom? Start, and I'll give you some pointers.
GEORGE=>Don't fill it all the way, Bruce, or you won't be able to lift it.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
NEW-PATH STAFFER=>So we are incorporating too much unliving drive within us. Now, activity does not necessarily mean life. Quasars are active, but not alive. A meditating monk is not dead.
MIKE=>Thanks, man.
MIKE=>Oh, c'mon, you guys left me the belt nobody else could work! You know how to do this, man?
MIKE=>Hey, thanks, buddy!
CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT=>You know what he is? A kissy-face! You're a kissy-face!
NEW-PATH RESIDENTS=>Can you fuck yourself? Can you fuck yourself?
CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT=>The kissy-facy!
CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT=>Kiss my ass, kissy-facy! He wants to kiss people, kiss this, kissy-facy!
NEW-PATH RESIDENTS=>Let's see you fuck yourself, kissy- facy!
MIKE=>Bruce?
MIKE=>Bruce, what's the matter? What brought you here? Can you tells us anything about yourself? Your past?
CHINESE GIRL RESIDENT=>Tell us, you cock-sucking fairy whore pimp! You ass-kisser, you fuck!
BOB ARCTOR=>I am an eye. I am dead. I can only look at what is front of me.
MIKE=>You like kids, Bruce?
BOB ARCTOR=>Yes.
MIKE=>You can eat with them if you like.
MIKE=>You can feed them in a month or two. After we're sure you won't hit them.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
LITTLE GIRL=>What's your name?
LITTLE GIRL=>I said, what's your name? My name is Thelma. Did you forget your name? If you forget your name, you can write it on your hand. Want me to show you how?
BOB ARCTOR=>Won't it wash off?
LITTLE GIRL=>Oh, I see. Well, you could write on the ceiling above your bed. Then when you want to know your name better, you can --
BOB ARCTOR=>Thelma.
LITTLE GIRL=>No, that's my name. And that's a girl's name anyway. If I see you again, I'll give you a name. I'll make one up for you. 'kay?
BOB ARCTOR=>Don't you live here?
LITTLE GIRL=>Yes, but my mommy may be leaving. She's thinking about taking us, me and my brother, and leaving. 'kay, Bye!
BOB ARCTOR=>Bruce.
MIKE=>Hey, Bruce!
BOB ARCTOR=>Are you leaving here?
MIKE=>No, man, I can never leave here. Too many temptations out there for the likes of us. No, I'm just going into town to pick up a donation of semi- rotten vegetables.
BOB ARCTOR=>Semi-rotten vegetables.
BOB ARCTOR=>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part...
BOB ARCTOR=>...but then shall I know even as also I am known.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>So are they paranoid about him?
MIKE=>No. He just sits there all day. There's really nothing to suspect. They can't get anything out of him during the game sessions.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Well, then, will he be able to act, when the time comes? Is anything left?
MIKE=>You never really know. A memory. A few charred brain cells flicker on. People like him are clacking insects. All reflex. We can only hope he's got the right reflex.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>It was very well drilled into him. Such a price to pay. The government asks an awful lot.
MIKE=>Life asks an awful lot.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>In this case, the fucking government. Bob didn't volunteer. He was sacrificed. He was my friend, y'know. I don't want to be on this assignment much longer. I just want it over. Shit. Sometimes I think we're colder than they are.
MIKE=>I see a warm person when I look at you, Donna.
DONNA HAWTHORNE=>Oh, I'm warm on the outside. Warm face, warm eyes, warm fucking fake smile. But inside I'm cold all the time. I am full of lies. I am awful.
OLD WOMAN=>Can you do this?
BOB ARCTOR=>I can't do that.
OLD WOMAN=>I can.
NEW-PATH STAFFER=>Donna, you need to clean yourself. You stink.
BOB ARCTOR=>Donna?!
BOB ARCTOR=>How long has Donna been here?
NEW-PATH STAFFER=>I don't know. Six months.
BOB ARCTOR=>Oh, then it's not Donna. I've been here a week. And Donna drove me here. And she was fine: sad-eyed, quiet and composed. So beautiful. Leather jacket. That purse with the rabbit's foot dangling. Just like always.
MIKE=>I think I'm going to try to get you a job on one of our farms, Bruce. When you're ready.
BOB ARCTOR=>Can I work with animals. I like animals. Can I work with them?
MIKE=>No, I want to try you with crops. I think that'd be good for you.
BOB ARCTOR=>I want to work with something living.
MIKE=>The ground is living. Do you have any agricultural background?
BOB ARCTOR=>I used to work in an office.
MIKE=>Well, you'll be outside from now on, sowing, tilling, killing insects. We do a lot of that with pesticides. But we're very careful, because those sprays can poison the crop as well as the person using them. Eat his head. The way yours has been eaten, Bruce.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
BOB ARCTOR=>Is this Jerry Fabin?! Is this Jerry Fabin?!
FARM MANAGER=>Your name is Bruce.
BOB ARCTOR=>My name is Bruce.
FARM MANAGER=>Mike Westaway recommended we give you a try on the farm. You're going to work here for a while.
BOB ARCTOR=>Okay.
FARM MANAGER=>I think you'll like it better here.
BOB ARCTOR=>I think I'll like it better here.
FARM MANAGER=>You like mountains?
BOB ARCTOR=>I like mountains.
FARM MANAGER=>Beautiful mountains all around.
FARM MANAGER=>And the air is good.
BOB ARCTOR=>I like air.
FARM MANAGER=>Yeah, Bruce, we all like air. We really all do. C'mon, I'll show you your bunk and get you a hat to protect your head from the sun.
FARM MANAGER=>This is where you sleep.
BOB ARCTOR=>Will I be seeing my friends?
FARM MANAGER=>You mean back at the rehab?
BOB ARCTOR=>Mike and Thelma and Donna and Jerry Fabin and Luckman and Barris and --
FARM MANAGER=>The farms are closed facilities, so they can't come visit. Besides you're not supposed to make any one-to-one relationships at New-Path. Didn't they teach you that?
BOB ARCTOR=>They had us memorize that as part of the New-Path creed.
FARM MANAGER=>But we usually send you back to your residence-of-origin for holidays. So you'll be visiting at Thanksgiving if you do good work.
BOB ARCTOR=>Thanksgiving.
FARM MANAGER=>All right then. What else? Bathroom there. And you can turn on and off the light with this cord.
FARM MANAGER=>Mountains, Bruce, mountains.
BOB ARCTOR=>Mountains, Bruce, mountains.
FARM MANAGER=>Echolalalia, Bruce, echolalalia.
BOB ARCTOR=>Echolalalia, Bruce, echolalalia.
BOB ARCTOR=>Why not for me?
BOB ARCTOR=>Gone. The flowers of spring are gone.
BOB ARCTOR=>I saw.
FAR-AWAY VOICE=>I saw Substance D. I saw death rising from the earth itself, in one blue field.
BOB ARCTOR=>A present for my friends. My friends who I'll see soon. At
