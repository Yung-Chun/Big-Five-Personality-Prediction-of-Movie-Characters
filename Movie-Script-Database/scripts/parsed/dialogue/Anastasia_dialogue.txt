TATIANA=>and grand parties. . .
TATIANA=>A beautiful, magical time. . .
TATIANA=>That would soon be gone forever. . .
SONYA=>Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault!
ANASTASIA=>Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . .
ANASTASIA=>. . . owwwwwwwww!
IVAR=>You're a servent! Never forget your place!
DMITIRI=>Someday my place will be out there!
IVAR=>Never! You're a peasant, Dmitri! Back in the kitchen
TATIANA=>Why were you so late tonight
ANASTASIA=>I was showing Sonya something . . .
TATIANA=>What were you showing her?
ANASTASIA=>How to read.
TATIANA=>I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
ANASTASIA=>I know, but I had to because . . .
ANASTASIA=>Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
TATIANA=>It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
ANASTASIA=>"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
TATIANA=>When you're older . . .
TATIANA=>Until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that I'm waiting for you.
NICHOLAS=>Rasputin! You're alive . . .
RASPUTIN=>Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
NICHOLAS=>I had nothing to do with it!
RASPUTIN=>You gave the orders!
NICHOLAS=>I did no such thing!
RASPUTIN=>After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
RASPUTIN=>The Romanov dynasty ends here! You, your wife and children will all die within the fortnight!
ANASTASIA=>NO!
ANASTASIA=>We're not afraid of you!
RASPUTIN=>You . . . my little babushka . . . you'll be so much fun to kill that I'll save you for last!
RASPUTIN=>THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV LINE - FOREVER !!!!
TATIANA=>Some say Rasputin ad harnessed all the dark powers of evil and that it was his curse which brought about the end . . .
TATIANA=>I will never know for sure. All I do know is that the beauty of our world was soon Gone . . . Forever . . .
ANASTASIA=>My music mox!
TATIANA=>Anastasia, no!

PHLEGMENKOF=>You ragged, skinny, little nothing! I have had just about enough of you . . .
PHLEGMENKOF=>Comrade Serebreakov!
PHLEGMENKOF=>Comrade Serebreakov! What a lovely surprise! What brings you here?
SEREBREAKOV=>I need. . . a worker.
SEREBREAKOV=>I will take her.
SEREBREAKOV=>Tomorrow you begin your life's work in my hearing factory. You'll start by cutting off the tails - but if I'm pleased with
SEREBREAKOV=>you - you just may move up to cutting off the heads. How does that sound?
ANYA=>About as bad as you smell!
PHLEGMENKOF=>No, no, Comrade - you don't want her . . .
SEREBREAKOV=>I want her.
PHLEGMENKOF=>That's horrible, skinny thing?! She's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here! She didn't even know her name! That one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . .
SEREBREAKOV=>I'll break her will. . . I shall come for you tomorrow at dawn. You will enjoy serving under me.
PHLEGMENKOF=>I couldn't break you - but he can!
GREGOR=>Anya?
GREGOR=>Are you running away?
ANYA=>No. I'm running to.
LITTLE GIRL=>Running to? Running to what?
ANYA=>To find my home.
CHUBBY GIRL=>But you are home.
ANYA=>No. This isn't a home - it's just a building. Home is where you belong and none of us belong here.
GREGOR=>Where is your home, Anya?
ANYA=>I'm not sure but look. . .
ANYA=>It says "Together in Paris". I was wearing this when I came here ten years ago - it's the only way that I know . . .
ANYA=>. . . that I must have been someone someone loved.
CHUBBY GIRL=>Is your home in Paris?
ANYA=>It might be. I have to go and find out.
ANYA=>I have to go now, before it gets light.
GREGOR=>But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
ANYA=>Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
GREGOR=>Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?!
ANYA=>Then come find me.
ANYA=>I hope there's no snow in Paris. . .
MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION.=>END MUSICAL NUMBER
ANYA=>I think you should be more careful about who you invite to dinner!
ANYA=>Could someone tell me. . .
ANYA=>Which line?
GUARD=>Very good. . .
ANYA=>Is this the right line to get papers to travel?
ANYA=>To Paris. I have to get to Paris
ANYA=>Is this where I get traveling papers?
CLERK=>It would be if we let you travel which we don't so it isn't. Russia is the people's paradise!
CLERK=>See Dmitri. He can help.
CLERK=>But you didn't hear it from me.
ANYA=>I didn't
CLERK=>No.
ANYA=>Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . .
ANYA=>Excuse me, do you know Dmitri. . .
ANYA=>I wish they'd all stop telling me they didn't tell me!
ANYA=>What are you doing. . .
TINY HUSBAND=>Could you get rid of her moustache?
ANYA=>Excuse me - I'm looking for a man named Dmitri. . .
ARTIST=>But I didn't write it.
VLADIMIR=>Dmitri! I can not work with her!
VLADIMIR=>May I remind you that you are supposed to be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout!
DMITRI=>Vladimir, calm down!
VLADIMIR=>This, my friend, as an exercise in futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!
DMITRI=>For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . . and all I need is the right girl.
DMITRI=>Next!
DMITRI=>Next!
DMITRI=>Next!
DMITRI=>I wouldn't be on the outside anymore. The ten million rubles would make me welcome anywhere. I'd really belong somewhere - if I could just find the right girl.
DMITRI=>Next!
VLADIMIR=>Stanislavski!
DMITRI=>Next!
DMITRI=>I've gotta find the right girl!
DMITRI=>Next.
VLADIMIR=>It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
DMITRI=>We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
DMITRI=>She could be right under our nose
DMITRI=>Ouch! That really hurt!
ANYA=>I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
DMITRI=>That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
ANYA=>I'm looking for Dmitri. I need traveling papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me.
VLADIMIR=>Who did you hear it from?
ANYA=>I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
VLADIMIR=>Providing travel papers is illeagal! I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
ANYA=>Well, I don't have any money . . .
VLADIMIR=>Good day!
ANYA=>I have a bike! Perhaps I could sell it and. . .
ANYA=>What are you doing here? And where's my bike?
ANYA=>Officer! My bike has been stolen!
POLICEMAN=>Nonsense. There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic.
ANYA=>Sorry, boy, I have to go.
ANYA=>No. You can't come with me. I'm leaving. . .
ANYA=>It sounds like you're saying "me too". Listen little guy, I have money, no food. . . and no bicycle. I'm the last person you should be following!
VLADIMIR=>. . . even if we find her, what makes you think the Empress will even see us?
DMITRI=>She'll see us.
BARTOK=>You, uhh. . . hang here often? "Hang" get it? I said "hang" and we're both, you know, cause we're bats. . . and, uhhh. . . what's your sign?
DMITRI=>What was that?
VLADIMIR=>That was your dinner! I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
BARTOK=>Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat. Get it? A "bug" to eat, 'cause we're. . .

DMITRI=>Who are you?!
VLADIMIR=>You're trespassing, boy!
ANYA=>I. . . I. . . spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .
DMITRI=>It's her.
VLADIMIR=>He's her?
DMITRI=>Look!
ANYA=>Are you Dmitri? I didn't mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . .
VLADIMIR=>Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .
DMITRI=>She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
VLADIMIR=>Ew. . . the honest type.
DMITRI=>You look like her. Like the Princess Anastasia. Has anyone ever told you that before?
ANYA=>Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop that!
DMITRI=>People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too
DMITRI=>What happened to your parents?
ANYA=>I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
DMITRI=>You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
ANYA=>I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
DMITRI=>Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
VLADIMIR=>How much do you weigh?
VLADIMIR=>I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
ANYA=>Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
DMITRI=>Why do you want to go to Paris?
ANYA=>I have my reasons.
DMITRI=>Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris. We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.
DMITRI=>And I think you are the Princess Anastasia.
DMITRI=>You never thought of the possibility?
ANYA=>Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!
DMITRI=>NO! YOU LOOK AT HER! LOOK AT
HER!=>It could be you.
DMITRI=>You don't have anything to lose. If I am wrong - the Empress will simply tell us you aren't Anastasia and we'll be on our way. No harm done - an honest mistake - but at least you will be in Paris.
ANYA=>THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER. . .
DMITRI=>Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
ANYA=>All right. I will go with you.
DMITRI=>The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
BARTOK=>Oy. . . he's gonna be so mad. . .
ANYA=>THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER ...
DMITRI=>Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
ANYA=>All right. I will go with you.
DMITRI=>The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
BARTOK=>Oy. . . he's gonna be so mad...
BARTOK=>Ummm ... Father Gregori? It's, uhh ... me. Bartok. Phew! Not home ...
RASPUTIN=>What?
BARTOK=>Oh my God! Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
RASPUTIN=>And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
BARTOK=>Name calling! That's mature.
RASPUTIN=>I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
BARTOK=>No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached. Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
RASPUTIN=>Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
BARTOK=>Yeah, right. Keep that thought okay? So, I'm in town, stop by the old palace. You get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything.
BARTOK=>So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague. Someone's gotta clean that up...
RASPUTIN=>Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
BARTOK=>Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
RASPUTIN=>Impossible. That rumor's been around for years.
BARTOK=>Trust me, it's her!
RASPUTIN=>How do you know?
BARTOK=>Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
RASPUTIN=>Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I need your help.
BARTOK=>Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
RASPUTIN=>I cursed then all!
BARTOK=>My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
RASPUTIN=>The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!
BARTOK=>You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . .
RASPUTIN=>YOU IDIOT
RASPUTIN=>Yesses - you'd all like to get out, wouldn' t you? Sorry just one at a time and only when I call.
RASPUTIN=>Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
BARTOK=>You'd lose your security deposit?
RASPUTIN=>Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
RASPUTIN=>YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND IF THAT HAPPENS!
RASPUTIN=>Where is she? Where is Princess Anastasia...
RASPUTIN=>She has friends. No matter...
BARTOK=>Ohhh, that was dumb...
BARTOK=>Hello, I've get really terrible claustrophobia. That's why I could never live in a cave ...
RASPUTIN=>Finish my prophecy...
BARTOK=>Ew, I hate when he does this!
RASPUTIN=>She is not to get off that train... alive!
RASPUTIN=>Go! I don't care what you do with the others but finish the girl! KILLLLL HERRRRR! And have fun...
TATIANA=>Take her away, Sophie.
TATIANA=>Haven't anything better to do than to break my heart.
TATIANA=>No more. So more...
SOPHIE=>Oh, oh... I must say. I thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, I mean she was human, of course. but not our real. I must say, even my sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were...
SOPHIE=>... moved to tears of joy! We won't be f ooled next time, girls! I'm a going to think of really hard questions...
TATIANA=>No, Sophie. My heart can't take it anymore! I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.
DMITRI=>Hurry up with those papers.
VLADIMIR=>Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
VLADIMIR=>You probably would. They're still wet.
VLADIMIR=>Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
DMITRI=>"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
VLADIMIR=>What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
DMITRI=>Wake up!
VLADIMER=>We have a lot of work to do...
DMITRI=>Come on!
DMITRI=>Take my hand!
DMITRI=>Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
ANYA=>Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
DMITRI=>I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
ANYA=>By pulling my hair?!
DMITRI=>I was all out of dynamite!
ANYA=>Put it on your nose. For heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!
ANYA=>Men are such babies...
ANYA=>Here, let me
DMITRI=>You're a princess...
VLADIMIR=>Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
VLADIMIR=>Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
DMITRI=>Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
GUARD=>Papers!
VLADIMIR=>It's what I hate about this government - everything in red!
GUARD=>Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.
ZHIVAGO=>Doctor Zhivago.
VLADIMIR=>What do we do now?
DMITRI=>Pray he's color-blind...
GUARD=>wait here.
ANYA=>I'm going to stretch my legs
DMITRI=>That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way.
ANYA=>I must have hit him harder than I thought...
GUARD=>That's them! Come on!
DMITRI=>Wait here!
ANYA=>Would you like to tell what we are...
DMITRI=>Come on up!
ANYA=>Why?
ANYA=>Just what do you think you're doing?!
DMITRI=>Trying... to... breathe...
DMITRI=>The guards! I'll explain later.
ANYA=>Forged papers! Now, what?!
DMITRI=>Now just get off the train.
ANYA=>HUH?!
ANYA=>Noooo....
VLADIMIR=>She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
DMITRI=>Come on, we'll jump together... Take my hand.
DMITRI=>Come on!
ANYA=>No!
VLADIMIR=>I think I have hurt my...
DMITRI=>You must enjoy causing me pain!
ANYA=>You shouldn't have pushed us!
VLADIMIR=>Is everyone all right?
ANYA=>I'm fine.
DMITRI=>She's fine! I may never walk right again, but she's fine...
BARTOK=>Well, I better got goin'. Got a busy day letting all the blood rush to my head...
RASPUTIN=>She's too far away, isn't she?
RASPUTIN=>Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
BARTOK=>Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
BARTOK=>You're absolutely right. Travel broadens your horizons...
RASPUTIN=>We'll catch her and finish her! We ride this night!
BARTOK=>Well, we wait this night!
VLADIMIR=>No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come along, Meetoo!
VLADIMIR=>We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
ANYA=>Who's Sophie?
VLADIMIR=>Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
ANYA=>What?!
ANYA=>You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
DMITRI=>You are the Princess.
VLADIMIR=>We're just going to refresh your memory...
ANYA=>I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
ANYA=>... good enough... I can't go through with this!
DMITRI=>What do you see?
DMITRI=>See? The Princess is under there ...
VLADIMIR=>Ah! Let us begin!
VLADIMIR=>You were born on the Adriatic sea at the summer palace, where the parties and the buffets were marvelous ....
ANYA=>...and on my father's side, there was [THIS SECTION IS NOT LEDGABLE]
DMITRI=>Every Russian family has one..
ANYA=>Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
VLADIMIR=>Did I tell you that?
ANYA=>You must have.
ANYA=>...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
DMITRI=>It's the best fork of all
ANYA=>The dessert fork!
VLADIMIR=>Ah, yes ... I have always loved that fork...
ANYA=>What a beautiful ship!
DMITRI=>It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
VLADIMIR=>Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of elaborate elegance in entertaining... A party boat. It once belonged to ...
ANYA=>Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
ELDERLY DOWAGER=>No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been!
VLADIMIR=>Come out! I can do alterations.
ANYA=>You'll laugh.
VLADIMIR=>I shant!
ANYA=>Not you. Him.
DMITRI=>I won't laugh - I swear...
ANYA=>You said you wouldn't laugh!
DMITRI=>It's not you - it's the dress!
ANYA=>I'm never going to be..
ANYA=>Well! Maybe I am...
VLADIMIR=>You are a natural! I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class orphanage ...
DMITRI=>I wanted to show you something.
ANYA=>It's so beautiful ... and sad.
DMITRI=>Sad?
ANYA=>Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
DMITRI=>Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
ANYA=>I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
DMITRI=>Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
ANYA=>I'm sorry.
DMITRI=>Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
RASPUTIN=>She's out there ...
BARTOK=>I'm getting a chest cold..
RASPUTIN=>Bartok... a question.
BARTOK=>I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
RASPUTIN=>What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
BARTOK=>My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way...
BARTOK=>... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ... Ewwww, what a mess ...
RASPUTTN=>Show her to me ...
BARTOK=>And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either.
DMITRI=>If you have to go - wake her..
DMITRI=>What were you doing?!
DMITRI=>It's okay now - I've got you. You're safe...
BARTOK=>Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
RASPUTIN=>She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
BARTOK=>Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ...
RASPUTIN=>You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close...
RASPUTIN=>Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
BARTOK=>Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
RASPUTIN=>We are going to Paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man. He annoys me.
ANYA=>Oh! I'm sorry...
DMITRI=>It's okay. Didn't hurt..
ANYA=>I'm almost there... I'm finally going to know...
DMITRI=>How is our current financial status?
VLADIMIR=>If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
VLADIMIR=>The "Odessa Dunk"?
DMITRI=>It worked in Odessa...
ELDERLY DOWAGER=>Help! My little dogs! Chevalier! Maurice! Hold on, darlings!
DMITRI=>I'll save them, Madame
VLADIMIR=>Such bravery! Why, that man should be rewarded! Amply rewarded!
ANYA=>That was really very kind of you.
VLADIMIR=>I won't say a word...
DMITRI=>Nervous?
ANYA=>Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
DMITRI=>You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
VLADIMIR=>May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
SOPHIE=>Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
SOPHIE=>I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear...
ANYA=>Of course.
SOPHIE=>Where were you born?
DMITRI=>The real Anastasia couldn't have grown up to be lovelier.
SOPHIE=>This is the hard one ... what rare treat was served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty? The last ball they ever had?
ANYA=>Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. Oranges and pineapples from the far east. I remember ... I remember I threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...
SOPHIE=>Yes ... yes, it was fresh fruit. Well, maybe not "fresh" Estelle got one rather brown banana but ...
VLADIMIR=>Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
SOPHIE=>Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
VLADIMIR=>Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
SOPHIE=>Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
VLADIMIR=>Perhaps you could convince her?
SOPHIE=>Oh, heavens, no... but ... She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
SOPHIE=>Come my dear, we've much to talk about.
VLADIMIR=>We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
DMITRI=>But it's not the money, Vlad.
VLADIMIR=>Are you feeling all right?
ANYA=>But you never doubted who I was, did you, Dmitri? Not for a second ...
VLADIMIR=>Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
DMITRI=>What do you mean?
VLADIMIR=>Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
ACCORDION PLAYER=>Lovers!
FLOWER SELLER=>Ooh la la!
