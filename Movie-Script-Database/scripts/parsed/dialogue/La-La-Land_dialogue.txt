MIA=>...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity.
MIA=>Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
MIA=>Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --
WOMAN=>Cappuccino, please.
MANAGER=>On us.
WOMAN=>No, I insist.
MIA=>Shit.
MANAGER=>Where do you think you're going?
MIA=>It's -- five past...
MANAGER=>You'd better be here early tomorrow.
MIA=>Ok.
MIA=>And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... Revision 4.
MIA=>No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you waiting `til Denver to tell her...? Oh. I see... No, you're right. I understand. Ok... I just... Oh...
MIA=>No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --
CASTING DIRECTOR=>One second.
CASTING DIRECTOR=>...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost done in here.
CASTING DIRECTOR=>You know what? I think we're good. Thanks for coming in.
TRACY=>Holy Mother of God.
TRACY=>Ever heard of a vent?
MIA=>I wanted to give you an entrance.
ALEXIS=>Mia! How'd it go?
MIA=>Eh...
ALEXIS=>Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?
MIA=>I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
ALEXIS=>They're the worst.
MIA=>I don't know if they were there.
ALEXIS=>I bet they were. Revision 6.
CAITLIN=>Why is there a convention in the bathroom?
TRACY=>Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right?
MIA=>Can't. Working.
TRACY=>What? Did she say "working"?
MIA=>Yes?
TRACY=>Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming.
TRACY=>It'll be fun.
MIA=>It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.
TRACY=>Exactly. Fun.
TRACY MIA=>This looks familiar. I was going to give it back!
ALEXIS=>Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood clichÃ© crammed into a single home?
TRACY=>Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest.
MIA=>No...
MIA=>No...
SEBASTIAN=>You gotta stop breaking into my home.
LAURA=>You think Mom or Dad would call this a home?
SEBASTIAN=>Please don't sit on that.
LAURA=>Are you serious?
SEBASTIAN=>Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.
LAURA=>I wonder why. I brought you this. It's a throw rug.
SEBASTIAN=>Don't need it.
LAURA=>Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?
SEBASTIAN=>That's almost insulting... Did he? Revision 11.
LAURA=>When are you going to unpack these boxes?
SEBASTIAN=>When I unpack them in my club.
LAURA=>Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her. You're not still going by there, are you?
SEBASTIAN=>No.
SEBASTIAN=>They've turned it into a tapas-samba place. You believe that?
LAURA=>Seb --
SEBASTIAN=>Who wants to tapas while they samba?
LAURA=>I have someone I want you to meet.
SEBASTIAN=>I don't want to meet anyone.
LAURA=>You'll like her.
SEBASTIAN=>Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?
LAURA=>Probably not.
SEBASTIAN=>Then what are we gonna talk about?
LAURA=>You'll talk about the weather.
SEBASTIAN=>Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold. Revision 12.
LAURA=>Sebastian --
SEBASTIAN=>How long's it been?
LAURA=>You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance.
SEBASTIAN=>I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.
LAURA=>You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off.
SEBASTIAN=>What's the difference?
LAURA=>It's not as romantic as that. And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you.
SEBASTIAN=>Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?
LAURA=>Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.
SEBASTIAN=>You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.
LAURA=>I love you. Unpack your boxes.
SEBASTIAN=>I'm changing the locks. Revision 13.
LAURA=>You can't afford it.
SEBASTIAN=>I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!
BOSS=>Seb.
SEBASTIAN=>Bill. Thanks for having me back.
BOSS=>Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision 14.
SEBASTIAN=>Of course. Though I don't think they care what I play.
BOSS=>I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz.
SEBASTIAN=>How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal.
WAITRESS=>Well... Welcome back.
SEBASTIAN=>There's a nice way to say that.
BOSS=>...every goddamned night.
SEBASTIAN=>I'll stick to the set list, I promise --
BOSS=>Too late. You're done.
SEBASTIAN=>You're not gonna find a better player. You know that.
BOSS=>Do you think anyone here gives a shit?
MIA=>I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --
MIA=>I don't like the fissure on the GT scan. Did you test for achromatopsia?
MIA=>D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.
MIA=>This is my classroom. You don't like it, the door's to my left.
READER=>Lady why you be trippin' like that?
MIA=>No, Jamal. You be trippin'.
TRACY=>There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.
CARLO TRACY=>Nice to meet you, Mia. He's got projects all over town.
CARLO=>They say I have a knack for world-building.
MIA=>Congratulations. I have to grab a drink... Revision 17.
SINGER=>Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests?
MIA=>"I Ran".
SINGER=>"I Ran" it is. Wanna start us off, piano-man?
SINGER=>I walked along the avenue...
SEBASTIAN=>Ok. I remember you.
SEBASTIAN=>And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.
MIA=>"Curt"?
SEBASTIAN=>Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision 18.
MIA=>Ok.
SEBASTIAN=>But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far.
MIA=>My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"?
SEBASTIAN=>I don't think so.
MIA=>Can I borrow what you're wearing?
SEBASTIAN=>Why?
MIA=>Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.
SEBASTIAN=>So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?
MIA=>Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.
SEBASTIAN=>Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there.
SINGER=>Sebastian. Second set.
SEBASTIAN=>He doesn't tell me what to do.
MIA=>He just told you what to do.
SEBASTIAN=>I let him. Revision 19.
SEBASTIAN=>What's your name?
MIA=>Mia.
SEBASTIAN=>Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.
SINGER=>Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight...
CARLO=>...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it.
CARLO=>...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.
MIA=>George Michael!
SEBASTIAN=>You again.
MIA=>Did you just get your keys?
SEBASTIAN=>...Yeah. Revision 20.
MIA=>Can you grab mine?
SEBASTIAN=>...Which one is it?
MIA=>The Prius.
MIA=>The one with the green ribbon.
MIA=>Shit...
SEBASTIAN=>Those look comfortable.
MIA=>They are...n't.
MIA=>Thank you for saving the day back there.
SEBASTIAN=>You didn't give me much of a choice.
MIA=>Strange that we keep running into each other.
SEBASTIAN=>It is strange. Maybe it means something.
MIA=>I doubt it.
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah I don't think so either. Revision 21.
SEBASTIAN=>Put the clicker under your chin.
MIA=>What?
SEBASTIAN=>It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.
MIA=>Uh-huh.
SEBASTIAN=>You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.
MIA=>Oh my God.
MIA=>Eh.
SEBASTIAN=>Not much to look at.
MIA=>Agreed. I've seen better.
MIA=>Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...
MIA=>Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car?
SEBASTIAN=>No, that's fine... Thanks...
MIA=>...Ok...
MIA=>Night.
CUSTOMER=>Are these pastries gluten-free?
MIA=>No...
CUSTOMER=>What?? I want a refund.
MANAGER=>You're closing up Friday.
MIA=>I have an audition. Remember?
MANAGER=>Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.
MIA=>But you said --
MANAGER=>And fix your apron.
MIA=>...Hi. What are you doing here?
SEBASTIAN=>Meetings. Studio heads. Revision 24.
MIA=>Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?
SEBASTIAN=>Piece of cake.
SEBASTIAN=>Actually it took me four hours and I ended up running. We probably have twenty minutes before the guy finds me. You got a break coming up?
MIA=>I'm off in ten.
SEBASTIAN=>Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.
MIA=>That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.
SEBASTIAN=>What's your Bogart's name...? Is it Greg?
MIA=>Yeah. Greg.
SEBASTIAN=>How long have...?
MIA=>We've been seeing each other for a few months.
MIA=>I love this stuff. Makes coming to work easier.
SEBASTIAN=>I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.
MIA=>Oh yeah?
SEBASTIAN=>It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. It's a samba-tapas place now.
MIA=>A what?
SEBASTIAN=>Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history.
SEBASTIAN=>Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing.
P.A.=>Clear the frame!
MIA=>We need to wait here.
SEBASTIAN=>I know. They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out."
A.D.=>Quiet on set!
SEBASTIAN=>How'd you get into all this? Revision 26.
MIA=>Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. I never knew the world was so big.
DIRECTOR=>Cut!
MIA=>I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year.
SEBASTIAN=>Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?
MIA=>God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.
MIA=>Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things.
MIA=>I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. Should've been a lawyer. Revision 27.
SEBASTIAN=>...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.
MIA=>Well it doesn't need more actresses.
SEBASTIAN=>You're not just an actress.
MIA=>What do you mean, "just an actress"?
SEBASTIAN=>You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright.
MIA=>That is not what I said.
SEBASTIAN=>You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.
MIA=>Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.
SEBASTIAN=>All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.
MIA=>Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead.
MIA=>Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you...
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah? Revision 28.
MIA=>I hate jazz.
SEBASTIAN=>What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?
MIA=>It means when I listen to it I don't like it.
SEBASTIAN=>But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying "I hate animals".
MIA=>I do hate some animals.
SEBASTIAN=>Do you need to be anywhere right now?
SEBASTIAN=>Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other.
MIA=>I thought it was just Kenny G.
SEBASTIAN=>...What?
MIA=>I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.
SEBASTIAN=>It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision 29.
MIA=>Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.
SEBASTIAN=>Mia. These are things you can't unsay.
SEBASTIAN=>It's not cocktail music -- it's a high- wire act. These guys are performing and composing and rearranging all at once.
SEBASTIAN=>That's why you need to be in the space and see what's at stake. This whole thing -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll head off to cut commercial sessions or do pit at the Pantages `cause they have to -- but when I have my own place -- my club -- they'll play whatever they want.
MIA=>Your club?
SEBASTIAN=>...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.
SEBASTIAN=>The world tells everyone to move on. Says the music's had its moment. But I love it too much. I'm not moving on.
SEBASTIAN=>So?
MIA=>Hi, I just missed a call...
MIA=>I got a call-back!
SEBASTIAN=>Really? For what?
MIA=>That show I told you about.
SEBASTIAN=>Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
MIA=>Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.
SEBASTIAN=>That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"
SEBASTIAN=>You've seen it, right?
MIA=>Obviously. No.
SEBASTIAN=>What? You're the movie person.
MIA=>It's the one I lie about.
SEBASTIAN=>Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.
MIA=>...Ok. Revision 31.
SEBASTIAN=>10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?
MIA=>Ok. For research.
MIA=>Hi, Mom!
MIA'S MOM=>Hi, sweetie. How are you?
MIA=>Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.
MIA'S MOM=>Oh my God! You're going to be on TV??
MIA=>Well -- it's not picked up yet.
MIA'S MOM=>Not picked up?
MIA=>First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision 32.
MIA'S MOM=>And you're in the pilot?
MIA=>Well, no, I have a call-back.
MIA'S MOM=>I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week?
MIA=>It's another audition.
MIA'S MOM=>I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV...
MIA=>...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.
MIA'S MOM=>No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO?
MIA=>Oxygen.
MIA'S MOM=>Oxygen?
MIA=>You know what, I have to go. I love you.
DIRECTOR=>...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision 33.
ASSISTANT=>Mia Dolan?
DIRECTOR=>Whenever you're ready.
MIA=>Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --
DIRECTOR=>Thanks.
MIA=>I can do it another way --
DIRECTOR=>No, thanks, that was great.
MIA'S MOM=>Dad just helped me find Oxygen on the guide! So exciting! So will you be getting health insurance now?
ALEXIS=>Mia?
ALEXIS=>Greg's here...
GREG=>Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed.
GREG=>Did you forget?
MIA=>Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...
GREG=>It's ok.
GREG=>Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will be there in twenty.
JOSH=>That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like --
FIANCEE=>It's like being in a movie theater.
JOSH=>It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days --
GREG=>Oh, sure --
JOSH=>-- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just -- -- just so annoying, I mean you're trying to watch a movie -- one second -- Hello?...
FIANCEE=>Probably work.
JOSH=>Yeah, I'll have to call you back. So, yeah, we love it.
JOSH=>One word for you. Nicaragua.
GREG=>I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision 36.
JOSH=>Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable.
GREG=>Mia?
MIA=>I'm sorry.
MIA=>I have an idea.
TRACY=>What's that?
TRACY=>Is that a script?
MIA=>It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.
ALEXIS=>A play? You better give us roles!
MIA=>Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show...
TRACY=>...Is that gonna happen every time?
MIA=>I think so.
MIA=>It's one-way!!
KEITH=>Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN=>Keith? Revision 41.
KEITH=>Holy shit. Come here, man.
SEBASTIAN=>This is Mia. Mia, Keith. We used to play together.
KEITH MIA=>Hey, Mia. Hey...
KEITH=>So how've you been?
SEBASTIAN=>Great. You?
KEITH=>Keeping busy. Got a new combo.
SEBASTIAN=>Good for you.
KEITH=>...Looking for keys.
SEBASTIAN=>I'm good.
KEITH=>You sure? It pays.
SEBASTIAN=>I'm good.
KEITH=>Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long.
SEBASTIAN=>You bet.
KEITH=>Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision 42.
MIA=>Nice meeting you.
SEBASTIAN=>It's beautiful.
MIA=>...You're just saying that.
SEBASTIAN=>No... I'm not.
MIA=>I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?
SEBASTIAN=>That's the point.
MIA=>But do you think people will like it?
SEBASTIAN=>Fuck `em.
MIA=>You always say that.
SEBASTIAN=>I truly believe it.
MIA=>Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.
SEBASTIAN=>I'll be front-row.
MIA=>I made something for you.
SEBASTIAN=>What's that?
MIA=>It could be the name design. On the door.
SEBASTIAN=>Why does it say "Seb's"?
MIA=>That's what you should name it.
SEBASTIAN=>Never.
MIA=>Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick".
SEBASTIAN=>You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".
MIA=>No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. And it's time to start looking for other places.
SEBASTIAN=>It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.
MIA=>Make your own history.
SEBASTIAN=>Your play's incredible.
SEBASTIAN=>The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision 44.
MIA=>I'm doing that.
MIA=>So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?
SEBASTIAN=>...Which guy?
MIA=>The one who offered you a gig.
SEBASTIAN=>You mean Keith? He's the worst.
MIA=>Why was it weird between you two?
SEBASTIAN=>It's always weird with him.
MIA=>He did offer you a job.
SEBASTIAN=>Right...
MIA=>Are you going to call him?
SEBASTIAN=>No.
MIA=>Ok...
SEBASTIAN=>Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- -- and your play is going to be a triumph.
MIA=>...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately...
MIA=>Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad?
KEITH=>Sebastian.
KEITH=>Didn't know if I'd see you today.
SEBASTIAN=>Well... Here I am.
SEBASTIAN=>Where's the piano?
KEITH=>Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?
KEITH=>Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah, that...that... ...sounds good.
KEITH=>Let's play, see how it feels.
KEITH=>I know. It's different.
KEITH=>But you say you want to save jazz. How are you going to save jazz if no one's listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people hadn't gotten tired of what they were listening to before. I mean, do you really think a bunch of ninety-year-olds in a basement is the future of the form? Traditionalists whined when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs. If traditionalists had their way, we'd still be playing Dixieland.
SEBASTIAN=>You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future.
KEITH=>I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man.
KEITH=>If it's not your thing, just let me know. I don't want you uncomfortable and trying to change this into something it's not. But if you want it -- the job's yours.
SEBASTIAN MIA=>City of stars... You've never shined so brightly. Revision 50.
SOLO...=>Revision 51.
LAURA=>Look at him -- watch --
LAURA=>Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed.
HARRY=>Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything?
MIA=>Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision 52.
LAURA=>Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car.
LAURA=>Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?
MIA=>I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...
LAURA=>You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. What's the matter?
MIA=>Nothing...
LAURA=>You miss him.
MIA=>I guess. I'm adapting.
LAURA=>I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other.
MIA=>He told me.
LAURA=>I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... You've changed Seb. You know that?
MIA=>Do you think he's happy?
LAURA=>Is he happy?
MIA=>I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision 53.
LAURA=>Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.
LAURA=>Dreams change.
LAURA=>Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.
LAURA=>I told you not to get me anything!
HARRY=>Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.
LAURA=>No -- I changed my mind.
MIA=>Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... Ok... Bye...
SEBASTIAN=>Surprise.
SEBASTIAN=>And... There's twenty-five pounds of apples in it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem but it tastes good.
SEBASTIAN=>I have to head back in the morning but I needed to see you.
SEBASTIAN=>Feels so good to be home.
MIA=>Stay.
SEBASTIAN=>How's the play going?
MIA=>I'm nervous. Revision 55.
SEBASTIAN=>Why?
MIA=>Because... What if people show up?
SEBASTIAN=>Fuck `em!
SEBASTIAN=>You're nervous about what they think?
MIA=>I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified.
SEBASTIAN=>They should be so lucky to see it. It's going to be incredible. I can't wait.
MIA=>I can.
MIA=>What time do you leave in the morning?
MIA=>Ugh.
SEBASTIAN=>Yep. Boise.
MIA=>Boise?
SEBASTIAN=>You should come.
MIA=>To Boise? Revision 56.
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list.
MIA=>Wish I could.
SEBASTIAN=>Why can't you?
MIA=>Come to Boise?
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah.
MIA=>Because I have to rehearse.
SEBASTIAN=>Can't you rehearse anywhere?
MIA=>You mean anywhere you are?
SEBASTIAN=>...I -- I guess...
MIA=>Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical...
SEBASTIAN=>Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.
MIA=>I know, but when are you done?
SEBASTIAN=>...What do you mean?
MIA=>When are you done with the tour? Revision 57.
SEBASTIAN=>But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.
SEBASTIAN=>We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record.
MIA=>So it's...the long haul?
SEBASTIAN=>...What does that mean?
MIA=>I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time.
SEBASTIAN=>What did you think I was going to do?
MIA=>I don't know, I didn't think the band would --
SEBASTIAN=>You didn't think we'd be successful.
MIA=>No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.
MIA=>Do you like the music you're playing?
SEBASTIAN=>I don't know how that matters.
MIA=>It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision 58.
SEBASTIAN=>Do you like the music I'm playing?
MIA=>Yes. I do. I just didn't think you did.
SEBASTIAN=>Yeah, well, I --
MIA=>And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm --
SEBASTIAN=>What are you doing? Why are you doing this?
MIA=>What do you mean why am I doing this?
SEBASTIAN=>This is what you wanted from me.
MIA=>To be in this band?
SEBASTIAN=>To have a steady job.
MIA=>Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club.
SEBASTIAN=>So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating?
MIA=>Why aren't you starting your club?
SEBASTIAN=>You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick --
MIA=>Change the name!
SEBASTIAN=>-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you. Revision 59.
MIA=>I do like jazz now, because of you.
SEBASTIAN=>What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?
MIA=>People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.
SEBASTIAN=>Not in my experience.
SEBASTIAN=>Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know? This is what I'm doing. If you had a problem, I wish you would've said something earlier, before I signed on the dotted line.
MIA=>You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --
SEBASTIAN=>This is the dream!
MIA=>This is not your dream.
SEBASTIAN=>Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?
MIA=>Why do you care so much about being liked
SEBASTIAN=>You're an actress, who are you to talk??
SEBASTIAN=>Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself.
MIA=>Are you kidding?
SEBASTIAN=>No.
SEBASTIAN=>Wait --

SEBASTIAN=>Why won't you come?

MIA=>Because it's another audition! I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- -- because --
SEBASTIAN=>Because what?
MIA=>Because I'm probably not good enough.
SEBASTIAN=>Yes you are.
MIA=>No. Maybe I'm not.

MIA=>I can go back to school. I can find something else that I'm supposed to do. I left school to give it a shot, and it didn't work out, and it took six years, and I don't want to do it anymore.
SEBASTIAN=>Why?
MIA=>Why what?
SEBASTIAN=>Why don't you want to do it anymore?
MIA=>...Because it hurts a little bit too much.
