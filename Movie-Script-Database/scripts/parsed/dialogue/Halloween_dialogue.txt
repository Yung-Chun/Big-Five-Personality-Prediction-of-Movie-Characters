DANA=>Check, check.
AARON=>Testing, testing. One, two, three.
DR. SARTAIN=>Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.
DANA=>Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. We were hoping to have this chance before he is transferred to the new facility. Glass Hill is far less accommodating.
DR. SARTAIN=>Glass Hill is the pit of hell. Underfunded and short staffed. For years he has been kept here to be studied. I suppose the state has lost interest in discovering anything further.
AARON=>Well... That's why we're here.
DANA=>Do you mind if I record this?
DR. SARTAIN=>Why not?
DANA=>How long have you been working with him?
DR. SARTAIN=>I've examined every case file written on him. I was a scholar of Dr. Loomis before he passed away. Then I lobbied the University of Illinois to be assign to Michael myself.
DANA=>Any progress?
DR. SARTAIN=>He has been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists. And with each, many different opinions. Loomis reasoned that he was nothing more than pure evil.
DANA=>Any you agree with this diagnosis?
DR. SARTAIN=>Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my care, we implemented a holistic form of therapy. Since that time, his tendency for violence has essentially been erased.
AARON=>His response to your specific treatment has been effective?
DR. SARTAIN=>We left two kitty cats in his cell overnight and both remained unharmed. I hate to disappoint you.
AARON=>So you're telling us that there is no similarity between the murderous maniac that made newspaper headlines in 1978 and the amenable patient of this institution?
DR. SARTAIN=>Michael Myers is an evolving, aging creature like we all are. And although we have worked very closely with him, these halls display the limitations of my analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a beast in the wild. He witnessed human behavior at its most primal, while the rest of us only have the opportunity of observation in captivity.
DR. SARTAIN=>Our patients get fresh air and sunshine, a view, proper exercise, a healthy diet. It pains me to see him transferred to a less than desirable' facility. There he is. He can speak. He just chooses not to.
AARON=>I'd love to stand near him and get a sense of his awareness... Or lack of awareness.
DR. SARTAIN=>Make no mistake. He is aware. He was watching you as you arrived. When he's not out here in the courtyard, he walks from this window to that window, to the other. Observing things.
DR. SARTAIN=>And perhaps you'd like to tie your left shoelace. Mr Tovoli, the gentleman with the umbrella, has a fixation for such things. Underestimate no one.
DR. SARTAIN=>Step up to the yellow line. No further. Do not pass the line under any circumstance.
DR. SARTAIN=>Michael. I have some people who would like to meet you.
AARON=>Michael. My name be Aaron. I've followed your case for years, and I still know very little about you. I want to know more about that night. About those involved.
AARON=>Do you think of them? Feel guilt about their fate?
AARON=>Do you remember Laurie Strode?
AARON=>Does she remind you of your sister, Michael? Is that why you chose her?
AARON=>I borrowed something from a friend at the Attorney General's office. Something I'd like you to see.
AARON=>You recognize this, don't you, Michael? How does it make you feel? Say something.
AARON=>Say SOMETHING!
RAY=>You see this? I switched from marshmallow fluff to peanut butter. We'll see if the little devil snatches it.
SHANAH=>I rescheduled my last session, so I'll be able to make it tonight.
ALLYSON=>You didn't have to do that. It's not that big of a deal.
RAY=>Of course it is. You got into National Honor Society. It's a very big deal. I was top of my shop class, made ashtrays and birdhouses.
SHANAH=>And I'm looking forward to meeting Cameron.
RAY=>I know his father Lonnie and his uncle James. The entire Elam family has a... reputation.
SHANAH=>Ray, c'mon.
RAY=>What?! You know about his situation, right? It's a relevant factor. The whole household is--
RAY=>Goddamn it!
ALLYSON=>That's not fair, dad. Cameron isn't like that. He's a nice guy
RAY=>I'm not saying he's not nice. It's just- You're too smart to go out with troublemakers and dip shits.
ALLYSON=>You're right. Did you guys invite Grandmother like you said you would?
SHANAH=>I did. Talked to her yesterday. She's not going to be able to make it.
ALLYSON=>Really?
SHANAH=>She's agoraphobic. In serious need of cognitive... Um... behavioral-
ALLYSON=>Vicky's here. I gotta go.
ALLYSON=>My mom is a liar. She told me she invited my Grandmother tonight but she didn't.
VICKY=>How do you know?
ALLYSON=>She never even called her.
DAVE=>That's bullshit.
VICKY=>What's your mom's deal? Why would she say that?
ALLYSON=>She just tries to keep me away from her. Says she turns into a nutcase this time of year.
VICKY=>Your grandmother is Laurie Strode. If I were her I wouldn't celebrate either. I'd put up a Christmas tree instead. Just skip over all the spooky Halloween shit, right?
DAVE=>Jumping to Thanksgiving would make sense. Puritans, cornucopias, plagues, starvations, slaughtering the Indians. That stuff isn't creepy at all.
VICKY=>Does she ever talk around it?
ALLYSON=>Pretty much all she talks about. It defines her life. She's been in shock ever since. You should see her house.
VICKY=>Freaky.
DAVE=>Wasn't it her brother that killed those baby-sitters?
ALLYSON=>No. I think people made up the bit about them being related because it made them feel better. Like it couldn't happen to anyone.
VICKY=>To have a bunch of your friends get slaughtered by some random crazy person... how awful.
DAVE=>Is it though? I just feel like the universe has way worse shit now. One dude just kills a few people, I don't know.
VICKY=>Her grandmother is a bad ass and was almost fucking murdered, Dave!
DAVE=>And she escaped! And he was caught! He's like super incarcerated right now. It's not like the worst thing that has happened to a person. By today's standards.
VICKY=>Shut up, Dave. Stop talking.
DAVE=>I'm sorry. I sensed myself going on a rant and didn't know how to eject. Sorry.
DAVE=>Cool if I explode this pumpkinhead?
VICKY=>Yes, please.
ALLYSON=>Go for it.
DAVE=>Wooooo! happy Halloween!
DANA=>What is it we're after?
AARON=>To see the animal inside its environment. I fear there has been no rehabilitation. In this case it seems one monster created another. A victim locks herself away. Imprisoned by her own fear. Our goal is to get them in a room together. Can we find a form of rehabilitation if she faces him again?
DANA=>Here we are.
DANA=>You might want this.
AARON=>Journalists don't pay for interviews, Dana. This is her fifteen minutes of fame. There are two people in this world that care about her and they're both in this car.
DANA=>She's financially unstable. Had every job you can think of for the last forty years from catering to cosmetology. Currently unemployed.
LAURIE=>Can I help you?
AARON=>Yes. We're looking for Laurie Strode.
LAURIE=>Who?
AARON=>My name is Aaron Joseph Korey and- Um... We're working on a um... on a podcast.
LAURIE=>Good for you.
DANA=>We're investigative journalists.
AARON=>If you have a moment. We've travelled a long way to speak with you.
AARON=>We'll pay you for your time.
DANA=>How does three thousand dollars sound?
DANA=>You've lived here since 1985.
LAURIE=>Sounds about right.
DANA=>Do you feel isolated?
LAURIE=>I don't.
AARON=>You tell yourself that you're protecting your family. That if he come for you again you've distanced yourself from everyone that you love.
DANA=>Aaron and I have made several award winning public radio exposes. Our last project shed fresh light on a murder case from twenty years ago. We like to re-examine incidents with an unbiased lens. When people are willing to face a thing in a different light over time, new truths can sometimes emerge. I believe there is a lot to learn from the horror you experienced.
LAURIE=>There's nothing to re-examine. Nothing to learn from something that happened forty years ago.
AARON=>So is he real?
LAURIE=>Who?
AARON=>The Boogeyman. I've read you QUOATED-
LAURIE=>You don't believe in The Boogeyman?
AARON=>I believe in Michael Myers, a deranged serial killer. But The Boogeyman?
LAURIE=>Well, you should.
AARON=>We have archival recordings of Dr. Loomis from after that horrific night.
AARON=>His intellect was overcome with abstract and apocalyptic observations.
LAURIE=>He just wanted Michael dead and no one would listen.
DANA=>Michael Myers is a human being that killed his sister when he was six years old. And then he came after you... We want to know why. We want a glimpse inside his mind. That's why your story be important.
LAURIE=>My story?
AARON=>Two failed marriages. A rocky family relationship with your daughter and grandaughter. Among other issues...
DANA=>Aaron!
LAURIE=>It's interesting that Michael killed five people and he's a human being. I'm twice divorced and I'm a basket case.
AARON=>My apologies.
LAURIE=>I have nothing but vague, very blemished memories of that night. The insight you're here for does not exist.
AARON=>They're transferring him.
LAURIE=>I know. Tomorrow.
DANA=>He'll be locked away till the end of his days.
LAURIE=>That's the idea.
AARON=>Do you surrender any efforts of rehabilitation?
LAURIE=>-Because everyone knows 40 years is when you typically turn the corner.
DANA=>Let's talk about when the state came to take your daughter away. She was twelve years old. They said you were unfit mother. How long until you regained custody?
LAURIE=>I didn't. But I bet you know that.
AARON=>Mrs Strode. We want you to sit down with him. Sit with Michael in a safe environment. He won't talk to anybody... But he might speak to you. Finally you can get the chance to say what you've always wanted to say to him. Come with us. Let us help you free yourself.
LAURIE=>Time's up. I'll accept my payment.
LAURIE=>With your journalistic insights, I'm sure you'll be able to find your way out.
CAMERON=>Gottcha!
ALLYSON=>Cameron. Jesus.
CAMERON=>I got you, babe. Do you have everything for your costume tomorrow night? Bonnie and Clyde must roll as one.
ALLYSON=>I'm just thinking about tonight.
CAMERON=>Tonight? Come on. I thought you were joking when you said your parents were old fashioned.
ALLYSON=>Be nice. It'll be nice. I just want you to meet them. I'm more old fashioned than they are. Just don't make them like you too much. I like to keep them on edge.
OSCAR=>Slow down, Smoochy. Give me a slice.
CAMERON=>Dude, you got your chapped lip crusties all over me, man.
OSCAR=>You have everything for your costume tomorrow night? Tango and Cash must roll as one.
CAMERON=>Um...
OSCAR=>What? You said we were going as Sly and Kurt, bro. You said we were doing this Halloween dance thing. What's up? You're ditching me now?
ALLYSON=>I'll see you lovebirds later. And I well see you tonight.
SHANAH=>We need to look at those who love us for protection and comfort but listen to our feelings. We all have lived through difficult situations and are confronted with bad people from time to time, but by using our voice we can overcome our problems.
LAURIE=>Shanah. I need to talk to you.
SHANAH=>Well hello mother. New glasses?
LAURIE=>Allyson reached out to me-
SHANAH=>I specifically told you you're not to have any communication with her.
LAURIE=>I can't control who calls me. She's her own person and she's making her own decisions.
SHANAH=>What did she reach out to you about?
LAURIE=>Joining you tonight.
SHANAH=>Interesting. I guess she hasn't picked up on the fact that you... raised me.
LAURIE=>I raised you the way I did for your own protection and you're telling me I ruined your life? As a mental health care professional, I would hope you could empathize in some way.
SHANAH=>I've heard this before.
LAURIE=>Michael Myers is leaving Smith Grove. I've spent years petitioning for his transfer. He'll spend the rest of his life at a prison in Colorado. I'm going to do what I can to put my past behind me. It's been forty years. I just wanted to come here today and tell you that.
SHANAH=>I'm happy that you're ready to put your past behind you, but I've got to figure out if I can put our past behind me.
SHANAH=>Mom, wait.
SHANAH=>Allyson is being rewarded at school tonight and then we're going to have a family dinner after. It's important to her. She wants you to come. So... I think you should come.
STATE DOCTOR=>... Dr. Samuel Loomis, January 1979. Do you wish to give a statement regarding your former patient Michael Myers?
DR. LOOMIS=>My suggestion is termination.
KUNEMAN=>A-2201. Myers, Michael.
DR. LOOMIS=>A shot of sodium thiopental would render him unconscious.
HASKELL=>Stand up! Hands up! Shut up!
DR. LOOMIS=>Then a shot of potassium chloride to stop his heart. He would go quietly, without incident.
HASKELL=>Hands on the wall!
KUNEMAN=>A-2209 Aaron White... A-2217 Anthony Murphy. A-2243-Jeffrey Neundorf.
DR. LOOMIS=>I'll be with him to make sure his life is ended. My ear on his chest to hear for myself that his vitals no longer function. At that point with the help of a coroner we will extract the brain for our studies and then incinerate the body.
DR. SARTAIN=>Don't worry, Michael. I'll be by your side.
DR. LOOMIS=>It needs to die. It wants to die!
HASKELL=>A-7367 secure. All clear.
KUNEMAN=>Still not sure why you're here.
DR. SARTAIN=>Michael Myers is my patient until he is in somebody else's care. I'm seeing my duty through till the end.
KUNEMAN=>Buckle up, Dr. Sartain.
DR. LOOMIS=>There's nothing to be won from keeping evil alive and gestating.
DR. LOOMIS=>Destruction is the only solution for Michael. A quiet death before it kills again...
LAURIE=>Put the Boogeyman to bed now, will you Kiddo?
ALLYSON=>You said she was going to come.
SHANAH=>She said she would. She came to my office. We had a nice talk.
ALLYSON=>Did you really have a talk?
SHANAH=>I'm being honest with you. We all have to be truthful from now on no matter how much it might hurt us.
RAY=>Allyson's grandmother has had some struggles, Cameron.
CAMERON=>We have a lot of addiction in family too. A lot of troubled individuals.
SHANAH=>Can't we have a nice dinner now?
RAY=>Cameron, do you know I went to school with your father? He used to sell me Peyote.
ALLYSON=>Dad!
RAY=>It's true. I learned a lot about myself.
CAMERON=>He, um... He's weird.
SHANAH=>Come on Ray, that's like a massive over-share for our new friend. Do you have any special All Hallow's Eve plans?
SHANAH=>Why don't you and Cameron have a little fun tomorrow night. I hear there's a thing at school. What is it, a dance or something?
SHANAH=>Moms talk too.
LAURIE=>There you guys are.
SHANAH=>Mom?
ALLYSON=>Hey! I didn't think you were coming.
LAURIE=>Wrapped up later than expected.
LAURIE=>And you must be the new heart throb. What's your name?
CAMERON=>Cameron Elam. Nice to meet you.
LAURIE=>He's got a firm handshake. Not wet and clammy like Ray's.
RAY=>Wonderful to see you, Laurie. We're casually getting to know Cameron here and we're having a nice little celebration in honor of Ally-
LAURIE=>We've all got something to celebrate tonight, don't we? How was the ceremony?
SHANAH=>It was very nice. Want to have a seat, Mom?
SHANAH=>What are you on?
ALLYSON=>Mom!
LAURIE=>I'm used to it. I'm a bad mom when I don't show up and a bad mom when I do.
SHANAH=>Stop it. Reset. Let's start over.
LAURIE=>Yes. I agree. Where's the waiter so I can get a drink? I mean if I look the part... Right? Hello? Waiter? Drinks? Does ANYBODY work here?!
SHANAH=>Stop it. We were just about to get the check actually.
ALLYSON=>No we weren't.
LAURIE=>I'm sure Cameron could use a stiff one.
LAURIE=>Ray been throwing you the 3rd degree about your family? Have you slept with my granddaughter yet, son?
SHANAH=>Mom!
RAY=>That's enough!
LAURIE=>Jesus, I'm just kidding. Anyway, where is this waiter??
FATHER=>I can't reception on this thing ever since the antenna was bent at the car wash.
SON=>Imagine if they had won last week. They got hit with the 18th-ranked offense, but they totally got wrong ball protection. They had season- worst marks of negative-eight rushing yards, 295 total yards and five turnovers. Randall scored twenty-eight points off those takeaways, including 21 in the decisive second half.
FATHER=>Dammit! Can't we just listen to the silence?
SON=>Dad, look out!
FATHER=>What the hell happened to you, Hoss?
SON=>Oh shit, dad. Look.
FATHER=>Stay here Lumpy. I'll check it out.
FATHER=>Hey! You okay? You fellas all right? Want some help out here?
SON=>Yes? Hello? Yes. There's been an accident or something... There's a bus. People running around in the road... Lemme check.
SON=>Yeah. Looks like mile 227. - Yes. That back road just past Old Willard_Bridge. -- My dad went to look. I don't know-- Hold on. I'll go check...
SON=>Dad?
KUNEMAN=>Help.
SON=>The police are on their way. What happened? Where's my dad?
SON=>I can't understand.
SON=>Wait there. I'll get my dad.
KUNEMAN=>No. Run...
SON=>Dad? Daddy?!
DR. SARTAIN=>Don't shoot.
SON=>Aw ffff-!
SHANAH=>You need to know this. I was raised to trust no one. Our house was a bunker and I lived on lockdown my entire childhood. We'd hide in the basement every time the paranoia set in. I still have nightmares about that room. She didn't let me go to school. Instead she trained me to shoot and fight until social services came and took me away. I chose to forget the neurosis she planted in my head.
RAY=>She told me to give you this.
ALLYSON=>What is it?
SHANAH=>It's like she's spent her entire adult life preparing for the past. She lives every day in fear he's coming back.
SHAMEEL=>Yo Hawkins, you want that strawberry slushy or blue raspberry slushy?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I'm in wizard mode, Shameel. Get me a coffee if you don't mind. Thanks. I'll get you back.
COREY=>Another loss for hot fuzz!
STANFORD=>If the ball comes down loose, don't hit that bounce pass. It's gonna hit off that broken flipper then whack the bottom of the slingshot and go down the middle.
RADIO=>Dispatch to unit 601. We have a 1050 on Marla Road. Please respond.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Copy dispatch. I'm on my way.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Thanks man. Hey Corey, take over my game.
COREY=>Hot fuzz personified, born to lose.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Sheriff's Department! If you need assistance, please let yourself be known!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Signal 13. I have an officer down. Officer down. I need assistance. Send back-up right away.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Show your hands!!
DR. SARTAIN=>I can't.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Sir. Help is coming. Stay with me!
DR. SARTAIN=>Did he... Did he escape?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Who? Did who escape?
AARON=>Room for one more?
DANA=>Take that hideous thing off.
AARON=>When I wear this, there is a certain tendency or inclination that the legacy of the mask seems to inspire.
DANA=>Please don't murder me.
AARON=>I would never. I need your smile.
NEWS REPORTER=>Police have not determined the cause of the accident, but we do know there are multiple fatalities.
NEWS REPORTER=>According to sources, authorities have sent personnel from a local state hospital. At this time, we do not know why.
CARETAKER=>My cousin works at a graveyard not too far from here. They got War Generals, Philanthropists, a beatnik poet. They got Muddy Waters and Bernie Mac. People come from all over to pay respects. But this gal from Haddonfield. This is our only claim to fame.
CARETAKER=>Maybe you can explain to me what's so spectacular about Judith Myers.
DANA=>...As she sat combing her hair. Unaware. Her six year old brother crept in quietly with a kitchen knife.
CARETAKER=>Damn.
AARON=>He then proceeded to slice the base of her skull down to her spinal chord, here... ...then she turned and raised her hands in self-defense. He continued stabbing into the arteries and nerves of her palms, like so... Once she collapsed, three more stabs in her sternum, piercing her heart.
CARETAKER=>I don't know about sternums. All I know is we've had to replace this stone two times, people come around and put demon pentagrams and voodoo shit on it. Every Halloween. Crazy coconuts.
DANA=>If we could get those initial police transcripts from the press conference and post-conviction proceedings we might have a great prologue for our story.
AARON=>We have access to Brackett's personal journal on Michael as well as city records.
DANA=>What are you waiting for?
DANA=>Bathroom?
CASHIER=>Back out around the side.
AARON=>Dana?!
DANA=>Excuse me. Someone's in here.
DANA=>Aaron?!
AARON=>Oh bollocks.
AARON=>DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!
DANA=>NO!!!
DANA=>AARON--
AARON=>What have we done.
DANA=>Aaron!!!
SHERIFF BARKER=>Still waiting to ID the patients we found to see who's who. Almost all accounted for. Found two of them trying to check their e-mail at the local library and three others holding hands and chasing butterflies by the flea market off 220. Any word from Rip van Winkle over there?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Not yet. The nurses say he's been in and out. Lost a lot of blood. Somehow managed to fall on a bullet. I'm trying to get the story. Because here's my concern: Take a look at this list.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Most of the passengers were minor offenders. Mental patients.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>One stuck out. A-2201.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Michael Myers. The Babysitter Murders, 1978. It's forty years to the day. You think this is a coincidence or part of some greater plan?
SHERIFF BARKER=>Look Frank, I don't need to incite panic until we have all the facts. Myers loose with a bunch of nutbags in Haddonfield on Halloween night is a fucking joke if it's not legit. It sounds like a joke. It would ruin our department. And if it is legit. If Myers did escape, we're gonna have a serious circus on our hands.
SHERIFF BARKER=>I mean, what are we gonna do, cancel Halloween?
HAWKINS=>There's a reason we're supposed to be afraid of this night.
DISPATCH=>Dispatch to 601. Dispatch to 601.
VICKY=>So, bad news. I can't go to the dance tonight.
ALLYSON=>Serious?
VICKY=>I got a call to baby-sit. They needed somebody at the last minute.
ALLYSON=>I get it. You didn't let up about me going and then you back out?
VICKY=>It's good for you to go. You're going out with Cameron now. You'll hang with his friends. It's his scene. You can't just use homework as an excuse, can you? Can you?!
ALLYSON=>Maybe I like doing- I'm not being anti-social. I'm just... reserved.
DAVE=>You're sheepish, only like in a very fresh way.
VICKY=>Look, I wouldn't bail on you, but I need some cash, so I said I would. You'll have fun. I promise.
DAVE=>Vicky's also gonna have some fun. She said if I behave, I can come over after the kid's nighty night and do cool stuff. Like clean dishes, mop up, keep her company.
VICKY=>You're like my helpful pet. I appreciate you, Dave. If you help me mop and do dishes I'll take your virginity. Enough of this third base shit, right? We're adults.
DAVE=>Finally. Hey, wanna get matching tattoos so we can remember this day forever?
ALLYSON=>Hey, there's Cameron. I'm gonna catch up with him. You guys go on without me.
VICKY=>Okay, if not you're pissed at me. Are you pissed?
ALLYSON=>No. I just thought... It'd be more fun if you'd hang with me. That's all. Cameron is sweet, but I'm still getting used to the idea... I don't know. And his friend...?
OSCAR=>There she is, brother. What do you say? She's a knock out. I would definitely take her over me any day of the week. I'm not offended.
CAMERON=>I like her. I'm serious. And I don't want you to fuck this up by doing something stupid. Please.
OSCAR=>Hey Allyson. Guess what? Cameron likes you more than me, but I'm over it. I'll see you guys later. I'm gonna catch up with Bianca and see if any of those ladies need a handsome male escort to Halloween.
CAMERON=>He's a mess. You okay?
ALLYSON=>I'm fine. I couldn't sleep. I was so embarrassed about last night. I'm sorry you had to see that. It's a weird time for me I guess.
CAMERON=>Wait till you meet my family. Your grandma has nothing on my Uncle James. Don't worry about that stuff, okay?
ALLYSON=>Okay. I won't worry.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Is that who I think it is?
OFFICER RICHARDS=>Yeah. She calls the station at least twice a month. She's a paranoid pain in the ass.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Tell her to go home.
DETECTIVE=>State issued.
SHERIFF BARKER=>Get on the phone to Smith's Grove and confirm the match.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>In the meantime, we have to let people know, Sir.
SHERIFF BARKER=>Not until we have confirmation. I don't want the media foaming at the mouth and dragging the name of this town through the headlines again.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I strongly disagree, sir. If this is who we think it is, we have one order of business. Hunt this man down.
SHANAH=>Ray?
SHANAH=>Allyson? Anyone home?
RAY=>Shanah?
LAURIE=>Bang. You're dead.
SHANAH=>You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing in my house?!
LAURIE=>Side window is unlocked. No security system. You have a dozen knives available for any psychotic to come in here and stab you with. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between ignorance and stupidity.
RAY=>I know Jujitsu, Laurie. I can apply pressure points and choke holds to use the opponents force of attack against them.
SHANAH/LAURIE=>Shut up, Ray.
LAURIE=>Michael has escaped. I'd be a fool to think this is over. If he comes for my family, I'll be ready.
LAURIE=>Where's Allyson? We have to get out of here. Now.
SHANAH=>Mom, no one's coming after you and they're not coming after us. Get out of my way.
RAY=>Maybe you should put down that gun?
LAURIE=>'Out of my way'. It's like I'm always in your way, aren't I, Shanah? You're always going somewhere and you're trying to leave me behind. Evil is real. You don't know what it's like to feel true terror. To live powerless. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I only want to train and protect you.
SHANAH=>The world is not a dark place. It can be full of love and understanding and I don't need your psychotic rants to confuse me or convince me otherwise.
RAY=>You need to leave, Laurie.
LAURIE=>Do you have a gun?
SHANAH=>Of course not.
COWBOY KID=>Hey wait up!
COWBOY KID=>Sorry mister.
HUSBAND=>Oh hell, I can't find my keys.
WIFE=>We're going to be late.
WIFE=>Hello?
HUSBAND=>Let's go, baby.
TRICK OR TREATER=>Trick or treat!
WOMAN=>Wow! Look at you, all dressed up.
WOMAN=>You guys are my last customers for the night. Happy Halloween!
ALLYSON=>What's wrong?
CAMERON=>Nothing. It took me a whole year to get up the nerve to ask you out and now look what I'm willing to do to impress you.
ALLYSON=>I know. I respect that. You look good. You look amazing.
CAMERON=>So do you. Total criminal.
OSCAR=>You guys! Daaayum, you look good. Hey, I got a twelve pack stashed and gin in this flask. Who wants to party with Oscar?
CAMERON=>We're gonna have a good time, right?!
ALLYSON=>I'm sad you're not here. It's ridiculous. It's actually a lot easier for me to talk to people when I can't tell who they are.
VICKY=>See. I told you. How's Cameron? Looking hot in my skirt?
ALLYSON=>We're having a good time. I think he's sweet.
VICKY=>You guys should just come over here when it's done. Dave's on his way. He's bringing beer. Julian's parents aren't gonna be home till late.
ALLYSON=>School night though.
VICKY=>Listen, I gotta tuck this cute little critter in to bed. Stop being a needy bitch and get over here.
ALLYSON=>Sounds good. See ya in a bit.
JULIAN=>I heard you telling your friends to come over here and you're drinking beer. That's against the rules. I'm telling my mom.
VICKY=>Well, I've seen your browser history, Julian. Wouldn't want me telling your folks about that, would you?
VICKY=>-And up late watching horror movies is not what you're supposed to be doing either.
VICKY=>Get to bed, you little monster.
JULIAN=>Will you leave the door open? Just a crack?
VICKY=>Goodnight, critter.
VICKY=>Jesus Dave! You scared the shit out of me.
DAVE=>Sorry. I've been knocking on the front door for five minutes. I didn't wanna ring the bell and wake the kid. Check it out. Fresh from my patch.
VICKY=>Julian just went to bed.
DAVE=>So we have the house to ourselves?
VICKY=>Allyson and Cameron are gonna head over in a few.
DAVE=>Should we make popcorn? Wanna watch TV?
VICKY=>No.
DAVE=>Hold on a sec. Check this out. I did this for you.
DAVE=>Because tonight is the night. And this is tonight's date which is Halloween.
VICKY=>Oh fuck yeah.
VICKY=>Shhh... stop. Dave. What was that?
DAVE=>What? What was it?
VICKY=>I don't know. I heard something.
DAVE=>It's nothing. It's Julian taking a dump or somethin'. C'mon...
VICKY=>I'm serious. Go see.
DAVE=>Go see him take a shit?
VICKY=>Go!
DAVE=>Oh fuck me
VICKY=>Julian?
VICKY=>What are you doing up?
JULIAN=>I saw someone in the hallway, standing outside my door.
DAVE=>Aww, bro! Ghosts and goblins?
JULIAN=>Shut up, Dave! I heard him breathin' then I saw him. He's in here. The Boogeyman's in the house!
VICKY=>Come on. Let's go see this creature, then get you back to bed.
JULIAN=>He was standing in the door right there. I closed my eyes. When I opened them, he was gone.
VICKY=>That's the last time I show you a scary movie.
JULIAN=>Vicky?
VICKY=>All clear, little dude.
VICKY=>Nothing to be afraid of.
DAVE=>Sick bike.
JULIAN=>Will you turn on the closet light?
VICKY=>Then you go to sleep for real.
JULIAN=>Oh shit!!!
DAVE=>Aww. Idiot.
JULIAN=>Nope.
VICKY=>RUUUUN!!
DAVE=>Dude! Chill. Why are you screechin'?
JULIAN=>There's a man up there!
DAVE=>There's no man up there.
JULIAN=>You go up there, you're gonna get killed, Dave!
DAVE=>Oh yeah? Come get some Dave.
CAMERON=>Allyson. Come here!
ALLYSON=>What are you doing? What was that?
CAMERON=>I just need a kiss from you.
ALLYSON=>Looks like you just got one from Kim?
CAMERON=>That was nothing.
ALLYSON=>Really?
CAMERON=>Yeah. Every time I turn around, you're in your phone. Looking at it, texting with people, talking with people. It sucks. And I didn't do anything with Kim. She came up to me. Gave ME a kiss. Don't cry about it.
ALLYSON=>You're drunk. Oscar got you fucked up.
CAMERON=>Come 'ere. Come on.
ALLYSON=>Don't.
CAMERON=>See! This piece of shit.
ALLYSON=>What the fuck?!
DISPATCH=>Base to all units. Intrusion in progress at 707 Meridian Avenue.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Copy.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Haddonfield Sheriff's department. Responding to a domestic disturbance!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I repeat! This is Officer Hawkins. Please respond!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Hands on your head. Come out NOW!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Stop or I'll fire!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Where is he?!
LAURIE=>Fuck! Jesus! What the fuck?!
LAURIE=>Don't creep up on a girl in the dark unless you want to get punched.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>You were told to go home.
LAURIE=>I shot him! I almost shot you too.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Did you see which way he went?
LAURIE=>No. But do me do me favor. If you find him before I do, finish him.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Sure. Sure. You get a license for that fire arm, lady?
LAURIE=>I do. And this one too.
SHERIFF BARKER=>Hawkins, look who's up!
DR. SARTAIN=>Where is he?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>You tell me.
DR. SARTAIN=>The bus lost control after Michael overtook the first guard, then the driver. He is no longer dormant. I saw him kill with my own eyes. He only knows how to keep moving and to keep killing and he will kill again unless he is captured.
SHERIFF BARKER=>What I want to know is why he didn't kill you?
DR. SARTAIN=>I tried to hide, but he found me. Locked me to a seat. He looked down at me. I closed my eyes and when I opened them, he walked away.
SHERIFF BARKER=>Hawkins, come talk to me for a second. Doctor, please wait here.
SHERIFF BARKER=>He's an asset.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>He's not an asset, he's a liability.
SHERIFF BARKER=>You're going to take him. He knows Myers better than anyone.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>You want me to take this injured civilian to search for a psychopathic serial killer?
SHERIFF BARKER=>You were right. I was wrong. We're clearing the streets. Patrol cars on every corner. I'm going statewide with this. Let's find this son of a bitch. You hear me?
LAURIE=>Sheriff Barker, Officer Hawkins?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>We don't need your help right now, Ms. Strode.
DR. SARTAIN=>Excuse me, officers.
SHERIFF BARKER=>Laurie Strode, meet Dr. Sartain.
DR. SARTAIN=>I'm Michael's doctor. Ranbir Sartain.
LAURIE=>You're the new Loomis. I can tell by the classy accent.
DR. SARTAIN=>I've read everything about you in his case files. Do you know our friend Mr. Hawkins here was the responding deputy when Michael was apprehended in 1978?
DR. SARTAIN=>He lawfully stood between doctor Loomis' vindictive tirade and the right to a fair trial.
LAURIE=>Loomis calling for his execution didn't persuade you?
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I used to believe that due process balanced the power of the law of the land. I'm not so sure anymore.
LAURIE=>I prayed everyday that he would escape.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>What the hell did you do that for?
LAURIE=>So I could kill him.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Well, that was a dumb thing to pray for...
DR. SARTAIN=>Will you come with us?
LAURIE=>No. I need to protect my family.
SHERIFF BARKER=>We have you covered, ma'am.
CAMERON=>Just put it in a bag of rice. It'll be fine.
ALLYSON=>I leave you alone for literally two minutes and you run to talk to the one girl that stresses me out. Then you break my phone?!
CAMERON=>Listen. I had too much gin. I told you. Kim was talking to me. She came on to me. I'm trying to be respectful that she still has feelings. I'm sorry. She already has eating issues and I don't want to make it worse. What was I supposed to do?
ALLYSON=>It's ruined. It's totally sticky with fucking Velveeta on it.
CAMERON=>Good! Now we actually have to blab to each other. Seriously. Let's have some fun. Please. If we don't this is a completely degrading experience. I'm serious.
ALLYSON=>What's happening? Why aren't we safe? Why do we need to go?
ALLYSON=>We were just leaving-
CAMERON=>No we weren't. Dude. We're in the middle of a fight and we were at the point of a breakthrough when you shined that goddamn flashlight in my face! Why you gotta be dicks-
ALLYSON=>Cameron!
CAMERON=>Oh yeah?
CAMERON=>Go fuck yourself.
CAMERON=>You say anything about my family again and I'll-
CAMERON=>I was ten years old and made you look like a bitch in front of your entire department.
OSCAR=>Cameron? What's up dude? Are you being misunderstood again. This is a heartbreaking case of mistaken identity Your Honor.
CAMERON=>Are you serious? Are you fucking serious?!! Allyson!
CAMERON=>Oscar! Get her home safe, man.
CAMERON=>Get her home!
SHANAH=>Mom! Do we have to do this-
LAURIE=>I never wanted you to be scared, baby. Never. Just prepared.
LAURIE=>Where's Allyson?
LAURIE=>Where's Allyson?!
SHANAH=>Allyson, you need to call me the second you get this. The police said the dance was evacuated and I haven't heard from you. We're heading to your Grandmother's house. We're worried about you.
LAURIE=>Where are you, baby? There are police officers at your house. Get to them and they'll bring you to us. We're all together now. We love you...
LAURIE=>Wherever you are... It's not safe outside tonight.
OSCAR=>This is an amazing night, right?! Don't you just love Cameron?
ALLYSON=>No. I think he's a jerk.
OSCAR=>He's cool. So bad ass. But I can tell you're pissed about your phone. He plopped it into the chili con queso. Classic Cameron!
ALLYSON=>I'm tired of people letting me down. You give them the benefit of the doubt and think they're going to be different, but then they show you who they truly are. Cameron doesn't want people to judge him, but then he acts like a jerk. Gets drunk, gets arrested.
OSCAR=>You deserve better. You're the smartest, most beautiful girl at school. Anyone that doesn't appreciate that is crazy.
ALLYSON=>Thanks Oscar, that's sweet.
OSCAR=>Check it out. 5.0. Let's detour this rendezvous.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>From a clinical perspective, would you say that Laurie Strode has lost her fucking marbles?
DR. SARTAIN=>There are many ways for tragedy to change a victim. They can grow accustomed to always being afraid. They can become weak or they can become strong. But there is also the other side.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>What side is that?
DR. SARTAIN=>The core of the victimizer. This is what has intrigued me through my studies. How does a crime like Michael's change him? What is he feeling? Is he on a random path or is he emotionally driven? Triggered by something. Some unheard marching order imprinted on his very being? Evil incarnate. Michael and I had a special connection, but without his verbal participation there was a side of his mad journey that I could never understand.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Walk a mile in another man's shoes, or something like that, right? Not for me, brother.
DR. SARTAIN=>Tell me what become of his childhood home.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>That old place was a shrine kinda- thing but for serial killer groupies and death metal bands. Vandals got the best of it. A local organization that I work with tore it down and turned it into a community garden. Turned tragedy into beauty if you can consider it.
OSCAR=>Watch out for the poison ivy. It's all over.
ALLYSON=>This is a dumb short cut.
OSCAR=>Treacherous. Let me give you a hand.
ALLYSON=>Thanks.
ALLYSON=>What? What are you doing?
OSCAR=>You deserve better.
ALLYSON=>Ew. Oscar. What the fuck?!
OSCAR=>Wait, I thought you said you weren't with Cameron anymore.
ALLYSON=>Doesn't mean I want- Get away from me.
OSCAR=>I thought you were sending me signals.
ALLYSON=>Definitely no signals. Just go!
OSCAR=>I'm sorry. Please don't tell Cameron I did that. I didn't feel anything either.
ALLYSON=>You're disgusting. I'm going home. You need to figure your shit out.
OSCAR=>I'm drunk. Like... really drunk, and I got all horny at the party, I was dancing with some girl, this way out of my league girl and my brain got all sexed up, and her tits got me totally chubbed out when she was feeding me guacamole in sexy ways--
OSCAR=>SHIT!
OSCAR=>Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod. Cool mask. Sorry... I'm not trying to trespass on your shit, I was just talking to this pretty girl over there. It's just... I guess, I always kind of liked her. And I know she's bummed out about Cameron so I thought maybe... Stupid, right?
OSCAR=>All right. Peace. Thank you.
OSCAR=>Yo! Where'd you go, bro? You're acting super sketchy right now.
AARON=>Oscar?!! Oscar?!
ALLYSON=>Help me!! Open the door!
ALLYSON=>Please open the door!
SHANAH=>Hello? - Allyson? - Thank God you're all right. Where are you?!
ALLYSON=>Officer! I saw him. My friend was attacked! He came out of nowhere-
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Take a deep breath, Allyson. You're going to be all right. Take a deep breath.
OFFICER FRANCIS=>We'll drop you off and wait at the gate for your girl to arrive. We have an officer on the scene in contact with her now.
RAY=>Home is where the heart is, right Laurie?
LAURIE=>I saw your mousetraps, Ray. Peanut butter and marshmallow fluff?
RAY=>What's this?
SHANAH=>My childhood.
LAURIE=>It's how we protect ourselves.
LAURIE=>Pick your poison. Do you need small caliber defense, semi-automatic ballistics with brownout rounds, a shotgun for tactical operations or a rifle with accuracy and stopping power?
LAURIE=>He's waited for this night. He's waited for me. I've been waiting for him.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>601 to dispatch. I'm 1076 with a witness in custody.
DISPATCH=>Copy 601. Be advised. Suspect last reported on 11th Avenue, South of Bypass.
ALLYSON=>I haven't been to her house in years, but I think I can give you directions from the-
ALLYSON=>LOOK OUT!!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Brace yourself.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Stay in the car!
DR. SARTAIN=>He's alive.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Not for long. Stand back.
DR. SARTAIN=>Officer Hawkins, do not kill my patient.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I'm finishing this.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Get back, now. I'm going to fire!
OFFICER HAWKINS=>I'm not going to ask you again, Doctor. Stand back!
DR. SARTAIN=>Don't move, Young lady. Do not scream. Stay where you are.
ALLYSON=>Please... Don't.
DR. SARTAIN=>This is a dream.
ALLYSON=>No! please no! Please!
DR. SARTAIN=>Make room, my dear. Mindful of my patient.
DR. SARTAIN=>Are you with us, Michael? Are you listening? I don't believe he hears everything.
ALLYSON=>NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HELP!
DR. SARTAIN=>Michael, I see why you are who you are. The sensation is obvious. The thrill is exhilarating. Loomis was a coward. He was afraid to travel to such depths for you. But I love you and I know you feel the same way. I freed you from those unwilling to understand you. Those of archaic mind.
ALLYSON=>Let me go. Please.
DR. SARTAIN=>The look on your face when you saw freedom? And then the carnage and confusion we created?
DR. SARTAIN=>I'm glad we're together, Michael.
ALLYSON=>Please... Where are you taking me?!
OFFICER RICHARDS=>You know what sounds good with a baloney sandwich?
OFFICER RICHARDS=>...An IPA.
OFFICER FRANCIS=>What the hell?
DR. SARTAIN=>What greater spectacle than to reunite two old friends. Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. A historical reunion.
DR. SARTAIN=>Michael. She's been waiting for you. Are you ready?
OFFICER RICHARDS=>601? 606 to 601? Hawkins. Turn your fuckin' radio on. Hawkins?
OFFICER FRANCIS=>Let's check it out.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>Hawkins, please respond.
DR. SARTAIN=>But you said I could watch.
DR. SARTAIN=>Do it.
OFFICER HAWKINS=>It's him.
OFFICER RICHARDS=>Hands where I can see `um! DON'T MOVE!!!
SHANAH=>I'm scared. I don't know how to do this.
LAURIE=>You never wanted to listen when I spoke about that night... but this is why. We fight to survive. He is a killer. But he will be killed tonight. I've been preparing for this for a long time. And whether you know it or not, so have you.
LAURIE=>Shanah... I'm sorry. For everything.
RAY=>Any word on Allyson?
RAY=>You guys need some coffee or something?
LAURIE=>Ray?
SHANAH=>Mom?
LAURIE=>He's here Shanah. Michael is here. Go to the shelter and hide. You'll be safe there.
SHANAH=>What about Ray? What about Allyson?
LAURIE=>I'll take care of it. It's time. Now. It all ends tonight.
LAURIE=>It only works if you load it, Sweetheart.
LAURIE=>He's right there.
LAURIE=>Michael?!
LAURIE=>Michael?! Come out.
LAURIE=>Allyson, you can't be here.
LAURIE=>I'm so sorry. It's not over. You need to run. Run and hide. Go to the road and don't look back. Get help. Save yourself.
ALLYSON=>I'm not leaving without you.
LAURIE=>You must. Go now. I love you.
ALLYSON=>Grandmother?!
LAURIE=>Kill it. Kill it. It must die.
