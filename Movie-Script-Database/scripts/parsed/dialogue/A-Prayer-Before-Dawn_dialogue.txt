NAN=>Chok!
NAN=>What you want?
NAN=>You fight before?
BILLY=>Boxing, six years. As a kid, I won the Northwest area in England.
NAN=>No Muay Thai?
BILLY=>...Not much.
NAN=>Father train you?
BILLY=>When he used me as a punching bag, I might've learned some.
NAN=>-- Why you want fight? You in danger?
BILLY=>It helps me forget where I am. When the gloves are on,-- I don't have pain.

NAN=>Next round not for you. Your ear almost come off.
BILLY=>Fuck that. I got another one.
BILLY=>How's the ear?
NAN=>Still there.
NAN=>Last round, Billy! Must knock out or lose fight!
OFFICER PI SIT=>Your fight at Songkran was impressive. Insane, but impressive.
OFFICER PI SIT=>I'm going to transfer you to the boxing team's cell... You will share in their privileges: better food, earlier to shower to avoid line, same thing at night.
OFFICER PI SIT=>But if you lose in National tournament, you will be sent back to live with regular prisoners.

BILLY=>I don't owe you nothin'.
KIAW=>You know I have AIDS. You pay my debt to Samurai or I inject you with my blood.
JOM=>...You good fighters, not bad. My father want me to be Muay Thai, like him.
JOM=>But his dream not mine. I start taking hormones when I was fifteen. Father say I bring great shame, and he disown me. But now I am who I want to be. Happy with myself.
JOM=>My only regret is I should have had kids before I cut my dick off.
GERMAN INMATE=>Well me, I like to fuck `em younger. Much younger...Dick or no dick, it don't matter.
GERMAN INMATE=>How many cigarettes to suck me off?
JOM=>You, Westerner-- what your problem?!

NAN=>Muay Thai more than just "fight." Disrespect spirits or no believe, you never understand Muay Thai!
BILLY=>I "believe."

A MAN'S VOICE=>Mr. Moore?
DR. ADI=>Mr. Moore, I am Dr. Adi.
BILLY=>Never seen you here before...
DR. ADI=>I come once a month to give medical aid to foreigners.
DR. ADI=>How are you feeling?
BILLY=>I'm not sure.
DR. ADI=>You have a delineation of the esophagus.
BILLY=>A what...?
DR. ADI=>It's a tear. Primary cause: drug and alcohol abuse. Through years of this, it's worn away the lining of your esophagus.
BILLY=>Well I'm sober now.
DR. ADI=>You need to stay that way.
BILLY=>So can I get out of here...get back to the gym?
DR. ADI=>You need to heal. After, exercise is good,-- but only moderate.
BILLY=>I've got a tournament comin' up: Muay Thai.
DR. ADI=>Make other plans.
BILLY=>Doc, I'm in prison. I haven't got no "other plans."
DR. ADI=>Boxing is what caused the rupture. You vomited blood because you had at least a pint in there. Any more trauma, and you could hemorrhage. You'll bleed to death.
DR. ADI=>I'm putting in a request to have you transferred to a government hospital. They'll patch your esophagus, or perhaps cauterize it.
BILLY=>I'll just, I'll keep my guard up.

BILLY=>watches scenery pass. People on the streets; temples; markets; life on the outside.
BILLY=>sits alone. He watches other boxers with their families. Pon, Tiger, etc. Lek, holding and kissing his INFANT SON. Then, Billy looks away and quietly stares at the ring.
ANGLE, OFFICER PI SIT.=>talking to Government Officials. He sees Billy sitting alone, walks over and sits. They both watch the families and prisoners interact for a moment. Then:
OFFICER PI SIT=>I talked to your Mother. She could no afford airfare, but she sends her love.
OFFICER PI SIT=>They say boxers should have no pleasure before fight.
OFFICER PI SIT=>They say it softens you,-- steals your hunger.
BILLY=>Well maybe "they" are full of shit.
OFFICER PI SIT=>The man you fight tonight, he no deserve to ever leave prison...So he'll do anything he can to win.
OFFICER PI SIT=>But you... You had to go to prison in order to be free.
NAN=>It's time.
BILLY=>He's too strong!
NAN=>Breathe, Billy. Have calm.
BILLY=>I can't keep him off me!

BILLY=>Nurse. `Think I should go to the loo.
DOCTOR=>Going down?
YOUNG PHARMACIST=>Can I help you?
BILLY=>...no...
BILLY=>-- How you doin'? Took a fuckin' helluva piss in there.
OFFICER PI SIT=>Why did you come back?
OFFICER PI SIT=>You could be free. Why did you turn around?
BILLY=>You saw me?
BILLY=>I don't want to run anymore.
