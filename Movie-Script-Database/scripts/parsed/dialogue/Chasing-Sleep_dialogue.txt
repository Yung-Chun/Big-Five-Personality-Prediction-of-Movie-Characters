SADIE=>2t2Is that your wife?
ED=>2t2No. It was a friend of hers.
SADIE=>2t2I should go.
ED=>2t2No. Why?
SADIE=>2t2You must be tired. Those pills must be working.
ED=>2t2I don't think they're working at all.
SADIE=>2t2Still. You're married, right?
ED=>2t2Yeah, but, please don't go. Please. Time has a way of slowing down when you're around.
SADIE=>2t2Really? For me, too.
ED=>2t2So you'll stay?
SADIE=>2t2If you want me to.
SADIE=>2t2Can I ask you something?
ED=>2t2What?
SADIE=>2t2Do you think my writing is good?
ED=>2t2You've done some good work.
SADIE=>2t2Yeah. C minus good.
ED=>2t2I told you, I was in a bad mood when I graded that.
SADIE=>2t2I guess so.
SADIE=>2t2What's wrong?
ED=>2t2I don't know. Maybe it's those pills. I don't know.
SADIE=>2t2Just relax. Lie back.
ED=>2t2No. Please. Just stop.
ED=>2t2It's just not working. OK?
SADIE=>2t2Alright. I'm sorry.
SADIE=>2t2Maybe I should go.
ED=>2t2No. Please, don't. It's my fault. Please. Don't go.
SADIE=>2t2Damn, I'm so stupid.
ED=>2t2No, it's me. Please.
SADIE=>2t2This was a mistake.
