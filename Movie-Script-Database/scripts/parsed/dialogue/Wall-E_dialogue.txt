CAPTAIN=>Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship.
CAPTAIN=>Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be... ...doing the exact same thing...they were doing...
CAPTAIN=>SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your free... ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup. Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?
AUTOPILOT=>Captain?
AUTOPILOT=>Probe One has returned positive.
CAPTAIN=>Positive?
CAPTAIN=>But...no probe's ever come back positive... ...before.
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Greetings and congratulations, Captain! If you're seeing this, that means your Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or... ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis!
BUY N LARGE CEO=>That's right, it means it's time to go back home!
CAPTAIN=>Home? W-w-we're going back?
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Now that Earth has been restored to a life-sustaining status, by golly, we can begin "Operation Recolonize"!
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Simply follow this manual's instructions to place the plant in your ship's holo- detector, and the -- -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate your return to Earth! It's that easy!
CAPTAIN WALL-E=>Huh? Huh?
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity, you and your passengers may have suffered some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few laps around your ship's jogging track will get you back in shape in no time.
CAPTAIN=>We have a jogging track?
BUY N LARGE CEO=>If you have any further questions just consult your operation manual. See you back home real soon.
CAPTAIN=>Operate... Manuel... Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
CAPTAIN=>Wow... Will you look at that?
EVE=>Wall-E?!
WALL-E=>Ee-vah!

EVE=>Plant! Wall-E... Wall-E!
WALL-E=>Ee-vah?
EVE=>[Find it!] PLANT!
CAPTAIN=>Why don't you scan her to be sure.
AUTOPILOT=>Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is faulty.
CAPTAIN=>So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
AUTOPILOT=>Negative.
CAPTAIN=>So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh?
AUTOPILOT=>Correct, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>Well, false alarm!
SHIP'S COMPUTER=>False alarm.
CAPTAIN=>The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward.
CAPTAIN=>Have them run diagnostics on her. Make sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!

AUTOPILOT=>Aye-aye, sir.
EVE=>Wall-E...
EVE=>Wall-E!
CAPTAIN=>Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector.
AUTOPILOT=>Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me.
CAPTAIN=>You know what? I should do it myself.
AUTOPILOT=>Captain!
AUTOPILOT=>Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
CAPTAIN=>Auto, get out of my way.
AUTOPILOT=>Sir, we cannot go home.
CAPTAIN=>What are you talking about? Why not?

CAPTAIN=>Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
AUTOPILOT=>Aye-aye, sir.
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Just cut it off, will ya?! Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well... failed! Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on Earth.
CAPTAIN=>Unsustainable? What?
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize. So just, uh...just stay the course. Rather than try to fix this problem, it'll just be easier if everyone remains in space.
CAPTAIN=>Easier?
CEO ADVISOR=>Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
BUY N LARGE CEO=>Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot. Take control of everything! And do not return to Earth! Repeat! Do not return to Earth! Now let's get the heck out of here.
AUTOPILOT=>Now, the plant.
CAPTAIN=>No, wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom?
SHIP'S COMPUTER=>Message received in the year 2110.
CAPTAIN=>That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back!
AUTOPILOT=>Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth".
CAPTAIN=>But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong.
AUTOPILOT=>Irrelevant, Captain.
CAPTAIN=>What?! It's completely relevant! Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!!
AUTOPILOT=>On the Axiom you will survive.
CAPTAIN=>I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
AUTOPILOT=>Must follow my directive.
CAPTAIN=>DAAAARGH!!
CAPTAIN=>I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today!
