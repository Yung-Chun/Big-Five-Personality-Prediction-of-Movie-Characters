AGU=>It is starting like this...
AGU=>Which ones having talent?
DIKE=>That one...not that one.
VILLAGE CONSTABLE=>Agu, what am I supposed to be doing with this?
AGU=>Watching TV, Massah.
VILLAGER CONSTABLE=>It is not having a screen.
AGU=>It is imagination TV.
VILLAGE CONSTABLE=>It is garbage. Go, get out of here.
2ND LIEUTENANT=>It doesn't have any channels.
AGU=>It is having 12, and one more, that is the imagination channel.
2ND LIEUTENANT=>And how much for this treasure?
AGU=>3000. And you are giving us some of your foods.
2ND LIEUTENANT=>Take these.
BIG BROTHER=>What are you two girls plotting?
AGU=>Big Brother.
BIG BROTHER=>Come, I have job for you.
AGU=>Big Brother. He is always having ideas.
OLD WOMAN=>Enh! You are not greeting me?
AGU=>Witch woman. Nobody is talking to her because every person is fearing her.
OLD WOMAN=>These young person not behaving well anymore, just acting like animal. But it is okay. Trouble go follow you.
AGU=>No trouble go follow me. I am a good boy.
BIG BROTHER=>Trouble go touch you old woman if you stay standing in the middle of the road.
OLD WOMAN=>I am knowing you, boy. I am knowing your family. And trouble go follow all of you. Thieves! Throw an old woman like me from her land! Devil go bless your family!
AGU=>I have a good family.
AGU=>My Father was a teacher. But since war is making it so we have no more school, he is keeping busy.
AGU=>He and the Paramount Chief cut some of our land so that all of the refugees can be having a place to be staying. Mother is saying he is always doing good things.
AGU=>Mother. Before she was having children she was also being a teacher, but she is saying raising childrens is too too much work.
AGU=>My mother is always working hard for us and so I am thanking her by working hard too.
AGU=>Big Brother, he is more concerned with his muscles, and his skin. Sometimes I add to his products.
AGU=>Big Brother is also concerned with sleeping.
AGU=>I am not liking his music, and I am not like his dancing, and if he is playing it loud loud I do not know how this girl will be sleeping.
AGU=>I am going to church every Sunday with my family.
AGU=>Father is saying that Pastor is thinking he can be talking so much because he is having his Reverend Doctorate -- that is making him doctor of "talking."
AGU=>God is liking music more than just talking so if we are singing and dancing, then He is listening to us well well.
FATHER=>What is wrong with you? You know you cannot waste batteries on such nonsense!
FATHER=>And you? What are you doing? Unroll him.
FATHER=>Agu. What are these?!
FATHER=>Well?
AGU=>I...
FATHER=>I? I. I. I. what?
AGU=>I got them from the Nigerians.
FATHER=>We do not need handouts. We are not beggars on the street. We are not refugees. I work for this family and I provide for this family.
AGU=>But I earned-
FATHER=>You will return them.
AGU=>Yes, Father.
FATHER=>Good dancing. Go on, help Mother.
BBC CORRESPONDENT=>It would seem things are changing quickly within the interim government. As of this morning, the NRC junta moved to abolish all political parties, further consolidating their control of the government in the wake of the recent military coup...
BBC CORRESPONDENT=>Lieutenant General Sangania, commander-in-chief of the armed forces responsible for the junta, stated in a recent press conference that it was his intention to rid the southern regions of the PLF...
BBC CORRESPONDENT=>He also condemned the Native Defence Force militias, who he said presented a threat to the very fabric of national security...
FATHER=>It's okay Agu, do not be worrying. We are in a safe place, we are in THE-
AGU=>"-Buffer zone". That is why so many refugee are coming here small small. Many people are suffering but we are not, here we are safe.
BIG BROTHER=>When I was your age, if I was doing the same things you are doing, Father would beat me. You are lucky this war is happening.
AGU=>I am not lucky. It is just because everyone is liking me.
BIG BROTHER=>When she is seeing these, her knees must be wobbling with hunger.
BIG BROTHER=>And you will see, I will be like this with all the girls in town.
BIG BROTHER=>We are seeing that witch woman on the road today. She is saying we are thieves. Why is she saying that?
FATHER=>She is not right in her head. God has taken away her ration. The land we are letting the refugees use has been in our family since before your Grandfather, we gave her a place in the camp but she refused.
AGU=>So she's crazy?
FATHER=>Enh? What is that?
AGU=>Enh?
FATHER=>What is this?
AGU=>I am a good boy. But sometimes I am sleeping outside so I am not having to go inside and be getting a beating.
FATHER=>Why so fearful? Doesn't the light go out all the time? It will come back.
MOTHER=>Go on Agu, go to bed.
AGU=>No beating?
FATHER=>Get up! Get up, now! We are going to church!
BIG BROTHER=>But it is not Sunday.
PASTOR=>It is saying in the Bible that God is only helping those who are helping themselves.
PASTOR=>Isn't God protecting the Israelites when they are having to leave their own home?
AGU=>Where is Dike?
PASTOR=>We cannot allow ourselves to face voluntary self-destruction. May God bless us all!
AGU=>Reverend Doctorate.
PARAMOUNT CHIEF=>Linguist.
PARAMOUNT CHIEF=>I am listening to the Pastor and to the Imam, and the representative for the women, and what they have to say is wise, but not all of it. It is right that we must be helping ourselves.
PARAMOUNT CHIEF=>The NRC Junta telling us to be running away is not acceptable. Our forefathers have lived on this land for centuries. It is our duty to preserve it for our children.
PARAMOUNT CHIEF=>Now that the NRC has broken its promise and entered the buffer zone, we should be accepting ECOMOD help and be sending women and the small small children to safer areas. But we who call ourselves men must stay.
LINGUIST=>The Section Chiefs and their deputies should be assembling after this to discuss protection of this village. We all must do our part.
LINGUIST=>The refugees are our problem, they are our guests.
AGU=>Father, I am not seeing Dike.
FATHER=>It is my responsibility...
AGU=>Father, where is Dike?
FATHER=>Dike and his family are gone! They fled.
FATHER=>He cannot be moved, he is an old man. And I won't force-
MOTHER=>Sometimes I am thinking that you are having no sense at all.
FATHER=>What is so irrational about staying with your sister in the Capital, I will be coming to meet you once I am knowing everything is safe here. I cannot just be abandoning my responsibilities.
MOTHER=>But then you are abandoning us.
FATHER=>Just remove that thought from you head. What are we just supposed to be doing, then? Enh? Just running into the bush and living like rats?
MOTHER=>No, you are not understanding anything.
MOTHER=>Do you want me to be a refugee in my own country, with three children in my arms and no husband? We are one family, we must be staying as one family.
FATHER=>I am not asking you. I am telling you woman.
DRIVER=>Come back tomorrow.
FATHER=>I am the Section Chief and this is my family, there must be space.
DRIVER=>No space.
FATHER=>Just one woman and these small small children.
DRIVER=>And the little boy?
AGU=>I am not a "little" boy.
FATHER=>Him, too.
DRIVER=>And where are you thinking this woman and child will be fitting.
FATHER=>I am thinking this women and children are more valuable than all this luggage you have piled in back.
FATHER=>They can be sitting with you in the front.
DRIVER=>70,000. No boy.
FATHER=>With the boy-
MOTHER=>We will find another way.
FATHER=>No! With the boy.
DRIVER=>No bargaining. Or are you wanting your woman to be walking through the bush to the capital?
MOTHER=>I would rather be walking then leaving my child.
MOTHER=>I am not leaving him.
FATHER=>Please. How much to fit the boy?
DRIVER=>No boy.
MOTHER=>No. No we cannot!
MOTHER=>No, I cannot!
FATHER=>Do not scare them. You are strong. You will be okay. Take care of them and I will take care of our boys. Now get in, there is no choice.
MOTHER=>Remember to be praying praying to God all the time and not to be worrying, we will be seeing each other soon.
AGU=>Mother!
FATHER=>You are with the men now, Agu. Be strong, wave goodbye.
AGU=>Mama!
BIG BROTHER=>Let's go home.
AGU=>And this is how it is starting.
AGU=>If I am closing my eye, I am seeing the rainy season and how in my village, they are saying it is always bringing change too fast. You can be finding that the whole world is washing away beneath your feets.
AGU=>You can be walking on road and finding that you are swimming in river. You can be starting day all dry and warm and then be finishing with your clothes like another skin on your body. Nothing is ever for sure and everything is always changing.
AGU=>I am not feeling my legs. It is like they are belonging to other PERSON-
AGU=>Will they be killing us?
MAN=>Shut up!
MAN=>Shut up, I say. They will be finding us only if you keep talking.
MAN=>And if they are rebel they will be cutting off our hand and holding them to be shaking each other, is that what you are wanting?
FATHER=>Do not be listening to them, Agu. No matter what happens, this is how God tests us, we must be strong.
FATHER=>We stay here, outside we die.
FATHER=>If we are running now, none of us will be having a chance.
FATHER=>You are killing us all!
MAN=>Shut up, quiet, they will be hearing us!
FATHER=>Stay down!
SERGEANT=>Which faction are you fighting for?
FATHER=>We are not fighters. We are from this town. We were protecting the stores.
SERGEANT=>You are Native Defense Forces?
FATHER=>No. I am a Section Chief. We were tasked to stop looters.
SERGEANT=>Bring the woman.
SERGEANT=>You are calling us looters?
SERGEANT=>Do you know these men?
OLD WOMAN=>I do not know them.
FATHER=>This woman, everyone knows she is crazy. Just talk to her, Massah, you will see she is not right in the head.
OLD WOMAN=>They are not from here, they must be rebels.
SERGEANT=>We, the armed forces of the National Reformation Council, find you to be spies and sentence you to immediate and summary execution. (to the soldiers around
THEM)=>Waste them.
FATHER=>Run!
AGU=>A forest spirit.
AGU=>This is what death is feeling like.
VOICE=>Make way!
COMMANDANT=>Why is this thing here on the ground? Who is catching this thing?
COMMANDANT=>Strika. Is it you who is finding this thing?
COMMANDANT=>Enh! Strika? Untie him. So all of you grown men here, and it is Strika who is finding a prisoner?
COMMANDANT=>(addressing Strika but
STUDYING AGU)=>Where are you finding him?
COMMANDANT=>Here? Is that right... where is Two- I-C? Two-I-C!
FAST KILL AND BONE=>Two-I-C!
TWO-I-C=>Commandant, sah!
COMMANDANT=>What are we to be doing with this thing?
TWO-I-C=>This thing? It is just a boy.
COMMANDANT=>A boy.
COMMANDANT=>A boy is nothing? A boy is harmless?
NDF SBU=>Harmless no, sah!
COMMANDANT=>Does a boy not have eyes to see?
NDF SBU=>Two eyes, sah!
COMMANDANT=>A boy has hands to strangle!
COMMANDANT=>And fingers to pull a trigger. BUAH!
COMMANDANT=>A boy is not harmless.
COMMANDANT=>A boy is very dangerous. Strika, are you trying to be eating this boy?
COMMANDANT=>I am looking at you. You are not seeming like soldier to me. Show me your fingers.
COMMANDANT=>Your hands are like babies hands. What were you doing here? Why are you just laying by the ground like one dead rat?
TWO-I-C=>Sah? We need to be move-
COMMANDANT=>I said wait. You are from Alpha Town?
COMMANDANT=>You should be telling me.
COMMANDANT=>Just tell me and I will be helping you.
AGU=>My father is telling me to run. Run far far so the Army Soldier is not catching me and killing me. And then, and then I am just hiding in the bush and running running...
COMMANDANT=>And where is this your father?
COMMANDANT=>Alpha Town? The army is killing your father?
COMMANDANT=>We have just come from Alpha Town. It is burned to the ground.
COMMANDANT=>Are you hungry?
COMMANDANT=>Thirsty?
COMMANDANT=>If you are wanting drink, you will drink, but that is having to wait until you are telling me your name. Are you hearing me?
COMMANDANT=>Everybody is calling me Commandant. What is everybody always calling you?
AGU=>Agu.
COMMANDANT=>Say it like you are proud of it.
AGU=>Agu.
COMMANDANT=>Agu, enh? Well, that is what I will be calling you then.
COMMANDANT=>Leave this one with me. I will take this one under my charge, turn him into a warrior. Is that what you want? Do you want to be fighting the Army that is killing your father?
TWO-I-C=>Formation!
COMMANDANT=>You should be saying yes.
AGU=>Yes.
COMMANDANT=>Say yes, sah.
AGU=>Yes, sah.
COMMANDANT=>Move on!
AGU=>Mother, glory be to God in the Highest. I am still living... but I am soldier now.
RAMBO=>Botu botu botu.
AGU=>Botu botu botu.
RAMBO=>Water.
TWO-I-C=>...to protect life and property. If you are wanting to stay, then stay, but you must be initiated.
COMMANDANT=>Two-I-C.
TWO-I-C=>Yes, suh.
COMMANDANT=>This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him.
TWO-I-C=>Yes, sah. C/O Hope!
HOPE=>Yes, suh.
TWO-I-C=>This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him.
CHICKEN LEGS=>Enh? What are you doing?
AGU=>I carried ammunition and water all day.
CHICKEN LEGS=>You think you are a soldier now?
NDF COOK=>Stealing from a dog?
AGU=>Which one of you is the dog?
C/O RAMBO=>In the battlefield, do not expect to be thinking normally. The only thing mattering is the mission of the NDF. Fight and kill anyone who destroys the peace.
AGU=>Mother, I am not knowing if I will ever be seeing you again. But Two-I- C is saying small small we are winning this war, and then, God willing, I can be finding you.
AGU=>They are calling him...
PREACHER=>The man who is driving the enemy to madness...
GRIOT=>He is treating death like lover.
HOPE=>He is eating people.
COMMANDANT=>I am not eating people, Hope-
COMMANDANT=>You can eat a man and take their power, it is true, but I taste their fear in the meats. I can take their juju just by looking at them in the eyes, so why must I eat their fear?
COMMANDANT=>Native Defense Forces!
NDF SOLDIERS=>Strong, proud, and intelligent!
TWO-I-C=>How does the Commandant look?!
NDF SOLDIERS=>Alright!
TWO-I-C=>...weakened by the PLF's outside pressure. The National Reformation Council took advantage of this instability and militarily seized power to restore UPC dominance. We NDF refuse to recognize this illegitimate government.
COMMANDANT=>The rains are coming, Gentlemen.
COMMANDANT=>You are knowing what that is meaning. Mosquitoes, sickness, muddy squalor. Suffering if we are caught with our "soldiers" hanging out.
TWO-I-C=>...the Junta will tell the international community that we NDF are the reason this war continues.
COMMANDANT=>You, Hope, and you, Rambo, you are not from the same tribe as him. But you are brothers before your enemy.
COMMANDANT=>What drove us to this larger family of strangers? Fear?
HOPE=>No, sah.
COMMANDANT=>War?
RAMBO=>Yes, Sah!
TWO-I-C=>The PLF could join the NRC, it would legitimize their cause, make us the sole enemy, and give them freedom to roam formerly Government controlled areas of the nation in policing actions. If this were...
COMMANDANT=>We have defended ourselves against criminal rapings and killings of our own people, first by the PLF, and now by the NRC government.
COMMANDANT=>But this has awakened a sleeping beast, Gentlemen. It has put the weapons of this war in the hands of you, the young, and therefore, the powerful.
COMMANDANT=>All of you, who were never listened to before, who have seen your loved ones gunned down, you have something that speaks for you now.
TWO-I-C=>The new regime needs to control the trade in resources for the international community to waste time recognizing them.
TWO-I-C=>You see, the colonists have never left Africa. Our very own politicians will steal our resources and give them away for pennies in exchange for private payoffs...but...
COMMANDANT=>They are licking their wounds. They are feeling our sting. We, along with our other brothers fighting further south under Dada Goodblood, we command and control what the NRC needs.
TWO-I-C=>The Grass People in the South East control the lumber and gold, the Clay and Charcoal people in the South West, diamonds and rare metals, and the Coastal people, petroleum and fisheries. This is the reason the NRC are trying so hard to be calling themselves a "reformation council."
COMMANDANT=>Reformation of what? Money. Old men and money.
TWO-I-C=>They have spit on the constitution. They have spit on your rights. They have tried to spit on your future.
COMMANDANT=>War has spoiled their minds, Gentlemen. So they could have "their turn to eat.
COMMANDANT=>War is a disease. It sickens and infects.
COMMANDANT=>You want to be a "big man", or a "small boy"?
TWO-I-C=>That is why we must not forget that we are the protectors of the people!
TWO-I-C=>The richness of our nation is for the young.
COMMANDANT=>When there is an infection in your foot. A deadly deathly sickness in your limb that's going to kill you slow slow, what do you do?
COMMANDANT=>So maybe they should be calling us the doctor army and not the hunter army? We have to be cutting off that leg to save the body. That is how you prevent the NRC/PLF infection from spreading.
CHIEF PRIEST=>You must die before you are reborn.
TWO-I-C=>Tomorrow we mobilize for major action, uniting all of our brother warriors under Supreme Commander Dada Goodblood, and with God's blessing, end this plague, end this war, end our oppression!
COMMANDANT=>Young men! Gentlemen! We will not wait to inherit it, we will not wait for them to just give it to us, we will take it, we will seize it from their rotting and decaying old hands.
COMMANDANT=>Victory!
AGU AND TROOPS=>Victory!
CHIEF PRIEST=>Eat the enemy if you bring him down. Become braver, his heart becomes your medicine.
COMMANDANT=>The spirits have blessed you and cleansed you. To the enemy, you are invincible. But there are rules you must follow to keep the spirits happy, to remain pure.
CHIEF PRIEST=>No sex with women. No touching women. No talking to women. Stay pure. No looting. No touching dead bodies. No...
COMMANDANT=>Agu, you are a soldier now. The only way is forward. Do not be leaving any nice thing for the NRC or the PLF to be using if they are coming to this place.
CHICKEN LEGS=>Advancing in the rainy season?
GRIOT=>Everyone will be on zero-zero-one now.
AGU=>What is zero-zero-one?
PREACHER=>It is meaning you, me, we all be hungry.
GRIOT=>It means no breakfast, no lunch, only dinner. If you are wanting to eat when it is not dinner, then you are having to keep your dinner from before to be eating the next day.
HOPE=>Or if we raiding or finding farm, then we can be eating what we find. Cow, chicken, baby... woman.
COMMANDANT=>You are knowing this tree?
AGU=>It is Iroko. These other trees I am not knowing, but I am calling them children of the forest because they are smaller than the rest.
COMMANDANT=>When this tree is small, it is looking so so like a cassava plant, except that it has thorns.
COMMANDANT=>It is even having a root like a cassava, but if you eat it, it will kill you with its poison.
COMMANDANT=>That is why you must be knowing how to use your thorns. You kill before you are killed.
COMMANDANT=>You will see the enemy is having small boy soldiers, too, who can kill before they can even speak.
COMMANDANT=>I have seen them do things that are even making the Devil fall to his knee to beg for mercy.
COMMANDANT=>Have you killed a man before?
COMMANDANT=>You will. Today.
AGU=>Yes, sah.
AIDE=>Commandant.
COMMANDANT=>You will destroy anything that threatens us. As I would anything that threatens you, understand?
COMMANDANT=>Two-I-C, report.
HOPE=>Don't worry, killing is easy.
CHICKEN LEGS=>Besides, you already eating a man.
AGU=>What do you mean?
CHICKEN LEGS=>What do you think was that ball of garri, the one you are eating in initiation?
HOPE=>In an ambush you don't make a sound. You get injured, you don't make a sound. You see a snake, you don't make a sound. You get bitten by a snake, you don't make a sound. You shut up! You take it!
AGU=>They are calling you Strika?
AGU=>Are you liking war?
AGU=>Are you liking killing?
AGU=>Is it easying to be doing?
AGU=>Are you fearing death?
AGU=>Are you having parent?
AGU=>I am still having mother. Somewhere.
AGU=>What is that you are chewing on?
AGU=>Are you liking Commandant?
AGU=>Are you stupid?
AGU=>Why are you not talking, then?
GRIOT=>Morale booster.
HOPE=>It is good juju, making you stronger and braver.
AGU=>It is tasting like licking rock. And eating pencil.
HOPE=>Shhh. They are coming.
AGU=>I am almost laughing and almost dying, even though I am not feeling like laughing. Inside my stomach and heart it is feeling like fire from a pepper. I am only thinking about what is going to be happening.
ARMY CORPORAL=>Please do not shoot us!
COMMANDANT=>On the floor!
PREACHER=>Agu, where is the fucking ammunition?
COMMANDANT=>Disarm and disrobe them!
COMMANDANT=>Agu, come here, enh. Come here right now. Come here. These are the dogs who killed your father.
COMMANDANT=>Agu, you will kill this man.
ARMY CORPORAL=>Please, Sah. I am an engineering student from the university in the capital. I am supposed to be fixing bridges, not be a soldier.
ARMY CORPORAL=>Please don't be killing me. Just be making me your prisoner. Please, I can be helping you.
HOPE=>Sah!
COMMANDANT=>Open it.
GRIOT=>What is it?
COMMANDANT=>No, no, this won't do.
AIDE=>A pistol?
CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER=>That is too easy.
TWO-I-C=>Why not the cutlass?
CSO=>Does he have the strength?
COMMANDANT=>Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to the ground.
COMMANDANT=>Agu. See this thirsty goat. These are the tyrants who murdered your father. Now look at him.
COMMANDANT=>Remember what they have taken from you. Remember your suffering and turn it into hate for them.
COMMANDANT=>God and the spirit of your Father is wanting you to kill him.
COMMANDANT=>Like this. Just bring this hand up and knock him well well.
COMMANDANT=>Use all of your force, imagine the blade sinking deep into him like chopping a coconut.
COMMANDANT=>Yes! That is how you are dealing with the NRC. Do it again! And again and again until he shuts up.
COMMANDANT=>Watch his blood, Agu. That is justice. That is what God wanted.
AGU=>Mother, I have kill a man.
AGU=>It is the bad sin and I am feeling like I am dying inside, like each breath can be my last and my heart will stop its beating. But I am knowing, too, it is the right thing to be doing.
COMMANDANT=>Always keep it with you.
TWO-I-C=>If you are losing it, then I will be losing you.
COMMANDANT=>You are my Special Guards now. Both of you.
COMMANDANT=>CSO. Take note and act accordingly.
CSO=>Suh.
COMMANDANT=>Agu and Strika are now my Special Guards.
CSO=>Yes, suh. Special Guards.
AGU=>Always be keeping it. If you are losing it, then they will be losing you.
COMMANDANT=>Gentlemen! Cover! Cover!
TWO-I-C=>Cover!
AGU=>Botu, botu, botu.
COMMANDANT=>...ooh, and they are having so many foods to be eating...
COMMANDANT=>...chicken, and cow, and goat, and vegetable, and fruit, any kind of fish you are wanting because the fishermen are always bringing everything from the sea. There is nothing they are not having in this place...
COMMANDANT=>The best thing this town, this town of abundant resources, is all the womens.
COMMANDANT=>Ah, woman in this place are just too beautiful. If you just see women here, before you are even knowing it, your soldier is standing at full `tenshun. They are having breasts so soft and so round that their clothes are rejoicing to be holding them. And they are having bottoms with specs so nice that anytime they are sitting down, the ground is also rejoicing. They are knowing well well how to make a man feel good with their kissing and loving, kai! The last time I am in this place, enh, my soldier is hurting too much for me to even be easing myself.
COMMANDANT=>You all will see, because that is where we are going, gentlemen. You will see it all with your own eyes.
TWO-I-C=>Commandant, sir!
COMMANDANT=>Who is this?
TWO-I-C=>Refugees, sir. They say the PLF and the NRC took their village three days ago. They killed most, but let these ones go.
COMMANDANT=>Well, let us be giving their village back, huh?
HOPE=>See what the PLF does to you?
COMMANDANT=>Two-I-C?
TWO-I-C=>Roger.
COMMANDANT=>Report.
TWO-I-C=>We are facing heavy fire, suh.
COMMANDANT=>Can you take the bridge?
TWO-I-C=>I don't know, suh.
COMMANDANT=>Explain.
TWO-I-C=>It's very difficult, suh. Our men are fighting bravely but-
COMMANDANT=>But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task.
TWO-I-C=>We need support, suh. The men's spirts are low, suh.
COMMANDANT=>Sustain.
COMMANDANT=>Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this.
COMMANDANT=>This is a very special device, you can be seeing the enemy with it, even when they are hiding.
COMMANDANT=>You see?
COMMANDANT=>It's magic. I need volunteers! Who has heart? Who wants to fight with me? Who isn't afraid of bullets!?
COMMANDANT=>Chicken Legs, go!
COMMANDANT=>These bullets?
COMMANDANT=>They are nothing. No one can touch us!
COMMANDANT=>Are you afraid?
COMMANDANT=>Moove it! Gentlemen! Moooooove it!
COMMANDANT=>No retreat! No surrender! Men dropping! Men moving!
COMMANDANT=>Agu, let me be see your aim, hit that man.
COMMANDANT=>Agu, it is on safety, what was Two- I-C teaching you?
AGU=>To always be leaving it off.
COMMANDANT=>Off. How will you be firing quickly if it is in safety? Enh? Listen.
COMMANDANT=>Like that.
AGU=>What?
COMMANDANT=>Sit.
COMMANDANT=>You fought bravely today, Agu.
AGU=>Thank you, sah.
COMMANDANT=>You see what happens when the men listen to me?
AGU=>Yes, sah.
COMMANDANT=>You are wanting to know how to be leading?
AGU=>No, sah. I am happying to be following you, sah.
COMMANDANT=>That is good, Agu, because there is no learning to be leading. Some men is born to leading, other is born to following, and other is only waiting to be dying.
AGU=>I am following you, sah.
COMMANDANT=>No, Agu. You are different. You are reminding me of me when I was a little boy, and this means you are borning to be leader. But even the best leader Agu, must first be learning to be good follower. Sometimes I even have to be following the Supreme Commander, if when I am not agreeing.
AGU=>Yes, sah. I am a good follower, sah.
COMMANDANT=>You are seeing this place. Supreme Commander is saying this is important. So it is important for me then.
COMMANDANT=>If we get this place, then we can go to Taro. Is that where your mother is?
AGU=>I am thinking she is in the Capital, sah.
COMMANDANT=>After Goodblood greets us, we all will be going to the Capital, that is a certainty.
COMMANDANT=>I am wanting to be helping you more than the others, Agu.
COMMANDANT=>But do not be telling anyone I am helping you like this, this will be our secret. Can you be keeping this secret, Agu?
AGU=>Yes, sah.
COMMANDANT=>Then be saying it.
AGU=>I can be keeping this secret, sah.
COMMANDANT=>In this family where I am being father, we cannot have the other children getting jealous, Agu!
COMMANDANT=>Kneel down in front of me. You do me this thing.
COMMANDANT=>I am not punishing you, Agu. I am helping you, to care for you.
COMMANDANT=>This is what commanding officer is supposed to be doing to his best boy soldier. Play with him, cherish him, protect him, enh?
COMMANDANT=>Touch my soldier, Agu, with your mouth. This is a command. You took an oath to obey, and now obey.
AGU=>Strika. He is my only friend, Mother. His eye are too red, his teeth are too brown, his head is too too big, but he is my friend even if he is looking too ugly.
COMMANDANT=>No one in the land we are going is your friend. They are the farmers who feed your enemy.
COMMANDANT=>The farmers' wives whose breasts feed babies who will grow to join the enemy ranks, whose wombs breed more of them.
COMMANDANT=>This is the nature of the place we are going. The homeland of the collaborators and traitors. Our people's blood has flowed for year. Now must their blood flow, too. Let us pray to the spirits and God.
COMMANDANT=>God, be guiding us in everything we are about to be doing. Give us the strength to fulfill your justice.
AGU=>My gun is making mark on my hand. I am servant to be doing whatever it says.
AGU=>God, help me to be doing the thing I am supposed to be doing.
VOICES WHISPER=>Devil be blessing you. Devil bless what you do.
PREACHER=>This way...
AGU=>What is wrong with them?
AGU=>What is wrong with them? Why are they crying?
PREACHER=>Commandant won't let them go with him into battle.
AGU=>Where is this battle?
AGU=>God, there is nothing to be keeping you from watching what we are doing.
AGU=>Mother?
AGU=>I am not recognizing you.
AGU=>I am not bad boy. I am not...
AGU=>You are not my mother! And you, you are not my sister!
AGU=>Enough!
WOMAN=>God, please take my daughter safely to heaven. Please Lord I am begging to You.
WOMAN=>Devil bless you! Devil born you!
AGU=>Devil is not blessing me. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
AGU=>You are not my sister.
AGU=>You are not my mother.
COMMANDANT=>See, now it is your time to eat.
CSO=>This is for you, sah.
TWO-I-C=>From the Supreme Commander? What does it say?
COMMANDANT=>He is summoning us.
COMMANDANT=>Load up!
CSO=>Where do I instruct the drivers to take us?
COMMANDANT=>To Taro -- The Town of Abundant Resources.
TWO-I-C=>Did he state the reason?
COMMANDANT=>No.
PREACHER=>Pardon me, sah.
COMMANDANT=>What is happening to this one?
TWO-I-C=>A piece of his own RPG is hitting his temple.
PREACHER=>What do we do with them?
COMMANDANT=>Leave one living. Tell him to run north, to the next village, and to the next village after that, tell him to tell everyone that soon we come. This is just the beginning.
COMMANDANT=>Home, Agu.
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER=>Halt! Enemy or friend?!
PREACHER=>Friend!
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER=>Drop your arms to be recognized!
PREACHER=>We are NDF.
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER=>Who is your Commander?
COMMANDANT=>I am.
COMMANDANT=>What kind of welcome is this, enh, for a hero battalion?
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER=>I am not having instructions to be receiving you. I will radio HQ. Hold ground.
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER=>I have instructions to take you to HQ immediately. The Supreme Commander, he is awaiting you.
AGU=>These people do not run.
AGU=>Maybe they are not seeing us because they are spirits. This is death's hometown.
DEPUTY=>Commandant. Welcome.
COMMANDANT=>Thank you Deputy.
COMMANDANT=>I have been asked to leave my men on the edge of town.
DEPUTY=>We apologize for the inconvenience. We do not want to alarm the population by the arrival of such a large force.
COMMANDANT=>When can they enter? I have-
DEPUTY=>I do not know Goodblood's plan for you. I assure you, you will know A- S-A-P.
DEPUTY=>You will wait here.
COMMANDANT=>You will bring something to drink for us. Water.
DEPUTY=>Certainly.
AGU=>I am looking at him, and I am seeing he is not happy to be waiting.
AGU=>And I am seeing these people entering with more than they are having when they are leaving and I am wondering why they are leaving their things behind and if I should be telling them.
AGU=>And with every person that is coming, and every person that is going, I am seeing anger on Commandant's face grow.
DEPUTY=>Supreme Commander is so very upset to keep you waiting. Please, follow me.
DEPUTY=>Please sit, I will be with you shortly.
COMMANDANT=>What is this? This is just another room. Where is our water?
AGU=>Give us water! Give us water, now!
DEPUTY=>Commandant.
DEPUTY=>The Supreme Commander felt ill and has gone home for the evening.
DEPUTY=>But he invites you to his home first appointment in the morning.
COMMANDANT=>Where are you putting us to be sleeping?
DEPUTY=>I hope this room, with the air conditioning, will be sufficient. Thank you, Gentlemen.
DEPUTY=>Commandant, I trust you rested well. I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your Battalion this morning.
TWO-I-C=>Thank you, Deputy.
GOODBLOOD=>At ease Gentlemen. At ease...
GOODBLOOD=>Commandant.
COMMANDANT=>Supreme Commander, sah.
GOODBLOOD=>I must apologize for yesterday, so much busy-ness these days, it's worn me down.
COMMANDANT=>I'm sorry you were feeling weak, sah.
GOODBLOOD=>I see your family has grown.
GOODBLOOD=>They will want to eat while we talk. Unless you are hungry, too?
COMMANDANT=>I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a plate.
GOODBLOOD=>Two-I-C, you stay. Deputy?
COMMANDANT=>What is this, Chief? Why are you making me wait?
GOODBLOOD=>It is your duty.
COMMANDANT=>Something has changed, what is it?
COMMANDANT=>We are not taking the Capital?
GOODBLOOD=>Protecting our people remains the priority. As you know, the world is becoming aware of this war, now. No one will escape judgment when it is over.
COMMANDANT=>Chief, to protect our people, we have the force and the momentum, why stop, why wait?
GOODBLOOD=>It used to be survival of the strongest, the strong dominating by brute force, but now it is survival of the wittiest and the decisions we make have far deeper consequences.
COMMANDANT=>Then what is your plan for my battalion? Are you not making me General?
GOODBLOOD=>I am not. I am giving your battalion to Two-I-C, Commandant. That is why I brought you here.
GOODBLOOD=>And you, I will promote to Deputy Secretary of Defense. Effective immediately. I hope you will accept and act accordingly.
TWO-I-C COMMANDANT=>Thank you, suh! May we speak alone, chief?
TWO-I-C=>I promise to perform my duties to the fullest pot-
COMMANDANT=>Two-I-C get out.
GOODBLOOD=>I want the ceremony of change over tomorrow, so that Two-I-C... I mean newly, Commandant in absence, may take the battalion back out for security details. As you know, and much thanks to you, we have the NRC on their heels. With support from the UN and ECOMOD, the battle now is for public image. Two-I-C and other commanders like him will provide that for us until the junta crumbles.
COMMANDANT=>You are taking my battalion?
GOODBLOOD=>Commandant, your battalion is my battalion. One of hundreds across the nation. I will remind you that you are a soldier, you are subject to orders, you listen and obey orders.
COMMANDANT=>And for my services, Chief? I built this battalion. I am their father.
GOODBLOOD=>That honor remains yours.
COMMANDANT=>And payment? What share of the resources will I have, for this honor?
GOODBLOOD=>If you are wanting to be a man of industry and resources, then find a job with a mining company. I am offering you something else entirely, an education.
GOODBLOOD=>Do not forget, your most important duty is obedience. Your first duty is obedience...
GOODBLOOD=>your second duty, obedience. Your third, obedience. Everything is obedience. Without obedience you have nothing. Have you forgotten yourself?
COMMANDANT=>I have not Chief. I am not a politician, I am a soldier.
COMMANDANT=>I will have one last night with them.
TRIPOD=>Move on!
TRIPOD=>Sah?!
COMMANDANT=>Assemble the C/Os, take the troops and bivouac outside of town. I am taking Two-I-C with some of the boys to celebrate.
TRIPOD=>Yes, suh!
TWO-I-C=>Where are we going?
COMMANDANT=>You will see. You will like it.
COMMANDANT=>If you and Strika are my bodyguard, then if I am going, you are also going, you are hearing me?
AGU=>Imagination TV.
MADAME=>Enh, so you come?
COMMANDANT=>Ma. Bring something that will satisfy my soldiers and my soldier!
COMMANDANT=>Bring beer! Bring soda! Bring it all!
MADAME=>Get up you, can't you see we are having guest?
YOUNG GIRL=>The beer is warm.
COMMANDANT=>How is it warm?
YOUNG GIRL=>No ice.
COMMANDANT=>No ice!?
YOUNG GIRL=>No light.
COMMANDANT=>Bring the drink. We will be drinking it even if it is warm.
TWO-I-C=>Commandant. Permission to be dismissed. I want to be going to be checking on my men-
COMMANDANT=>Negative. You'll be staying here so we can celebrate you. In fact, Mama, why don't you bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Co-mman-dan-tttt. Who's your Commandant?
TRIPOD=>You, sir!
COMMANDANT=>But you have one special for Two-I- C?
MADAME=>No problem. No problem.
MADAME=>No problem.
COMMANDANT=>Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya.
MADAME=>If it is woman you are wanting, leave this one. I am having plenty womens in the back if you are having plenty moneys to be giving me, for a special girl.
COMMANDANT=>Don't you be worrying about money, ma. Bring me a good girl, you know my specifications.
AGU=>Auntie! Auntie, bring us some chips!
MADAME=>This small thing borned yesterday trying to order things around, enh!
MADAME=>We are having enough for you men, but there is no more girls for the little boys.
COMMANDANT=>What is happening? Huh? What happened?
TWO-I-C=>You did this.
COMMANDANT=>What happened to my man? Wh- What happened here?
GIRL=>I was just playing with his gun, and it just went off. I don't know what happened. I don't know- I'm sorry.
TWO-I-C=>You did this. You did this.
COMMANDANT=>Relax, relax, relax! You did this! You did this!
GIRL COMMANDANT=>You thought you were shooting I didn't mean to. me!
GIRL COMMANDANT=>No, no, no! You thought it was me?
GIRL COMMANDANT=>I didn't mean to. I'm so Are you trying to kill me, sorry. and to kill my men? Huh!
GIRL=>She told me...
MADAME=>She told you? It was an accident!
COMMANDANT=>Go!
COMMANDANT=>Let's go! Let's go! Enh! Pick him up! I want you to take all their women! All of them!
AGU=>His spirit is fighting to be let free from his body. It is hurting because you are thinking about it. If you are stopping to think about it, there is nothing to be feeling. The thinking is the hurting.
TWO-I-C=>You are just a boy.
TWO-I-C=>Do you know you are just a boy?
TWO-I-C=>Was this all for nothing?
AGU=>It is like God is turning his gaze on Two-I-C.
COMMANDANT=>Agu? Is that you.
COMMANDANT=>Agu. Come. Sit down with me.
COMMANDANT=>It is dangerous times now, Agu. Can't be trusting nobody. That is why it is always good to be sleeping with one eye open. And that is why I have you and Strika.
TRIPOD=>Goodblood is asking for you.
COMMANDANT=>Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you.
COMMANDANT=>Sometimes I am.
AGU=>Two-I-C is dead.
AGU=>It is taking Two-I-C all day to be dying, and then he is dying when the moon is full and the night is shining like silver.
COMMANDANT=>You are my new Two-I-C.
AGU=>The the only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying.
COMMANDANT=>This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong!
MEN=>Strong and proud!
COMMANDANT=>That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out.
AGU=>Mother. If this war is ever ending I am thinking, I cannot be going back to doing child thing.
AGU=>We are just wild animals now with no place to be going.
PREACHER=>Tripod, Hope!
AGU=>Bullet is just eating everything, leaf, tree, ground, person -- eating them -- just making person to bleed everywhere... so much blood.
AGU=>Strika? Strika! We are having to go or they will be leaving us.
AGU=>Let's go.
AGU=>Strika! We have to be going. Stand up and let's go!
AGU=>What is wrong with you?
AGU=>What is wrong?
AGU=>I am wanting to say to Strika, I am tired too.
AGU=>I am tired, and so the words are not coming out of my mouth.
AGU=>I will be an old man before this war is over...
AGU=>Enh... Strika, a song. Music. Like my mother sings...
AGU=>Strika?
AGU=>Strika?
AGU=>Mother, your song is making my body to move and I am not having to think anymore, not about Strika, not about this war, not about any of the thing that are jumping into my head.
PREACHER=>Ammo. Find me some fucking bullets to be shooting, Agu.
AGU=>He is dead.
PREACHER=>Who is dead?
AGU=>Him.
AGU=>I want to be going to that person who is singing and taking all of the sound so I can be keeping it in my pocket, to be having it for myself.
AGU=>I am wanting to lie down on the warm ground with my eye closed and the smell of mud in my nose, just like Strika.
AGU=>I am wanting to feel how the ground is wet all around my body so that if I am sweating, I am feeling like it is the ground sweating through me.
AGU=>And I am wanting to stay in this same place forever, never moving for anything, just waiting waiting until dust is piling on me and grasses is covering me and insect is making their home in the space between my teeths.
AGU=>One onina tree will be growing from my body, so wide that its trunk is separating night and day and so tall that its top leaf is tickling the moon until the man living there is smiling.
AGU=>Commandant, suh. We are out of bullets.
COMMANDANT=>Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our friend.
COMMANDANT=>It was not supposed to be the way it has come to be, Agu.
AGU=>They are dead.
COMMANDANT=>Who are dead?
COMMANDANT=>EVERYONE-
COMMANDANT=>Everyone betrays you, eventually. But, I will always look out for you, Agu. I will look out for you because you are my son.
COMMANDANT=>And a son always protects his father.
PREACHER=>Out of my way.
PREACHER=>I am needing to be speaking with you Commandant.
COMMANDANT=>What is all this noise?
PREACHER=>We are leaving, sah.
COMMANDANT=>Who and who is leaving?
COMMANDANT=>Who is leaving?
COMMANDANT=>Two-I-C, go back to your post.
PREACHER=>No, Sah. We are going.
COMMANDANT=>You are the only one stupid standing in front of me.
PREACHER=>I am going, sah! I have no bullets, I cannot be shooting our enemy with no bullets. There is no gold, no money, nothing to be buying more bullets. So I am going.
ANOTHER NDF SOLDIER=>I am going too.
COMMANDANT=>I see. I see you are a big man now, Two-I-C. And where will you be going? You will surrender to the other NDF? No. They will eat you. And to the ECOMOD? That would be wiser, but, then what? Jail? War crimes? If they let you go, you think you will ever have it as good as you have it right now in this mud? You think that you will be able to just do what you want in "peace"?
COMMANDANT=>You all will go back to your towns, but they will fear you. Your families will not associate with you. You will be nobodies, with your poor, uneducated minds. And you will sit all day, and you will watch the sun rise and set, waiting with thousands of others for some big man to come along and say "I have some job for you."
COMMANDANT=>Orphans. You are all orphans like me. You think I will let you waste what little time you have left on this earth drinking black tea and playing draughts with your gun powder tea.
COMMANDANT=>Agu?
COMMANDANT=>What are you thinking?
COMMANDANT=>You want to kill me?
COMMANDANT=>You want to surrender?
COMMANDANT=>Then surrender.
COMMANDANT=>When you are poor and hungry with nothing to do with your nothing days, you will remember these days as your best. And know, one day I will call on you again. And you will come. Because you will remember this, and you will come running. Nobody has it better than us.
COMMANDANT=>Go!
AGU=>Sun, why are you even thinking to shine on this world. I am wanting to catch you in my hand, to be squeezing until the color is dripping out from you forever. That way everywhere it is always dark and nobody is ever having to see any of the terrible thing that is happening in this world.
AGU=>In heaven, it is always morning.
AGU=>I am not knowing how long I am staying here, but I am staying here for a long time -- some week, some month -- I am not knowing. All I am knowing is how it is feeling here.
AGU=>Sometimes I am eating even if I am not hungrying too much because I am fearing that the food is finishing for the next day.
AGU=>I am liking the clothes is clean and dry and it is not having any hole from bullet or blood from the last person who is wearing it.
FATHER FRIDAY=>Turn to God. Confession and Forgiveness and Resurrection, these are the things you need to know to bring the life back to your life...
AGU=>I am not knowing all what he is meaning. The only thing that is making sense to me is memory that I am having of another boy -- Strika - - sleeping next to me, so close because we are the only people protecting each other from all of the thing trying to kill us.
AGU=>The only thing I am knowing is the sound of people coughing and screaming, and the smell of going to toilet and dead body. And the feeling of the brown brown and djamba in my blood.
AGU=>Confession and Forgiveness and resurrection.
FATHER FRIDAY=>Above all, my boy. Have faith in God and trust in him because he is the one helping you to understand what these words mean. Do you have a Bible?
PREACHER=>They are not even paying us an allowance. How are we supposed to be living on this?
AGU=>Don't go Preacher.
AGU=>Yes, I am having Bible, but I am using to be holding my drawing down on my desk so the fan is not throwing them everywhere.
PREACHER=>They are saying they are needing soldier, fighting is what I am knowing and that is what I should be doing. You are sure you do not want to fight?
AGU=>Amy. She is always looking at me like looking at me is going to be helping me.
AMY=>Go on, try, try to talk about it...
AGU=>She thinks that my not speaking is because I can't be explaining myself like baby... but I am not like baby, I am like old man and she is like small girl because I am fighting in war and she is not even knowing what war is.
AMY=>Tell me what you are feeling, or, try to tell me what you are thinking.
AGU=>I am thinking about my future.
AMY=>Good, yes, good. And how do you see your future?
AGU=>Botu botu botu.
AMY=>Do you want to talk about some of your experiences?
AMY=>Okay. But it might make you feel better.
AGU=>I am seeing more terrible thing than ten thousand men and I am doing more terrible thing than twenty thousand men.
AGU=>So, if I am saying these thing that I do, then it will be making me to sadding too much and you too sadding to much in this life. I am wanting to be happy in this life because of everything I am seeing. I am just wanting to be happy.
AGU=>If I am telling this to you it will be making you to think that I am some sort of beast or devil. I am all of this thing. I am all of this thing, but I am also having mother and father and brother and sister once, and they were loving me.
