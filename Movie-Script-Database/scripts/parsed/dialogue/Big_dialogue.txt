MOM=>He had a birthday.
BILLY=>Yeah, I know. He'll be coming back real soon. Everything is going to be okay.
MOM=>Thanks.
BILLY=>Goodnight.
BILLY=>Right there. Sea Point Park, New York! Well?
JOSH=>Yes?
WOMAN=>They're waiting for you Mr. Baskin.
JOSH=>Thanks.
BILLY=>See you around.
JOSH=>There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.
PAUL=>Excuse me.
JOSH=>Paul.
PAUL=>I don't get it.
JOSH=>Well, it's a comic book that....
SUSAN=>See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. That's the point.
MR. M=>Terrific Susan.
SUSAN=>A kid makes his own decision.
MR. M=>This is really possible?
SUSAN=>Yeah. In fact, it's a very simple program. Isn't that right?
MAN=>So what happens when you run out of choices?
SUSAN=>Well, that's the great thing. You can just sell different adventures. Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.
MAN=>We could market this on a comic book rack.
JOSH=>I'll be right back.
MR. M=>How much would the unit cost?
SUSAN=>Well, our initial figure is around...around $7.00, with a retail cost of around $18.95.
PAUL=>You expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic book?
SUSAN=>I think a kid....Would you excuse me?
SUSAN=>Josh! Josh!
JOSH=>Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?
BILLY=>Sea Point Park? Josh!....Josh! Josh!...Yes!
SUSAN=>Excuse me. You know him? You know Josh?
BILLY=>Yeah.
SUSAN=>Look, you have to tell me where he went.
BILLY=>Who are you?
SUSAN=>I'm his girlfriend.
BILLY=>Billy Kopecky.
SUSAN=>Look, you have to tell me where he went. Where did he go? Please, tell me. Tell me!
JOSH=>Work! Damn it!....I wish I was a kid.
SUSAN=>Josh!
JOSH=>Susan!
SUSAN=>You know, you don't walk out on somebody! You don't just get up and leave and walk out like that! You don't do that!
JOSH=>I know. I know. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry but I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to say.
SUSAN=>Oh God. You got your wish.
JOSH=>I tried to tell you.
SUSAN=>I didn't listen, I guess. I didn't hear you...
JOSH=>I tried to tell you last night.
SUSAN=>...or want to...or how would I have...or even if I did listen, why would I know? Why would I know that?!
JOSH=>I've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to stay.
SUSAN=>What? What reason is that?
JOSH=>Well, you...Oh, come on. Don't cry.
SUSAN=>So, what are you? 15? 16?
JOSH=>I'm 13.
SUSAN=>Well, that explains it.
JOSH=>Maybe you could come with me.
SUSAN=>No. No.
JOSH=>Why not?
SUSAN=>I've been there before. It's hard enough the first time. You know what I mean? You don't know what I mean....Come on, I'll drive you home.
JOSH=>I'm sorry.
SUSAN=>No, I'll be okay. You'll be fine. In ten years, who knows? Maybe you should hold on to my number.
SUSAN=>So this is where you live. Which one is it?
JOSH=>The one right there.
SUSAN=>Oh. It's nice. I'm gonna miss you.
JOSH=>I'm gonna miss you, too.
SUSAN=>You won't even remember me.
JOSH=>Oh yes I will.
JOSH=>Mom? Hello!
MOM=>Josh? Josh! Josh! Oh my God! Oh, thank God you're home!
JOSH=>Oh Ma, I missed you all so much!
JOSH=>I'm just not good enough.
BILLY=>What are you talking about? You've been hitting the ball over the fence almost every time in stick ball. You just got to get used to a fatter bat.
JOSH=>You really think I could do it?
BILLY=>Yeah!
JOSH=>Come on. We'll hit some after supper.
