DUSSANDER=>All right. All right. I'm coming. Let it go!
DUSSANDER=>A boy. I don't need anything, boy. Can't you read? I thought all American boys could read. Don't be a nuisance, now. Good day.
TODD=>Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander.
DUSSANDER=>Give me my newspaper.
TODD=>Sure thing, Mr. Dussander.
DUSSANDER=>My name is Denker. See? Denker. Perhaps you cannot read after all. What a pity. Good day.
TODD=>Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44. Then you went to Patin.
TODD=>After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires. From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know. No one does. But in 1965, you popped up in West Berlin, where they almost got you.
DUSSANDER=>Listen, boy. I don't know what is the matter with you. But I don't have time for this game. Now, get out of here before I call the police.
TODD=>Call them if you want.
DUSSANDER=>Fine.
TODD=>It's okay by me Herr Kommandant. I'm sure the police would love to meet the "Blood- fiend of Patin."
DUSSANDER=>You get away from this house, God damn you! I'll beat you all the way home.
TODD=>After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I did. Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If you want to call the cops, go right ahead. I'II wait on the steps.
DUSSANDER=>You'll do no such thing.
TODD=>I won't? Listen, old man, if I want to start screaming right here, I will. If I want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then I will. I will do what ever I want. Do you understand? But if you like, I could come in for a minute. We could talk.
DUSSANDER=>I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home.
DUSSANDER=>Is that what you want, to come into my home? So be it. There is no arguing with crazy people.
DUSSANDER=>My wife. She died in 1955 of lung disease. At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen. I was heartbroken.
DUSSANDER=>Stop that!
TODD=>Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the lampshades out of human skin?
DUSSANDER=>Now I don't know what you're talking about.
TODD=>Sure you do, Mr. Dussander.
DUSSANDER=>Denker. Denker. Denker. You don't listen, boy. The television has fried your brain.
TODD=>Your hands are shaking.
DUSSANDER=>Yes, they're shaking. I'm old. We all shake. You are most tiresome, and rude. Now if you have a point I wish you'd come to it.
TODD=>We're in no rush. If I thought you had plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know you don't...
DUSSANDER=>You know nothing of my business --
TODD=>What business? You sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day. Except on Friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater. And twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping. You always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items.
DUSSANDER=>You have been following me?
TODD=>Of course, I followed you. You think I normally go around to peoples' houses and accuse them of being Nazi fugitives?
DUSSANDER=>Perhaps for me you made an exception.
TODD=>No, for you I had to be sure. For Kurt Dussander I had to be absolutely certain. ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here.
DUSSANDER=>Oh, yes, I see now. As I am this ex-Nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where I offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish men, of course, which I keep buried in the basement. Isn't that right, boy? Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I have no money. If I did I might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.
TODD=>I don't need money. You don't have any anyway. At least, I don't think so. You probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country. A good American passport is expensive on the black market, that I know.
DUSSANDER=>Do you? Good for you.
TODD=>Yes, I do. I know it all, Dussander. You're my One Great Interest.
DUSSANDER=>Your what?
TODD=>My One Great Interest. Well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something I learned back in eighth grade. Our teacher, Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our One Great Interest in life. You know, the thing that would really grab us. Once we did that, everything would fall into place. Like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth-century postcards. I guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher. Anyway, she told us to start thinking about it. So I did, but nothing happened. Until the following summer, in Ronny Pegler's garage. That's where I found it.
RONNY=>One of these has three girls doing it at the same time.
RONNY=>I got it! Check this out. ...Todd, look.
TODD=>Hang on a sec.
TODD=>It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd never seen, stuff they never put in the books anymore, especially the ones they give us to read. And here were stacks of them.
TODD=>It... grabbed me. It was just like Miss Harmon said. I couldn't believe it. But there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the ...the way they saluted each other. But what am I telling you for? You know more about this stuff than anybody.
DUSSANDER=>Yes, what are you telling me for?
TODD=>Then last year I wrote my big term paper on Dachau. I got an A+. It was the only A+ she gave. I mean I always do real well. A's on everything. That's why I'm accelerated.
DUSSANDER=>Accelerated?
TODD=>You know, accelerated. I skipped two grades, second and ninth. I didn't need them. That's why I'm already a junior.
DUSSANDER=>I see...
TODD=>Some kids resent me for it. That's not important. Anyway, my paper really floored my history teacher. I guess because I got through all those books without throwing up. But I learned something. I learned that when you talk about the camps now, you have to remember to sound really disgusted. I mean, you can't just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that. If I tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in.
RONNY=>Todd, your mom's on the phone. She says you have to come home for dinner. ...Todd?
TODD=>What?
RONNY=>Your mom's on the phone.
TODD=>Nowadays you have to... soften it.
DUSSANDER=>Why do I care about this?
TODD=>Because, I don't want it softened.
DUSSANDER=>I am sure you trouble your parents to no end.
TODD=>Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance. That's what my dad says.
DUSSANDER=>You told your parents about me, then?
TODD=>You think I'm crazy?
DUSSANDER=>I think you're crackers, but go on. I'm riveted.
DUSSANDER=>What are you doing?
TODD=>And then it happened... I was on my way to the library. It was raining...
TODD=>You climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle. Just like you were examining a new batch of inmates. I don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way. And under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella. But what really did it, what really set me off was the coat. You were wearing this long black rain coat. My mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at Patin. You in your S.S. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.
TODD=>It was incredible.
DUSSANDER=>All of this... because of a rain coat?
TODD=>Well, it wasn't that easy. I mean, I had to really check up on it. And every picture of you in those books is forty years old, at least. I went back to the library to find the picture. And then I matched it with the photos I took.
DUSSANDER=>You took photographs of me?
TODD=>Yeah, I got this little camera. Fits right in the palm of my hand.
DUSSANDER=>Clever boy.
TODD=>But even then I couldn't be sure. I needed real proof. So I went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what you're supposed to look for and then dusted your mailbox while you were at the movies. Pretty smart, huh?
DUSSANDER=>You... put dust on my mailbox? For fingerprints? You took photographs of me? What else did you do?... I don't believe any of this.
TODD=>I already had a copy of your fingerprints. They're on your want sheet from the Israeli government. It's on database at UC Irvine. Can you believe that?
DUSSANDER=>Bourbon.
DUSSANDER=>Would you care for a drink, boy?
TODD=>Sure, you got a Coke?
DUSSANDER=>No Kok.
TODD=>Milk?
DUSSANDER=>Milk.
TODD=>It takes eight good matches, they're called compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get accepted in court.
DUSSANDER=>Is that right?
TODD=>Yeah, there were two sets of prints. The first I figured were the mailman's. Once I knew what I was looking for, yours were easy to spot.
DUSSANDER=>You should be a detective.
TODD=>Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it.
TODD=>I found fourteen compares.
TODD=>You have some.
DUSSANDER=>Good Gott.
DUSSANDER=>You see? It's milk, boy. From Dairylee Farms. On the carton is a picture of a smiling cow.
DUSSANDER=>...And two missing children. Boy what you have done, I have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand, what you have done is a violation.
TODD=>A violation?
DUSSANDER=>Yes.
TODD=>Kind of like those experiments with the decompression chamber. Now, that was a violation, Dussander.
DUSSANDER=>That fucking name. Enough of that. I demand it.
TODD=>You what?
DUSSANDER=>I demand --
TODD=>You demand nothing from me. Ever. Get it?
DUSSANDER=>Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for the last time. My name is Arthur Denker. It has never been anything else. It has never even been Americanized. If you must know, and apparently you must, I was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. I did serve in the reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, when I was first married, I supported Hitler. I supported him most, I suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...Would you like a cigarette?
TODD=>No. My dad used to smoke. Mom made him quit. Now he's addicted to Nicorette... that's nicotine gum.
DUSSANDER=>Nicotine gum.
DUSSANDER=>Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. He even gave his dog, Blondi, a death capsule. On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the Americans. I remember that a private named Gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. I wept.
DUSSANDER=>I was interned at Essen where I was treated very well. We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio and when Goering committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk. When I was released, I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works until I retired in 1963. In 1967 I emigrated here, to California, and became a U.S. Citizen. I am as American as you are. I
