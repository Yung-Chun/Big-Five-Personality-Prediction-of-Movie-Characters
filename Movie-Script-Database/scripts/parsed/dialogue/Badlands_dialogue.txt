KIT=>I'll give you a dollar to eat this collie.
CATO=>I'm not going to eat him for a dollar... I don't think he's a collie, either. Some kind of dog.
KIT=>Watch your heads.
KIT=>Hey. Woody. Gimme a cigarette.
KIT=>Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette. Ever notice he don't talk much?
BUM=>Nah. they wouldn't fit.
KIT=>How do you know? You hadn't tried them on yet.
BUM=>Nah.
KIT=>Gimme a dollar for them... Cost twenty new.
KIT=>Why don't you see if they fit you?
KIT=>I throwed enough trash for today, Cato.... I'll see you In the morning.
CATO=>Catch!
KIT=>What do you mean?
KIT=>Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
HOLLY=>No.
KIT=>Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
HOLLY=>Holly.
KIT=>Listen, Holly. you want to take a walk with me?
HOLLY=>What for?
KIT=>Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
KIT=>Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like druthers, doesn't it?
HOLLY=>It's okay.
KIT=>Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
HOLLY=>You still in school?
KIT=>Nah, I got me a job.
KIT=>Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
HOLLY=>That's my father. I got to run.
KIT=>Hey. wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
HOLLY=>Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
HOLLY=>Can I be honest?
KIT=>Sure.
HOLLY=>Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
HOLLY=>Yeah.
HOLLY=>Nothing.
HOLLY=>Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
FATHER=>Who was that?
HOLLY=>Just some boy.
HOLLY=>Is that going to kill the grass?
HOLLY=>You got some on my feet.
FATHER=>What'd he want?
HOLLY=>Just wanted to know if we needed any yardwork done... I said no, and for him not to bother us.
KIT=>I used to throw trash for the City.
CLERK=>You lost that one?
KIT=>Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
CLERK=>What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
KIT=>I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
CLERK=>Well, I think we could find you something... working cattle over at the pens.
KIT=>Well. what the hell. Just hope there's a breeze.
KIT=>Hi.
HOLLY=>Well, stop the world.
KIT=>Quit my job.
HOLLY=>Great.
KIT=>Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
HOLLY=>Spanish.
HOLLY=>Something mi trabajo.
KIT=>Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
HOLLY=>I don't know.
KIT=>Well, at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots any more.
KIT=>You want to go for a ride?
HOLLY=>Well, I got homework.
KIT=>Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk.
KIT=>Everybody did that, the whole town'd be a mess ... Hi.
KIT=>You're a redhead.
HOLLY=>I know.
KIT=>Anybody ever call you "Red"?
HOLLY=>Yeah, but I don't like it.
KIT=>Why not?
HOLLY=>Just don't... I've got a headache.
KIT=>Yeah?
HOLLY=>What a nice place.
HOLLY=>And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
KIT=>It's your play.
HOLLY=>My stomach's growling.
KIT=>There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
HOLLY=>No.
KIT=>Somebody else is going to get it.
HOLLY=>I don't care.
KIT=>Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
HOLLY=>Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
KIT=>Yeah.
HOLLY=>Is that all there is to it?
KIT=>Yeah.
HOLLY=>Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
KIT=>Don't ask me.
HOLLY=>Well. I'm glad it's over... For a while I was afraid I might die before it happened... Had a wreck, some deal like that.
KIT=>You see where that tree fell in the water?
HOLLY=>Yeah... The river must've washed the roots away... You don't care about anything I say, though.
KIT=>You know what I think?
HOLLY=>What?
KIT=>That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
HOLLY=>But it would hurt.
KIT=>Well, that's the point, stupid.
HOLLY=>Don't call me stupid.
KIT=>Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
KIT=>Or maybe one that's lighter.
KIT=>Sure is pretty.
FATHER=>What'd you come out here for?
KIT=>I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
KIT=>You know Holly... well. she means a lot to me, sir.
KIT=>You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
FATHER=>Is that right?
KIT=>Yeah.
KIT=>It okay me leaning on your Willys here?
KIT=>Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
FATHER=>Well, it's not good enough. Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
KIT=>She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
FATHER=>You get out of here. I don't want you hanging around any more. You understand?
FATHER=>You're something.
KIT=>Takes all kinds, sir.
KIT=>Hi.
FATHER=>What're you doing?
KIT=>I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
FATHER=>What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
KIT=>Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
FATHER=>Okay, boy, I'm turning you over to the authorities.
KIT=>What for?
FATHER=>For coming onto my property... With a gun.
KIT=>No, you're not either.
KIT=>Cause I can't allow it.
KIT=>Hey... Hey, wait a minute.
KIT=>Suppose I shot you. How'd that be? Huh?
KIT=>You want to hear what it sounds like?
KIT=>Hey, where you going?
HOLLY=>Daddy... This is Holly... Are you going to be okay?
KIT=>I came in the front.
HOLLY=>How bad off is he?
HOLLY=>We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
KIT=>He don't need a doctor.
HOLLY=>Are you sure?
KIT=>You don't believe me, see for yourself.
KIT=>I found a toaster.
KIT=>Listen, honey. I don't want to...
HOLLY=>Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
KIT=>You said that once already... Too late now.
HOLLY=>Why?
KIT=>They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
HOLLY=>Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
KIT=>Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
KIT=>Oh... You want to call the police, that's fine. Just won't be so hot for me.
KIT=>My girl Holly and I have decided to kill ourselves, same way I did her dad. Big decision huh? Well, the reasons are obvious, and I don't have time to go into them right now... One thing, though... He was provoking me when I popped him. That's what it was like, a POP.
KIT=>Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us. You can't deny we've had fun, though. Which is more than I can say for some.... Mmmm. that's the end of the message. I run out of things to say... Thank you.
KIT=>How you doing?
KIT=>Yeah, me too.
KIT=>Take a break. Red... Life of Riley, huh?
HOLLY=>One of the chickens died last night.
HOLLY=>I almost stepped on him.
HOLLY=>"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
KIT=>He was nervous.
HOLLY=>"Time passed. At dawn, just before six, Torstein came hurrying down from the masthead. He could see a whole line of small palm- clad islands far ahead..."
KIT=>Holly!
KIT=>Get in the car, Red.
KIT=>We don't need this.
KIT=>How you doing, Cato?
CATO=>Not bad.
KIT=>Take that sombitch.
KIT=>What you been doing?
CATO=>Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
KIT=>Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
KIT=>Where'd you get them antlers?
KIT=>Oh, Cato, I want you to meet my girl, Holly Sargis.
HOLLY=>Did you hear the one about the guy in the nuthouse that went around naked, with only a hat and gloves on, and this nurse came up to him and said, "Hey, what... You can't walk around that way," and the guy says, "What's the matter? Nobody comes around here." Anyway, the nurse says, "What do you have the hat and gloves on for, then?" And the guy says, "Well, you never know."
KIT=>Isn't that funny?
CATO=>Yeah, I guess.
HOLLY=>Don't you ever get bored around here?
CATO=>Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
KIT=>That's what he told you, huh?
HOLLY=>What'd they look like?
KIT=>Let me finish my supper.
KIT=>We're thinking of going down to Texas. Holly wants to visit some of her people down there, but after that I don't know... They say Mexico's nice.
CATO=>Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
KIT=>Okay.
CATO=>I'll catch up with you.
KIT=>Okay.
HOLLY=>I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
KIT=>Put that down. It's dirty.
KIT=>Cato!
CATO=>The shovel's in the truck.
KIT=>Look at all this junk.
HOLLY=>How's he doing?
KIT=>I got him in the stomach.
HOLLY=>Is he upset?
KIT=>He didn't say anything to me about it.
KIT=>Bunch of junk.
KIT=>He stole that cage. I saw him doing it.
KIT=>Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
HOLLY=>Hi.
HOLLY=>That your spider in there? in that bottle?
CATO=>Yeah.
HOLLY=>What do you feed him?
CATO=>Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
HOLLY=>Does he bite?
CATO=>He never bit me.
BOY=>Hi. where's Cato?
KIT=>Well, he's gone.
BOY=>Gone? ... Where?
KIT=>He said not to tell.
KIT=>Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
BOY=>Well, I just need to pick up something in the house.
KIT=>No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
BOY=>What's going on?
KIT=>Can't afford to take chances.
KIT=>Let's us step out in this field here.
KIT=>Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
BOY=>Okay.
KIT=>You don't mind?
HOLLY=>Hi.
GIRL=>What's going to happen to Jack and me?
HOLLY=>You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
GIRL=>Okay.
HOLLY=>What's your friend's name?
GIRL=>Jack.
HOLLY=>You love him?
GIRL=>I don't know.
HOLLY=>I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
GIRL=>Yeah. I can imagine.
HOLLY=>Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
KIT=>Okay, you two, down in the cellar.
KIT=>You promise to stay down there for an hour?
BOY=>Yeah.
KIT=>You expect me to believe that?
BOY=>Yeah.
KIT=>I'm going to shut the door.
KIT=>Think I got 'em?
HOLLY=>I don't know.
KIT=>Well, I'm not going down there and look.
HOLLY=>We're in for it now... If they catch us.
HOLLY=>What'd you put him in there for?
KIT=>You tired?
HOLLY=>Yeah.
KIT=>Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
HOLLY=>I don't want a steak.
KIT=>Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
KIT=>They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards.
KIT=>Hi, I come to check the meter. My tools are in here.
KIT=>Oh, this Is Holly. She's from Texas.
KIT=>Excuse me.
KIT=>Hi.
RICH MAN=>Yes?
KIT=>This your place?
RICH MAN=>Yes.
KIT=>Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
RICH MAN=>No.
KIT=>Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
RICH MAN=>Stay as long as you like.
KIT=>Next time I ring that, it means time to clear out.
KIT=>Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always a chance you could learn something. Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoint of others. Consider the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority opinion once it's accepted. Course Holly and I've had fun, even if it has been rushed, and... so far we're doing fine. hadn't got caught. Excuse the grammar.
HOLLY=>Hi... Kit's downstairs playing with the dictaphone... Sometimes he acts like there's something wrong with his bean.
HOLLY=>Hope nothing ever goes wrong with mine.
RICH MAN=>Think he's crazy, huh?
HOLLY=>I don't know... He's kind of odd.
HOLLY=>Gosh, I like your house.
RICH MAN=>Thank you.
KIT=>Hi.
VISITOR=>Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
KIT=>Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
VISITOR=>Really?
KIT=>Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
VISITOR=>No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
KIT=>Well, he didn't have it last night.
KIT=>What's that?
VISITOR=>Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
KIT=>Sure.
KIT=>You have to excuse me now. I have to go back inside. Bye.
KIT=>We're out of here, Tex.
KIT=>Hi, whatcha doing?
RICH MAN=>Just thinking.
KIT=>Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
RICH MAN=>Yes.
KIT=>Listen, ah ... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
RICH MAN=>Fine.
KIT=>Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
KIT=>Okay, ma'am, let's go . . . come on.
KIT=>You're my friend, aren't you?
RICH MAN=>Yes.
KIT=>Okay, no monkey business then.
KIT=>Groceries.
KIT=>That guy could sell that list I gave him as a sample of my handwriting.
HOLLY=>Well, why you always walking behind me?
HOLLY=>Don't.
KIT=>Anybody ever done that to you before?
HOLLY=>No.
KIT=>Positive?
HOLLY=>Yes.
KIT=>Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
KIT=>That guy must pay through the nose to keep this place up... Lawn, the gas and electric... Bagworms. Plus the upkeep on the cars... Yeah, you get a little money in your pocket, you think all your problems are solved. Well, let me tell you, they're not.
HOLLY=>I'd like to get out of here.
KIT=>Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
HOLLY=>"Rumor Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
KIT=>I don't blame him.
HOLLY=>"Rumor Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact True, but not with each other."
HOLLY=>That's Montana over there.
KIT=>I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
HOLLY=>State bird's a meadowlark.
HOLLY=>Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
KIT=>Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
KIT=>Everybody loves trout.
HOLLY=>I'm serious.
KIT=>Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
HOLLY=>It was going too fast.
KIT=>I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
KIT=>Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
HOLLY=>You're crazy.
KIT=>Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
HOLLY=>How about over here?
KIT=>Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
KIT=>Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
KIT=>We'll keep on heading for that mountain... Just remember I said it wasn't such a hot idea.
KIT=>I could get a job with the Mounties. The Northwest Mounties ... Hell, I got all the qualifications. I can ride, shoot and... I don't mind the cold. Fact. I kind of like the cold.
HOLLY=>What?
KIT=>Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
HOLLY=>I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
KIT=>I was just talking about going after a job... Hey. don't lip it.
HOLLY=>You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
KIT=>You smoke Pall Mall?
HOLLY=>Yeah.
KIT=>Nah, you hadn't seen me when I'm going after something, honey. Tough?
KIT=>Hey. don't touch that... Nat King Cole.
KIT=>Boy, if I could sing a song like that... I mean, if I could sing a song about the way I feel right now, it'd be a hit.
KIT=>God, what a sight... Tell me this, honey. What does a little Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that?
KIT=>Love this air.
KIT=>Morning... Say, you got any gas?
ROUGHNECK=>Maybe.
KIT=>Well. I'm sorry. sir. but we've got to ask you for it.
KIT=>Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
KIT=>Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
KIT=>Now don't worry. You're getting a fair deal. Hell. what's the blue book value on this thing, Mildred?
KIT=>Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
HOLLY=>Kit!
KIT=>Okay, friend. start running.
KIT=>Git.
KIT=>Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
HOLLY=>Yeah.
KIT=>He's not coming to take us for a ride. either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
HOLLY=>I don't want to.
KIT=>Have you got a better idea?
HOLLY=>I just don't want to go.
KIT=>What?
KIT=>What is wrong with you, huh?
KIT=>What is the matter with you, huh!?
KIT=>Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you.
KIT=>You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you got that?
KIT=>Hey, anybody here?
KIT=>Hi... Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a .300 Savage?
ATTENDANT=>Nope.
KIT=>Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to fill her up for me? Please?
KIT=>If you want any of that junk, it's yours.
KIT=>Hi.
SHERIFF=>Hold it right there.
KIT=>I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
DEPUTY=>We did it, Ray.
KIT=>You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
SHERIFF=>Put your hands in back of your head.
SHERIFF=>Now put the other one on yourself.
KIT=>You're going to give me a cauliflower ear, Sheriff.
DEPUTY=>He should've thought about that before he got caught... Shouldn't he?
DEPUTY=>Hup!
KIT=>Think I'll take the juice?
SHERIFF=>Beats me.
KIT=>Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
DEPUTY=>Thirty aught six.
DEPUTY=>Nope.
KIT=>You tossed my hat out the window.
KIT=>No.
DEPUTY=>Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
KIT=>Mmmmm.
DEPUTY=>You like people?
KIT=>They're okay.
DEPUTY=>Then why'd you do it?
KIT=>I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
DEPUTY=>You know who that sombitch looks like? You know, don't you?
DEPUTY=>I'll kiss your ass if he don't look like James Dean.
MECHANIC=>How you doing there, Kit?
KIT=>You think?... it's leather.
KIT=>Hey, now here's a real prize. I must've had this about ten years. Who's going to get it?
KIT=>There you go.
KIT=>South Dakota. Where you from?
KIT=>Want a comb?
KIT=>Yeah, she got out of there, too.
KIT=>Eddie Fisher. Who's yours?
KIT=>Damn! Want a pen?
KIT=>Don't you read the papers?
KIT=>No sir, I hadn't.
KIT=>Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
DEPUTY=>I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
KIT=>Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
DEPUTY=>Sure thing. Come on.
KIT=>You boys keep out of trouble.
GUARDSMAN=>Don't worry about us.
DEPUTY=>Holly's over here, Kit. if you want to see her.
KIT=>Sure.
KIT=>You want to give me a little slack here?
KIT=>Don't worry now.. I'm going to get you off these charges... There's a whole lot of other boys out there. You're going to have a lot of fun.
KIT=>Boy, we rang the bells, didn't we?
KIT=>I'll say one thing, though... That guy with the deaf maid? He's just lucky he's not dead, too.
KIT=>Course it's too bad about your dad.
HOLLY=>Yeah.
KIT=>We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
KIT=>Thank you very much, Chief Sims. Sorry if I caused you any inconvenience.
CHIEF=>You didn't cause me any trouble.
KIT=>Thanks anyway.
DEPUTY=>Well, Kit...
KIT=>Tom...
DEPUTY=>Good luck to you.
KIT=>Thanks.
DEPUTY=>I mean it.
KIT=>I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
TROOPER=>Now we go.
KIT=>Come on, Red.
KIT=>Sir... Where'd you get that hat?
TROOPER=>State.
KIT=>Boy, I'd like to buy me one of those.
TROOPER=>You're quite an individual, Kit.
KIT=>Think they'll take that into consideration?
