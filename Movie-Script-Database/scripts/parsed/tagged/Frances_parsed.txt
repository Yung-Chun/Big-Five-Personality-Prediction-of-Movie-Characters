M: PROLOGUE
M: BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.
M: FRANCES (V.O.)
M: No one ever came up to me and said,
M: 'You're a fool. There isn't such a
M: thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing
M: you.'
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY
N: On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through.
C: FRANCES
D: It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right.
E: V.O.
N: The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.
C: FRANCES
D: And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER
N: The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun.
C: FRANCES
D: But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.'
E: V.O.
S: INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
N: Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.
C: FRANCES
D: It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it.
N: ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read.
C: FRANCES
D: But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?
N: Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.
C: ERNEST
D: Bye, baby.
C: FRANCES
D: See you next weekend, Dad.
N: He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.
C: FRANCES
D: I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931."
C: FRANCES
D: I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness.
N: The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried.
C: FRANCES
D: I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.
N: Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.
C: WOMAN
D: You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer!
N: A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances. Frances stares back, dumbfounded.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY
N: The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK.
C: KAMINSKI
D: And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
N: YORK & CROWD No!
C: KAMINSKI
D: Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
N: YORK & CROWD No!
C: KAMINSKI
D: Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
N: YORK & CROWD No! No!
C: KAMINSKI
D: Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
N: The crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World."
T: FADE TO BLACK: FADE IN:
N: A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN: GOD'S IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALL'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD? 'NOT SO!' SAYS YOUNG FRANCES FARMER We realize we've been watching a newsreel. We SEE the SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT presenting Frances with an award.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God.
N: City Hall steps. Judge Hillier and other BIGWIGS speaking heatedly to reporters.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian --
N: Lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small CROWD of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home.
E: emphatically
N: Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAY
N: Frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up.
C: FRANCES
D: Hi Emma.
N: Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.
C: FRANCES
D: Bye Emma.
N: Frances shakes her head as she walks on.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Hey!
N: Frances hesitates, then turns to look: A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.
C: HARRY
D: C'mere. I wanna talk to you.
E: friendly
N: Frances keeps walking. Harry hurries after her.
C: HARRY
D: Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!
E: reaches her, grabs her arm
C: FRANCES
D: Don't touch me.
C: HARRY
D: I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
N: She stares at him. He's got a newspaper wedged under one arm.
C: FRANCES
D: Okay then...
E: waiting
C: HARRY
D: Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
C: FRANCES
D: I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
C: HARRY
D: Not me. But other people seem to.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
C: HARRY
D: Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
C: FRANCES
D: No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
E: examining him
N: Harry laughs.
C: HARRY
D: That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right? You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down.
E: holding coat open
N: Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed.
C: FRANCES
D: I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
C: HARRY
D: Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
E: smiles & points to him
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, well --
E: embarrassed
C: FRANCES
D: You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
C: HARRY
D: Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
C: FRANCES
D: Whattaya mean?
C: HARRY
D: Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
C: FRANCES
D: But I'm not. The newspapers're --
C: HARRY
D: Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
N: Beat.
C: HARRY
D: Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
C: FRANCES
D: Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
C: HARRY
D: I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
C: FRANCES
D: Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
C: HARRY
D: Harry.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry.
E: hesitates, nods
N: They half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. Then Harry doffs his hat.
C: HARRY
D: Bye.
N: She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.
C: HARRY
D: Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.
E: admiring her
S: INT. COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: CLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench.
C: HILLIER
D: These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas --
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: I know.
N: The CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. We SEE that the courtroom is empty.
C: HILLIER
D: Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother?
N: Now we SEE who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium.
C: STYLES
D: Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years.
C: HILLIER
D: What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals.
C: STYLES
D: He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition.
E: shaking her head
C: HILLIER
D: Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country. Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma?
E: sternly
C: STYLES
D: Of course, your honor.
N: He nods with satisfaction. Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ernest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars. We HEAR bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes. Ernest rises. They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father.
C: ERNEST
D: It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
C: LILLIAN
D: I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
N: She moves the bread so Ernest again faces the check. As Lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly.
C: LILLIAN
D: Bread?
E: offering to Ernest
C: ERNEST
D: Thank you.
E: taking a piece
C: LILLIAN
D: When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
C: FRANCES
D: Mama...
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
E: pushing back her plate
N: She leaves. A long silence. They both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. Frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight.
C: ERNEST
D: I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
C: FRANCES
D: Thanks, Dad.
C: ERNEST
D: An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
C: FRANCES
D: I didn't have much to do with it.
C: ERNEST
D: You wrote it, didn't you?
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
C: ERNEST
D: Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
C: FRANCES
D: He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
C: ERNEST
D: Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
C: FRANCES
D: Is Kaminski a Communist?
C: ERNEST
D: No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
C: FRANCES
D: He's a socialist, then?
S: INT. STUDY - LILLIAN - NIGHT
N: Sitting at a rolltop desk. She's looking through a large scrapbook. We SEE articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. She listens to the conversation in the other room.
C: ERNEST
D: The label's not important, Francie. What's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it. Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing, down-wing... they don't mean much. All a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name.
E: V.O.
N: Lillian's face becomes set. She looks down at the book. An article titled "Girl Denies God" is there, freshly pasted. She lays a hand on the blank page opposite.
C: FRANCES
D: It's already started, Dad... with me.
E: V.O.
C: ERNEST
D: I know.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
C: FRANCES
D: And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
E: what I meant
N: Lillian appears in the doorway.
C: LILLIAN
D: Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
C: FRANCES
D: Yes, Ma.
C: LILLIAN
D: And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
N: She stomps out. Frances and Ernest push back their plates.
S: EXT. BACK GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Lillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly. As Ernest approaches, she senses him and grows silent. She speaks without turning around.
C: LILLIAN
D: You're poisoning that child's mind.
C: ERNEST
D: I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
C: LILLIAN
D: You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
C: ERNEST
D: They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
C: LILLIAN
D: How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
C: ERNEST
D: No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
E: sadly
C: LILLIAN
D: That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
N: Beat.
C: ERNEST
D: I'm going back to the hotel.
C: LILLIAN
D: Good.
C: ERNEST
D: See you next weekend?
C: LILLIAN
D: As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
N: Ernest starts back toward the house. He sees Frances watching them and slows down, turns...
C: ERNEST
D: Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
C: LILLIAN
D: Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
C: ERNEST
D: That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
E: under his breath
N: He trudges back toward the house under Frances' eye. A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from behind the fence.
C: NEIGHBOR'S VOICE
D: Are you all right, dear?
C: LILLIAN
D: I'm fine, perfectly fine.
S: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
N: Ernest stands on the porch holding his little bag.
C: FRANCES
D: Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
C: ERNEST
D: Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
N: He trudges out and down the walk. Frances watches him, shaking her head. That is not a lesson she wants to learn.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. THEATRE LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Opening night. Harry is reading a playbill displayed in a theatre lobby: "1934 Spring Production... University of Washington Players Present: 'Uncle Vanya' by Anton Chekhov." Frances is playing Sonia. Harry turns and enters the theatre.
S: INT. UNIVERSITY THEATRE STAGE - NIGHT
N: Frances on stage seen from a distance.
C: FRANCES
D: What can we do, we must live! We shall live, Uncle Vanya...
N: Frances is acting with a nervous young man, CHET. As her speech progresses, the camera moves in nearer and nearer, ending with a close-up. It is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion.
C: FRANCES
D: And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress... Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying... In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait... We shall rest... We shall rest!
E: wipes away tears through her tears embraces him
N: Curtains close. AUDIENCE bursts into applause. As the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we SEE in the audience: Lillian and Ernest, Lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging Ernest to clap harder. And in the back stands Harry York.
C: HARRY
D: Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad.
E: to himself
S: INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - NIGHT
N: A celebration in progress. Masks of Comedy and Tragedy hang on the walls. DRAMA STUDENTS lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily. Bing Crosby is on the record player, singing "I've Got The World on a String." The Drama Teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students.
C: DRAMA TEACHER
D: Art is a constant struggle. Some of you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two...
N: The front door opens. Frances and Chet enter.
C: DRAMA TEACHER
D: On cue.
N: The young men rush over to congratulate her. Frances takes a mock bow. She laughs as people cheer. TWO GIRLS observe from the back. GIRL #1 I could really learn to hate her. GIRL #2 Stand in line.
S: INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
N: Things have quieted down. The Drama Teacher has cornered Frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of "Voice of Action." Frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor.
C: DRAMA TEACHER
D: This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
C: FRANCES
D: But I'll never win that.
C: DRAMA TEACHER
D: Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
C: FRANCES
D: Really?
E: intrigued
C: DRAMA TEACHER
D: New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you.
E: flattered/embarrassed
N: A door opens quietly and Harry slips in. He smiles at Frances, who disentangles herself from her teacher and rushes over.
C: FRANCES
D: Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
C: HARRY
D: You think I'd miss it?
C: FRANCES
D: Well? What'd you think?
C: HARRY
D: I just wanted to see how you looked.
E: shrugs
C: FRANCES
D: How'd I look?
C: HARRY
D: Enh.
E: teasing
C: FRANCES
D: Don't be a rat, Harry.
E: smiling
C: HARRY
D: You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
E: glances around
N: She hesitates, looks around and sees Chet passed out, snoring in a chair. She takes Harry's arm.
S: EXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT
N: The beach is very dark, but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old Chevrolet parked near the shore.
C: FRANCES
D: You really think so?
E: V.O.
S: INT. CHEVROLET - NIGHT
N: Frances and Harry are sitting in the back seat.
C: HARRY
D: Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
C: FRANCES
D: I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
C: HARRY
D: Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
C: HARRY
D: What?
C: FRANCES
D: Quietly.
C: HARRY
D: You're not the quiet type, Frances.
N: They are silent for a while.
C: HARRY
D: You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
C: FRANCES
D: What happened to him?
C: HARRY
D: He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
N: He grins ironically and Frances laughs.
C: HARRY
D: I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
C: FRANCES
D: ...So you think I should go.
C: HARRY
D: Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
C: FRANCES
D: I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
C: HARRY
D: You don't know what you want.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah.
N: She looks at him, smiles wistfully.
C: FRANCES
D: Not in the long run, anyway.
N: She starts to unbutton her blouse. Harry is pleasantly surprised, but unnerved.
C: HARRY
D: Frances...
C: FRANCES
D: What?
C: HARRY
D: Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
C: FRANCES
D: Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters.
E: whispers pregnant pause... smile...
N: Harry can't believe his good fortune.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
N: Lillian's face, distorted.
C: LILLIAN
D: Communists?! No daughter of mine is going to Communist Russia!
N: Lillian is in her apron, canning peaches.
C: FRANCES
D: You act like I'm a bomb-thrower, Mama. It's just a trip.
N: She leaves. Lillian follows her down the narrow -- almost institutional -- hallway.
C: LILLIAN
D: But they're using you!
C: FRANCES
D: Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
N: They've reached Frances' room. She puts on her coat.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
C: FRANCES
D: Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
E: sighs
N: She stares out the window. We see Ernest mowing the lawn.
C: FRANCES
D: I have to do this on my own. You see, I've learned your lesson very well. To do what I think is right and everyone else be damned.
N: Frances turns and heads back down the hall. Lillian follows.
C: LILLIAN
D: I never taught you that!
N: Frances keeps walking.
C: LILLIAN
D: Little sister, if you don't wise up soon, it's going to be out of my hands!
N: They've reached the kitchen. Ernest is there, sweating, drinking water.
C: FRANCES
D: It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
C: LILLIAN
D: Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
C: FRANCES
D: I don't care.
C: LILLIAN
D: ...You will.
E: grimacing
N: She storms outside. Frances sighs, looks at her father.
C: FRANCES
D: What do I do, Dad?
C: ERNEST
D: You really want to go?
C: FRANCES
D: Of course.
C: ERNEST
D: And you think it's worth all this?
C: FRANCES
D: If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
C: ERNEST
D: ...Then go.
S: EXT. SEATTLE BUS STATION - DAY
N: Lillian has a few reporters drawn off to one side. Alma Styles and a MINISTER stand nearby. A CROWD has gathered. Inside the station, more reporters are milling around Frances.
C: LILLIAN
D: The authorities tell me there's no legal way I can stop her, but the way I see it, it's bigger than me or my family... American integrity, that's what's at stake here. They're sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness. . .the dark forces that would overthrow our country. Your country. My country.
E: almost conspiratorial the following is heard faintly as b.g. to the scene below
S: INT. BUS STATION - FRANCES AND REPORTERS - DAY
N: Ernest and the Drama Teacher stand at Frances' side. REPORTER #1 Has your earlier denial of God led you to Communism?
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not a Communist.
N: REPORTER #2 But Frances, you said --
C: FRANCES
D: I said all countries are of cultural interest. Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world.
N: REPORTER #2 Better than any American company? REPORTER #1 What do you think of Stalin?
C: FRANCES
D: Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski.
N: REPORTER #2 Who?
C: LILLIAN
D: Help me save my daughter! Save the children of America.
E: suddenly frantic, loud
N: A TALL SPECTRAL MAN dressed in black adds:
C: TALL SPECTRAL MAN
D: Repent, Frances, Repent!
C: CROWD
D: Repent! Repent!
N: Their cries seem weird, almost deranged, and Lillian is taken aback.
S: EXT. BUS STATION - DAY
N: Passengers climb onto the bus. As Frances is hugged by her Drama Teacher, the Tall Spectral Man approaches her. In his arms he carries a potted plant, a Bible, and a flashlight.
C: TALL SPECTRAL MAN
D: Bless you, sister, bless you. Here is a Bible for solace... and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us... and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest Russia.
E: dignified, as though conducting some bizarre ceremony
N: Frances accepts the gifts, bewildered. The Tall Spectral Man stares at her through hollow eyes. She staggers on toward the bus, looking like a bedraggled Statue of Liberty. The Tall Spectral Man sings an ethereal hymn. Lillian blocks Frances' path. Frances looks at her tearfully.
C: FRANCES
D: I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.
E: turns to her father
C: ERNEST
D: Be careful, Francie.
E: hugging her
N: As Frances climbs on board.
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna throw myself beneath the wheels. I'll do it, Frances. Frances!
N: Inside the bus, Frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly. The bus starts. Everyone looks at Lillian. She is motionless... Furious. Frances sighs, and the bus moves off unimpeded. There is a homicidal rage in Lillian's eyes as she stares after the vehicle. Then the Reporters rush toward her.
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer?
N: She looks down, her lip quivering. Humiliated, crumbling... As the reporters shout unanswered questions, Ernest puts his arm around his wife and leads her away.
T: FADE TO BLACK: FADE IN:
S: INT. FARMER STUDY - DAY
N: Lillian is happily thumbing through her scrapbook. Her hand runs down the page, and we SEE a series of headlines, with photos: MOTHER UNABLE TO HALT GIRL'S TRIP TO RUSSIA (Photo Lillian & Frances) Then: MOTHER WARNS AGAINST REDS IN SCHOOLS (Photo Lillian) Next is a SNAPSHOT of Frances on board on ocean liner. Then TWO SNAPSHOTS of her in what is clearly Moscow. She wears a Russian hat. The Kremlin stands behind her. Then SNAPSHOTS of her in New York, with a small clipping from the "New York Times": Visits Moscow Art Theatre... YOUNG ACTRESS RETURNS FROM RUSSIA, ASPIRES TO THE BROADWAY STAGE Below this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad. Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her. Lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite -- blank -- page of her scrapbook. A handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her. She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. The clipping says: "STARS OF TOMORROW" and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars. Lillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: We SEE the Hollywood sign in the distance... then CHANGE FOCUS to see the front of the studio...
S: INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: Frances' hair is tightly curled. She is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool. Behind her TWO ASSISTANTS fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid. A seasoned PUBLICIST kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, CLAIRE, surveys the scene.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: One more time.
E: O.S.
N: Frances stares dramatically off into space.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Hobbies?
N: The camera clicks.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh, I swim some... play the piano badly... and I read like a fiend: I like history.
C: PUBLICIST
D: No, no, people don't want that. Now listen: you spend lots of time at the beach. You're crazy about dancing. And you're the kind of girl who's just a little in love with love. Get it? Now try again? Hobbies?
C: FRANCES
D: Look, I...
C: PUBLICIST
D: Beach... dancing... in love with love.
E: writing in notepad
C: FRANCES
D: That's me.
E: ironically
N: The camera clicks again. MR. BEBE -- a tall, brooding, well- dressed man -- ENTERS.
C: CLAIRE
D: Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
C: BEBE
D: Who's this?
C: CLAIRE
D: Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
C: BEBE
D: Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
E: an assessment
C: CLAIRE
D: I guess so, sir.
C: BEBE
D: Very fine bone structure.
E: nods, stares again at Frances
N: He leaves. Claire stares after him with profound contempt.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Not much to work with. How's this: 'The most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to Hollywood was 12,000 miles long. After winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to Europe...' She made some deal with the Commies and went to Moscow, but I'm not going to say that, am I?
E: coming up to Claire reading
C: CLAIRE
D: Heavens no. Go on.
C: PUBLICIST
D: Um... 'Miss Farmer returned to New York City and had a brief fling with the Broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom.'
C: CLAIRE
D: 'Brief fling?'
C: PUBLICIST
D: Well, actually she couldn't get hired, but lucky for her, some guy in our New York office saw her. She says soon as she gets a stake, she's going back.
N: Claire rolls her eyes. She's heard this before. The Camera clicks again. Frances is frozen in time.
S: INT. STUDIO ACTING CLASS - DAY
N: TWO STUDENTS are doing a scene from "Design For Living." Others sit around watching, whispering, flirting, sleeping... but Frances is paying very close attention, making notes. The MAN next to her rubs her arm and whispers something. She grimaces and pays no attention. Then she notices, two rows in front, a young handsome student, DICK, who's also making notes. She stares at him for a second, then back at the stage.
S: EXT. LAUREL CANYON COTTAGE - DAY
N: A tiny rustic cottage, dogs everywhere. Two identical old Fords are parked out front.
S: INT. COTTAGE - DAY
N: Frances sits on the couch talking on the phone.
C: FRANCES
D: Did you get the check?... Oh my God, it opened?!, what'd you think?
N: Water lands on her face. She grimaces playfully.
C: FRANCES
D: Well, I hope I get bigger parts, they don't come much smaller.
N: The last line is garbled as water streams in her mouth. She fumbles for something on the floor.
C: FRANCES
D: No, I'm fine. I just have water in my mouth.
N: She finds a water pistol on the floor, picks up the phone, and starts searching for her assailant.
C: FRANCES
D: No, Mama, I'm not changing my name. They can't actually make you, you know? Most people don't realize that. Oh Dick...
E: playfully, covering receiver
N: She flings open the bathroom door and finds him: Dick from drama class. A furious water battle ensues.
C: FRANCES
D: No, no, nothing's going on. I love you too, Mama. Give my love to Dad. Bye!
E: fast
N: She hangs up, lowers her gun as Dick squirts her. She's getting wet. Her shirt clinging to her breasts. She likes it.
C: FRANCES
D: Okay, handsome. You win.
S: INT. HOLLYWOOD SCREENING ROOM
N: On the small screen we SEE Frances in the arms of a MAN IN FIRE CHIEF'S HAT.
C: FRANCES
D: Kurt!
C: FIRE CHIEF
D: Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
C: FRANCES
D: But, Kurt, I...
C: FIRE CHIEF
D: No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
C: FRANCES
D: Oh, Kurt!
C: FIRE CHIEF
D: Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
N: ON SCREEN the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent. The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers. The brim of his hat hits her forehead. Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing. The Fire Chief looks stunned. She tries to control herself.
C: FRANCES
D: I'm sorry... I'm sorry, let's go back.
E: looking into camera
N: Laughter inside the screening room. A small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly SEE TWO MEN. MAN #1 (irate) What the hell is that? What's she doing?
C: LAUGHING MAN
D: That's talent, Andy.
N: MAN #1 (after a beat) Oh.
S: EXT. CATWALK - DAY
N: Frances smiles and eases shut the screening room door. We HEAR the Laughing Man inside shout: "Let's see that again!" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match. A man's hand appears, holding a lighter. She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person!
N: Frances throws her arms around him. They hug warmly.
C: HARRY
D: How ya doin', Farmer?
C: FRANCES
D: Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
C: HARRY
D: Came to get a tan.
N: They compare forearms.
C: FRANCES
D: Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
C: HARRY
D: Kaminski.
E: staring out
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
C: HARRY
D: Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
C: FRANCES
D: What?
C: HARRY
D: They killed him. They threw him out that window.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh no...
C: HARRY
D: Eight stories.
N: She stares down two stories to the ground, imagining:
C: FRANCES
D: Jesus.
C: HARRY
D: Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
E: also staring down
C: FRANCES
D: But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
E: walking on
C: HARRY
D: He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage?
E: shrugs brightening confidentially turns around, displaying his shirt
C: FRANCES
D: You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.
E: pushing him down the stairs
S: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
N: Harry and Frances walking arm in arm.
C: FRANCES
D: Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
C: HARRY
D: I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
C: FRANCES
D: I know what ability you're interested in.
E: smiling
C: HARRY
D: Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. For old time's sake.
E: off her sober expression
C: FRANCES
D: Harry... I met someone.
E: serious
C: HARRY
D: Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
E: stiffens slightly
N: Frances shakes her head.
C: HARRY
D: Actor?
N: She nods.
C: HARRY
D: Good. Then it's temporary. All actors are phonies.
E: whispers
N: He's joking, but she doesn't respond.
C: HARRY
D: Serious, huh?
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah.
C: HARRY
D: Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
N: She smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment. She squeezes his arm and they continue walking.
S: INT. SOUND STAGE - SET (RHYTHM ON THE RANGE) - DAY
N: Lights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking. In the midst of this we SEE Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the WARDROBE MISTRESS, who is listening without enthusiasm.
C: FRANCES
D: These creases... I look like I just came from the laundry! I'm supposed to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping on floors.
E: spreading her arms
C: WARDROBE MISTRESS
D: This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer.
E: cool
C: FRANCES
D: Oh, I know that. But it could look more realistic, don't you think?
E: friendly
C: WARDROBE MISTRESS
D: It'll do. No one will notice.
E: looking her over
C: FRANCES
D: I'll notice.
N: We HEAR a man conspicuously clearing his throat. Both women turn as Mr. Bebe steps forward.
C: WARDROBE MISTRESS
D: Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning.
N: He nods imperceptibly.
C: BEBE
D: Come along with me, Fanny.
N: She hesitates, then goes.
C: FRANCES
D: That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
C: BEBE
D: You see: We've got to change that name.
E: leading her off
S: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
N: Frances and Bebe come through the sound stage door into the light. He gestures to indicate what direction they're going, but remains silent, watching her. She's uncomfortable, blinking like a bird.
C: BEBE
D: I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you --
C: BEBE
D: I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
N: Frances is taken aback. This is all rather blunt.
C: BEBE
D: Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
C: FRANCES
D: Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
C: BEBE
D: Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
N: They hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look: PICKETERS are fighting with POLICE. It is raucous, brutal. Bebe turns back to her with a stern look:
C: BEBE
D: Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
C: FRANCES
D: But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
C: BEBE
D: No, I'm concerned with everything.
E: fierce but very muted
C: FRANCES
D: But I'm the one up there on the screen.
C: BEBE
D: That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
N: She's about to reply, but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips. Kisses it very formally, like a suitor. Then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building. She watches him go.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT
N: Brightly colored bulbs flashing, causing the wisps of fog around them to glow. The bulbs spell: "COME AND GET IT" WITH SEATTLE'S OWN FRANCES FARMER A noisy CROWD is gathered outside the theatre, straining against velvet cordons. Big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear, to the applause of the crowd. All slightly small-town, off-key. Harry, now sporting a mustache, hat pulled down over his face, stands across the street.
C: HARRY
D: Not bad, Farmer.
E: puffing his cigarette
S: EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
N: Two limousines streaking through the night.
S: INT. SECOND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: Frances sits next to a faceless STUDIO EXECUTIVE. She's all dolled up. She looks uncomfortable. Silence. She glances up at the limo ahead of them.
S: INT. FIRST LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
N: Dick sits between Lillian and Ernest A REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER crouch in front of them.
C: LILLIAN
D: I guess it's no secret that I'm proud. Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done. As for her looks, I flatter myself that she gets them from me.
E: confidentially
C: DICK
D: Obviously.
N: He winks at the reporters.
C: LILLIAN
D: And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law!
C: REPORTER
D: Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction when Frances told you she had married...
C: DICK
D: Dwayne. Dwayne Steele.
C: ERNEST
D: What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman.
N: Dick smiles and hugs them both.
C: DICK
D: Well, all I can say is: I feel like I've known these two for years!
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh, Dwayne! This is like a fairy tale!
E: girlishly overcome
N: They're stopped at a light. Outside their window we SEE DERELICTS, casualties of the depression, huddled in the night.
S: INT. FRANCES' LIMO - NIGHT
N: She's staring at the derelicts. We feel her sympathy for them. Almost like she'd rather be out there. A MAN WITH HOLLOW EYES shouts something at them.
C: FRANCES
D: What'd he say?
N: She rolls down her window. The Studio Executive beside her looks at her like she's crazy.
T: STUDIO EXECUTIVE
N: (to Driver) Let's go. We'll be late. The limousine lurches forward. Frances settles back in her seat, letting the night air sweep over her face.
S: EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT
N: The two limos pull up, the second emptying first. As Frances gets out, the CROWD cheers wildly. She walks past them, eyes glazed. She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons. Lillian is posing and signing autographs. In her tight, formal dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted. As she walks, voices assault her:
C: LILLIAN
D: There she is!
N: REPORTER #1 (O.S.) How does it feel to be back in Seattle, Frances?
C: FRANCES
D: A little strange.
C: WOMEN'S VOICES
D: Isn't she gorgeous?
T: STUDIO EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
N: This way. REPORTER #2 (O.S.) How's the movie, Frances?
C: FRANCES
D: It's okay.
C: LILLIAN
D: Smile, little sister, smile.
E: O.S.
N: Frances sees her mother smiling nervously. They have entered the:
S: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Again there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle luminaries are sipping champagne. Reporter #1 lurches forward: REPORTER #1 Can you make some statement about Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools --
C: FRANCES
D: Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn't luck was hard work.
N: REPORTER #1 (disappointed) Oh. Judge Hillier's Wife, whom we recognize as the Woman who shouted at Frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a garish gown. She's holding a large key.
C: JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE
D: Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how proud I am to meet you.
N: She embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little put off. After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' hand and won't let go. Judge Hillier steps to his wife's side. Lillian also approaches.
C: JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE
D: On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
C: FRANCES
D: Excuse me.
C: JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE
D: Yes...?
E: startled
C: FRANCES
D: Don't I know you?
C: JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE
D: I don't believe so.
C: FRANCES
D: Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
C: JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE
D: No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh bullshit.
E: barely audible
C: JUDGE HILLIER
D: I beg your pardon?
C: FRANCES
D: Listen, I'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all.
E: to the dignitaries
N: A hideous silence. Judge Hillier is fuming. His wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her. She shoves it into Frances' arms. Frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio Executive, who escorts her into the theatre. The crowd follows. Lillian is utterly mortified.
S: EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT
N: We TRACK along the side of the theatre. An exit door is thrown open, and Frances storms out. As she does, she trips over an OLD INDIAN BEGGAR. She stops and looks at him. He peers up at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. A connection is made. All the anger drains out of her. She gives him money, several bills. He breaks into a wonderful crooked grin. She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city. He stares at it, bewildered. She strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley. The CHAUFFEURS are talking and smoking a cigarette. Her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo. As it pulls into the street, we see Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it.
S: EXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT
N: Frances sits on the old wood jetty staring out at the water, the lighthouse... Harry approaches.
C: HARRY
D: ...It's one thing to marry the guy, but did you have to sleep with him?
N: She cracks up. Harry laughs at his mistake.
C: HARRY
D: Shit. I meant the other way around.
C: FRANCES
D: Well, the studio told me not to.
E: still laughing
C: HARRY
D: Is that why you did it?
C: FRANCES
D: Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
C: HARRY
D: You're telling me.
C: FRANCES
D: Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
C: HARRY
D: Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
C: FRANCES
D: Forget it.
N: He looks at her thoughtfully, then sits.
C: FRANCES
D: You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
C: HARRY
D: If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
C: FRANCES
D: No, they don't, do they?
E: warmly, to him
N: Beat.
C: HARRY
D: Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
C: FRANCES
D: I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
E: stares at the water
C: HARRY
D: Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
C: FRANCES
D: But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
E: important
C: HARRY
D: What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
E: laughs
N: They start to walk now along the beach. We see Harry's car and the chauffeured limousine parked above.
C: HARRY
D: Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
C: FRANCES
D: The hell you will, Harry York.
C: HARRY
D: Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
N: She shakes her head mischievously... moves backward unbuttoning her coat.
C: FRANCES
D: Bong... bong... bong...
E: like a clock striking
N: The coat falls.
C: HARRY
D: Don't start, Farmer.
C: FRANCES
D: It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
E: dropping her scarf
C: HARRY
D: The chauffeur. He's watching.
E: nervously
C: FRANCES
D: He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
C: HARRY
D: I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
C: FRANCES
D: I know.
E: kicking off a shoe
N: She kicks off another shoe, sailing it into the water. Frances is zipping off her dress. Harry bends to pick up the first shoe.
C: FRANCES
D: A single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands. Who was that girl, anyway?
N: Harry watches her, mesmerized. The dress is off.
C: FRANCES
D: 'Come and get it,' Harry.
N: She skips off down the beach, her dress strewn on the sands. After a moment, from the darkness, we SEE her underclothes fly into view. Harry can restrain himself no longer.
C: HARRY
D: Hot damn!
E: excited
N: He drops the shoe and runs after her, tearing off his clothes. After a moment, from the darkness, we hear her squeals of laughter.
S: EXT. STUDIO - HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: The street outside the Studio Main Gate. Actors, directors, etc. arrive in their shiny expensive autos. Among them is Frances in her old battered Ford. She waves to the Guard and drives through.
S: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
N: As Frances pulls into her parking space, Claire, the woman from the photo session, strolls up.
C: CLAIRE
D: Hi Frances, got a minute?
C: FRANCES
D: Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
N: They walk toward the dressing room.
C: CLAIRE
D: Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
E: nervous
C: FRANCES
D: My clothes?
E: bewildered
C: CLAIRE
D: Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
C: FRANCES
D: It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
C: CLAIRE
D: Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
C: FRANCES
D: I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
C: CLAIRE
D: You know what I mean.
C: FRANCES
D: Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
N: Claire is laughing. They go inside.
S: INT. FRANCES' DRESSING ROOM - DAY
N: Posh, fit for a star. Frances smiles at the MAKEUP MAN.
C: FRANCES
D: Morning, Eddie.
N: As Frances sits at the table and Eddie goes to work:
C: CLAIRE
D: That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
C: FRANCES
D: Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
C: CLAIRE
D: I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
C: FRANCES
D: I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
E: imitating Bebe
C: CLAIRE
D: ...acts. I'll relay your message.
E: laughing
S: INT. FRANCES AND DICK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
N: Dick is talking on the phone in the living room.
C: DICK
D: Yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights. Call back tomorrow, okay?
N: He hangs up. Immediately the phone rings again. He stares at it wearily, then answers:
C: DICK
D: Dwayne Steele's residence.
E: pointedly
N: Through the half-open door to the bedroom we see Frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her.
C: DICK
D: Yes. What...? Yes. Yes, I'll tell her.
E: confused hurt
N: He hangs up. Stares off. Slowly enters the bedroom. Frances looks up.
C: DICK
D: You learn your lines?
C: FRANCES
D: Sort of.
E: nods drowsily
C: DICK
D: There've been some calls.
C: FRANCES
D: Who?
C: DICK
D: Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
C: FRANCES
D: Claire?
C: DICK
D: Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
C: FRANCES
D: Fired?
E: apprehensively
C: DICK
D: Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
N: Frances looks stricken. Dick presses on.
C: DICK
D: There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
C: FRANCES
D: ...Yes.
C: DICK
D: Without me.
C: FRANCES
D: Showdown.
E: sighing
C: DICK
D: You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
C: FRANCES
D: Dick, we need some time apart --
C: DICK
D: Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
C: FRANCES
D: Dick, I can't even breathe here...
C: DICK
D: Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
C: FRANCES
D: Dick...
E: softly, remembering
C: DICK
D: I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
C: FRANCES
D: No?
C: DICK
D: No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
C: FRANCES
D: What night?
E: bewildered
C: DICK
D: The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
C: FRANCES
D: You want his name?
E: quietly
N: Dick is crumbling inside.
C: DICK
D: What...?
N: We watch it sink in. Confusion... self-pity... building gradually to resentment and rage. He starts to throw a tantrum. Hurling things around the room. Frances just sits there.
C: FRANCES
D: My God... I think you're overplaying this a bit...?
N: He hurls a pillow against the wall and rushes out. Frances looks after him, then turns. She's now facing the bureau.
C: FRANCES
D: Goodbye, Dick.
N: A mirror sits on top of the bureau. She looks into it. Doesn't like her expression. Turns the mirror away.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. THEATRE LOBBY - NIGHT
N: A playbill in a theatre lobby reads: "Mt. Kisco Playhouse, 1937 Summer Season: 'THE PETRIFIED FOREST'." Among the names listed is: "Frances Farmer, the 'Come And Get It' Girl. Suddenly we HEAR an eruption of applause.
S: INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE - NIGHT
N: TIGHT SHOT on two men: HAROLD CLURMAN -- a thoughtful aristocratic man -- and CLIFFORD ODETS, who is taller, slimmer, with black hair and intense dark eyes. Around them we see (mostly HEAR) the AUDIENCE going crazy, leaping to its feet, yelling "Bravo! Bravo!" Clurman and Odets sit impassively. As the hurrahs die down and the audience files out, the two men sit there. Finally Clurman turns to Odets. Odets nods very slightly.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Frances sits in the cramped room, listening intently to Clurman. Occasionally she sneaks a glance at Odets, who is pacing like some caged beast.
C: CLURMAN
D: The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
C: FRANCES
D: Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
E: watching Odets
C: CLURMAN
D: Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
C: FRANCES
D: Who is she?
C: ODETS
D: She's a tramp from Newark.
C: CLURMAN
D: Forgive me, but I think you'd be perfect for the part.
N: Odets is pacing furiously, seizing their attention. He stops, looks at her, then resumes.
C: ODETS
D: Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault... a seduction... a plea for understanding. I think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets... and you make very attractive ammunition.
N: He stops. Tentatively, almost boyishly, he smiles. She returns it. She's charmed.
C: FRANCES
D: And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
C: ODETS
D: 'Golden Boy.'
E: mysterious, intimate
S: EXT. BELASCO THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT
N: It reads "Golden Boy". Crowds of people streaming out of the lobby. A sign over the box office reads: "Tomorrow's performances sold out." Odets sits on the curb. Behind him the lights in the theatre lobby flicker off. PEDESTRIANS stroll by: an odd mix of affluent theatre crowd and 1930s bums. Frances emerges from the theatre, sees him sitting there. Sits beside him.
C: FRANCES
D: Hi.
N: He nods.
C: FRANCES
D: You wanted to talk?
N: Another nod. He's silent. He peers up the street. A GIRL, 16, selling pencils catches his eye.
C: ODETS
D: You see that girl?
N: She looks like a waif: tough, vulnerable, pleading with a WEALTHY COUPLE, following them down the street. A drama being played out in the distance, out of earshot.
C: ODETS
D: That's who my play is about.
N: Frances watches the girl.
C: FRANCES
D: That's me, Clifford.
C: ODETS
D: I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
E: strong
S: INT. WORKING CLASS BAR - LATER
N: The same conversation continuing:
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not!
C: ODETS
D: Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
C: FRANCES
D: But I want to. I'm trying!
C: ODETS
D: I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
C: FRANCES
D: Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
C: ODETS
D: Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
S: EXT. PLATFORM - SPANISH EMBASSY - DAY
N: Clurman is delivering a speech in the background as PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. Behind them on the platform Frances and Odets continue their conversation in whispers:
C: ODETS
D: I can see it. You just have to let it out. Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle!
N: We now HEAR Clurman's speech. The initial words below were background to the above. What we HEAR now is underlined:
C: CLURMAN
D: ...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive. (presenting check to
C: SPANISH CONSUL)
D: The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Yes you are. We all are. The first step is to acknowledge our fear.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT
N: They're walking. The conversation continues.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not!
C: CLIFFORD
D: You're afraid!
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not!
C: CLIFFORD
D: You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
C: FRANCES
D: God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
E: angry
N: She is seething. Gorgeous. Alive. He smiles, watching her.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Good, good. Give them that.
C: FRANCES
D: What?
N: As she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about. She looks at him, still breathing heavily. Gradually her face turns toward a smile. He reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her.
S: INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Later. They enter slightly drunk, laughing. He takes her coat.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Madam...?
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you.
N: She's looking at the apartment. He sees her. A dark thought flickers across his face, and he breaks into an exaggerated act:
C: CLIFFORD
D: Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
E: gesturing off
C: FRANCES
D: Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
E: playing along
N: She starts to put on her coat. He watches her.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Okay, but come here first.
C: FRANCES
D: Huh.
C: CLIFFORD
D: Come here. I want to show you something.
E: Leading her down hall
N: He opens the bedroom door.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The bed is drawn back, and the sheets are sprinkled with rose petals. Frances' eyes are large. The kiss is very hungry now.
S: INT. BEBE'S PANELLED OFFICE - HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: Bebe's huge desk. Variety Headline: "ACTRESS FIGHTS FASCISM!" Next to the newspaper are a dozen pencils which Bebe is lining up precisely parallel. His expression is totally obsessive, crazed. Behind him a woman (TORA) is cutting his hair. A STUDIO LAWYER paces nearby.
C: LAWYER
D: And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
C: BEBE
D: I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
E: muttering
C: LAWYER
D: Excuse me, sir?
C: BEBE
D: I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
N: Tora is massaging the back of Bebe's neck. He's oblivious.
C: LAWYER
D: Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
E: startled
C: BEBE
D: That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
C: LAWYER
D: Oh. I mean, good.
C: BEBE
D: I think it's time to take the gloves off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons!
E: scowls, speaks into intercom afterthought
N: During this conversation, Bebe has been drawing on the Variety. We now see his work. Beneath the headline was a photo of Frances, on whom Bebe has drawn a mustache.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BELASCO THEATRE - NIGHT
N: The marquee for "Golden Boy" reads "Held Over". USHERS are opening the glass doors from the empty lobby onto the street. We HEAR thunderous applause from the inside.
S: EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Frances emerges from the stage door to a throng of AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS. She smiles tiredly, but good-naturedly complies. A little ways back stands a boyish YOUNG MAN holding a single red carnation. When the Autograph-seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away, the Young Man steps forward.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Miss Farmer... I've never done this before... but... I had to tell ya' you're great!
N: He shyly hands her the flower.
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you very much. I'm glad you liked the play.
N: She smiles and begins to walk away. The Young Man follows her.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
C: FRANCES
D: You can always come see it in London.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Only if you were in it. Are you?
C: FRANCES
D: I wouldn't miss it.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
C: FRANCES
D: Are you an actor?
E: smiling
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
C: FRANCES
D: Are you really serious? About acting?
E: after a pause
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Why... yes.
C: FRANCES
D: Then don't go to Hollywood.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Why?
C: FRANCES
D: I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You sound as if you hate it.
C: FRANCES
D: No, I don't hate it.
N: Again she walks on. He follows.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Aren't you ever going back?
C: FRANCES
D: ...Not if I can help it.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
C: FRANCES
D: They'll mend.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: What about your husband?
E: after a pause
N: Frances stops walking, her eyes shoot to the Young Man's face.
C: FRANCES
D: What?
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
C: FRANCES
D: What is this?
N: The Young Man suddenly seems much older, and there is no sign of the awkward boyishness.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
C: FRANCES
D: Why, you... you little bastard!
N: The Young Man grins.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be seeing you.
N: He begins to walk away.
C: FRANCES
D: Just one minute...
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
E: turning
N: He is gone.
S: INT. WORKING CLASS BAR - NIGHT
N: Odets sits at a table in back, drinking and writing in a notebook. Frances comes up to him. He smiles, draws her to him for a hug.
C: ODETS
D: How'd it go?
N: She hesitates, still affected by the incident outside the theatre.
C: FRANCES
D: 'But how do I know you love me?'
C: ODETS
D: Your big speech?
C: FRANCES
D: 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
C: ODETS
D: I already have.
E: smiling
N: She nods, turns her back to him.
C: FRANCES
D: How's it sound?
C: ODETS
D: The speech? Real good.
C: FRANCES
D: You think I got it?
C: ODETS
D: You got it.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
N: She is crying.
S: INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - DAY
N: Frances comes in the front door with a bag of groceries, removes her key. Walks into the living room, stops short. Clurman is sitting on the couch, a bottle and two glasses in front of him.
C: FRANCES
D: Hello, Harold.
C: CLURMAN
D: Frances.
E: nodding
C: FRANCES
D: Where's Clifford?
E: looking around
C: CLURMAN
D: He's not here.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh.
N: She sits.
C: CLURMAN
D: Bourbon?
N: He pours. She drinks hers, watching him.
C: FRANCES
D: What's up?
C: CLURMAN
D: I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
C: FRANCES
D: That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
C: CLURMAN
D: Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
N: Frances looks like she's been punched in the stomach.
C: FRANCES
D: You don't think I'm good enough?
E: insecure
C: CLURMAN
D: What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
C: FRANCES
D: Who?
C: CLURMAN
D: An actress.
C: FRANCES
D: A rich actress.
C: CLURMAN
D: Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
C: FRANCES
D: But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
E: growing angry
C: CLURMAN
D: I know, but --
C: FRANCES
D: What does Clifford say?
E: over his line
C: CLURMAN
D: Right now we have to be practical.
C: FRANCES
D: Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
E: off his silence standing
C: CLURMAN
D: He knows, Frances.
N: She collapses back into her seat. Her head is swirling.
C: CLURMAN
D: He approved it.
E: gently
N: She's glaring at him. He hands her a letter.
C: CLURMAN
D: I'm very sorry, but... well, Hollywood wants you back, right?
N: Her eyes fill with rage. She hurls her drink in his face.
C: FRANCES
D: Prick!
N: He stands and, with as much dignity as he can muster, leaves. Frances is shaking. She rips open the letter he gave her. Stares at it in horror...
S: INT. BOOKIE JOINT - DAY
N: Plain room. A few tables with phones, men on the phones writing down numbers. Behind them are blackboards with horses' names and prices. Off to one side Harry is conferring with the OWNER.
C: HARRY
D: Of course it can be done, "Mr. Jones," but it's how you do it. There's a way to pay off L.A. cops and a way to get yourself arrested. First you gotta know who to approach --
N: A Man at one of the phones looks up, calls.
C: MAN AT PHONE
D: You Harry York?
N: Harry nods, startled. The Man at the table holds up the phone and goes to his next call. Harry takes the phone.
S: INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NEW YORK - NIGHT
N: Frances on the phone. A half-packed bag lies on the bed. A bottle and glass sit beside her. She's been crying and drinking.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry? Harry, where are you?!
C: HARRY
D: Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
E: V.O.
C: FRANCES
D: I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
S: INT. BOOKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
C: HARRY
D: Calm down, Frances.
C: FRANCES
D: Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
E: V.O.
S: INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NEW YORK - NIGHT
N: Frances unfolds the crumpled letter Clurman gave her.
C: FRANCES
D: Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
C: HARRY
D: Frances...
E: V.O.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
E: sobbing
S: INT. BOOKIE JOINT - DAY
N: With the patter of the bookie taking bets beside him, Harry listens to Frances' sobs.
C: HARRY
D: I know, Frances... I know.
N: He HEARS a CLICK on the other end. He hangs up and heaves a long slow sigh.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. SOUND STAGE - FLOWING GOLD SET - DAY
N: Frances, in a pair of overalls, falls face down into mud.
S: INT. SOUND STAGE - FLOWING GOLD SET - LATER
N: We SEE the slate: 'Flowing Gold', Scene 31A, Take 11... then the same action is repeated from a slightly different angle. Next to her is an old car, its wheels mired in mud.
S: INT. SOUND STAGE - FLOWING GOLD SET - LATER
N: Slate: Take 12. She falls again, this time splattering mud all over her face and hair. She lies still for a moment, gritting her teeth. Sitting comfortably in a nearby director's chair is a DIRECTOR reading Daily Variety. The headline reads: "STUDIO WINS FARMER WAR ON HOLLYWOOD." Behind the Director, off to one side, stands Bebe. The A.D. tugs on the Director's sleeve:
C: A.D.
D: How was that?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Good, good. One more time.
E: looking up
C: FRANCES
D: For God's sake... why?
E: standing
C: DIRECTOR
D: Because we want to get it perfect... just the right combination of fury and confusion. You can understand that, can't you, Miss Farmer? We're serious artists here, right? Right.
N: The Director glances toward Bebe, who nods with satisfaction. Frances watches this interaction. She hesitates, then approaches Bebe. She wipes some mud from her face and drops it at her feet.
C: FRANCES
D: Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
C: BEBE
D: I'd like nothing better.
E: somewhat snidely
N: She turns and walks, with an air of pride, to her wardrobe trailer.
S: EXT. ELEGANT BEACHFRONT HOME - NIGHT
N: Lights everywhere. Cars line the driveway. We HEAR the SOUND of a large party. A car pulls up. BOB BARNES gets out, goes around to open the door for Frances. She's exhausted. She doesn't move.
C: BARNES
D: Well... come on.
C: FRANCES
D: This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
C: BARNES
D: Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
C: FRANCES
D: But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
E: tiredly
C: BARNES
D: Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
C: FRANCES
D: You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.
E: getting out sighs
C: BARNES
D: Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
E: taking pills from pocket
C: FRANCES
D: So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
E: joking
C: BARNES
D: Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
N: She nods, takes a few. They head for the door.
S: INT. HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
N: The DOORBELL CHIMES. The hostess, CONNIE, a pleasant-looking woman, answers the door.
C: BARNES
D: Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell party!
C: CONNIE
D: Frances!
E: pleased
N: As they embrace, Frances looks around with trepidation:
C: FRANCES
D: God, who's here?
E: whisper
C: CONNIE
D: The usual vermin, I'm afraid.
E: also whispering
N: Barnes tries to pull Frances inside. She sees a flurry of waiting faces. Everyone's watching her.
C: FRANCES
D: Get me a drink.
E: sotto voice
N: Barnes nods, concerned, and crosses to the bar.
C: FRANCES
D: Hi everybody.
N: Some people seem amused, some curious, some scornful. The Director from the mud scene nods to her. Connie is at her side for support. A voice from somewhere pierces the chatter:
C: SNIDE VOICE
D: So nice to have you back, Frances.
N: As Barnes returns with her drink, she turns to Connie:
C: FRANCES
D: Connie, can I use the upstairs bathroom?
C: CONNIE
D: Sure.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Later. Frances lies in a bubblebath, relaxing, sipping her drink. She obviously feels a lot better. Someone knocks.
C: FRANCES
D: Come in.
N: A FAT MAN ENTERS, stares at her.
C: FRANCES
D: Hi.
E: relaxed
N: He is dumbfounded. He slowly retreats into the hall.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Barnes is talking to a Young Man whom we recognize as the reporter who tricked Frances in New York.
C: BARNES
D: You wouldn't believe the offers! Just piling in. I mean piling. Some of the best scripts I've read in years!
C: YOUNG REPORTER
D: Yes? My employer will be glad to hear that.
E: sarcastic
C: BARNES
D: Louella? Is she here?
C: YOUNG REPORTER
D: How could you miss her?
N: He nods toward a hard-faced OLDER WOMAN surrounded by admirers.
C: BARNES
D: Louella's here and I'm talking to you?
S: INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: We SEE the open door to the bathroom. Frances, with a towel around her, is going through Connie's closet. Barnes KNOCKS.
C: BARNES
D: Frances? Oh no.
E: enters, sees her
C: FRANCES
D: Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
C: BARNES
D: What're you doing?
E: aghast
C: FRANCES
D: Putting on my armor.
C: BARNES
D: Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
C: FRANCES
D: Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
E: musing
C: BARNES
D: Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
C: FRANCES
D: 'Forgive'...? For What?
E: darkly
C: BARNES
D: I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
N: Frances pulls down a dress and inspects it.
C: FRANCES
D: You're not kidding. Get me a refill, Bob. I'll be down in a minute.
E: firmly
N: He nods and retreats out the door.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Everyone chattering away... then hushing slightly. Heads turn: Frances is descending the stairway in one of Connie's dresses. She looks absolutely radiant... like some kind of goddess. Barnes, looking very pleased at her appearance and the others' reaction, hands her the drink.
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you.
N: Then the Young Reporter steps forward.
C: YOUNG REPORTER
D: Gee, awful good to see ya again, Miss Farmer.
E: his callow youth act
N: Frances bristles. Barnes looks on nervously: It's all becoming unravelled again.
C: YOUNG REPORTER
D: My employer would like to know something very important: is it true your friend Clifford sleeps in the nude?
N: Frances is broiling. She stares at him. Under her steady gaze, the snide smile gradually fades from his face.
C: FRANCES
D: You seem like an intelligent young man.
C: YOUNG REPORTER
D: Huh?
C: FRANCES
D: Can't you find a more dignified way to make a living?
N: He blanches. This hits home. Frances turns on her heel and leaves.
S: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Frances rushes out, followed by Barnes and a few curious partygoers. She is very upset. Tight. Holding it in. Barnes pleads with her, tries to stop her, but she leaps in the car and speeds off, spewing gravel over him. The partygoers salute her with their drinks.
S: EXT. A CLIFFSIDE COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: In the pale moonlight we SEE the dim outline of a poster tacked to the outside wall. The highway disappears down to the sea glittering dully in the distance. We HEAR the RISING SOUND of an approaching car. Its headlights crest the hill, illuminating the poster, showing a woman driving an open car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure. The poster reads, "When You're Riding Alone, You're Riding with Hitler." The lights grow brighter, almost blinding. The car, accelerating furiously, flashes by. Then we HEAR a motorcycle start up. It emerges from the blackness and speeds off in pursuit. A roadsign reads: "Dimout Zone." Frances drives fast, tears running her face. The MOTORCYCLE COP pulls up alongside and shouts, "Pull over!" She hesitates. He waves insistently. Gradually she slows. He gets off his bike and walks over, preparing the usual lecture.
C: COP
D: Okay...
N: He leans over the car and sees Frances, her hair wild and tangled.
C: COP
D: Hey, where's the fire, sister?
E: a come-on
C: FRANCES
D: In my eyes, officer.
E: sarcastic
C: COP
D: Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?" There's a war on, you know?
E: switching off her lights
C: FRANCES
D: Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
C: COP
D: I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
E: testy
N: She switches her headlights back on.
C: FRANCES
D: God, you bore me.
N: She starts the car. The Cop, angry now, lunges in and grabs the keys.
C: FRANCES
D: Don't touch me!
N: She leaps out of the car. The Cop turns off the car lights. As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights.
C: COP
D: Hey!
N: He runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way. When he catches her, he grabs her arm. She struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt. She switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. He lunges for it, knocks her down. They struggle. He rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff her. She writhes, knees him in the balls. She crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones. The Cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. The Cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. He pulls out his radio mike.
C: COP
D: Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six. I got a live one here.
E: panting
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. BEACH HOUSE BALCONY - DAY
N: CLOSE ON front page of the Los Angeles Times, October 1942. The headlines read: "24 Jap Ships Sunk", "Errol Flynn Sex Trial Delayed", "Frances Farmer Arrested on Drunk Driving Charge -- Actress Gets $250 Fine and Six Months Probation." CAMERA PULLS BACK to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of Frances' beach house. As the papers ruffle in the wind, a little kitten swipes at them. Frances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one we saw at the opening of the film. A man's shoes COME INTO VIEW.
C: HARRY
D: Got any ginger beer?
E: O.S.
N: She turns, surprised and pleased to see him.
C: FRANCES
D: Take a look.
N: He walks off into the kitchen. She puts her diary away.
C: FRANCES
D: How the hell do you find me anyway?
E: calling
C: HARRY
D: Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
E: O.S. she laughs
C: FRANCES
D: What's left of my blood.
C: HARRY
D: Think I'll have a glass.
E: O.S.
C: FRANCES
D: Help yourself. Everyone else has.
N: Harry returns, sipping the drink.
C: HARRY
D: Very tasty.
N: She smiles.
C: HARRY
D: Nice joint. Can you afford it?
E: looking around
C: FRANCES
D: Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: What for?
C: FRANCES
D: For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
C: HARRY
D: Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
N: She laughs.
C: HARRY
D: Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
C: FRANCES
D: I took the early rounds.
C: HARRY
D: I'll bet.
E: laughs
C: FRANCES
D: I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
C: HARRY
D: So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
C: HARRY
D: Beats me.
N: Beat.
C: FRANCES
D: I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out of this town.
N: We see a thought come to him.
C: HARRY
D: Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
C: FRANCES
D: No, Harry, I can't --
E: right now
C: HARRY
D: You're coming.
S: INT. SAN DIEGO BAR - NIGHT
N: Waterfront bar, full of SAILORS, WHORES, and HEAVY DRINKERS. Hanging over the bar is San Diego paraphernalia. Frances and Harry sit at a table. Heavy boozing has led to philosophizing:
C: FRANCES
D: You know... when I started acting, you know what I wanted?
N: He grunts: what?
C: FRANCES
D: I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
C: HARRY
D: And?
C: FRANCES
D: Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
N: In the background, we SEE a DRUNKEN SAILOR lurching toward their table.
C: HARRY
D: Well, like the man said: "You can make a fresh start with your last breath."
N: The Sailor trips and falls across their table, spilling beer on Frances and knocking things over.
C: FRANCES
D: Hey, watch it.
E: irritated
C: SAILOR
D: Watch what?
E: eyeing her suggestively
C: FRANCES
D: Get away from me, you foul slime.
C: SAILOR
D: That's no way for a lady to talk.
C: HARRY
D: Take a walk, pal.
C: FRANCES
D: Who said I was a lady?
C: SAILOR
D: Sorry I insulted you... bitch.
C: HARRY
D: Hey!
C: FRANCES
D: Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat.
N: The Sailor goes berserk, takes a swing at Frances. Harry leaps in to protect her, starts to fight with the Sailor. Frances joins in; she's not going to let anyone fight her battles. The Sailor's BUDDY enters the fracas. Everyone's getting hit. As the melee continues we:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FRANCES' BEACH HOUSE - DAY
N: A cab pulls up. Frances gets out. She looks weary and has a bruise on her cheek. A car is parked in the driveway. She frowns at it, shrugs, and carries her suitcase toward the house.
S: INT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
N: She enters with her bags, then drops them, stunned. The house is stripped bare. A MAN holding a measuring tape comes out of the bedroom.
C: FRANCES
D: What happened? Who're you?
C: MAN
D: Who're you?
C: FRANCES
D: I live here.
C: MAN
D: You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
C: FRANCES
D: What?
C: MAN
D: I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
N: Frances stares at him, dumbfounded.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
N: Frances on the phone. Boxes spread out, their contents strewn over the floor, tables, etc. Frances is going through various piles, again and again, looking for something...
C: FRANCES
D: God damn it, god damn it... Yes, I'll wait, I'm waiting... I don't believe this. They can't do this to me!
E: muttering into phone to herself
N: She takes a long drink, sifts through a pile, then throws it on the bed in disgust. We HEAR a voice on the phone.
C: FRANCES
D: Barnes? It's my diary! They stole my fucking diary! Find it, will you? Find it! God damn it, that's my life!
E: into phone
N: She slams down the phone.
S: INT. STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY
N: The crew is idle and the Director paces, muttering:
C: DIRECTOR
D: Never. Never again. I swear, I swear I will never work with this broad --
N: Frances, looking pretty hung-over, enters blithely.
C: DIRECTOR
D: You're four hours late! It's insane! It's unprofessional!
C: FRANCES
D: I'd say I'm behaving as professionally as anyone else in this town.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Where were you?!
C: FRANCES
D: Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept. What's the name of this fine entertainment we're all so involved in?
N: The Director clenches his fists as though about to punch her.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh yes. "No Escape." That's it. There's no escape.
E: looking blearly at the slate
N: She walks to her dressing room as the Director explodes anew.
S: INT. FRANCES' DRESSING ROOM - DAY
N: Small, cramped; not like the earlier one we saw. The Hairdresser -- whom we recognize as Tora, the woman who cut Bebe's hair -- stands waiting, holding her brushes and looking vexed. Frances enters.
C: TORA
D: It's about time! You're not the star on this show, y'know!
N: Frances sits. Tora begins brushing her hair, yanking Frances' head back with each stroke. Building tension...
C: TORA
D: Of course, it's not up to me to say anything. I'm just crew... Y'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful. Wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves. In fact, I think you are already... Fact, I think you better --
N: Frances cries out and twists around suddenly. Tora is thrown back: stumbling... falling... hitting her jaw against a chair.
C: FRANCES
D: That's it! I'm not taking this any more! I quit!
N: She storms out. Tora is left moaning, holding her jaw.
S: INT. STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY
N: Frances marches across it. Everyone stares.
C: FRANCES
D: Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!...
N: When she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them all, grandiloquently.
S: INT. FRANCES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: She's snoring in bed. Face down, spread-eagled. The light is on. A whiskey bottle (three-quarters empty), a tumbler (three- quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table. The phone RINGS. She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over. Her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off.
C: FRANCES
D: Shit.
N: The phone keeps RINGING. Her arm gropes for it. A loud POUNDING at the door.
C: FRANCES
D: What the hell's going on here? Hold on! Hello... Hello?
E: calls answering phone we HEAR a dial tone
N: The POUNDING at the door becomes violent. Someone's breaking it down.
C: FRANCES
D: Hey!
N: The door splinters.
C: FRANCES
D: What...? Help!
N: Men stream into the room. Back-lit from the hall they look like monsters, phantoms. They're carrying sticks. Frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom.
C: FRANCES
D: Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
N: She slams the door on the advancing figures.
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Frances leans her weight against the door.
C: FRANCES
D: Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't let them kill me!
N: It's too much for her. She's shoved back, falling to the floor. The door flies open revealing THREE LARGE COPS. Leering at her. Frances clutches at the shower curtain, trying to cover herself.
C: COP
D: Get your clothes on.
C: FRANCES
D: You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
E: crying
C: COP
D: Get your clothes on, lady --
C: FRANCES
D: GET OUT!
C: COP
D: You're under arrest.
S: INT. SANTA MONICA POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Frances is being led to the booking desk. All around her Photographers snap her picture, and Reporters walk alongside subjecting her to a never-ending barrage of questions. Frances just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour-faced SERGEANT facing her.
C: SERGEANT
D: Name?
C: FRANCES
D: I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
N: The Photographers laugh.
C: SERGEANT
D: Age?
C: FRANCES
D: Fifteen.
C: SERGEANT
D: Address?
E: bristling
C: FRANCES
D: Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
C: SERGEANT
D: Occupation?
N: Frances considers for a moment, then smiles matter-of-factly.
C: FRANCES
D: Cocksucker.
N: The Sergeant reddens. Frances laughs as the Photographers snap their shots.
S: INT. WOMEN'S JAIL - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
N: TWO MATRONS escort Frances to her cell. She shakes their hands off her arms and enters. They slide the door shut. Photographers press up to the bars. Frances calls after the matrons.
C: FRANCES
D: Hey! I'd like to leave a wake-up call for say, ten? Hey! I'll have my bread and water in bed!
N: Frances looks disgustedly at the Photographers and lies down heavily on the cot.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Hey Frances! Why don't you comb your hair, okay?
C: FRANCES
D: ...Take me the way I am.
S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: Frances, looking disheveled, dazed, and over-tired from a sleepless night in jail, stands alone before the JUDGE. Next to the PROSECUTOR sits Tora, her jaw heavily bandaged, glaring at Frances. The spectator's section is packed.
C: JUDGE
D: ...Is that not true?
C: FRANCES
D: Who's writing this guy's lines?
E: under her breath
C: JUDGE
D: Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
C: FRANCES
D: No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
C: JUDGE
D: Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
C: FRANCES
D: I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
C: JUDGE
D: Did you expect him to look you up?
C: FRANCES
D: Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
N: Suppressed laughter ripples through the courtroom.
C: JUDGE
D: You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
C: FRANCES
D: That's fine with me... Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
E: turning to spectators
C: JUDGE
D: Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
C: FRANCES
D: Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
C: JUDGE
D: Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
N: Frances moves closer to the bench.
C: FRANCES
D: Are you telling me you didn't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning? I can smell it from here, Your Honor.
N: The courtroom erupts into surprised laughter.
C: JUDGE
D: That's enough!
N: Frances laughs triumphantly and spears the air with her finger, pointing at the Judge.
C: FRANCES
D: It's the truth! I can smell it from here -- you old hypocrite!
N: The laughter grows. The Judge bangs his gavel.
C: JUDGE
D: Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
C: FRANCES
D: Fine!
C: JUDGE
D: You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
E: rising
N: The Judge pounds his gavel. Frances is about to say something when suddenly the realization of what's happening hits her. The Judge is leaving the bench. A REPORTER runs out of the room.
C: FRANCES
D: Wait a minute... I haven't got a lawyer...
E: frightened now
N: The Judge ignores this.
C: FRANCES
D: What I want to know is do I have any civil rights?
E: shouting
N: The Judge closes his chambers door behind him. Frances turns slowly. The Matrons are coming toward her.
C: FRANCES
D: I want to make a phone call...
N: She lunges at the Matrons, trying to get past them.
C: FRANCES
D: I have a right to make a phone call!
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE COURTROOM - A ROW OF PHONE BOOTHS - DAY
N: The Reporter is phoning in his story. The hallway is pandemonium.
C: REPORTER
D: "The kleig-lighted road to fame and fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair. Today film star Frances Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and drugs" -- 'm I going too fast for ya?
E: from his notes
N: In the next phone booth we SEE Harry listening to the Reporter's spiel. He regards the confusion around him with calm eyes.
S: EXT. THE COURTROOM DOORS - DAY
N: They burst open. The Matrons and Two Cops come out carrying Frances. Reporters and Photographers rush past her.
C: FRANCES
D: They're stealing my civil rights! Help me! I'm being kidnapped! Oh God, help me! Help me!
N: She suddenly sees the phone booths. Her eyes fill with tears, her shoulders slump forward and her lower lip begins to tremble. She no longer struggles.
C: FRANCES
D: Haven't you ever had a broken heart?
E: to a Matron
N: The Matron relaxes her grip and gives Frances a handkerchief. Frances dabs at her eyes... wraps the kerchief around her knuckles... and slugs the Matron in the jaw, sending her sprawling. Frances runs to the phones.
C: REPORTER
D: Oh my God, she's loose!
N: Frances throws herself at the door of the booth. The Reporter is delirious with joy: what a story!
C: REPORTER
D: She's attacking your correspondent! Right here in the Court Building! Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone stop her!
N: Frances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to the next booth... into the arms of Harry.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry!
E: a whisper
N: Harry shakes his head. Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator.
C: FRANCES
D: I have a right! I have a right!
C: REPORTER
D: With what must surely be the final act of madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer's once promising career. The crazed blonde who at 27...
E: into phone
N: Harry opens the door to his booth. The Reporter looks up at him.
C: REPORTER
D: Hold it a second, Bub...
N: Harry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the face. The Reporter sags, out like a light. In the confusion, no one has noticed a thing. Harry pulls the door shut.
S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: Frances is sitting in a wooden chair. The venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed. The room is dim and terribly quiet. A WOMAN is murmuring something to a kindly-looking JUDGE. Another MAN is standing beside her. Frances can't quite make out the words.
C: WOMAN
D: ...and we feel that this would be more appropriate.
C: JUDGE
D: ...a difficult decision, but, I'm sure, the proper one.
N: He nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn away from the bench. As they pass in front of one of the tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman. It is Alma Styles.
C: FRANCES
D: What?
N: She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. Her mother's face appears by hers.
C: LILLIAN
D: It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
E: whispering
C: FRANCES
D: Mama, what's...
C: LILLIAN
D: Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
C: FRANCES
D: You're taking me home!
N: Two other WOMEN appear at either side of Frances and Lillian. Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands.
C: LILLIAN
D: First things first, little sister. Trust me.
E: smiling
N: She kisses Frances on the forehead. Frances looks at the two Women. They are smiling understandingly at Lillian. Frances looks a little alarmed.
S: EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY
N: A wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a white-washed wall are black letters: "MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene. The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees.
S: INT. A SMALL OFFICE - DAY
N: Frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance.
C: LILLIAN
D: Why it's beautiful here! What a view!
N: Lillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that. An awkward moment of silence. Lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters. He holds his right hand out to Frances.
C: MAN
D: Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr. Symington.
N: Frances stares at the proffered hand. Lillian steps in quickly and takes it.
C: LILLIAN
D: Good afternoon, Doctor.
N: The Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's arm.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here.
N: He smiles pleasantly. Lillian is obviously very put off by the idea. She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the window.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're...
C: SYMINGTON
D: I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment.
N: He goes to the door and opens it. Lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces. She bends down and tightly hugs Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl.
N: She waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door.
C: FRANCES
D: Mama!
E: staring out window
N: Lillian turns back expectantly.
C: FRANCES
D: ...I want to go home, Mama.
E: warningly
N: Lillian looks to the Doctor, who nods sympathetically at her.
C: LILLIAN
D: You'll see, little sister. Everything will be fine. The doctors know best.
N: She goes out and down the hall. The Doctor closes the door.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
C: FRANCES
D: Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Thanks are hardly necessary.
C: FRANCES
D: Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
C: FRANCES
D: It ain't for lack of trying.
C: SYMINGTON
D: So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
C: FRANCES
D: Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
E: seductively
N: He reddens ever so slightly and looks away.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I feel I've known you for a long time... you see, I've followed your career... you're a fascinating case... I'm looking forward to resolving your predicament.
N: Frances' face begins to set in hard planes.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh! Are you really?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
E: can cripple your ability to function...
N: He stops as Frances rises and leans over his desk:
C: FRANCES
D: Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Please sit down...
C: FRANCES
D: You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I see.
C: FRANCES
D: Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
C: SYMINGTON
D: And what's that?
C: FRANCES
D: Normal. Average.
C: SYMINGTON
D: All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says.
E: smiling
C: FRANCES
D: ...Did you really say that?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
C: FRANCES
D: This whole thing is a joke!
C: SYMINGTON
D: Stay calm, please.
C: FRANCES
D: No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
E: soft, seductive turning harder very hard
C: SYMINGTON
D: I'll have someone show you to your room.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
N: Symington stares at her. With a careful, almost scientific gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip, then rubs the two fingers together. Yes, there is sweat.
C: SYMINGTON
D: You really should get some rest now. Nurse will meet you outside. Good day.
N: He pushes a button on his desk and reaches for a folder. Frances hasn't moved. She gazes at him evenly.
C: SYMINGTON
D: Is there something else?
C: FRANCES
D: You didn't say 'Symington says'.
N: His eyes are very calm now, he smiles at her patronizingly.
C: SYMINGTON
D: Symington says.
S: INT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY
N: Small, white, spartan and rather pleasant. Lillian is standing by the window, testing the locks. She turns and goes to the bed, fussing with the pillow, seeming very uncomfortable. She pulls at the corners of the mattress. The door opens and a tall, sullen-looking MATRON walks in. Lillian doesn't pay much attention to her.
C: LILLIAN
D: Not much on hospital corners, are you?
C: MATRON
D: You Farmer?
N: Something in her tone makes Lillian look up. The Matron closes the door behind her and advances. Lillian assumes her full height.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Frances is walking with a NURSE. They pass a variety of other patients, some of whom look old or beaten but few of whom seem overtly crazy.
C: FRANCES
D: So this is the nuthouse...
N: The Nurse smiles confidentially at her.
C: NURSE
D: Honey... take my word for it. This is a resort.
N: They get to the door and HEAR Lillian's protesting voice:
C: LILLIAN
D: You have no right!
E: O.S.
N: They enter and SEE the Matron struggling to get Lillian's coat away from her. Lillian pleads with Frances.
C: LILLIAN
D: Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
C: FRANCES
D: Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
N: Frances bursts out laughing. The Matron releases Lillian and comes for Frances.
S: INT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY CLOSE-UP OF A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
N: A little fluid squirts out the tip.
C: FRANCES
D: But what is it?
E: O.S.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Frances strapped down on a white cot. The Nurse is holding the syringe while a THIN NURSE and an ATTENDANT stand by.
C: FRANCES
D: You've got to tell me what it is!
C: THIN NURSE
D: It's insulin. It throws your body into shock.
N: Frances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic.
C: NURSE WITH HYPO
D: It's just vitamins.
E: reassuringly
N: This sounds more reasonable. Frances relaxes somewhat.
C: NURSE WITH HYPO
D: A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals... Just stay relaxed... Good, now open your mouth a sec.
E: inserting hypo
N: Frances does. The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth. Frances squirms, fights. The Attendant holds the bar in place. And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo. Frances goes rigid. Her eyes widen, her back arches. With a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse. The SCREEN BEGINS TO FADE into bright white light. She is unconscious. The SCREEN IS NOW BLANK.
S: EXT. COURTYARD - MEADOW WOOD - DAY
N: Frances sits beside Lillian on a bench. Other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about. There is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to Frances. Frances seems restless.
C: LILLIAN
D: ...and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time.
N: She hands it to Frances, who lets it drop beside her on the bench.
C: LILLIAN
D: And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
C: FRANCES
D: Why are these all opened?
C: LILLIAN
D: Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
C: FRANCES
D: Then why did you bring them?
C: LILLIAN
D: It's your fan mail, little sister.
C: FRANCES
D: You kill me, Mama.
E: looking off, under her breath
C: LILLIAN
D: What?
C: FRANCES
D: Go on...
N: Frances sighs. She looks for something to divert her attention.
S: INT. SYMINGTON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Frances is alone in the room. The door is ajar. She's standing over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad. The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic... After a moment, Symington ENTERS holding several folders. Frances' manner changes very subtly.
C: SYMINGTON
D: ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
C: FRANCES
D: Yes. It was very good to see her.
E: sitting
C: SYMINGTON
D: Really? Any problems?
N: Symington puts the folders in a drawer. All except Frances'.
C: FRANCES
D: Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
E: a performance
C: SYMINGTON
D: You're telling me you feel guilty.
C: FRANCES
D: No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
E: slightly edgy
C: SYMINGTON
D: Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
E: after a pause
C: FRANCES
D: What?
E: laughing
C: SYMINGTON
D: She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
C: FRANCES
D: I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
C: SYMINGTON
D: And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh for Christ's...
N: Frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief around her knuckles. Looks a little crazy. Symington's watching it. She stops.
C: FRANCES
D: I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
C: SYMINGTON
D: But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
C: FRANCES
D: Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
C: SYMINGTON
D: Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
C: FRANCES
D: You what?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
N: Frances stares at him. Stunned. Horrified.
C: SYMINGTON
D: I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
E: smiling
C: FRANCES
D: Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
C: SYMINGTON
D: Huh?
C: FRANCES
D: 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
N: Symington smiles patronizingly.
C: FRANCES
D: I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
C: SYMINGTON
D: Frances, I'm warning you...
E: calmly
C: FRANCES
D: No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
E: she knocks her folder to the floor she grabs some pencils and throws them at him she pounds on the inter-com; a voice says, 'Yes, Doctor?'
N: She tears open the door. Two huge ORDERLIES are waiting. Frances tries to barrel past, but they easily restrain her.
C: ORDERLY
D: Doc?
N: Symington sits forward, his hands smoothing his hair. Frances smiles sarcastically at him:
C: FRANCES
D: Symington says...
C: SYMINGTON
D: Sedate her.
E: tonelessly
N: They haul her away.
S: EXT. MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME - DAY
N: A few PATIENTS stroll about, visiting with relatives. Frances lies on a chaise lounge. She's wearing a robe and dark glasses, a big hat, and she seems to be sleeping. THE CAMERA APPROACHES. Her hair is a mess, her skin splotchy. And something is moving: her hand... one finger on one hand is moving in agitated little bursts. We realize she is not sleeping at all...
C: HARRY
D: Hi there. How 'bout a walk in the woods?
E: O.S.
N: She looks to one side and sees him. Frowns. Takes off her glasses and runs her fingers nervously through her hair.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh my God, I look awful.
C: HARRY
D: You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
E: friendly
S: EXT. MEADOW WOOD GROUNDS - DAY
N: Frances and Harry walking in a relatively secluded area. She glances around continuously... suspiciously.
C: FRANCES
D: They're doin' stuff to me, Harry. Can you see it? You feel it? They're putting stuff in my food or something, my water, and they're using it to put thoughts in my head. You understand? They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry!
N: She breaks down and weeps on Harry's shoulder. Harry looks around warily.
C: FRANCES
D: I can't stay here anymore, you understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta get home. I gotta get somewhere else, anywhere, okay?
N: Harry nods, squeezes her arm firmly -- a warning -- as a white-coated ATTENDANT APPROACHES. Frances straightens up.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Oh, Miss Farmer! Time for your bath, Miss Farmer!
C: HARRY
D: Listen: to the left. Straight through the trees and over the wall to your left. My car is there.
E: urgent whisper
N: The Attendant reaches them.
C: ATTENDANT
D: It's time for your bath!
E: as if to a child
C: FRANCES
D: Oh good. I love my baths.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Come along now.
N: Frances starts to move off with the Attendant. For an instant Harry -- and we -- wonder if she really is crazy.
C: HARRY
D: Frances! Did you hear what I said?
N: She turns. The Attendant turns. She smiles sweetly, madly.
C: FRANCES
D: Of course, Harry.
N: The Attendant is between her and Harry. We SEE her face turn dark. She shoves the Attendant toward Harry and shouts:
C: FRANCES
D: Over the walls!
E: fiercely
N: She runs. The Attendant staggers toward Harry, who knocks him down with two punches. ANOTHER ATTENDANT runs up. Harry whips out an icepick and brandishes it at them:
C: HARRY
D: You want crazy? I'll show you crazy!
N: The Attendants hold their ground. Harry runs after Frances.
S: EXT. GROVE OF TREES - DAY
N: Frances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall.
C: HARRY
D: Here.
E: offering to lift her
N: Frances hugs him tightly, kisses him. He lifts her by the waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up. Harry joins her. We SEE, over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr waiting on a dirt road. Harry and Frances jump down as we HEAR the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up. As their heads pop over the top of the wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust...
S: INT. LINCOLN - DUSK - DAY
N: Harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead. The RADIO DRONES quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad. After a while, there's movement in the back seat and Frances sits up. She yawns and stretches as Harry watches her in the mirror.
C: HARRY
D: Evening, gorgeous.
C: FRANCES
D: That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
E: yawning leaning over front seat
C: HARRY
D: Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
C: FRANCES
D: Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
N: Harry smiles. Frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio.
C: FRANCES
D: Where are we, mean man?
C: HARRY
D: Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
C: FRANCES
D: I should've known...
C: HARRY
D: What?
C: FRANCES
D: This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
C: HARRY
D: That's right.
C: FRANCES
D: ...Take advantage of me.
E: smiling
N: Harry laughs. They pass a poster: "BUY WAR BONDS!" Frances stares at it.
C: FRANCES
D: I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
C: HARRY
D: Whattaya think you're in now?
C: FRANCES
D: I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
E: sleepily
C: HARRY
D: Huh?
C: FRANCES
D: A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
N: Harry looks at her quizzically.
C: HARRY
D: Who to?
N: Beat.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
C: HARRY
D: Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
C: FRANCES
D: No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
E: sitting up
C: HARRY
D: Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
N: She rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften. She looks at him fondly, thoughtfully.
C: FRANCES
D: You know something, Harry?
C: HARRY
D: I guess.
C: FRANCES
D: Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
C: HARRY
D: What's that?
C: FRANCES
D: You can't drink.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The Lincoln is parked beside a few other cars.
S: INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Frances and Harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses. The JUKEBOX PLAYS, a few COUPLES dance. Frances is gulping down a tall Scotch.
C: FRANCES
D: Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
E: wincing/grinning
C: HARRY
D: Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
E: calling drunkenly
C: FRANCES
D: What a man!
C: HARRY
D: Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
C: FRANCES
D: To quarter-horses.
E: hoisting her glass
C: HARRY
D: No. To thoroughbreds.
N: He knocks back his drink. THE JUKEBOX A hand puts a nickel in, and we HEAR Bing Crosby singing "Love Is So Terrific." We PAN across the dance floor, where Harry and Frances are dancing.
C: BING'S VOICE
D: Love is so terrific Such a funny feeling Makes you want to cuddle And coo...
N: Frances squeals with delight when she hears the song. She holds Harry forcefully and starts to lead him around the floor. Harry starts to sing along: BING & HARRY Makes you sentimental, Makes you kinda gentle Ouch! (Frances pinches Harry) Terrific thing. Around them an infection is spreading: all the women are leading their men. For an instant it is magical, liberating... She leans her head against his shoulder.
C: FRANCES
D: Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
C: HARRY
D: Huh?
C: FRANCES
D: You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
C: HARRY
D: Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
C: FRANCES
D: I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
E: after a long pause
C: HARRY
D: Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
E: a bitter smile
N: They are silent for a moment.
C: HARRY
D: There's just one more thing.
C: FRANCES
D: What's that?
C: HARRY
D: Will you marry me?
N: She laughs happily. He joins her, but his seems a little forced. She leans her head on his shoulder and holds him tight. They dance...
S: EXT. FARMER HOUSE - SEATTLE - DAY
N: The Lincoln, Harry at the wheel, drives up and stops. Harry shakes his head.
C: HARRY
D: It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
C: FRANCES
D: Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
C: HARRY
D: You give up on her?
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
C: HARRY
D: Frances, You're crazy.
E: smiling warmly
C: FRANCES
D: I know. Don't tell anyone.
E: whispers
N: He laughs. We SEE Lillian come out onto the porch with uncharacteristic trepidation.
C: HARRY
D: Anyway... if you need me...
C: FRANCES
D: I got your number, Mister Man.
E: warmly
N: She gets out, waves to him, and walks toward the house. Harry drives off. As Frances reaches the top step, Lillian suddenly opens her arms:
C: LILLIAN
D: Welcome home, little sister.
E: nervous, forced
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
N: Frances and Lillian enter. On the sofa sits Alma Styles. Alma and Lillian seem slightly furtive. Caught in the act.
C: FRANCES
D: Well, who have we here...?
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
E: anxiously
C: STYLES
D: Hello, Frances. You seem to be having quite a time of it.
C: LILLIAN
D: I called Alma because I think we'll need...
C: STYLES
D: Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood have petitioned the court for your return. Your mother has asked me to intervene so you can stay here.
C: LILLIAN
D: I swear I didn't know what they were doing to you. I wouldn't have let them...
N: She bursts into tears. Frances takes her in her arms and rocks her like a child.
C: FRANCES
D: It's okay, Mama. It's okay.
C: STYLES
D: You realize, of course, your mother is now your legal guardian. In the eyes of the law, you no longer have any rights as an adult. You're going to have to hold your tongue and be selective about whom you mix with. That man who drove you here, for instance --
C: FRANCES
D: You leave him out of this!
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances, please don't...
C: STYLES
D: Never mind. We won't have to worry about him much longer.
S: EXT. LINCOLN - END OF FRANCES' STREET - DAY
N: Harry pulls up at a stop sign. He rubs his forehead wearily as a car crosses the intersection. It stops dead in front of him. Another pulls up alongside. Another behind. Harry thinks about this. His hand slides down slowly under the seat. We SEE the handle of his ice pick. Harry turns to smile at the MAN in the next car. The Man flashes an FBI badge, points revolver:
C: FBI MAN
D: How ya doin', Al?
E: smiling
C: HARRY
D: You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum.
C: FBI MAN
D: No, it ain't. And it ain't Harry York, neither.
C: HARRY
D: Look, I'm tellin' you...
N: The FBI Man pulls the hammer back on the revolver. ANOTHER MAN opens the passenger door.
C: FBI MAN
D: I'd give you till ten, Al, but we ain't got the time.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS
N: Judge Hillier walking... out of the chamber and down a corridor. His stride is long, his demeanor purposeful. The corridor leads into a courtroom. Harry standing at attention. We hear Hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official. Harry stares up at the judge.
C: HILLIER
D: Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns, Thomas Slocum, Harry York... Mr. Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years. Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed -- inciting to riot -- and the cause you sought to promote -- a worker's rebellion -- are such anathemas to this court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. I only wish it were longer. Six months in the state penitentiary.
E: slamming gavel
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
N: Frances sits at the piano playing "You Are My Sunshine". Lillian is lounging on the couch, leafing happily through her scrapbook.
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton'.
N: Frances' brows mesh.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
C: LILLIAN
D: Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
N: Frances sighs and begins to play it. Lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along.
C: LILLIAN
D: It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish... but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook.
N: She smiles warmly at Frances. Frances abruptly stops playing.
C: FRANCES
D: I think I need a little air.
C: LILLIAN
D: What's wrong?
C: FRANCES
D: Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
C: LILLIAN
D: Where are you going?
C: FRANCES
D: For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
N: She gets up and Lillian rouses herself.
C: LILLIAN
D: How long will you be?
C: FRANCES
D: Not long.
N: Frances goes down the hall for her coat. Lillian follows part way.
C: LILLIAN
D: I'll have lunch ready by one.
E: smiling
C: FRANCES
D: I'll be back.
C: LILLIAN
D: At one. Promise?
C: FRANCES
D: Sure.
N: Frances returns wearing the coat. Lillian half-blocking her path.
C: LILLIAN
D: Say you promise.
C: FRANCES
D: I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
N: Lillian nods, moves aside. As Frances heads for the door:
C: LILLIAN
D: You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
C: FRANCES
D: Yes, Mama.
E: exiting
C: LILLIAN
D: I don't want you drinking, Frances.
C: FRANCES
D: Yes, Mama.
N: Lillian enters and re-establishes herself on the couch with a happy smile. She begins to hum "Flow Gently Sweet Afton"
S: INT. FLEA-BAG HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
N: DERELICTS sleep on broken couches and armchairs. In a corner by a pay phone Ernest Farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs. Frances sits across from him. They've been talking.
C: FRANCES
D: ...So what do you think?
C: ERNEST
D: I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
C: FRANCES
D: I know that, Dad, but --
C: ERNEST
D: What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
C: FRANCES
D: But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
C: ERNEST
D: Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
E: after a pause
C: FRANCES
D: Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
C: ERNEST
D: Always. Always.
N: Frances rises from her chair, looking around the room to hide her tears. Ernest rises too.
C: ERNEST
D: I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
E: it's not a proper office
C: FRANCES
D: I don't care, Dad. I love you.
C: ERNEST
D: I love you too, Francie.
N: They look at each other across the desk for an uncomfortable moment, then Frances slowly leaves. He looks sadly after her.
S: EXT. FLEA-BAG HOTEL - DAY
N: Frances exits and starts across the road. Ernest comes to the window to watch her leave. It is raining and the water on the glass distorts his view.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - FRANCES' ROOM - DAY
N: Lillian is straightening up Frances' room, rearranging things to suit herself. She hears the door slam downstairs.
C: FRANCES
D: I'm back, Mama.
E: O.S.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
E: coming into hall
C: FRANCES
D: Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
E: excited
N: She goes to hug her mother, but Lillian has changed. Frances' news has chilled her.
C: LILLIAN
D: Don't... talk crazy.
E: coming down stairs
C: FRANCES
D: Mama...?
C: LILLIAN
D: They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
E: entering living room
N: She points to a stack of letters on the table.
C: FRANCES
D: Haven't you heard what I said?
C: LILLIAN
D: I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
C: FRANCES
D: I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
C: LILLIAN
D: You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
C: FRANCES
D: No!
C: LILLIAN
D: You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
C: FRANCES
D: Mama, shut up!
C: LILLIAN
D: And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
C: FRANCES
D: You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
E: sudden realization
N: Frances grabs her coat.
C: LILLIAN
D: Where are you going?
C: FRANCES
D: I'm going out!
C: LILLIAN
D: You're not going anywhere!
C: FRANCES
D: Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
C: LILLIAN
D: Frances!
N: They're wrestling, Lillian trying to prevent her from leaving.
C: FRANCES
D: Don't you try and stop me. Don't you dare!
N: She grabs Lillian's wrists and twists them, throws her back.
C: FRANCES
D: If you follow me, Mama, I swear I'll fucking kill you!
N: Frances storms out. Lillian sits back in the chair, suddenly looking very old. She massages her wrists...
C: LILLIAN
D: That's it. You've done it now, little sister.
S: INT. LARGE OFFICE - DAY
N: Dark. Blinds drawn. We SEE a single light with a green shade, HEAR the soft coo of Lillian's voice. The CAMERA SHIFTS gradually onto her earnest face.
C: LILLIAN
D: All my life, I've tried to live up to my parents' example. To have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great. I taught that to Frances: Speak out. Aspire. Make something of yourself, something --
E: to be proud of
C: DR. DOYLE
D: Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer --
E: bored
C: ALMA STYLES
D: Frances has always been a battleground, Lillian.
N: DR. DOYLE, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with Judge Hillier around a table.
C: DOYLE
D: The point is: it's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse?
C: LILLIAN
D: Well... yes.
N: Doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him.
C: DOYLE
D: And you feel you're unable to control her any longer?
C: LILLIAN
D: No... I mean, yes, Doctor.
N: Alma holds up Lillian's bruised wrists as evidence.
C: DOYLE
D: And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution?
C: LILLIAN
D: Well, Alma told me that...
N: Alma looks coolly at Lillian.
C: LILLIAN
D: ...Yes.
N: Hillier nods slightly, approvingly, toward Alma.
C: DOYLE
D: I believe that's all I need to know about Miss Farmer.
E: closing his folder
C: HILLIER
D: I think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Richardson.
C: LILLIAN
D: Her married name?
C: HILLIER
D: Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum.
C: LILLIAN
D: ...Oh yes.
C: HILLIER
D: Now. Can you tell us where we might find Frances?
S: INT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BAR - NIGHT
N: It's late. Frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted DRINKERS.
C: FRANCES
D: ...Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.'
N: Behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain. In the street a police car cruises slowly past.
C: FRANCES
D: Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street.
C: RRRAAAAAAA!!!
D: Gigantic footsteps... coming closer. Stopping.
E: stomping her feet
N: We SEE the police car again... It stops out front.
C: FRANCES
D: Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere.
N: TWO COPS appear at the window, looking in.
C: FRANCES
D: He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!'
N: Everyone laughs. A long moment of enjoyment. Then Frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops.
S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: Hillier behind the bench. Doyle sits at a table with Alma Styles. A COURT RECORDER taps out his notes in an odd, jerky style. (NOTE: This scene is INTERCUT, where appropriate, with shots of FRANCES in a bare room, wearing a strait jacket.)
C: DOYLE
D: ...From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care.
C: HILLIER
D: Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury trial?
E: to Styles
C: STYLES
D: Yes, your Honor.
N: She signs a paper which is passed to Hillier.
C: HILLIER
D: Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician... and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician, I do hereby order that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson, an insane person, be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom.
N: He bangs his gavel.
C: HILLIER
D: So ordered! Are the gentlemen from Steilacoom present?
S: EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY
N: Huge, dark-red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees. A van pulls up to the front entrance. Two MEN get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out. She is strapped into a strait-jacket. She yells and struggles violently but a piercing SCREAM stops her. She looks up at the building. From a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves "hello".
S: INT. STEILACOOM HALLWAY - DAY
N: Frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum-covered hallway. There are many patients here, talking to imaginary birds, laughing at unheard jokes. A few of them notice Frances, most do not. The two Orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open. A bare 6'×10' room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows. Frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click.
S: INT. TREATMENT ROOM - DAY
N: A MEDICAL STUDENT wheels a small electrical machine up to a table. On the table Frances is securely strapped down. TWO DOCTORS grease Frances' temples and put two metal electrodes on them. The electrodes are connected to the machine. DOCTOR #1 What's she getting, anyway? DOCTOR #2 Standard series to start. DOCTOR #1 Fifteen? Doctor #2 nods and jams a rubber bar into Frances' mouth. The Medical Student steps forward.
C: STUDENT
D: Can I push the button on this one?
N: Doctor #1 shoots a silent query to Doctor #2. DOCTOR #2 Sure. The Medical Student pushes the button with great gravity. Frances' body immediately begins to convulse. It seems as if it will never stop.
S: INT. STEILACOOM - A WOMAN'S WARD - DAY
N: Beds three inches apart. Women patients lie on them in varying stages of madness and decay. Some are bound to their beds with coarse cloth strips. One bed is empty, the bonds chewed through. We find Frances sitting on the floor staring at a hissing radiator. Her lips are caked with blood. Her eyes are glazed. She is dreaming. Or remembering...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: FRANCES ACTING (HER MEMORY) A scene from one of her movies or plays. Soundless. She looks radiant, vivacious, alive...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. STEILACOOM - THE HYDRO-THERAPY ROOM - DAY
N: A NURSE ushers Frances and two ATTENDANTS into a sparse tiled room with dilapidated plumbing and fungus growing between the tiles. In the center are three steel baths with hammocks suspended above them. The Attendants strap Frances into a bath as Dr. Doyle enters.
C: FRANCES
D: Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
E: speaking with difficulty
C: DOYLE
D: I know you believe that.
C: FRANCES
D: ...Don't you?
C: DOYLE
D: I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
N: The Attendants lower her into the empty tub.
C: FRANCES
D: No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
C: DOYLE
D: Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
E: smiling
C: FRANCES
D: You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
E: tightly
C: DOYLE
D: Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
C: FRANCES
D: ...I see.
C: DOYLE
D: We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
C: FRANCES
D: One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
N: The Doctor smiles sympathetically.
C: DOYLE
D: We'll talk.
N: As he turns to leave, Frances laughs triumphantly. The two Attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with ice-cold water.
C: FRANCES
D: What the hell!
N: They shove a rubber bit between her teeth. She immediately spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep her teeth from chattering.
S: INT. STEILACOOM - DINING HALL - DAY
N: Everyone eating gruel. A parade of lunatics. The edge of incipient violence is palpable. Frances eats listlessly. Others are playing with their food, devouring it ravenously, fondling each other. Suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall. Other voices join in. At first we don't understand it, but gradually the words become clear:
C: CHANT
D: Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and get it!
N: The whole hall joins in. The Nurses make no effort to stop it. Others at Frances' table smile at her, try to push her to her feet. When they succeed, the hall breaks into applause and a new chaotic chant:
C: CHANT
D: We want Frances! We want Frances!
N: The chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds. Everyone is watching Frances. She climbs up on her bench. Her eyes are glazed, her face expressionless. This feels like some kind of automatic behavior. She takes an exaggerated posture and speaks in almost a whisper:
C: FRANCES
D: Come and get it...
N: The hall breaks into riotous applause, catcalls, stomping. Frances climbs down from her bench. That was the entire performance.
S: EXT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT
N: Two dark FIGURES move stealthily along the shadow of the main building. A little ways ahead, a door opens, sending a shaft of light across the ground. The two Men duck back into the shadows. Five young SOLDIERS EXIT, paying off and waving goodbye to one of the Orderlies. The door closes. They head off down the road laughing and joking together. The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door. They try the handle. It opens. The first one in is Harry, followed by the other Man carrying a rolled-up bundle.
S: INT. STEILACOOM - NIGHT
N: We SEE Harry and the other Man, now wearing a white Doctor's coat, walking quickly down a dim hallway. They come to a large door with a barred window. The Man fiddles with a keyring and unlocks the door. They enter. We HEAR the door lock behind them.
S: INT. WARD - NIGHT
N: Just inside the door the Doctor flicks on a flashlight and they walk down the center of the room. The beam of light sweeps over women PATIENTS in their cots, crammed side-by- side. Some are asleep, others stare blankly at the ceiling. A few smile invitingly at the two Men, whispering obscenities. The light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner between the wall and a cot. It is Frances. Harry goes to her, putting his arms around her. She is very heavily sedated. Tears spring to Harry's eyes.
C: HARRY
D: Frances! Frances!
E: whispering
C: FRANCES
D: Who?
C: HARRY
D: Frances, it's me, Harry?
C: FRANCES
D: ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
C: DOCTOR
D: Watch out, Harry. Let me look her over.
N: Harry is on the verge of tears.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
C: DOCTOR
D: The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
C: HARRY
D: Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
C: DOCTOR
D: I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
E: pulling a hypodermic from his pocket
N: Harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm. Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly.
C: DOCTOR
D: Yeah... she knows about these. Shut her up.
N: Harry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the Doctor injects her. Her arm is covered with sores.
C: HARRY
D: You'll be okay, honey. He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful.
E: tenderly
N: The Doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm.
C: DOCTOR
D: This stuff takes pretty quick. Let's go.
C: FRANCES
D: Please! Take me!
E: grabbing Harry
N: Other women in the ward cry out: "Take me! Take me!!"
C: DOCTOR
D: Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
E: pulling Harry
C: HARRY
D: Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
C: FRANCES
D: I'm grateful... grateful.
E: groggily
C: WOMEN IN WARD
D: I'm grateful! I'm grateful!
C: DOCTOR
D: Harry!
E: very worried
C: HARRY
D: I gotta go now.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry, please!
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door.
C: DOCTOR
D: We're all square now, Harry. Right?
C: HARRY
D: All square, Doc.
C: DOCTOR
D: Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
N: Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just hear her:
C: FRANCES
D: I love you, Harry. I love you.
C: HARRY
D: I love you too, Frances.
N: Behind Frances we HEAR the Women screaming: "I love you, Harry!" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the corridor.
S: INT. WARD - NIGHT
N: Frances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech.
C: FRANCES
D: I realize now that I was a very sick woman.
C: WOMEN IN WARD
D: Sick! She's sick!
C: FRANCES
D: I couldn't relate to others in a normal way.
C: ONE PATIENT
D: She's... not... normal...!
E: playful warning
N: The others laugh. We realize that if Frances can handle this, she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech.
C: FRANCES
D: And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope... I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much.
N: The room is silent now. A very odd moment. To their astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her...
S: EXT. FARMER HOUSE - SUNNY DAY
N: The vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling. The house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made... A car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
N: Frances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping tea and answering questions. Frances is uncomfortable.
C: LILLIAN
D: Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
C: FRANCES
D: No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
C: REPORTER
D: Who did your hair, Frances?
N: She touches it shyly. It's swept up in a continental style.
C: FRANCES
D: Well, I like to try different styles. Sometimes if you're old-fashioned enough, you find you're modern. Right, Mama?
N: Lillian laughs.
C: REPORTER
D: What do you think of all this, Mrs. Farmer?
C: LILLIAN
D: It's a miracle. Just a miracle.
S: EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The porch light goes out. Shadows pass over the curtained windows. Across the street a match flares. Harry is leaning against a tree. He lights a cigarette and settles back to wait.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Lillian walks from room to room turning off lights. Frances is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray. Very domestic, out of character. She carries the tray into the kitchen.
C: LILLIAN
D: Oh, just leave those things for now.
C: FRANCES
D: No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
N: Lillian smiles warmly at her.
C: LILLIAN
D: You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you for understanding, Mama.
N: Lillian links her arm with Frances' and they go upstairs together.
C: LILLIAN
D: Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
C: FRANCES
D: I will, I promise.
N: They hug each other.
C: LILLIAN
D: Good night, dear.
N: Lillian waits until Frances has shut her door before closing hers.
S: EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The front door opens and Frances, suitcase in hand, slips out onto the porch. She eases the door shut behind her, tiptoes down the steps and, without looking back, starts down the road.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Frances rounds the corner, then sees him: Harry, standing by his car, smiling.
C: HARRY
D: Where to?
C: FRANCES
D: Oh Harry...
N: She approaches him tentatively.
C: HARRY
D: This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah. I don't know.
C: HARRY
D: You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
C: FRANCES
D: I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
N: Long beat. She turns and stares at him sadly.
C: FRANCES
D: You can't change the things they did to me, Harry. Only I can do that... by myself.
N: He nods slowly.
C: HARRY
D: Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
C: HARRY
D: I don't know.
C: FRANCES
D: Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
E: getting frantic
C: HARRY
D: Right. Except... time has a way of --
C: FRANCES
D: No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
C: HARRY
D: I hope so, Frances.
E: smiles wistfully
N: They hug. Together for an instant. Then she shivers as if the contact were too much.
C: FRANCES
D: I'm sorry.
E: disentangling
N: He nods, looks at her.
C: HARRY
D: I'll be seeing you, kid.
N: He turns and walks slowly to his car.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN
N: Barren desert. The middle of nowhere. A lone male HITCHHIKER, poor, stands at a crossroads. A car coming the wrong direction raises dust along the highway. It slows, stops, and lets Frances out. She is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt. She has a heavy tan. She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm:
C: HITCHHIKER
D: Pretty morning.
C: FRANCES
D: It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
E: nods
C: HITCHHIKER
D: And no people.
C: FRANCES
D: Yes.
N: Beat.
C: HITCHHIKER
D: Where you goin'?
C: FRANCES
D: Wherever they're going, I'm going.
C: HITCHHIKER
D: Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
C: FRANCES
D: Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
N: She stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her gesture.
C: HITCHHIKER
D: What's the matter?
N: Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away.
C: HITCHHIKER
D: They're looking for you, huh?
N: She's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge:
C: FRANCES
D: Yeah.
C: HITCHHIKER
D: What'd you do?
C: FRANCES
D: You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
N: He laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings:
C: HITCHHIKER
D: I've got a little whiskey here, warm you up.
N: She smiles, truly grateful:
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you.
N: Then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side.
C: FRANCES
D: Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up.
N: The car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out.
C: FRANCES
D: Shit!
C: HITCHHIKER
D: Run!
N: She does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her.
S: EXT. SMALL TOWN JAIL - DAY
N: Frances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly SHERIFF. He watches them get in Ernest's car and drive off. His expression says very clearly: I'm glad that's over with.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Ernest's at the wheel, Frances at his side. Silence, then:
C: FRANCES
D: Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out?
N: Ernest writhes slightly with discomfort.
C: ERNEST
D: Francie, you know I can't do that.
C: FRANCES
D: Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
C: ERNEST
D: They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
N: We SEE them approaching a side road.
C: FRANCES
D: Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
C: ERNEST
D: But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
N: They are nearer the side road.
C: FRANCES
D: You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
C: ERNEST
D: Please, Francie...
C: FRANCES
D: Daddy!
E: pleading
N: They pass the side road. It disappears behind them. All the life seems to drain from Frances.
C: ERNEST
D: I'll try to protect you, Francie. I will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a real talk.
N: Frances buries her face in her hands.
C: ERNEST
D: Are you... are you hungry?
C: FRANCES
D: I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Lillian is sitting on the couch, waiting. We HEAR A CAR PULL UP outside and stop. Doors slam. Steps come up the walk and onto the porch. The door opens and Frances and Ernest enter. Lillian rises to face her daughter.
C: FRANCES
D: Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
E: coldly
C: LILLIAN
D: I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
C: FRANCES
D: You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
C: LILLIAN
D: I have!
N: Through the window we SEE a white van pull up outside.
C: FRANCES
D: No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
E: to Ernest to the MEN IN WHITE COATS who are at the door turning back
C: LILLIAN
D: But what --
E: have I done?
C: FRANCES
D: No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready.
E: walking out the door
N: The way she goes out that door we know she's never coming back.
S: INT. STEILACOOM - VIOLENT WARD - NIGHT
N: The ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their hair cropped very short. The walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing. The place looks like an enormous tool shed. The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops. These are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. Everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been. Their faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the back. We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread- eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is squirming violently on top of her. Frances' eyes are open but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. She is passive and unresisting. She is reciting to herself, over and over.
C: FRANCES
D: We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds...
N: Two of the SOLDIERS, waiting their turn, are smoking cigarettes and chatting idly. SOLDIER #1 ...Best deal I ever made. Twenty bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star. SOLDIER #2 Yeah, it's worth it I guess. SOLDIER #1 What's she saying, anyway? SOLDIER #2 Who knows. She's crazy, ain't she? Frances keeps reciting as one rapist gets off. The Soldiers cheer as another quickly takes his place.
S: EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY
N: A heavy snow is falling. From the corrugated-tin Violent Ward, a thin white hand protrudes from a narrow window to catch a snowflake. As it opens and closes, capturing individual flakes, a VOICE BEGINS TO SING "You Are My Sunshine...". We recognize Frances' voice, still surprisingly strong and steady.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. STEILACOOM - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY
N: TWO NURSES discuss Frances' condition as we SEE, background, that she is getting electroshock treatments from a pair of doctors.
C: OLDER NURSE
D: I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
C: YOUNG NURSE
D: Yeah?
C: OLDER NURSE
D: I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
E: nods
C: YOUNG NURSE
D: You're kidding.
E: wincing
C: OLDER NURSE
D: Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
E: indicating the doctors
C: YOUNG NURSE
D: What?
C: OLDER NURSE
D: 'Incurable.'
S: INT. STEILACOOM - HOLDING WARD - DAY
N: Frances, barely conscious, lies strapped to a bed. Doyle and an ORDERLY approach her. Doyle nods toward her as if to say: that one. He and the Orderly unstrap her.
C: FRANCES
D: Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
E: to Doyle
C: DOYLE
D: We'll get you home, Frances.
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you, Harry.
N: She's untied. The Orderly helps her up onto a gurney. She lies down. Doyle nods to the Orderly, who starts pushing her. She is wheeled out and down: THE HALL Past other patients, doctors, etc. We see some of this from her point of view. She goes through two swinging doors, down another hall... at the end of which a man opens a door. She is pushed onto a: STAGE She is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice:
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain.
E: O.S.
N: The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour.
E: O.S.
N: Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round and round. The voice drones on.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever.
E: O.S.
N: We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty.
N: Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment.
N: The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening...
N: Frances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring...
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: ...with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.
N: We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: These patients will soon be leaving the hospital.
N: Harlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view.
C: DR. HARLINGTON
D: Lobotomy gets 'em home.
N: He moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. As the leucotome descends, we:
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY
N: Total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... This house is easing slowly back to nature...
S: INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Neglect is just as evident inside. Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. The scrapbook is open on her lap.
C: LILLIAN
D: What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances.
N: Ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. FOUR REPORTERS crouch on the floor, totally bored. Yesterday's headlines are now old news.
C: LILLIAN
D: They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart...
N: Two Reporters rise and edge toward the door.
C: REPORTER
D: Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to... uh...
C: THIRD REPORTER
D: Yeah, I better pack it in too.
E: rising
C: LILLIAN
D: Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade?
E: distractedly
N: The last Reporter gets to his feet.
C: FOURTH REPORTER
D: I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye.
E: kindly
N: He follows the others out. Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. Ernest stares into the fire.
C: LILLIAN
D: You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day.
N: Ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home... FADE IN ON: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark background The show is "This Is Your Life". We SEE a smiling RALPH EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances. She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems uncomfortable.
C: EDWARDS
D: ...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you.
N: Throughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt.
C: EDWARDS
D: ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
C: FRANCES
D: ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
N: We MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York. He still looks athletic, young for his age. Tears stream down his cheeks.
C: EDWARDS
D: Were you an alcoholic?
E: O.S.
C: FRANCES
D: No.
E: O.S.
C: EDWARDS
D: Were you a drug addict?
E: O.S.
C: FRANCES
D: No. Never.
E: O.S.
N: ON THE SCREEN Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. We've never seen any of them before.
C: EDWARDS
D: ...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail! And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!
E: indicating seating area
N: The curtains behind them open to reveal a car in a spotlight.
C: EDWARDS
D: A brand new 1958 Edsel!
N: The audience applauds. Frances smiles guardedly.
C: FRANCES
D: Thank you, Ralph.
C: EDWARDS
D: Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
N: Applause.
C: EDWARDS
D: So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good night. God bless you.
N: The audience applauds. Frances smiles wearily and accepts congratulations.
S: EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - HOLLYWOOD - DAY
N: A group of PEOPLE are coming down the front steps, Frances among them. They all talk happily, Frances is silent but smiling.
C: WOMAN
D: Where shall we drop you, Frances? Home?
C: FRANCES
D: No... no, someone's picking me up.
E: vaguely
N: The people all excuse themselves, calling goodbye. Frances waits by herself for a few moments, but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk.
C: HARRY
D: Hey.
E: O.S.
N: She turns. Harry is leaning against the side of a building, looking much as he did when they first met. But there is very little light of recognition in Frances' eyes.
C: HARRY
D: C'mere. I want to talk to you.
C: FRANCES
D: Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
E: flatly
N: Harry is a little puzzled by her reaction.
C: HARRY
D: How... how ya doin', Farmer?
C: FRANCES
D: Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
C: HARRY
D: Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
C: FRANCES
D: How did I look?
E: concerned
C: HARRY
D: Oh, you... ...ennh.
E: smiling
C: FRANCES
D: Well... you're looking well.
E: a glimmer, but she does not pick up on the cue
N: They are both silent a long moment.
C: FRANCES
D: I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
C: HARRY
D: Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
C: FRANCES
D: Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
C: HARRY
D: Why do you say that?
C: FRANCES
D: I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
E: she smiles
N: Harry is alarmed now.
C: HARRY
D: Frances!
E: taking her by the arm
N: She angrily bares her teeth; then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid.
C: FRANCES
D: Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please. It's just... Some things happen for the best.
N: Beat. She takes his hand as if to shake it. Harry clasps hers tenderly. She holds on like an old woman, stroking his hand. For an instant she gets lost in time, just holding his hand. Then she looks up.
C: FRANCES
D: It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
C: HARRY
D: I'm not sure.
C: FRANCES
D: Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
E: uncertainly
C: HARRY
D: No.
C: FRANCES
D: No, we're not.
E: reassured
N: It is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will... but the words bear no emotional power.
C: FRANCES
D: Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
C: HARRY
D: Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
C: FRANCES
D: That would be okay.
C: HARRY
D: Just a little way.
N: He offers his arm. She takes it. All rather formal. They stroll on together.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
N: THE END
