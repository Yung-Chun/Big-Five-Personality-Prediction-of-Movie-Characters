M: Nov. 2009
T: FADE IN
N: SUNRISE Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day... Sun is rising over... A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with... HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building... A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy... PARKING LOT Empty thus far. A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their assigned slots far from the entrance. One of those cars is a old, not so vintage nor classic convertible... KARMANN GHIA -- Belonging to... LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that rising sun. Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and Company Polo. Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the cover into place. He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount. He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders...

N: MENSWEAR DEPT - LATER Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those briefs ... hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers... helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor - clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again.
C: MOMMY
D: Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug!
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: They do love the comfort food. Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug... Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...
S: EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - LATER
N: Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart pen like a Trail Boss... LATER That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up- chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up. A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the Handicapped Space. LARRY CROWNE Buddy. Park there and you'll get a ticket.
C: PIZZA KID
D: Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds. You guys having a party?
E: a dozen pizza boxes
S: INT. MEETING ROOM 2 - UNIMART - LATER
N: The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices. A RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads "Good Luck Dorothy Genkos!" The name has been printed over the last person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete. None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group. Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX, STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female).
C: STRANG
D: Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor?
C: ANDREWS
D: Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief.
C: STRANG
D: The "R" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place. Hurley is shocked!
C: HURLEY
D: "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?
C: COX
D: Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right?
N: HURLEY Chaff is the waste matter, correct. When are we restructuring?
C: COX
D: Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders. Hurley looks sick. She hates this.
C: STRANG
D: What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd?
C: ANDREWS
D: How?
C: STRANG
D: Firing someone.
C: COX
D: Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it.
C: STRANG
D: Like a Team Leader.
C: HURLEY
D: Team Leader?
N: STRANG
C: COX
D: Suggestions on who it should be?
C: STRANG
D: I say Crowne.
C: HURLEY
D: Larry Crowne? Strang rolls his eyes.
C: STRANG
D: Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.
C: STRANG
D: Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week. ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.
E: CONT'D
N: STRANG (CONT'D) Crowne's pink slip will save 'da "U" big green backwash.
C: COX
D: What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
C: ANDREWS
D: Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year.
C: COX
D: Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course. They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."
C: COX
D: How's his review record?
E: CONT'D
C: HURLEY
D: He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time.
C: COX
D: Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason... Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.
C: HURLEY
D: We could use the Limited Horizons strategy.
N: (EXPLAINING) Larry will always be passed over for Management. He never went to college.
C: COX
D: You're that familiar with his record?
C: STRANG
D: She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick?
C: HURLEY
D: That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember...
C: STRANG
D: The memory haunts me.
N: ANDREWS He'll sock us for severance.
C: STRANG
D: Big brick in the pond, though.
C: COX
D: Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm.
S: EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift.
S: INT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER
N: Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is fastidious in his work. The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by.
C: VASQUEZ
D: LC Why still here?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy.
C: VASQUEZ
D: I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Probably to clean up after the party.
C: VASQUEZ
D: Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.
N: VASQUEZ You're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
S: INT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME
N: Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
C: STRANG
D: Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I think I know what this is about.
C: STRANG
D: I don't think you do.
C: COX
D: Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking.
C: STRANG
D: I take it back.
C: COX
D: Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas.
N: (THEN) It is touchas, right? Where you get kicked?
C: HURLEY
D: Yeah. A yiddish word.
C: ANDREWS
D: Like the buttocks.
C: HURLEY
D: Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
C: COX
D: Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: UniMart is firing me...
C: STRANG
D: Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Why me?
C: ANDREWS
D: Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Why not Strang? Strang snorts.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.
E: CONT'D
C: HURLEY
D: Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
N: COX Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder.
C: STRANG
D: Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I won't make the Front Office?
C: STRANG
D: Never. S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true.
E: shows his college ring
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then...
C: COX
D: Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I thought I was Employee of the Month.
C: STRANG
D: In a way, you are. Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house...
C: COX
D: The timing on this is always a bitch.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this?
N: COX Really wish we could. (THEN) Vick? The generous severance package? She has a folder with posted "Sign Here's."
C: HURLEY
D: Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done. Strang finds one last piece of party pizza.
S: EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
N: Vasquez helps Larry put down the ragged top of his car.
C: VASQUEZ
D: 12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Stick it out. You go to college?
C: VASQUEZ
D: Couple years. Then I blew out my
N: KNEE
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Thanks for seeing me off.
C: VASQUEZ
D: I need your apron, man.
N: (AGAIN) Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so it ain't yours. Larry unharnesses himself from that which is not his. Hands it over. Branded. Scorned as the one let go...
C: VASQUEZ
D: Thanks.
E: CONT'D
N: (WALKING AWAY) Goofy car, man.
S: EXT. INTERSECTION - LATER
N: Larry pulls up at a red light. From his hands-free speaker jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear ON-HOLD Music. RECORDED VOICE Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD- "Remember, you always have a friend at RiverBank..." LIB where they are going next...

N: LARRY CROWNE LAURIE GAMMELGAARD No. She gets a brochure: "The RiverBank Survival Plan!"
C: LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
D: But RiverBank does have a plan for you.
E: CONT'D
N: (THE BROCHURE) In a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do. Find new employment. Liquidate everything low on the Value Index. Stick to a budget. Clip coupons, buy in bulk, you know the drill. Then come back and we'll work with you.

C: LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
D: It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...
S: EXT. DERBY COURT - EVENING

Thinks some more...

If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.

S: EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO - SAME
N: It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her chair and into her drink. This is where she goes when she thinks/drinks.

S: INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER
N: Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls from her Thermo-cup. Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes. In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is demonstrating an exercise for her speech.
C: CALIMERIS
D: With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The

E: CONT'D
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.
N: Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking, only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face.
E: CONT'D
C: LARRY CROWNE

C: TALIA
D: Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang. Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...
N: DELL GORDO Okay. You're in for a trial run. And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D) (WHISPERING) I broke up with the Orthodontist. Now I have to get a new boyfriend and a new orthodontist. You ever do that?

C: DR. MATSUTANI
D: Someone's been reading my book.
N: (THEN) The Break Even Paradox creates a new metric... Talia makes a decision and palms her phone, punching in a text. In a second, Larry's phone vibrates. He struggles to get it before he gets caught with his mobile on. TALIA: "Scoot? You/me?" Larry nods at Talia. Turning back, Dr. Matsutani is there again. Larry hands him his mobile phone again. Palm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) I am growing tired of this game, Mr. Crowne. Aren't you?

N: (LARRY DOES) I'm going to ask a question in a moment. I want someone other than you to answer it - I don't care if the silence is positively Arctic. Larry moves to take a seat. Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him "What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) This brings us to a dreaded task to every corporate entity. What is the purpose of semi-annual re- purposing? Anyone? (THEN) Anyone? He waits. And waits. And waits.

C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.

C: LARRY CROWNE
D: She's marred.
C: TALIA
D: You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living.

C: LARRY CROWNE
D: What are you talking about?
N: MERCEDES TAINOT What, you have no short-term memory? Larry has been tying to be polite.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home.

D: Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.
N: (MORE)
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot. Bang.
E: CONT'D
N: It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and everything. Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept at it, too.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Wow...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Pretty dang good. I still got it, no?

N: A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his world gets much more complicated. P.O.V. All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the top of the heap, his computer. Turned on and showing porn

D: Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...
N: (THEN) Mercy!!!
S: EXT. E.C.C.C. TEACHERS' PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally hungover. As she straightens up, her eye catches... LARRY CROWNE On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking. She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that direction.
S: EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME
N: Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is caught by surprise when.. He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar. Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow. Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud. Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam. Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the head. Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues... BENCH AREA Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet' with Larry. Then she sees her. TALIA Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his waist and affection in her eyes.
C: MERCY
D: Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a minute or two.
N: TALIA AND LARRY Amid the others... TALIA Oh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Epilog. School today.
C: TALIA
D: Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play...
N: MERCY Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.
S: INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY
N: Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is looking at Larry. Larry is listening to Lala with delight.
C: PINEDO
D: Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me.
N: (THEN) That is something I will remember forever. The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala, who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate. Then the applause is over. The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI That was a knockout speech, Lala. Made the news. Caused riots downtown. School's out til 2019. The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and head ou .
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
C: CALIMERIS
D: Why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
C: PINEDO
D: This is bordering on harassment now.
C: DIBIASI
D: Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show...
C: MACK
D: Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.
C: DIBIASI
D: Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
C: MACK
D: You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short
N: a time span.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished.
E: CONT'D
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I wouldn't want that.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: happened before.
N: (MORE)
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) I hope the entire thing will be forgotten. Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: None.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
N: LARRY CROWNE I'd better scurry along to Dr. Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him. Larry leaves - a good mood ruined... Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark glasses?
S: EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON
N: Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play down the street. They run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball. They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light up.
C: LAMARR
D: Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.
N: (THEN) See? Works.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I have to sell my car. Put a new top on it.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.
C: LAMARR
D: What's the job paying you?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Half my UniMart salary.
C: LAMARR
D: You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as dirt.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
C: LAMARR
D: Hang in there, neighbor.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Everyone keeps saying that.
N: LAMARR I was in the same spot. Look what happened.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
C: LAMARR
D: I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
N: LARRY CROWNE (THE PIPE) This thing must be making me dizzy. What?
C: LAMARR
D: Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says... Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a
C: LAMARR
D: A woman with a measuring tape? That's money in my pocket. A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his pipe flying.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Hardly any cars. Shopping carts are herded into their corral by... former Team Leader Larry Crowne.
S: INT. UNIMART MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME
N: Larry stands where he was once king. P.O.V. The place looks different. Shabby. Unkempt. Understaffed. He recognizes no one. AISLE No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by Owner' signs. And, he can't help it: he straightens out some messed up racks and shelves.
C: REGISTER
D: Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history. Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing? Vicky Hurley. Not looking good
C: HURLEY
D: ' ind bargains today?'
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her Cashier's Apron.
C: HURLEY
D: Larry. Hi.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Why are you on the Register?
C: HURLEY
D: Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Cash. No receipt. Hurley is robotic.
C: HURLEY
D: You got out of here just in time... 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.'
S: EXT. A PARK - DAY
N: Trees. A picnic table. And Mercedes Tainot writing individual words on pages of a steno book. After each word, she folds each page many times and puts it in a basket. Up walks Dean Tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful. DEAN TAINOT Hi.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Thanks for coming.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I knew you'd be on the computer.
N: (THEN) Working...
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: Point made.
N: (THEN) So. What up.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Are we making a mistake here?
N: DEAN TAINOT
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: We could. Why should we?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: I'd like that too.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Really?
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: You're not a pleasant woman after a
N: few glasses. Mornings with you are to be survived.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: I see. I'm what this is all about.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: You're talking about you but you really mean me.
N: (THEN) I am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. So you don't get to either.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I'm not saying that.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working.
N: (THEN) I'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too. But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults. (THEN) I just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting. He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself.
C: DEAN TAINOT
D: I don't think there is anything else to talk about. Do you?
E: CONT'D
N: Mercedes looks at him. She has been a fool...
S: EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO

D: 'Disraeli'? What is that?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Who is that?
C: DIBIASI
D: It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: 'Consumerism'.
N: MERCEDES TAINOT That's supposed to say 'Communism.'
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.
C: CALIMERIS
D: 'Malpity Hoople.'
N: (THEN) What's this say?

D: And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.
N: LARRY CROWNE
C: TALIA
D: Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out. She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.
C: TALIA
D: That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit. Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"
E: CONT'D
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.
C: TALIA
D: Oh shut up.
N: LARRY CROWNE It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce. Quitting school is for dopes. It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.
C: TALIA
D: Be here for our Grand Opening!
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Might not make it. I have finals!
N: OPEN SKY Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.
S: EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY
N: He is pounding the FOR SALE sign into his front lawn. Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new VW Bug with a COUPLE in the back seat. They get out and Larry nods as he waves them to the door. He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street. It's all over...
S: EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
N: Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: This place anonymous enough?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: As long as alcohol's out of my grasp.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: They have good pie, they say.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY
N: OWNER." FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP) So. You're a mess.
S: INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME
N: They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Yep.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee. Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.
C: PERRY
D: Ladies. Bring an appetite?
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.
N: PERRY
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: No Key Lime?
C: PERRY
D: Cream pies I got.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: Boston Cream?

C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I'll have the French Toast.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: French Toast?
N: MERCEDES TAINOT (on the menu) Breakfast all day. Perry leaves to put in the order.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: I have seen it happen a time or two.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I kissed a boy.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: When, third grade?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: One of my students.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: You Hoor.
N: (THEN) Gimme the friggin' details! He's not a minor is he?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Older than me.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: He a fireman who bakes bread?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: Bold. Who is he?
N: KITCHEN Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook. PERRY You're slipping, Larry. (THE TOAST) Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: She's insane.
C: PERRY
D: Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen.
C: PERRY
D: No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment.
E: CONT'D
N: BOOTH Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?
N: MERCEDES TAINOT Knock Larry over with a feather.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Mrs. Tainot.
N: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (TO MERCEDES) The student of yours!?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: This is Larry Crowne.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: It was fine, actually.
N: (THEN) I wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there. And say, howdy. Howdy doody. During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of Larry -- to find out how he smells. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Ready for the final?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: So, your meal is satisfactory?
E: CONT'D
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Absolutely.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Yes indeed.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Shall I prepare you another batch?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: No. Thanks.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: You kissed the cook...
N: (THEN) I got a whiff. He smelled like bell pepper.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Look at the men in my life.
C: FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
D: Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself.
N: (THEN) You hoor...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor.
N: KITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH That ends... right now. (THEN) Check please? Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his face. He tosses the French Toast down the disposal.
S: INT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - LATER
N: Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums, cleaners, and fortitude. BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled, just chucked. KITCHEN The cupboard is open. Where there was once booze go coffees and teas. MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's life...
S: EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT
N: The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around and around and around the block that he will soon leave. He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV. This was Larry's street...
T: CUT TO:
N: SUNRISE
S: EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING
N: Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not clutches, her Thermo-Cup?
S: EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - MORNING
N: He's wearing a zipped up jacket. Kids and dog-walkers pass as his scooter starts pronto, he is off... The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW
S: INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER
N: On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI. Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought.
N: (THEN) Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? (THEN) What did I just say about Larry Crowne? The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each other. The men stifle laughs. DIBIASI Nothing. And I was just wrapping up here.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I'm so sorry. Please go on.
C: DIBIASI
D: Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods.
C: DIBIASI
D: Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause.
E: CONT'D
C: PINEDO
D: Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last?
C: DIBIASI
D: Fourth quarter dramatics.
N: (THEN) Not that it mattered to my Speech professor...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Congratulations all of you.
C: MACK
D: Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Not me, I have to stay objective.
C: MACK
D: I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.
N: It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of. As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room.
S: INT. ECON. 1 - LATER
N: Everyone is taking the final. Dr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands like a pair of binoculars. Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers. Larry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his Blue Book.
C: DR. MATSUTANI
D: The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves.
S: INT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN
N: The final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this part himself. He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.
C: MACK
D: This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Priceless at a buck apiece.
S: EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER
N: His furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car. PATIENCE A two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture?
C: LAMARR
D: Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing.
N: (THEN) What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: You'll get me top price.
C: LAMARR
D: You did learn.
C: DIBIASI
D: Pizza at last!
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.
N: LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
C: STRANG
D: Son of a cock. Larry Crowne. The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
C: STRANG
D: Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- fifty. Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.
C: STRANG
D: Tell me about it.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.
N: Strang leaves. Larry watches him go. him. It almost was. STRANG I appreciate it. That could have been

C: PERRY
D: I love this business sometimes.
N: (GREETING MERCEDES) Something told me you'd be back. Is Larry Crowne working today? KITCHEN Larry is arranging his station.
C: PERRY
D: Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu. Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.
C: RAUL
D: Go ahead. I'll take the window even though I'm the boss of the whole kitchen.
N: BOOTH - LARRY'S HQ - LATER Mercedes is having coffee.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: There's Larry Crowne. Are you allowed to sit?
N: (HE DOES) Where does Perry get his coffee?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy.
N: MERCEDES TAINOT You're probably wondering why I stopped by. Well, it's to tell you your grade for Speech 217. You killed on the final and have an A. Way to go! She offers him a Terrorist Fist Bump. With the hand that no longer has a wedding ring on it...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Actually, everybody got an A, but you got the special A where I tell you in person.
E: CONT'D
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short.
N: (THEN) So. Just wanted to congratulate you. Your girlfriend will be thrilled. LARRY CROWNE
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: No. I meant the... never mind.
N: (THEN) Which classes are you going to ace next term?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT

C: LARRY CROWNE
D: I'll have to see.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM, thank God. Who knows what I'll hear with the extra sleep.
N: LARRY CROWNE My first class in college ever. And I get an A. Gotta be the teacher. They look at each other.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Should get going.
N: (THEN) You don't know anything about car devices, do you?
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Cars not much. Devices some. They rise.
S: EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - SAME
N: Mercy is opening her door, starting her car.
C: GPS VOICE
D: Please enter your destination.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: It is Hellspawn.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him.
N: LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) How long was this broken?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Seemed like years and years.
C: LARRY CROWNE
D: All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye.

S: EXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: The sign says "New Term Beginning! $20 a unit! Ask about Financial Aid!" Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up...
S: INT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Mercedes has just written "Care" next to "Welcome to Shakespeare!!" up on the board. She turns. And does a quick head count. Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one, again. Clumps up the wooden steps are heard... Calimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in. Twelve students now.
C: DIBIASI
D: I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo... Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
E: on his phone
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Is Larry with you?
C: CALIMERIS
D: Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I... Seeing you all... I just thought...
N: (THEN) Choose a seat and lets get started! The four smile at each other...
C: PINEDO
D: Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands...

E: O.C.
N: MERCEDES TAINOT Dr. M.
C: DR. MATSUTANI

C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Larry's enrolled?
C: DR. MATSUTANI
D: He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Larry said that about me?
C: BUSIK
D: Oh yeah! I put that guy in your class. So technically, I changed his life.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: He is a good student
C: DR. MATSUTANI
D: And handy on a scooter.
N: (THEN) Is there any chance you would consider having drinks with an older faculty peer who holds a PhD in Economics?
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: Well, no. No offense Dr. M.
C: DR. MATSUTANI
D: The rumor is you are newly single and I was just taking a shot. Mercy looks right at Busik.

She is tying to check out her ass-crack tattoo to see if it really does say 'Soy Sauce'. Mercedes has arrived. Talia sees her and comes out. Lamarr is around. Patience, too. We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly alike, as we've seen the same jacket once on Lance Corona. TALIA I love that blouse with that skirt but I'd show more leg if I were you.
C: MERCEDES TAINOT
D: I'm Mercy Tainot

N: Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant. In the potted plant is an Altoids tin. Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key. Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly opens the door. The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny flat, but she can make out... Larry, arranging the last of his stuff. Mercy stands at the door until he sees her. When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells her - her neck, her hair.
