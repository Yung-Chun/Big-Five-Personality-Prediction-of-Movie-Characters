C: MARCIE
D: I don't have to answer your questions.
C: JIM KURRING

C: MARCIE
D: I live alone.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
C: MARCIE
D: No I Said.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Ok. What's your name?
C: MARCIE
D: Marcie.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
C: MARCIE
D: I preffer to stand.
C: JIM KURRING
D: I'm not askin', Marcie.
N: Marcie sits down.
C: MARCIE
D: I didn't do anything.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
C: MARCIE
D: I don't know a loud crash.
C: JIM KURRING
D: And what about screaming?
C: MARCIE
D: I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
C: JIM KURRING
D: What's this, how did this happen?

C: MARCIE
D: I went out last night.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me. The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
C: MARCIE
D: It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
C: JIM KURRING
D: Yes I can, Marcie. And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
C: MARCIE
D: Mischief? What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
C: JIM KURRING

C: JIM KURRING
D: --- What was that?
C: MARCIE
D: I didn't hear anything.
N: Marcie stands up.
C: JIM KURRING
D: No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
C: MARCIE
D: I don't have to do a god damn thing.
N: Kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;
C: MARCIE
D: WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
C: JIM KURRING
D: Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
N: Continue with that until he's got her cuffed to the couch. He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move slowly down the hall to the back bedroom --
C: MARCIE
D: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, MOTHERFUCKER? MOTHER-GOD-DAMN FUCKER. WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'? DON'T GO IN MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
N: Kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, CAMERA behind him;
C: JIM KURRING
D: This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
C: MARCIE
D: THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
N: Kurring moves into the BEDROOM now and sees that the CLOSET is closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;
C: JIM KURRING
D: This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
C: MARCIE
D: THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
E: OC
C: JIM KURRING
D: Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
C: MARCIE
D: THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
E: OC
C: JIM KURRING
D: -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
N: Jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing.
C: MARCIE
D: I told you there was no one in there!
N: Jim looks down the hall at Marcie who has physically dragged the large couch handcuffed behind her;
C: JIM KURRING
D: Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further!
N: JIM'S POV, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CLOSET. He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal: A DEAD SKINNY WHITE MAN (50s) curled up in a ball on the floor of the closet. He'd dead and he's been covered in dirty laundry. He has a gag around his mouth. HOLD on Jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his REVOLVER towards Marcie:
C: JIM KURRING
D: What the hell is this Marcie?
C: MARCIE
D: THAT'S NOT MINE.
N: Jim swings the aim of his gun back at the dead body.

C: PHIL
D: How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
C: EARL
D: Do me a personal favor --
C: PHIL
D: Go fuck myself?
C: EARL
D: You got it.
N: EARL gets hit with something and starts to MOAN a bit. Sharp pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face....
C: EARL
D: ...I can't hold onto this anymore...
C: PHIL
D: I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --

C: EARL
D: ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck.... I can't hold ontothis anymore...
N: He gives Phil make an imaginary object and falls asleep. BEAT. Stay with Phil a moment as he turns his head, looking around the house a moment, looks back to Earl.

S: INT. BURBANK HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT
N: FRANK steps into a CLOSE UP and holding a mic, says:
C: FRANK
D: Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.
N: REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the "Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and play along; Frank is on a slightly elevated stage. vBehind him a huge banner for, "Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf with a big buldge in his fur. It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives".
C: FRANK
D: And you did hear me right. Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, "No. You will not control me. You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge. I'm the one who says yes, no, now or here. Shit, man. Sad but true. Sad But True. And you wanna know what? It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is. I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before? Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money! Because I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case. They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each and every one of them. And once you learn these methods: You're Set. You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom. Done. Over. Why? Because all women are the same. Period. End of discussion. Sorry. It's true. Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair?" Yes, they are. Guilty as charged. And so's the world. It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- Period. Sorry. End of discussion.

N: Sliding doors open in the lobby and a young woman GWENOVIER (30s) enters, takes off her sunglasses and looks around. There's a bunch of Posters and Signs for the "Seduce and Destroy Seminar with Frank TJ Mackey," etc. Frank's two sidekicks: DOC (20s) and CAPTAIN MUFFY (40s) approach;
C: CAPTAIN MUFFY
D: You're Gwenovier?
C: GWENOVIER
D: Yeah.
C: CAPTIAN MUFFY
D: I'm Captain Muffy, I'm Frank's personal assistant. This is Doc --

N: Captain Muffy, Doc and Gwenovier enter and head tor some seats, CAMERA swings a 180 and moves down the aisle, towards the stage as Frank speaks --
C: FRANK
D: Number One: Get a calendar. I cannot stress this enough. This is a simple item guys. It's 99 cents at your corner store: Go And Get One. Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you'll see I've been nice enough to include one, 'cause that's the kind of prick I am -- You're gonna need this calendar and I know it sounds like a small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you meet a girl and you're gonna work an A-3 Interuption -- let's say an eight day waiting period before the next call -- how you gonna know when those eight days are up? Buy a calendar. Next move? Mark the calendar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What did I pay my eight hundred dollars for? To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it? Just stick with me and stick by the calendar. Mark it up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna make that "friend" something else -- you gotta be hard on yourself, set goals: You, there: And What's Your Name?

C: FRANK
D: Denise?
C: GUY
D: That's right --
C: FRANK
D: -- and she hurt you didn't she? I know, I know. I know how that can be brother, but let me tell you loud and clear what we will be teaching Denise when we put our calendars to work and set goals:
N: Frank hops back up on the stage;
C: FRANK
D: Little Denise, I say this: I mark it up and I write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay." "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage." I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what? I've said "enough is enough." Because why? She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend. You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something? Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise! But: Listen up: That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps. But we'll get to that. Number One
E: audience cheers this is page 18 in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and follow along with me.
N: The guys flip open their little blue booklets and follow along.
C: FRANK
D: Create a crisis -- simple and clean, and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush. Here we go: Set a date with your so-called "friend." Let's say you make it 7:30. You call her on the phone --

E: VO
N: She opens the door and sees FRANK, crying and hysterical.
C: FRANK
D: She opens it up, pissed as hell, but finds you sobbing your eyes out --
E: VO
N: Frank looks up at her and says:
C: FRANK
D: ...I can't believe what happened...
N: Frank and the Girl sit down on the couch together.
C: FRANK
D: You explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal hospital but by the time you got there --
E: VO

S: INT. HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT
N: Frank is cracking himself up. He continues.
C: FRANK
D: I can't believe I'm telling you guys this, but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS. Any girl that calls herself your friend is not gonna let you be alone in a situation like that. Technique #2: Staging a fight. This is not knock down, drag out, crying screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girl's mind. Remember we are using reinforcement technique "G" with these women. Here's how:

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - BACK TO SCENE
N: Frank speaking to the group:
C: FRANK
D: Let her wonder what she did wrong.
N: CAMERA DOES A SLOW DOLLY IN. Frank's tone changes a bit, gets darker:
C: FRANK
D: This is the way...because they will always wonder, "What did I do?" "What could I have done different?" "How should I behave to get this back?" And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do. That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.

C: DR. LANDON
D: I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
C: LINDA
D: I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me practical things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then What?
C: DR. LANDON
D: Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you. They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
C: LINDA
D: He has Phil right now.
C: DR. LANDON
D: Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
C: LINDA
D: Yeah.
C: DR. LANDON
D: If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
C: LINDA
D: -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
C: DR. LANDON
D: We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
C: LINDA
D: I'm listening. I'm getting better.
C: DR. LANDON
D: Do you wanna sit down?
C: LINDA
D: I need to sit down.
C: DR. LANDON
D: Ok. Linda: Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is. He is dying very, very rapidly --
N: She breaks a bit more.
C: DR. LANDON
D: Now the thing here is making that experience as painless and easy as possible for him, you understand? Now you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking me about -- they are who you call when he dies.
N: He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;
C: DR. LANDON
D: This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
C: LINDA
D: -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
C: DR. LANDON
D: The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right? You understand?

Y'know? I think they have those scenes in movies because they're true, because they really happen. And you gotta believe me: This is really happening. I mean, I can give you my phone number and you can call me back if you wanna check with whoever you can check this with, but don't leave me hanging on this -- please -- please.

C: FRANK
D: Like I said, yeah --
C: GWEN
D: And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
C: FRANK
D: I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled. I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what was as opposed to I wanted.
C: GWEN
D: Where does that name come from?
C: FRANK
D: What name? My name?
C: GWEN
D: It's not your given name, right?
C: FRANK
D: My mother's name, actually. Good question. You've done you're research.
C: GWEN
D: And "Frank?"
C: FRANK
D: "Frank" was my mother's father.
C: GWEN
D: Ok. That's why. I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
C: FRANK
D: Oh, yeah. No, no, no. They wouldn't --
C: GWEN
D: They wouldn't?
C: FRANK
D: no, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
C: GWEN
D: Kind of.
C: FRANK
D: I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there. But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World. Defining It. Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine. You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not? he.he.he.

D: Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
C: CLAUDIA
D: You take cream or sugar?
C: JIM KURRING
D: That'd be fine. So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud: They're incovenienced by that. If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?

C: CLAUDIA
D: It's not -- what's a 422?
C: JIM KURRING
D: It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help. Now there are certain measures you can take --
C: CLAUDIA
D: It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over. Really. It's not. He won't came back.

T: CUT TO:
N: INT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT Sequence F CAMERA pulls back from the TELEVISION above the bar, playing the show. We see Jimmy start to chat w/and do intro's for the adults.

C: DONNIE

C: DONNIE
D: "The" cause of dullness in others --
C: THURSTON
D: Picky, picky.
C: DONNIE
D: -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money? His parents? His mommy and daddy? Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
N: PATRON #1 You're parents took your money you won on that game show?

C: THURSTON
D: This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
C: DONNIE
D: I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
C: THURSTON
D: Shall we drink to that?
N: Donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up, CAMERA pushes in slow to an EXTREME CLOSE UP. He repeats line's from his days on "What Do Kids Know?" and does his best Jimmy immitation;
C: DONNIE
D: "If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?

S: INT. HOLIDAY INN SUITE - THAT MOMENT
N: Frank and Gwenovier doing the telvision interview. CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOW ON EACH:
C: FRANK
D: -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this: That there is no need for insight or understanding. Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is? I'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values. GOD DAMN I'M GOOD. There is no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language. The "listener-patient" settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new. The System's state. What did I do? I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn. I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
E: in other words: The Chick
C: GWENOVIER
D: Let's talk about --
C: FRANK
D: I just realized this is for television, isn't it? I can't swear up and down like I just did.
C: GWENOVIER
D: It's fine. I can bleep it out.
C: FRANK
D: I warned you -- I get on a roll...
C: GWENOVIER
D: -- let's talk more about your background --
C: FRANK
D: Muffy -- coffee?
N: Muffy moves to pour a cup, Gwen looks down at her clipboard, then:
C: GWENOVIER
D: I'm confused about your past is the thing.
C: FRANK
D: Is that still lingering?
C: GWENOVIER
D: -- just to clarify --
C: FRANK
D: So boring, so useless --
C: GWENOVIER
D: I would just want to clear some things up:
C: FRANK
D: Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
E: Muffy delivers coffee
C: GWENOVIER
D: This isn't meant --
C: FRANK
D: -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
C: GWENOVIER
D: Are you asking me that?
C: FRANK
D: Yes.
C: GWENOVIER
D: Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
C: FRANK
D: In aid of what?
C: GWENOVIER
D: I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
C: FRANK
D: -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself into --
C: GWENOVIER
D: It's all important --
C: FRANK
D: Not really.
C: GWENOVIER
D: It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
C: FRANK
D: This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
C: GWENOVIER
D: We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
C: FRANK
D: I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
C: GWENOVIER
D: Do you remember a Miss Simms?
C: FRANK
D: I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
C: GWENOVIER
D: She does. From when you were a boy.
C: FRANK
D: Mm. Hm.
C: GWENOVIER
D: She lived in Tarzana.
C: FRANK
D: An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
C: GWENOVIER
D: No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
C: FRANK
D: Go ahead and waste your time.
C: GWENOVIER
D: I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
C: FRANK
D: And that's what you've heard?
C: GWENOVIER
D: I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
N: BEAT. Frank goes silent.
C: GWENOVIER
D: In my research I have you listed as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980. See: It's my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank. And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then I think your family history -- you're accurate family history...well: this seems important...Frank...?

C: KLIGMAN
D: You can't change his will. Only Earl can change his will.
C: LINDA
D: No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand? I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...

C: LINDA
D: Where will the money go?
C: KLIGMAN
D: Well. Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
C: LINDA
D: What does that mean?
C: KLIGMAN
D: The money would go to Frank. The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
C: LINDA
D: -- that can't happen. Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
C: KLIGMAN
D: -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.

People think if I make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them...but that's not what I do and that's not what should be done...I have to take everything and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that's a very tricky thing on my part...making that call...the law is the law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but you can forgive someone....? Well, that's the tough part....What Do We Forgive?
