S: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
N: We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.
C: ZOE
D: I can't believe I didn't get a pedicure for this. How embarrassing. Look at that...
E: V.O.
N: The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.
C: ZOE
D: What's wrong with me? If I were with a real guy doing this, I would've gotten a pedicure. And a wax. I'm pathetic.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.
C: ZOE
D: Fuck, that one's even worse. And when did my toes get so fat? No wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed animal.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Zoe lets out a sigh. She speaks out-loud now.
C: ZOE
D: Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.
E: CONT'D
C: DR. HARRIS
D: What?
N: DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.
C: ZOE
D: My toes...sorry.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: I'm not looking at your toes.
C: ZOE
D: Right. Duh.
N: Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: All done.
C: ZOE
D: That's it?
N: And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something, girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: I'll elevate your legs for ten minutes and then you're good to go.
N: He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.
C: ZOE
D: This is the first time I've heard that ticking clock sound and it doesn't freak me out.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Good. Just relax.
C: ZOE
D: I can't, I'm totally freaking out.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Everything's going to be great. I have a feeling you and... Number CRM-101404 are going to make beautiful babies together.
E: checks empty syringe
N: Zoe smiles. Maybe he's right. Yeah...of course he's right.
C: BOBBY
D: Number CRM-101404? Are you high?
E: V.O.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: TITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file and points to a piece of paper.
C: BOBBY
D: Says here he has red hair and freckles.
C: ZOE
D: And glasses, too.
C: BOBBY
D: And why are we picking him?
C: ZOE
D: Because he's honest.
C: BOBBY
D: He's ugly.
N: Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.
C: ZOE
D: You think they're all telling the truth? If they're so smart and good looking, why are they beating off into a cup?
C: BOBBY
D: Have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles?
C: ZOE
D: No, and I won't have to.
C: BOBBY
D: But what about your kid? No one's going to want to fuck your kid. That came out wrong.
E: beat
C: ZOE
D: Yeah...it's a good thing you're not going to be the father.
S: INT. WAVERLY INN - NIGHT
N: TITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGO Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.
C: BOBBY
D: What? I can't be the father!
C: ZOE
D: Come on, we don't have to have sex.
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think about that. Rewind, rewind, rewind...
C: ZOE
D: You're one of my best friends. Don't you want to help me?
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll walk your dog, tell you when you look fat, be honest about your eyebrows...
C: ZOE
D: Just a few sperm. Big deal. You waste billions of them every night.
C: BOBBY
D: You know I flee at the slightest chance of intimacy. Do you see these bags under my eyes? Ricardo slept over last night, and he wanted to hold me. I actually had to fake a seizure.
C: ZOE
D: Forget it. Forget the whole thing.
N: Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.
C: MONA
D: Forget the whole thing. It's just a phase...
E: V.O.
S: INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: TITLE UP: TWELVE WEEKS AGO. Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the kitchen table.
C: MONA
D: You don't want kids. Trust me.
C: ZOE
D: Easy for you to say. You have four.
C: MONA
D: Yeah, and it's awful.
N: Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming. A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.
C: MONA
D: They've ruined my life.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Come on...
C: MONA
D: Have you seen my vagina?
N: Zoe shakes her head.
C: MONA
D: Do you want to?
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe shakes her head again.
C: MONA
D: I would do that for you. To prove to you that you don't want to have kids, I will show you my vagina.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I don't want to see your vagina. I want a baby. My own baby.
C: MONA
D: Is it possible you're just a little lonely? You know, you haven't met the right guy and--
C: ZOE
D: It's not about a guy. I don't need a guy. I don't even think I want a guy at this point. I've dated a hundred guys in the last five years, and not one of them is even close to being the one. How long am I supposed to wait?
C: MONA
D: You never know. He could be right around the corner.
C: ZOE
D: Well, then he's late. And I hate people who are late. And what if he's not right around the corner? What if he's miles away?
N: Zoe shakes her head. She becomes very serious.
C: ZOE
D: I want to have a baby. And time is running out. I hear a clock ticking every time I close my eyes. I need it to stop.
E: CONT'D
N: We hear a loud DING.
S: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
N: Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room. She looks at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.
C: ZOE
D: Ding.
N: Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears. Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.
C: ZOE
D: How the fuck am I supposed to get down from here?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER
N: Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris passes.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: You don't have to walk like that.
C: ZOE
D: Oh. Okay.
N: Zoe separates her legs an inch. And then closes them.
C: ZOE
D: Should we hug? We might have just made a baby together.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this exclusive baby club.
C: ZOE
D: Hi.
C: PREGNANT WOMEN
D: Hi.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
N: Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...
C: ZOE
D: Hi.
C: WOMAN
D: Hi.
N: The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.
C: WOMAN
D: You're starting to freak me out.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Sorry.
N: Zoe looks down. After a beat, she sneaks another look.
C: WOMAN
D: Stop it.
S: EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
N: It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over their heads. Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together. A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.
C: ZOE
D: Hi!
N: Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She rounds the corner towards the subway station and then, miraculously, spies a cab.
C: ZOE
D: Taxi!
E: CONT'D
N: She runs (little steps) across the street.
S: INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe closes the door behind her.
C: ZOE
D: Hallelujah!
N: As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices someone entering the cab from the other side. This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid -- faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.
C: ZOE
D: Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: You own it?
C: ZOE
D: No, but I'm about to rent it.
C: STAN
D: Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it.
C: ZOE
D: I don't think so.
C: STAN
D: If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours.
C: ZOE
D: I didn't see you.
C: STAN
D: I saw you see me.
C: ZOE
D: Sir, who saw you first?
E: to the cabbie
N: The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.
C: STAN
D: Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code. It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we--
C: ZOE
D: Fine. Forget it. I'll get out.
N: Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.
C: ZOE
D: But not because you're right, but because I am in a terrific mood, and you are ruining it.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: No. I'll get out.
N: They each get out.
S: EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.
C: ZOE
D: Now what?
C: STAN
D: I don't know. You tell me.
N: That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.
C: ZOE
D: What? Where's he going?! Come back!
E: waving her hands, then
N: They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.
C: ZOE
D: Well, that was stupid. Why'd you get out, you, stupid-head?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: You said you were in a great mood and I was ruining it. I felt bad. Did you just call me stupid-head?
E: then
N: Zoe storms off with her little steps.
S: INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY
N: Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time. They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, man...
C: STAN
D: How's your great mood now?
S: INT. 6 TRAIN - DAY
N: A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.
C: STAN
D: How `bout now?
C: ZOE
D: Please stop talking to me.
S: INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAY
N: Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.
C: STAN
D: So, why are you in such a good mood anyway?
N: They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet and has a magical quality.
C: ZOE
D: Not that it's any of your business, but...good things are happening to me.
N: Stan is moved by this. What a thing to say.
C: STAN
D: That's nice. I hope it continues.
C: ZOE
D: Thanks. Well, have a nice life. Try not to steal any more cabs.
C: STAN
D: You do the same.
N: They nod and separate.
S: INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY
N: Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits. Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.
C: ZOE
D: Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?
N: She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina hottie, and Bobby run from the back.
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, my God, you're glowing. She's glowing, right?
E: to Jalisa
C: JALISA
D: Glowing. Tell us everything.
C: BOBBY
D: Everything.
C: ZOE
D: There's not much to tell.
C: BOBBY
D: You just got shot up with a wad of red-headed-freckle sperm. There's something to tell.
C: JALISA
D: He had red hair and freckles?
C: BOBBY
D: I tried to talk her out of it.
C: JALISA
D: Why'd you do that, Mami?
C: BOBBY
D: I know, right?
E: to Jalisa
C: JALISA
D: Red pubes. Eek...
C: ZOE
D: I'm never going to see his pubes!
C: BOBBY
D: You'll see your kid's pubes.
C: ZOE
D: I doubt it.
C: BOBBY
D: But you'll know they're there.
C: ZOE
D: What is wrong with you?
C: JALISA
D: So, what happened? Come on...
C: ZOE
D: I lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over. I barely felt a thing.
C: BOBBY
D: Sounds like Ricardo.
C: JALISA
D: Tell me about it, Papi.
N: Bobby and Jalisa high five. Bobby then turns to Zoe.
C: BOBBY
D: So...what happens now?
C: ZOE
D: Now, we wait.
C: BOBBY
D: That's no fun, I want to know if I'm going to be a fairy godmother.
C: ZOE
D: We'll just have to wait and see.
N: Zoe smiles and heads for the back.
S: EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT
N: The lights in the pet store go dark. Moments later, Zoe, Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can have an O'Dhouls or something.
C: JALISA
D: We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.
C: BOBBY
D: Forget it, she's not coming. I can tell by the dull look on her face.
C: ZOE
D: Love you.
N: They all hug. Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm, singing.
C: BOBBY/JALISA
D: I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign...
N: Zoe turns to lock up. While her back is turned, Stan appears from the shadows.
C: STAN
D: Hi.
C: ZOE
D: Aahhh!
N: Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.
C: ZOE
D: You scared the hell out of me!
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Oh, wow. Is he...okay?
N: Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning. Zoe sets him upright.
C: ZOE
D: What are you doing here?
C: STAN
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Or hurt your dog. Don't worry, I'm not a stalker.
C: ZOE
D: How'd you know I worked here?
C: STAN
D: I followed you after the subway. That sounds a little stalkery, huh?
E: thinks, then
C: ZOE
D: Yeah.
C: STAN
D: I just really wanted to see you again. Almost like I had to see you again. Can I walk you home? Is it me or does everything I say make me sound more like a stalker?
E: then
N: Zoe allows a small smile.
C: STAN
D: Can I just give you my card? Here. Take my card. I'm not a freak. Really. I sell cheese.
E: CONT'D
N: This hangs out there for a beat.
C: ZOE
D: Cheese?
C: STAN
D: Yeah. My family has a goat farm. We make cheese. You like cheese?
C: ZOE
D: I guess. I've never really thought about it.
C: STAN
D: Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us at the Farmer's market? Come by sometime and you can taste my cheese. Okay, I'm going to go. This has not gone as planned.
E: then
N: Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.
C: ZOE
D: Bye.
N: Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around. Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.
S: EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNING
N: Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow. Zoe opens her eyes. After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.
S: INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small, East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing. This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL, 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.
C: CAROL
D: Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.
C: EVERYONE
D: Hi, Zoe.
C: CAROL
D: Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice. As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen.
N: The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to Zoe.
C: LORI
D: Are you a doer or a tryer?
C: ZOE
D: Excuse me?
C: LORI
D: Are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one?
C: ZOE
D: Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just inseminated a few days ago. Inseminated...makes me feel like a cow or something.
E: then
C: CAROL
D: Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right? So, tell us a little bit about yourself.
E: then
C: ZOE
D: Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet store on Hudson Street. Dogs, cats, rabbits...no birds, they creep me out. Before that, I worked for Google, which I completely hated. One day, I decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, I quit Google, cashed out and bought the pet store. Now I'm really happy on the work front, but I still haven't found, you know, the one.
C: CAROL
D: Ah, yes. The elusive "one."
C: ZOE
D: I always imagined I'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way. So, time for Plan B.
C: CAROL
D: Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. But guess what...you have to create your own happiness. You don't need someone to complete you, some...man. You already are complete.
C: LORI
D: Amen, sister.
C: CAROL
D: If you want to have a baby, we here at Single Mothers By Choice can be your partners. We will be your emotional rocks.
N: Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl covered in tatoos. And several more...
C: CAROL
D: From inception to college graduation and everything in between. We're here for each other.
E: CONT'D
N: Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.
C: SARA
D: Dakota was actually born right here in this very room. Right where you're sitting, actually.
C: ZOE
D: Really? Right here? Imagine that.
E: uncomfortable
C: SARA
D: Best day of my life.
C: ZOE
D: And how old is she now?
N: Dakota looks up from the breast.
C: DAKOTA
D: I'm three.
S: INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY
N: Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of pastries and a pot of coffee.
C: MONA
D: Why did you join a support group of unattractive, militant lesbians when you have me?
C: ZOE
D: Because you're really not that supportive.
C: MONA
D: Sure I am.
C: ZOE
D: You just told me that if I breast- feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks.
C: MONA
D: I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder.
C: ZOE
D: What does it do to your bladder?
N: Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.
C: MONA
D: I just peed a little bit.
C: ZOE
D: I don't think I'm pregnant. The doctor says it will probably take several tries. Something about frozen sperm being lazy.
C: MONA
D: Good. Take your time.
N: Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.
C: ZOE
D: So, should I call this guy? Do you think that would be weird?
C: MONA
D: Do I think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable? No. Because that's what you do. You sabotage.
C: ZOE
D: He works at the Farmer's market. And it's right around the corner. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
E: ignoring her
C: MONA
D: I look fat and old?
C: ZOE
D: No.
C: MONA
D: Then, no.
C: ZOE
D: Let's go spy on him. Come on. It will be fun. Like high school.
C: MONA
D: I can't. This twenty minute breakfast concludes my "me" time for the week. More proof that you should not have kids.
E: checks watch
S: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
N: The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby. Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there. She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, well.
N: She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around. As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band. He's playing banjo. Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.
C: OLIVIA
D: Can I help you?
C: ZOE
D: No, I'm fine.
E: distracted
N: Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan.
C: OLIVIA
D: Tasty, huh?
N: Zoe nods and takes another berry.
C: OLIVIA
D: All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe now turns, confused.
C: ZOE
D: What?
C: OLIVIA
D: And don't look now, but he's coming this way.
N: Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder.
C: STAN
D: A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all.
C: ZOE
D: I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie.
E: trying to be casual
C: STAN
D: I love blueberry pie.
N: Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something.
C: STAN
D: What makes you think I don't?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know, you're over there playing the banjo.
C: STAN
D: Can't someone do both?
C: ZOE
D: Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either.
N: Olivia returns.
C: OLIVIA
D: Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend?
C: STAN
D: Nope. Come on. Let me show you around.
E: to Zoe
N: Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away. Olivia watches them go with her arms crossed.
S: EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER
N: Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.
C: STAN
D: This is our basic chevre, probably our best seller. The cheese that started it all, as they say. Then over here we have our surface- ripened cheeses. These are the aged/raw milk cheeses. This is really boring, huh?
E: realizing
C: ZOE
D: No, not at all.
C: STAN
D: It's like you're in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese. You don't want to watch it, but somehow you can't stop...
C: ZOE
D: I think it's interesting. Really.
E: laughing
C: STAN
D: All right, you asked for it... The aged/raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Usually more. Depends on the cheese.
E: boring voice
C: FRED
D: Stop. You're killing me.
N: FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks up from behind the counter.
C: STAN
D: Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred. She's the one I followed from the subway the other day like a total psychopath.
E: then
C: FRED
D: Right...I heard about you.
C: ZOE
D: I don't know whether to be flattered or terrified.
C: FRED
D: Be afraid.
C: STAN
D: Don't scare her away. I'm trying to redeem myself.
C: FRED
D: Then you should put down the banjo. You look like a doofus.
C: STAN
D: Doofus? Do you think I look like a doofus?
E: then, to Zoe
C: ZOE
D: I don't really know what a doofus looks like.
N: Fred points to Stan.
C: STAN
D: Okay. If I put the banjo down, can I take you to lunch or something?
C: ZOE
D: I should really get back to work.
C: STAN
D: Come on, say the word and we can have a six-course tasting menu at Union Square Cafe. I know the chef.
C: ZOE
D: That sounds nice, but, I should probably go.
C: STAN
D: Well, can I call you?
N: Zoe smiles.
S: INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY
N: Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost her.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay, spill it.
C: JALISA
D: Who is he? What does he do? How do we know him?
C: ZOE
D: What are you talking about?
C: JALISA
D: Stan from the Farmer's Market? He's called twice already.
C: ZOE
D: Really?
C: BOBBY
D: Is he a farmer? Because that's not okay.
C: ZOE
D: No. He makes cheese.
C: BOBBY
D: He's a pilgrim?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know what he is. He's cute and different and plays the banjo. I think I like him.
E: then
C: BOBBY
D: What about the, you know, bun in the oven?
C: ZOE
D: I really doubt I'm pregnant.
C: JALISA
D: You want to be pregnant. You don't want to be pregnant. I'm confused.
C: ZOE
D: I want to be pregnant. Of course I want to be pregnant. I mean, I put a lot of thought into this, right? So what did Stan say?
E: then
C: BOBBY
D: He says to name any restaurant you want to go to.
E: MORE
C: BOBBY
D: He'll be there with bells on. He didn't say the "bells on" part. I added that. Sounds a little too gay, though, so I take it back.
E: CONT'D then
S: EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT
N: Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.
S: INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT
N: Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.
C: STAN
D: We could have gone anywhere.
C: ZOE
D: Just take a bite. You'll see.
C: STAN
D: Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...
C: ZOE
D: Gray's Papaya. Cheers.
N: She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.
C: ZOE
D: Good, right?
E: CONT'D
N: Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.
C: ZOE
D: You've lived here your whole life and never been to Gray's Papaya. What's wrong with you?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I actually haven't lived here my whole life. We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm....not died, but actually bought a farm and moved upstate.
C: ZOE
D: That must have been a nice place to grow up. On a farm.
C: STAN
D: What about your family?
C: ZOE
D: It's just me and my grandmother. She lives in a retirement community in Queens. My parents died when I was young.
E: an awkward beat
C: STAN
D: I'm so sorry.
N: There is a long silence. They both stare at the hot dogs.
C: STAN
D: I don't know what to say now. I've made it all awkward and sad.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: It's okay. My dad was kind of a bad guy, anyway.
E: then
C: STAN
D: Shit. I'm so sorry, Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: No, come on, we'll get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again. Let's ask all the awkward, get-to-know- you questions right now.
C: STAN
D: Okay. Good idea.
C: ZOE
D: Let's see...are you religious?
C: STAN
D: Nope. What about you?
C: ZOE
D: No.
C: STAN
D: Have you ever been married?
C: ZOE
D: No.
C: STAN
D: Aren't you sick of going to weddings?
C: ZOE
D: If I have to listen to one more couple write their own vows...
C: STAN
D: I hate when they write their own vows!
N: They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay together, feeling the charge between them.
C: STAN
D: What about kids?
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks. Like everyone there must now be looking at her.
C: ZOE
D: What about them?
C: STAN
D: Well, do you want them?
C: ZOE
D: Yeah. I want kids.
N: She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real. She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.
C: ZOE
D: Do you?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Yeah. Absolutely.
N: Zoe nods. Slowly, she starts to breathe again.
S: EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT
N: They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.
C: ZOE
D: Okay, first kiss...
C: STAN
D: Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She wore a head-gear. What about you?
C: ZOE
D: Summer camp. I think his name was--
N: Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...
C: ZOE
D: That was way better.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: When can I see you again?
N: Zoe feels her heart jump. She kisses him again.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her. The sun is shining and they are both waking up. She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight look of concern on her face.
S: INT. EQUINOX - DAY
N: Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.
C: ZOE
D: What if I'm pregnant?
C: MONA
D: Then you'll get fat and hormonal and I'll say, "I told you so."
C: ZOE
D: But what if this could go somewhere with Stan? Like, really go somewhere.
C: MONA
D: Then it will work out perfectly.
C: ZOE
D: What do you mean?
C: MONA
D: Because just when you really like him, you'll break up because you're pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt. That's your dream.
C: ZOE
D: I'm not pregnant.
E: thinks, then
N: She gets off the machine.
S: INT. EQUINOX STEAM ROOM - DAY
N: We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other WOMEN.
C: MONA
D: So, when are you seeing him again?
C: ZOE
D: Tonight.
C: MONA
D: Well, don't have sex with him. That's the last thing we need. You get knocked up and we'll have no idea who the father is.
N: A few women look over.
C: MONA
D: And then we'll have to do a paternity test. Is it the cheese farmer or the red-pubed bandit?
E: CONT'D
N: More women look over.
C: ZOE
D: I'm not going to have sex with him tonight. It's too soon. I'm not a slut.
E: for the women's benefit
C: MONA
D: Well, bring condoms, just in case. And a pregnancy test.
E: thinks, then
C: ZOE
D: Very funny.
C: MONA
D: I'm not joking.
N: All of the women are now staring at Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: I'm really not a slut.
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands. Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her.
C: ZOE
D: There's no way, right?
S: INT. ZOE'S BATHEROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe pees on the stick. Nuts is beside her, watching with his head tilted.
C: ZOE
D: Stop looking at me like that. I'm not pregnant.
N: Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test. Nothing yet.
C: ZOE
D: Come on, come on, come on...
E: CONT'D
N: We hear the doorbell RING.
C: ZOE
D: Shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing. We wait and watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.
C: ZOE
D: Shit!
E: CONT'D
N: A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.
C: ZOE
D: Shitshitshitshit...
E: CONT'D
N: The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops. There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant.
C: ZOE
D: No, shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe stands. Looks at herself in the mirror. And then...
C: ZOE
D: Holy fucking shit!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. TAXI - NIGHT
N: Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.
C: STAN
D: Are you feeling okay?
N: Zoe nods. Her face looks pale.
C: STAN
D: Good, because this should really be a culinary adventure. This is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment, depending on the chef.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls the window all the way down and hangs her head out.
C: STAN
D: And some of the guys from the band will be there. So, we might get a little jam going. Sounds fun, right? Zoe?
E: CONT'D then
N: Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like a bad dream.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of sweat on her forehead.
C: STAN
D: And this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta.
N: He takes some for each of them.
C: STAN
D: And this, oh this must be white beans and lamb's tongue. You've got to have some of this. Etienne is famous for his lamb's tongue.
E: CONT'D
N: Olivia approaches.
C: OLIVIA
D: Hey, stranger.
C: STAN
D: Oh, hey, Olivia. You remember Zoe.
C: OLIVIA
D: Right. How'd that blueberry pie turn out?
C: ZOE
D: What?
C: OLIVIA
D: You bought blueberries from me? Said you were going to make a pie?
C: ZOE
D: Um, can you excuse me for a second?
N: Zoe hurries off. Olivia watches her go. Eyes narrowing.
C: OLIVIA
D: No way she knows how to bake a pie.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone.
C: ZOE
D: I'm pregnant.
C: BOBBY
D: What?! Where are you? I'm on my way.
E: O.S.
C: ZOE
D: Brooklyn.
C: BOBBY
D: Where's that?
E: O.S.
N: Zoe hangs up the phone.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe is now on the phone with Mona.
C: MONA
D: Don't panic. Could be a false positive. Take another test.
E: O.S.
C: ZOE
D: I can't. I'm at some underground foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am I gonna--
N: Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.
S: INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT
N: Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three...what the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket. Her cell phone RINGS. It's Bobby. She picks it up.
C: BOBBY
D: Okay, I'm looking at a subway map. Which way is Brooklyn?
E: O.S.
N: She hangs up again.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.
C: STAN
D: Where have you been?
N: Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.
C: ZOE
D: Sorry. You scared me.
C: STAN
D: Did you just go to the store?
C: ZOE
D: Yeah, I had a little emergency. I have a, a, um...corn, and I needed to get those little...corn pads.
C: STAN
D: Corn pads?
C: ZOE
D: I know, it's gross. Do you know where the bathroom is?
N: Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder.
C: STAN
D: What's a corn pad?
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe pees on eight sticks at once.
C: ZOE
D: Corn pad? What the hell is wrong with you?
N: Someone KNOCKS on the door.
C: ZOE
D: Corn pad. Jesus Christ.
E: CONT'D
N: The knocking turns to an angry BANGING.
C: ZOE
D: Relax! I'll be out in... Three to five minutes.
E: CONT'D checks box
N: Zoe holds up the tests. One by one, the little windows all show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.
S: INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a glass of wine. She rushes over.
C: ZOE
D: Excuse me, are you allowed to drink when you're...
N: Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word.
C: ZOE
D: You know...
E: CONT'D
N: More hand gestures.
C: PREGNANT WOMAN
D: Pregnant? My doctor says one glass is--
E: off Zoe's nod
N: Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish. She rushes the bar, pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling a beer. Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.
S: EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME
N: Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called "Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."
C: STAN
D: Who makes me forget all the other girls I met, sweet, little Miss Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me, than she really ought to be, sweet little Miss Blue Eyes.
N: Zoe appears at the door to the patio. Stan smiles at her while he sings.
C: STAN
D: Who's gonna start takin' care of my heart, she makes me realize. And it's lucky for me and I really want to be with... sweet, little Miss--
E: CONT'D winks at Zoe
N: Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts for the bathroom, puking.
C: STAN
D: Blue eyes?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done, she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.
C: ZOE
D: Ohhhhhhhh.
N: She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor. One that must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet, mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her eyes.
C: ZOE
D: Please, God...
E: CONT'D
N: But she can't pee. She tries and tries.
C: ZOE
D: Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to...
E: CONT'D
N: She doubles over and pukes between her knees. When she's done, she holds up the test. CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.
C: ZOE
D: Fuck me.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT
N: Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.
C: STAN
D: My singing made you vomit.
C: ZOE
D: No. It's not that.
C: STAN
D: Sure, we were a little out of tune, but...
C: ZOE
D: I really don't feel well.
C: STAN
D: Is it your corns? Hurts to walk?
N: ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching. Zoe's face pales.
C: CAROL
D: Zoe?
C: ZOE
D: Wow. Hi. Hey, there...
C: CAROL
D: Where have you been? You haven't been coming to any--
C: ZOE
D: Right. I know. I've been so busy. Next one, I'm there. For sure. This is my friend, Stan.
E: cutting her off then, awkward
C: STAN
D: Hi.
C: CAROL
D: Hello. Are you two--
E: eyeing Stan suspiciously
C: ZOE
D: Late. Yes. We are. We really are. I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.
E: pushing Stan along
N: They walk on. Stan looks at Zoe.
C: STAN
D: An old...boyfriend?
C: ZOE
D: Her name is Carol. We're on a...committee together.
N: They reach Zoe's front stoop. Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder to make sure Carol's gone.
C: ZOE
D: All right. I have to go to bed now. I'll call you, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Okay. Hey, I was thinking, if you don't have any plans this weekend, maybe you'd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days.
E: then
C: ZOE
D: I'll call you tomorrow. Something's not agreeing with me.
C: STAN
D: Was it the lamb's tongue?
N: Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth. Stan stands there for a beat. He calls after her.
C: STAN
D: Okay, well...this weekend. Think about it.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear.
C: ZOE
D: What the hell have I done?
S: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY
N: Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.
S: INT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY
N: The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada. Zoe walks by the front desk. ANNIE, an employee, looks up.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi, Zoe. You look fantastic.
C: ZOE
D: I don't know how that's possible.
C: ANNIE
D: Something's different. Did you get highlights or a spray tan? Your face looks like it's...
C: ZOE
D: Please don't say glowing.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes! Exactly!
S: EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER
N: There is a small group of WOMEN speed walking around the courtyard. They are fully decked out in jogging suits, visors and nose shields. The ringleader is NANA, 83, fit and fabulous. On the sidelines is ARTHUR, 87, with his walker and big grin, as he watches the ladies exercise.
C: ZOE
D: Morning, Arthur.
C: ARTHUR
D: Hello, my dear!
N: He struggles to get up.
C: ZOE
D: No, no, no, don't get up.
C: ARTHUR
D: Good, because I can't get up. Came to see my lovely fiance? She's looking fine today, let me tell you. Fine.
N: Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically.
C: ZOE
D: Hi, Nana.
C: NANA
D: One more mile to go. Do you have a minute? Talk to Arthur.
N: Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding.
C: ARTHUR
D: That's what I'm talking about. Work it.
N: Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.
S: EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER
N: Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.
C: NANA
D: Do you want a nose guard? I have an extra.
C: ZOE
D: No, I'm fine.
C: SHIRLEY
D: Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck just had another carcinoma removed from her nose.
C: ZOE
D: I kind of need to talk to you. Alone.
E: to Nana
N: Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.
C: NANA
D: Don't worry, they can't hear anything anyway.
C: ZOE
D: I'm pregnant.
C: NANA
D: What?
E: can't hear her
C: ZOE
D: I'm pregnant.
C: NANA
D: What?
C: ZOE
D: I'm pregnant.
C: NANA
D: I can't hear you, darling.
C: SHIRLEY
D: Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant. Turn your hearing aide up.
N: Zoe closes her eyes. Nightmare.
S: INT. NANA'S ROOM - LATER
N: Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea. Zoe's eyes well with tears.
C: ZOE
D: What am I going to do?
C: NANA
D: I'm confused. Isn't this what you wanted? You bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor. This isn't what we would call an accident.
C: ZOE
D: But now it's all happening so fast. Did I really think this through?
C: NANA
D: We talked about it for months. You said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world.
C: ZOE
D: But this guy, he's...special. It's all going to fall apart now.
C: NANA
D: What makes him so special?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. He's very...real. And funny. And different. The other guys I've been with all had their briefcases and their five- year plans and their secretaries they were fucking. Stan doesn't have a five-year plan. I don't even know if he has a plan.
C: NANA
D: What about a secretary?
C: ZOE
D: Some kid named Fred. I like him, Nana.
E: then
C: NANA
D: Well, if he's the right one, he'll stay.
C: ZOE
D: Do you really think so?
C: NANA
D: Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that would be enough to appease you.
C: ZOE
D: Should I still visit him for the weekend? Or should I just vanish and hope he forgets I ever existed.
C: NANA
D: Don't be silly. Go up there for the weekend. Spend some time with him and see what he's really like.
C: ZOE
D: Yeah. You're right.
C: NANA
D: You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot.
N: Zoe looks at Nana. Douchebag?
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally.
C: ZOE
D: Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. Could happen, right?
N: WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat. He's yawning.
C: ZOE
D: I'm sorry. Am I keeping you up?
E: CONT'D
N: Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.
C: ZOE
D: My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open? Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why am I so tired? I slept nine hours. And I'm starving, too. What the hell is going on?
E: CONT'D yawning thinks, then
N: Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.
S: INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY
N: Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.
C: ZOE
D: Am I even allowed to drink coffee?
N: The trucker looks at her. She looks at him.
C: ZOE
D: Do you know anything about being pregnant?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. CAR - LATER
N: Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere.
S: INT. CAR - SAME
N: Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is in her lap. Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the little coffee cup.
C: ZOE
D: Thanks a lot, decaf.
N: She picks up the phone.
C: STAN
D: Where are you?
E: O.S.
N: Zoe looks around.
C: ZOE
D: I have no idea.
S: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
N: Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top. Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.
C: ZOE
D: He's so not a douchebag.
S: INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: They enter the front door. Zoe takes in the charming carriage house.
C: ZOE
D: I can't believe you live here. This is ridiculous.
C: STAN
D: I just come on weekends. My parents really live here.
C: ZOE
D: Oh. Where are they now?
C: STAN
D: In the kitchen.
N: Zoe stops short.
C: ZOE
D: Wait, they're here? Now? Is this a "meet the parents" kind of thing? I wasn't prepared for this.
C: STAN
D: No. Not at all. I mean, you'll meet them, but--
C: ZOE
D: When you said come up for the weekend, I assumed it was just us. I think I need to lay down.
E: then
S: INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.
C: STAN
D: Are you hung-over or something?
C: ZOE
D: I'm just...not myself. Give me ten minutes. A ten-minute power nap and I'm good. I need to regroup.
C: STAN
D: Are you sure you're okay? Zoe? Hello?
E: then
N: But she's already out. Stan gives her a little poke.
S: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in- law.
C: EDWARD
D: Oh. It's just you.
C: STAN
D: She's taking a nap.
C: JOAN
D: A nap? Now? She just got here.
C: STAN
D: Mom, I need you to not be judgemental, okay. I like this girl a lot.
C: JOAN
D: How can I be judgemental? We haven't even met her yet.
N: We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.
C: JOAN
D: What the heck is that?
E: CONT'D
N: The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.
C: STAN
D: Oh. This is Nuts.
N: Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.
C: JOAN
D: Who's judging?!
S: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position. Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.
C: ZOE
D: What was that?
N: We hear the GRUMBLE again. It's her stomach. She puts her hands over it.
C: ZOE
D: Whoa.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
S: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.
C: ZOE
D: Stan?
E: whispering
N: No one in sight. She waits a beat and then whispers louder.
C: ZOE
D: Stan!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen. Nuts is with her.
C: ZOE
D: Stan? Hello?
N: Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the pot. It's beef stew.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, my God.
E: CONT'D
N: She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon. She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, my God.
E: CONT'D mouth full
N: She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands there. And stands there some more.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, who am I kidding?
E: CONT'D
N: She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.
C: ZOE
D: Oh. My. God.
E: CONT'D
N: Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one. Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop. And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows is she's supposed to be open-minded.
C: JOAN
D: Would you like a plate?
N: Zoe shakes her head no. Wow. This is embarrassing.
C: JOAN
D: A napkin?
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.
C: JOAN
D: I'm Joan.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe nods. Still can't swallow the bite.
C: JOAN
D: And you must be Zoe.
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
N: The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.
C: EDWARD
D: The stew is delicious, honey.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.
C: EDWARD
D: Have you ever in your life had stew like this? Come on, be honest.
E: to Zoe
N: Zoe looks at Joan. Joan smiles. It will be their secret.
C: ZOE
D: Uh...no. Never.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: They are having coffee and dessert in the living room. Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.
C: JOAN
D: So are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled?
C: ZOE
D: Oh, you can say paralyzed. He doesn't mind. No, our pets are all in great shape. Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills.
E: then
C: JOAN
D: Those puppy mills are terrible. I read about them in the paper.
C: ZOE
D: Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair.
C: EDWARD
D: You should have sued that place.
C: ZOE
D: I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better.
C: STAN
D: You worked for Google?
N: Zoe nods.
C: STAN
D: How could I not know that?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: You never asked.
C: STAN
D: And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store?
N: Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.
C: STAN
D: I love that.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: It's been fun. Beats brand management, that's for sure.
C: JOAN
D: That sounds like us, honey.
E: to Edward
C: EDWARD
D: It's true. When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. And now, twenty years later, here we are...
E: to Zoe
C: JOAN
D: Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. Make things happen your own way, you know?
N: Zoe forces a smile. If only they knew.
S: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT
N: The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan walk the grounds of the farm. Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.
C: STAN
D: I can't believe that Nuts has an off-road wheelchair.
C: ZOE
D: He's got one for snow, too. With little skis on the bottom.
N: Stan smiles and shakes his head.
C: ZOE
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: You're really something.
C: ZOE
D: Are you making fun of me? Do you think I spoil him?
C: STAN
D: No, I really think you're amazing. I mean, that story you told tonight. You just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog? Started your own business, just like that?
N: Zoe shrugs.
C: STAN
D: You're very...unique.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Well, you're a dime a dozen. I can't tell you how many banjo playing, cheese makers I've been with.
C: STAN
D: I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, how can you be so perfect? Why are you even still single? I can't believe no one's snatched you up by now.
C: ZOE
D: I drive them all away, I guess.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, right.
N: Stan takes her in his arms.
C: STAN
D: Look, I know this is all going fast...the time we're spending together, meeting my parents and everything...but, I'm okay with that. I want it to go fast.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: It is going fast.
C: STAN
D: But isn't that okay? Aren't we old enough to skip all the bullshit? What are we waiting for? I...want to be with you.
N: Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him. Before this goes any further, she has to tell him.
C: ZOE
D: Stan.
C: STAN
D: Come on. There's something I want to show you.
S: INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHT
N: It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese. Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.
C: ZOE
D: What is it?
C: STAN
D: It's cheese.
C: ZOE
D: I can see that.
C: STAN
D: It's a new kind of goat's milk we're using. I've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age. It'll be ready for market in several months. Want to know what it's called?
E: then, excited
C: ZOE
D: Okay.
C: STAN
D: Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: You named a piece of cheese after me?
C: STAN
D: Not just one piece. The whole line. This will forever in history be known as the Zoe.
E: MORE
C: STAN
D: Unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it. But that'll never happen.
E: CONT'D with a wink
C: ZOE
D: How do you know?
C: STAN
D: Because it's going to be fantastic. Sweet and sassy and very complex. Why do you think I'm calling it Zoe?
C: ZOE
D: No one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before.
N: Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.
C: STAN
D: You're kind of hard to read right now. You're either seriously flattered or totally repulsed.
N: Zoe smiles.
C: STAN
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I want to kiss you right now, but it really smells like cheese in here.
S: EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATER
N: The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out. Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like crazy.
S: INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.
S: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
C: ZOE
D: You're such a douchebag.
E: under her breath
C: STAN
D: What?
N: Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER
N: They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling. They look happy and worn out Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left. Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...
C: STAN
D: That was amazing. I mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing.
N: Zoe turns to him. Takes a deep breath.
C: ZOE
D: Stan.
C: STAN
D: Yeah.
C: ZOE
D: There's something I really have to tell you.
C: STAN
D: There's something I have to tell you, too.
N: Now Stan turns to her. They are face-to-face.
C: STAN
D: Can I go first? `Cause if we're going to say the same thing, I want to say it first.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: We're not going to say the same thing.
C: STAN
D: Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and I just have to say it.
C: ZOE
D: Okay.
C: STAN
D: I've dated a lot of women. I mean, not tons, but a lot. And, the thing is, I've never...been in love before. I've never even told anyone I love them before. Because I just never felt it. But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, I feel this, this... Maybe this is too much to say right now, but...I love you, Zoe. I really do.
E: he shakes his head
N: Stan finishes. He looks at her and smiles. Zoe just stares at him.
C: STAN
D: In my mind, you were supposed to say, I love you, too.
E: CONT'D
N: Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom. A beat later, we hear her vomit.
S: INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth. Stan enters.
C: STAN
D: Zoe?
N: He looks at her. Sees the tears in her eyes.
C: STAN
D: Why are you crying? Everything's perfect.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: It's not.
C: STAN
D: Sure it is.
N: Zoe takes a deep breath.
C: STAN
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I'm pregnant.
C: STAN
D: Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast.
N: Zoe shakes her head.
C: ZOE
D: I just found out.
C: STAN
D: Pregnant? As in you're going to have a baby?
N: Zoe nods.
C: STAN
D: I don't understand.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I know. It's hard to explain.
C: STAN
D: Well, who's it?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know.
C: STAN
D: What?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know who the father is. I kind of know him. I just don't know his name exactly. It was sort of anonymous.
C: STAN
D: Anonymous?
C: ZOE
D: He's a donor. From a sperm bank.
C: STAN
D: Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? Sperm bank? What?
C: ZOE
D: I know, this is so fucked up.
C: STAN
D: When did all of this happen?
C: ZOE
D: The day we met. That same day. And I didn't tell you because I didn't think there was any way I could be pregnant.
C: STAN
D: But...why?
C: ZOE
D: Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...
C: STAN
D: No, why would you do this?
C: ZOE
D: Because I wanted a baby. And I'm almost forty, and I never met the right guy. I was afraid if I waited any longer it would all pass me by, and I'd miss my chance.
N: Stan just looks at her. Speechless.
C: ZOE
D: I didn't know you. I would have never done it if--
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I just told you I loved you.
C: ZOE
D: Well....do you not now?
C: STAN
D: You're pregnant.
C: ZOE
D: Don't say it like that.
C: STAN
D: You're pregnant.
C: ZOE
D: Yes. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
C: STAN
D: I tell you I'm in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some stranger's child?
C: ZOE
D: Don't say it like that. You make it sound dirty.
C: STAN
D: I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I don't know what to say. What the fuck am I supposed to say?! This is great fucking news? Congratulations?! Why did you wait so long to tell me?
C: ZOE
D: Because I'm freaking out, okay! I didn't know what to do. I made this big decision to do this and then I met you--
C: STAN
D: Well, what am I supposed to do now? This isn't how it was supposed to be. This isn't what--
C: ZOE
D: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life isn't perfect. It's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band. It's messy. It's fucked up. This is real life, okay? I'm sorry to break it to you.
N: They both stand there. After the raised voices, the silence feels more pronounced.
C: ZOE
D: I'm sorry.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Sorry? What's sorry going to do?
N: Stan walks out. Zoe stands there. And stands there. And then she starts to cry.
S: INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Zoe lies in bed awake. Nuts is beside her. They are alone.
S: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
N: It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats from one pasture to another.
S: INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING
N: Stan lies awake in a small guest room. Joan enters and is startled to find him in there.
C: JOAN
D: Oh, I thought you were in your room. Sorry. Everything okay?
E: then
N: Stan doesn't answer. Joan sits on the corner of the bed.
C: JOAN
D: Well, she seems really terrific. Dad and I both think so. She's smart and poised and...
E: CONT'D
N: Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops. Then, wanting to seem open-minded, continues.
C: JOAN
D: And warm and gracious...
E: CONT'D
N: Another very LOUD HURL.
C: JOAN
D: And pretty and...
E: CONT'D
N: Another HURL. Joan looks at Stan.
C: JOAN
D: What the hell's going on in there?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: She's pregnant.
C: JOAN
D: Oh, dear God.
N: We hear the toilet FLUSH.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition. Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.
C: ZOE
D: I don't know what to say.
N: Neither does Stan, who says nothing. He runs his foot back and forth in the gravel.
C: ZOE
D: I guess I'd given up on meeting someone like you, and I did what I thought was best.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan still doesn't say anything.
C: ZOE
D: But, for what it's worth...I love you, too.
E: CONT'D
N: She puts the car in gear and pulls out. Stan watches her go. His hands in his pockets.
S: EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building. A beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.
C: MONA
D: Come here.
N: Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual. She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach. For the first time, we actually see a little bump.
S: INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY
N: Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure. Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Congratulations! What luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh? And with frozen sperm, too. So, how are we feeling?
C: ZOE
D: Okay.
E: unconvincing
C: DR. HARRIS
D: You sure about that?
C: ZOE
D: It's been hard. I don't know if I was really prepared for this.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult.
N: Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Well, the good news is everything looks great. You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today.
E: CONT'D
N: On the screen we see a small flickering dot. Dr. Harris smiles.
C: ZOE
D: That's it? That's...my baby?
N: Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe. Tears fill her eyes.
C: ZOE
D: Hi, Baby. Is it okay? Is it healthy?
E: CONT'D then
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Everything's just... Wait, a minute...
E: makes a face, then
C: ZOE
D: What? Wait a minute, what?
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Well...I see another heartbeat.
C: ZOE
D: It has two hearts?
E: freaking out
C: DR. HARRIS
D: No...but you have two babies.
N: Zoe's mouth falls open. NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her head in her hands.
C: CAROL
D: Twins! That's fantastic!
N: Zoe bursts into tears.
C: LORI
D: Why are you crying? That's so lucky.
C: ZOE
D: Yup. That's me. Lucky, lucky, me.
N: The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.
C: CAROL
D: Are you okay? Is it a financial concern? There are many programs--
C: ZOE
D: No. I'm fairly loaded, actually. Used to work for Google. I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I don't know if I can talk about it yet.
E: blows nose
C: CAROL
D: Take your time. When you feel like sharing, we're here for you. We're all sisters here. Let's give Zoe some space. When she's ready to talk, we're ready to listen. Deep, cleansing breaths, Zoe.
E: then, to the group
N: Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.
C: CAROL
D: Now, in the meantime, does anyone else have anything they want to discuss? Problems? Concerns?
E: CONT'D
N: Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.
C: TABITHA
D: I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps asking why he doesn't have a daddy, and I just don't know what--
C: ZOE
D: There's this guy. His name is Stan. And he's fantastic.
E: blurting out
C: CAROL
D: I knew it!
C: TABITHA
D: Uh...wasn't I just speaking?
C: CAROL
D: I knew you were with that guy!
C: SARA
D: What guy?
C: LORI
D: Zoe, this group is called Single Mother's By Choice.
C: ZOE
D: I know. I'm sorry--
C: TABITHA
D: Um, excuse me. What about Luca? He's been really, really sad.
C: ZOE
D: Have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever? The kind of guy who makes you re-examine everything? Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home mom and be barefoot and pregnant.
E: floodgates opening
N: The women stare blankly at Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: He actually lives on a farm! Plays the banjo! Maybe I could learn to sew and take care of the animals. Like Laura Ingalls.
E: CONT'D
N: Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.
S: EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.
C: ZOE
D: Carol, thank you. This has been really helpful. Just getting it all out and being with other women who--
C: CAROL
D: I'm going to have to ask you not to come back.
C: ZOE
D: What? Why?
C: CAROL
D: I don't think we can help you, and, quite frankly, you're against everything we stand for.
C: ZOE
D: But, I thought we were all sisters.
C: CAROL
D: No. Not you. Do you know how long it took me to conceive? Five years. I had three miscarriages and spent every last dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The woman with the short hair?
E: then
C: ZOE
D: Which one?
C: CAROL
D: The one with the really short hair?
C: ZOE
D: Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it down much.
C: CAROL
D: She just flew to Memphis to watch her baby being born. Seconds after the birth, the birth mother changed her mind and refused to give it up.
N: Zoe's face changes. She starts to get it.
C: CAROL
D: So, as you can see, we are really dedicated and choosing to be single mothers, and you seem to be in a slightly different place. You're carrying two healthy babies, and you have no idea how lucky you are.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: You're right.
E: after a beat
C: CAROL
D: I like you, Zoe. We all like you. But you kind of need to figure out where you are.
N: Zoe nods.
S: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY
N: Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.
C: NANA
D: That man is obsessed with my ass.
C: ZOE
D: I know. It's kind of upsetting.
C: NANA
D: He wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot. But, I don't know. What's the hurry?
C: ZOE
D: You've been engaged for nine years.
C: NANA
D: No reason to rush into anything.
N: Nana looks over at Zoe. She sees the bags under her eyes.
C: NANA
D: You look terrible, dear.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Thanks.
C: NANA
D: You must really love him, huh?
C: ZOE
D: I guess I do.
C: NANA
D: Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and I'm sure he loves you, too. But, you have put him in a really awkward position. Having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple. And you're not married. And he's not the father. And you've only been together a little while. And now you're having twins. And--
C: ZOE
D: Please stop.
C: NANA
D: I'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly, I don't think any man is that great.
N: They complete another lap around the courtyard. Arthur smiles at them and then "raises the roof."
C: NANA
D: Arthur's just about the best man I know, and look at him. He's a fucking idiot.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY
N: Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look older. Thinner. Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.
C: JOAN
D: You know, people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm.
E: MORE
C: JOAN
D: All of our friends in New York, they thought we'd lost our minds.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan nods. We get the feeling he's heard this before.
C: JOAN
D: I guess I'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction. You just have to be open to it.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse. He shrugs.
C: STAN
D: Having a baby with someone I barely know, someone else's baby...it's just not how I pictured it.
C: JOAN
D: I used to work on Wall Street. Now I wear boots covered in goat shit. This isn't how I pictured it, either. But guess what...I'm happy.
N: She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.
S: INT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT
N: Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over to try and sleep. ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room. Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears. Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is growing. For the first time, we see a smile.
S: INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.
C: LORI
D: Make sure you put your numbers down. I want to have everyone's number handy in case I go into labor early.
N: Zoe enters. All eyes turn. She waves sheepishly.
C: ZOE
D: Hi, guys.
N: No one knows what to say.
C: CAROL
D: Hi, Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry I got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and I'm sorry I interrupted you, Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing better.
C: TABITHA
D: Thanks.
C: ZOE
D: And I've thought a lot about what you said, about how lucky I am. I got into this whole situation because I wanted to have a baby. And, somehow, I lost sight of that. Anyway, I need partners in this, and I hope you'll take me back.
E: to Carol then
N: Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.
C: ZOE
D: What's this?
E: CONT'D
C: LORI
D: It's a phone tree. I'm due next month, but my midwife thinks I may go sooner. I want everyone to be there. Are you in?
N: Zoe smiles.
C: ZOE
D: I'm in.
S: EXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY
N: Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as far as it will go. A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches. Zoe smiles.
C: ZOE
D: Hi.
C: WOMAN
D: Hi.
C: TWIN TODDLERS
D: Hi./Hi.
N: Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar voice.
C: STAN
D: Hi.
N: Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection. For a brief second, they look like a family. Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or what. They just stand there.
C: ZOE
D: Hi.
C: STAN
D: Hi.
C: ZOE
D: You said that already.
C: STAN
D: You...look great.
N: Zoe touches her belly. Proud but protective.
C: STAN
D: How are you feeling?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Okay.
C: STAN
D: Good.
N: A long silence.
C: ZOE
D: You have a beard.
C: STAN
D: Yeah, it's awful isn't it.
C: ZOE
D: No.
C: STAN
D: Don't lie. Did I tell you how pretty you look?
E: then
N: Zoe nods. Another silence.
C: STAN
D: I miss you.
E: CONT'D
N: A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This separation makes the moment all the more tense.
C: ZOE
D: I miss you, too.
C: STAN
D: This whole time we've been apart, I've been trying to figure out what it is about you that I love so much. And I think that it's that a lot of people talk about doing things, but you actually do them. You're really kind of daring. How you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog. You came and found me at the Farmer's Market even though the night before I acted like a total stalker...
N: Zoe smiles at the memory. Stan continues.
C: STAN
D: And now you're pregnant. Because you wanted to have a baby and didn't think you could wait any longer. Well, that's just the same kind of thing. It's...brave. And I can't love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan takes her hands.
C: STAN
D: I love you. I've been waiting my whole life for you. And I can't let one little baby get in the way of that. I just...can't.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: There's something I need to tell you.
C: STAN
D: Okay.
C: ZOE
D: It's big. And you're allowed to take all of this back when I tell you.
C: STAN
D: What.
C: ZOE
D: It's not just one baby....I'm having twins.
N: Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one. And then, Zoe starts laughing too. The whole thing is just so ridiculous.
C: STAN
D: This is insane.
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the little bump, new since he's last been with her.
C: STAN
D: Do you feel any kicking?
C: ZOE
D: Sometimes.
C: STAN
D: What does it feel like?
C: ZOE
D: Like butterflies.
N: Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.
C: ZOE
D: Are you really sure you want to do this?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Yeah. I'm really sure.
N: They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as she dozes off.
S: INT. EXAM - ROOM
N: CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes floating head-to-toe. Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.
C: ZOE
D: Are you okay?
C: STAN
D: They're so...perfect. They look like real babies.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Would you like to know the sexes?
N: They look at each other. Zoe smiles. Stan shrugs. Zoe nods. Stan does, too.
C: ZOE
D: Yes. Tell us.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: You're having two healthy little girls.
N: Stan gets tears in his eyes.
C: STAN
D: Two girls?
C: ZOE
D: Two girls.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Congratulations.
S: EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY
N: Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to meetings, or fighting for cabs. But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing. Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the street.
C: STAN
D: Two girls!
N: A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by. Stan smiles. Now he's part of this exclusive club.
C: STAN
D: Hi.
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Hi.
S: INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT
N: We PAN past several small plates of food on a table. A chef tells us what delectable items we are looking at.
C: CHEF
D: Here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots. This is carpaccio with shaved white truffles. And, finally, an heirloom tomato salad with fresh Buratta flown in from Italy this morning.
C: STAN
D: Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.
N: Sam tops off their champagne and exits. Stan picks up his fork and starts eating. Zoe does not.
C: STAN
D: Aren't you hungry?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I can't eat any of this.
C: STAN
D: Why not?
C: ZOE
D: Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized. Alcohol.
E: pointing to each dish re: champagne
C: STAN
D: Let me get Sam back. He'll make you anything you want.
C: ZOE
D: I don't want to hurt his feelings. You go ahead. I'm fine.
C: STAN
D: Well, what are you going to eat?
S: INT. MCDONALD'S - NIGHT
N: The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.
C: CASHIER
D: Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese, four large fries, and a six piece chicken McNuggets?
C: ZOE
D: Make that an eight, no, ten-piece McNuggets. You'll have some, right?
E: to Stan
C: STAN
D: No.
C: ZOE
D: Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.
E: back to the cashier
N: Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to Expect when You're Expecting." Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.
C: ZOE
D: Have you gotten to page 79 yet?
E: re: book
C: STAN
D: No. I stopped reading when you ripped out one of my pages and used it as a napkin.
C: ZOE
D: Says here many women in the second trimester experience an increased sexual appetite.
C: STAN
D: Really?
N: Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget. She takes a seductive bite.
C: STAN
D: Are you coming on to me? It's kind of hard to tell right now.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Yeah. I'm coming on to you.
N: Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.
C: ZOE
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: You have chicken in your hair.
S: INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY
N: Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely going at all.
C: MONA
D: Why are you even working out? This is the one time in your life you're allowed to let it go.
C: ZOE
D: Because look at me. I just keep getting bigger and bigger.
C: MONA
D: Well, yeah. That's kind of how it goes.
C: ZOE
D: I'm afraid I'm going to scare him away. I'm like one of those giant bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to take over the whole back yard.
C: MONA
D: Come on. He loves you for you.
C: ZOE
D: I'm just getting kind of freaked out by everything. He asked me to go to this wedding with him. What kind of first impression am I going to make on all of his friends?
C: MONA
D: Well, you're knocked up with some stranger's twins. So, already you're not exactly...
C: ZOE
D: Not helping.
C: MONA
D: Do you have anything to wear at least?
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed. He turns to the closet.
C: STAN
D: Everything okay in there?
N: A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.
C: STAN
D: Never mind.
E: CONT'D
N: He waits a few beats. Another dress FLIES out.
C: ZOE
D: This SUCKS!!!
E: O.S.
C: STAN
D: Honey, whatever you wear is fine.
C: ZOE
D: I don't have anything to wear! That's the problem.
E: O.S.
N: Another dress sails through the air.
C: ZOE
D: Fuuuuuuck!
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: You always look great. I've never seen you not look great.
N: Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.
C: STAN
D: That's perfect. You look hot.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Really? You think?
N: Zoe turns to reveal the back. The two sides of the zipper are ten inches apart.
C: STAN
D: Do you have a shawl or something?
N: Zoe bursts into tears.
S: EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER
N: A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.
C: STAN
D: You look smokin'.
C: ZOE
D: Thanks, honey.
N: Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.
C: STAN
D: Let's go. We're super late.
N: She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight. Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around, but again, the dress is too tight.
C: ZOE
D: Hmmmm...
C: STAN
D: Why don't you sort of go in...head first and then turn around.
N: Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.
C: ZOE
D: Shut up and push me.
C: STAN
D: Push you?
C: ZOE
D: Just do it.
N: Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.
S: INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.
C: ZOE
D: I hate everyone.
N: She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into tears again.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly, and The National Enquirer. Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling.
C: ZOE
D: Do you think he's telling everyone why I didn't go? I'm too much of a fat-ass walrus to go to the wedding?
C: BOBBY
D: You're not a fat ass walrus. You're pregnant.
N: Zoe eyes well up with tears again.
C: BOBBY
D: Why are you crying? So what? You missed a stupid wedding.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: BOBBY
D: You got to have girls' night with me. This is way more fun.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. I'm just so emotional lately. It's the hormones.
C: BOBBY
D: You can't help it. Being pregnant sucks. You're emotional, and irrational, and you get back fat.
C: ZOE
D: I have back fat?
C: BOBBY
D: No. I'm just kidding. Okay, yes. You have back fat.
E: then
N: Zoe feels her back.
C: ZOE
D: How's Stan going to stay with me through this? I'm disgusting.
C: BOBBY
D: We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll get some hip maternity clothes... whatever that means.
C: ZOE
D: Look at me, Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: ZOE
D: Look at me. What do you see?
E: pinching back fat
C: BOBBY
D: I see the most amazingly wonderful person I know.
N: Zoe smiles. Tears come to her eyes again.
C: BOBBY
D: With back fat.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PUCK BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker, Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy. Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne.
C: OLIVIA
D: Why aren't you dancing?
C: STAN
D: I'm just about to go. It's late.
C: OLIVIA
D: Come on, one dance.
N: The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder. Stan notices. She steps in closer.
C: OLIVIA
D: For old time's sake.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I have a girlfriend, Olivia.
C: OLIVIA
D: Never stopped you before.
N: She tries to kiss him. Stan steps away.
C: STAN
D: It's serious this time.
N: Olivia pulls back, surprised.
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Zoe is asleep in the bed. Her bump looks very cute under the covers. Stan quietly gets ready for bed. She turns to him, half asleep.
C: ZOE
D: How was it?
C: STAN
D: Boring.
C: ZOE
D: Good.
N: Stan gets in bed next to her. Zoe scoots into him.
C: ZOE
D: I miss my old ass.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Excuse me?
C: ZOE
D: It was one of my best features.
C: STAN
D: You know what's weird? I never knew your old ass.
C: ZOE
D: It's kind of like this ass but way hotter.
C: STAN
D: I also don't know what you really like to eat and what's just a craving, or when you start laughing hysterically and then crying and you say, this isn't me, if that's true because I don't really know the real you. All I know is the pregnant you.
C: ZOE
D: That is weird.
C: STAN
D: Or like how you're horny all the time? Is that you? Or is that pregnant you?
C: ZOE
D: That's me.
E: lying
C: STAN
D: When all of this is over, who will you be?
C: ZOE
D: Hopefully, myself again.
C: STAN
D: But...who is that?
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is empty.
S: INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a box of photographs. We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph. His P.O.V. It's a picture of a woman's ass.
C: ZOE
D: This is my old ass.
N: Stan blinks a few times. His eyes adjusting.
C: STAN
D: Why do you have a picture of your ass?
C: ZOE
D: My college boyfriend took it. So, I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close. It's held up.
C: STAN
D: It's a nice ass.
C: ZOE
D: You said you don't know the real me, so I thought I'd show you.
N: She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and acne.
C: ZOE
D: This is me in seventh grade.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan props himself up in one elbow.
C: STAN
D: Wow.
C: ZOE
D: I know.
C: STAN
D: You look like Anthony Michael Hall.
C: ZOE
D: This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character. It also taught me that I should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again.
E: then
N: She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana.
C: ZOE
D: This is one of my favorites because look how happy I am. I don't even know what place yellow is, but I'm sure it's not good.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Fifth place.
C: ZOE
D: But I still look super happy, right? That's all because of Nana. Whatever I did, she thought it was the best.
N: The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe. Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in regular clothes.
C: ZOE
D: These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona. Mona and I met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Why are you dressed like that?
C: ZOE
D: Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way.
N: Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.
C: ZOE
D: This is my mom.
E: CONT'D
N: Stan takes the picture and studies it.
C: STAN
D: You look just like her.
C: ZOE
D: This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died.
C: STAN
D: I...can't imagine.
C: ZOE
D: She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep.
N: Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock.
C: STAN
D: Do you have any pictures of your dad?
N: Zoe doesn't say anything.
C: STAN
D: I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it...
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: My mother was in a coma for two years before the end. That's when my dad left her.
C: STAN
D: Oh.
C: ZOE
D: So...that's when he died. To us, anyway.
C: STAN
D: God, Zoe. I'm so sorry.
C: ZOE
D: It's okay. It was an important lesson. That's when I realized that nothing lasts forever.
E: after a beat
N: This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.
C: ZOE
D: So, that's my story. That's the real me.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: Things can last forever, you know.
C: ZOE
D: Not for me they can't.
N: Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.
C: ZOE
D: That's weird.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.
C: STAN
D: I'm confused. Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to get back in their good graces. Go home. I'll meet you there. I don't want them to see you anyway.
C: STAN
D: It's four in the morning. I'm not letting you walk home alone.
C: ZOE
D: Fine. I'll just pop in, show my face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.
S: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks. Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie. Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.
C: CAROL
D: Zoe, it's so nice of you to come, especially at this crazy hour.
C: LORI
D: You're really one of us now.
C: ZOE
D: Are you sure you're in labor? You're so calm.
C: LORI
D: Oh, I'm sure.
C: ZOE
D: Well, I just wanted to come and say a quick hi and good luck.
C: LORI
D: You're not staying?
C: CAROL
D: You have to stay. Lori wants us all to be together for this.
C: ZOE
D: Well, I really want to be here but...um, the truth is...actually I've been wanting to tell you guys for a while but, the truth is...
N: Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.
C: CAROL
D: She's having a contraction.
E: whispering
N: Zoe nods. This is weird. Lori breathes through it.
C: LORI
D: Okay. What was it you were saying?
C: ZOE
D: I'm back with Stan.
C: LORI
D: Stan who?
C: CAROL
D: The farmer?
C: ZOE
D: Actually, he makes cheese. He named a cheese after me. Isn't that romantic? Sort of? Well, anyway, I'm not technically a single mother by choice anymore. So, if you want me to leave right now, I totally understand. I'll just walk out the door and--
E: off their blank stares
C: LORI
D: No, I really want you to stay.
C: ZOE
D: Oh.
E: bummed
C: CAROL
D: Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're happy. We'd love to meet him. Bring him to group any time.
C: ZOE
D: Well, actually, he's downstairs, so I should probably get back to--
C: LORI
D: Great. Invite him up.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, no, no, no...
C: LORI
D: I'm not shy. I've been through this before. It's quite beautiful, really.
N: Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse. After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.
S: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been reading to pass the time.
C: STAN
D: Excuse me?
C: ZOE
D: Just a few minutes.
C: STAN
D: I don't know, Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: You have to come up. They begged me. And truthfully, I'm kind of scared of them. Please?
S: INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them nursing Dakota.
C: STAN
D: This is weird.
C: ZOE
D: Good brownies, though. This one has peanut butter in it.
N: Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs rhythmically.
C: CAROL
D: Come on everybody, it's time. She's getting into the water.
C: STAN
D: The what?
C: CAROL
D: Oh, it's a water birth. Didn't Zoe tell you?
N: Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.
C: STAN
D: What's a water birth?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. But just so we're clear, this... Is not the real me.
E: re. the whole scene
C: STAN
D: I'll wait here.
N: Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.
S: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who is now naked and pushing. Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand. Carol is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.
C: CAROL
D: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
C: ZOE
D: Wow. Wow. Wow.
E: eyes wide
C: CAROL
D: I know. It's amazing how the body can open up like that.
N: Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw up. She stumbles for the door.
C: ZOE
D: I'm just going to get some air. I'm feeling a little...
C: LORI
D: Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal point.
N: Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.
C: MIDWIFE
D: Push, Lori. Push.
N: While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out. Carol chases after, still beating the drum.
C: CAROL
D: You can't leave. You're her focal point.
C: ZOE
D: Can't she use someone else?
C: CAROL
D: She's in labor. You want to argue with her now?
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.
C: CAROL
D: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
N: Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.
C: ZOE
D: Oh, Jesus. What is...that?
E: then
C: CAROL
D: Sssshh. It's perfectly natural. Sometimes the bowels just let go. Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
E: then, back to chanting
N: The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag. Zoe turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.
C: LORI
D: Don't move, Zoe, I need you! You're my focal point.
E: yelling
C: ZOE
D: What does that even mean?
N: Zoe turns back. Her face white as a sheet. Lori lets out another WAIL.
C: LORI
D: I need to turn over. Please!
C: JESSIE
D: Do it, Lori. We're here for you. We're all here for you.
N: Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side. Lori lets out a loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.
C: CAROL
D: Here comes the head.
E: excited
N: Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.
C: JESSIE
D: We can see the head, Lori.
C: CAROL
D: There's so much hair!
C: ZOE
D: I don't think that's the baby's hair.
E: woozy, afraid
C: LORI
D: I want to see the head. Get me a mirror. It's in the bedroom.
C: ZOE
D: I'll get it.
N: Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.
C: LORI
D: GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!!
S: INT. LORI'S FOYER - SAME
N: Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed. Next to him is Dakota, who is crying. Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.
C: CAROL
D: Stan, get the mirror!
E: O.S.
S: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.
C: STAN
D: Excuse me. Hello. I'm Stan. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Stan.
N: Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.
C: LORI
D: Look at all that wet, curly hair.
N: Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.
C: STAN
D: Let's get the hell out of here.
E: freaking out
C: ZOE
D: I can't. I'm her focal point.
C: STAN
D: What does that mean?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know.
N: Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM. Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and plop into the water. CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the umbilical cord. CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces. Zoe's eyes roll back and we:
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.
S: INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She opens her eyes. Blinks a few times.
C: STAN
D: Are you okay?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. Why am I wet?
N: WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool. Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.
C: ZOE
D: What is that?
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I think it's the placenta.
E: afraid
N: Zoe's eyes roll back again and we...
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY
N: 14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to unload their wares. Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like soldiers back from battle.
C: ZOE
D: Wow. We really shouldn't have seen that.
C: STAN
D: No.
C: ZOE
D: I did mention that I barely know those people, right?
C: STAN
D: Like forty times.
C: ZOE
D: I feel the need to say it again.
N: They turn into the Farmer's Market. ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.
C: STAN
D: It won't be like that for us.
C: ZOE
D: How do you know?
C: STAN
D: Well, for starters, you wax.
N: ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.
C: OLIVIA
D: Oh, hi.
C: STAN
D: Hi. You remember Zoe.
E: awkward beat, then
C: OLIVIA
D: Right, hi.
N: And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.
C: OLIVIA
D: Wow. Wow.
E: CONT'D then, to Stan
N: At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie. It says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
C: ZOE
D: What is that supposed to mean?
C: OLIVIA
D: It's nothing.
N: Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.
C: OLIVIA
D: I had no idea it was that serious.
E: CONT'D re. Zoe's pregnant belly
C: STAN
D: I told you it was serious.
C: ZOE
D: What the hell does, "sorry about last night" mean?
E: interrupting
C: OLIVIA
D: It's stupid. I was drunk and...
C: STAN
D: It was nothing.
C: ZOE
D: What was nothing?
N: Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.
C: OLIVIA
D: You're having a baby? I didn't know you'd been together that long.
C: STAN
D: Well, they're not mine...but, yeah, we're having a baby. Two actually.
N: On Zoe's look of shock we...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
N: The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.
C: STAN
D: Nothing happened.
C: ZOE
D: Get away from me.
N: Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.
C: STAN
D: Nothing happened!
C: ZOE
D: You said, "they're not mine."
C: STAN
D: I didn't mean to say it.
C: ZOE
D: How could you say that?
C: STAN
D: I don't know. I was flustered.
C: ZOE
D: Flustered?
C: STAN
D: I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I've been up all night watching Orca give birth!
C: ZOE
D: "They're not mine?"
E: incredulous
C: STAN
D: Well, I mean...technically, they're not.
E: at a loss 
N: The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back. Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.
C: ZOE
D: You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you?
C: STAN
D: Zoe.
N: She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over and stands beside her.
S: INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY
N: Zoe and Mona are at their usual table. Zoe looks like she hasn't slept.
C: MONA
D: Do you really think something happened with the berry girl? They both said nothing happened.
C: ZOE
D: Well, are they going to come out and tell me? And that's not even the point. He said, the babies weren't his. And if he says that, he thinks that. And if he thinks that, he's not really committed.
C: MONA
D: So, now you run?
C: ZOE
D: Why should I stick around for the end of the story when I know what it's going to be?
N: Mona says nothing. She looks like she might say something and then doesn't.
C: ZOE
D: What? If you want to say something, say it.
E: CONT'D
C: MONA
D: Do you know the end of the story? Can't you just give him the benefit of the doubt? He seems like such a good guy.
C: ZOE
D: You haven't even met him.
C: MONA
D: Yeah, and don't think I don't know the reason for that. You were never going to see this through, Zoe. Never. It was doomed before it began. Just like all of your relationships. You get out before you get hurt.
C: ZOE
D: You don't think I'm hurt right now?
C: MONA
D: Every man is not your father. When are you going to realize that?
C: ZOE
D: You don't know what you're talking about.
C: MONA
D: I've known you for thirty years. I know you don't trust people. You and your grandmother, both. She's been engaged to Arthur for how long now?
C: ZOE
D: Leave Nana out of this.
C: MONA
D: She's never going to marry him. Just like you'd never marry Stan. No wonder you ended up with a sperm donor. He'll never let you down. It's your ideal boyfriend.
N: Zoe's face changes. She looks incredibly hurt.
C: ZOE
D: I used a donor because I wanted a baby.
C: MONA
D: I'm sorry. I went too far.
C: ZOE
D: Because I wanted to have a family. Because Nana is the only one I've got and she's eighty-four years old. And then it will just be me. So, yeah, you went a little too far.
N: Zoe leaves Mona at the table.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together. Zoe scratches behind his ears.
C: ZOE
D: Guess it's just you and me again.
N: Nuts licks her face. She gets out of bed and goes to check her belly in the mirror. It's actually getting kind of huge.
S: EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY
N: Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.
C: ZOE
D: What.
C: STAN
D: It's Thursday. We have a doctor's appointment.
C: ZOE
D: There is no "we", Stan.
C: STAN
D: Come on, I didn't mean to say it, and that's not how I feel.
N: Zoe shakes her head.
C: ZOE
D: I made a mistake trusting you.
C: STAN
D: Don't say that. That's not true.
C: ZOE
D: You're not good for me. You made me think I needed you, and I don't.
C: STAN
D: So that's it? Because of one stupid, asinine thing that I said, it's all over? This is how it ends?
C: ZOE
D: Yes. This is how it ends. I don't know why you're so surprised. I told you, nothing lasts forever.
E: then
N: Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.
S: INT. DR. HARRIS' OFFICE - DAY
N: Dr. Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly. Zoe holds up her shirt and watches the monitor.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Things look great.
C: ZOE
D: Good.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: So, I'll see you back in two weeks, and we'll start checking to see if the babies are dropping.
C: ZOE
D: It's hard to believe we're in the home stretch.
N: Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Now's the time I start discussing a birthing plan with my patients. Do you want me to wait until next time when Stan's here?
C: ZOE
D: Oh. Uh, no. He won't be here.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: He's out of town or something?
C: ZOE
D: No. He's just...out.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
C: ZOE
D: It's back to just you and me now. We've come full circle.
C: DR. HARRIS
D: Well, don't you want anyone with you in the delivery room? You know, like a birthing partner?
S: INT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY
N: Zoe and Nana are speed-walking. Nana stops, excited.
C: NANA
D: Me?
C: ZOE
D: Yeah. Is that okay?
C: NANA
D: Of course.
C: ZOE
D: Good. `Cause you're all I've got.
C: NANA
D: What do I have to do?
C: ZOE
D: I don't know. It will be a c-section, so, basically, just stand there and try not to faint.
C: NANA
D: I can do that.
C: ZOE
D: Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me that you'll be there.
C: NANA
D: Are you kidding me? I've been waiting my whole life for this.
N: They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and eyes closed.
C: ZOE
D: Holy shit, is he dead?
C: NANA
D: Sleeping.
C: ZOE
D: How can you tell?
C: NANA
D: He's been like that all morning. I wore him out last night.
C: ZOE
D: Wow. I did not need to know that.
C: NANA
D: We were celebrating. We finally set a date.
E: with a smile
N: Zoe stops dead in her tracks.
C: ZOE
D: Excuse me?
S: INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.
C: NANA
D: So, we'll put the band here and the dance floor right here.
C: ZOE
D: I can't believe you're getting married. What made you change your mind?
C: NANA
D: All of a sudden it just hit me, what am I waiting for? I love him. He loves me. What am I so afraid of?
C: ZOE
D: Wow. This is...really big news.
C: NANA
D: You don't seem happy.
C: ZOE
D: No, I am. It's just...it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic. You're getting married and here I am...
N: Her voice trails off.
C: NANA
D: Zoe.
C: ZOE
D: Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm really happy for you.
C: NANA
D: I'm worried about you, honey.
C: ZOE
D: I'm fine.
C: NANA
D: I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I made. I've been alone for over thirty years now, and that's too long. Sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on.
C: ZOE
D: Are you talking about my father or Stan?
C: NANA
D: Both, baby.
S: INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Zoe has her box of photographs. She pulls out a picture from the very bottom.
C: NANA
D: Because if you don't learn how to forgive, you will always be stuck in the past.
E: V.O.
N: The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like her, that it can only be her father. After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other. Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.
S: INT. CHURCH - DAY
N: The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana, lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the sweetest kiss. ANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a handkerchief back and forth.
S: INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER
N: Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition of "What a Wonderful World." Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor. It's their first dance as husband and wife.
C: BOBBY
D: I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you...
E: singing
N: Zoe watches, her hands on her belly. Mona stands beside her.
C: MONA
D: This song always makes me cry.
C: ZOE
D: Me, too.
C: MONA
D: Is it happy or sad? The words are happy but the song is so sad.
C: ZOE
D: I guess it's both. Happy and sad.
C: BOBBY
D: I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark and sacred night...
E: singing
C: MONA
D: I'm sorry about the things I said.
C: ZOE
D: I know.
C: MONA
D: It was really shitty of me.
C: ZOE
D: It was. Especially because you were right.
N: Mona takes Zoe's hand.
C: BOBBY
D: And I think to myself...what a wonderful world...
E: singing
C: ZOE
D: I don't want to be alone forever, Mona.
C: MONA
D: Then don't be.
S: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY
N: Stan stares off into space. His beard is back. A CUSTOMER surveys the different cheeses on the table.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Is this new? The Zoe?
C: STAN
D: Yeah. This is the first week it's been out.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Can I have a sample? What's it like?
C: STAN
D: It's...very stubborn, overly suspicious and distrustful of men.
N: The customer looks up at Stan.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Huh?
S: INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER
N: Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor.
C: BOBBY
D: Come on, you old maid.
C: ZOE
D: No.
C: BOBBY
D: Dance with me. One dance.
C: ZOE
D: Forget it.
C: BOBBY
D: Fine. But it doesn't mean that I won't dance with you.
C: ZOE
D: What?
N: Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his ass triple-time, like Beyonce.
C: BOBBY
D: Haaaaaay.
C: ZOE
D: Go away, you freak.
N: A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping, thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.
C: BOBBY
D: Smack it, Bitch.
N: Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.
C: BOBBY
D: You know you love it. Uh-huh. That's right. Smack it.
E: CONT'D
N: The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples smacking each other's asses. While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face. Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor.
C: BOBBY
D: What the hell?
E: CONT'D
N: An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.
C: OLD MAN
D: Damn it. Not again. Nope. Not me.
E: then, checks pants
N: A few other old people look down and check themselves. At which point, Zoe looks down and realizes.
C: ZOE
D: I think my water just broke.
S: EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY
N: The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the logistics of the trip to the hospital.
C: ZOE
D: I'll drive.
C: NANA
D: You're in labor. You can't drive.
C: ARTHUR
D: I'll drive.
C: NANA
D: You don't have a car or a license. You drive.
E: then, to Bobby
C: BOBBY
D: We're in Queens. I don't even know what side of the road they drive on here.
C: ZOE
D: Will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital?
N: All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up. Mona's at the wheel. She leans out and waves.
C: MONA
D: This was my surprise for after the wedding, but let's hit it.
C: BOBBY
D: This works.
N: They all pile in. And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along behind them.
S: INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER
N: Things are a bit frantic in the car.
C: NANA
D: Are you okay? Remember to breathe. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in.
N: Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths.
C: MONA
D: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.
C: NANA
D: Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...
E: joining in
C: MONA/NANA
D: Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...
C: ZOE
D: Please stop. It's getting really breathy in here. I'm fine.
C: BOBBY
D: What about me? I have amniotic fluid on my Gucci tux.
N: ANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked.
C: ARTHUR
D: Who needs a drink?
N: Everyone (including Zoe) raises their hands.
S: INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana grabs the glass and swigs it.
C: NANA
D: Bobby...
E: whispering
C: BOBBY
D: What?
C: NANA
D: I don't know if I can do this.
C: BOBBY
D: What?!
C: NANA
D: I can't go in with her.
C: BOBBY
D: Well, I certainly can't do it. I don't do vaginas.
N: They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his walker.
C: ARTHUR
D: Don't look at me.
N: Nana starts to hyperventilate.
C: NANA
D: Help me, Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: Nana, pull yourself together. This is the biggest moment of Zoe's life, and you can't let her down. I'd slap you right now, but I'm afraid your teeth would fly out.
S: INT. LABOR AND DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
N: Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown.
C: ZOE
D: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.
N: Bobby enters, all sweetness and light.
C: BOBBY
D: Hey, girl. How ya doing?
C: ZOE
D: Okay.
C: BOBBY
D: Good. So, I really don't want you to worry, but Nana just passed out at the nurse's station and is now down in the ER getting stitches.
E: smiles, then
C: ZOE
D: What???
C: BOBBY
D: Everything's under control. Good thing we're at the hospital, right?
N: Zoe jumps out of bed.
C: ZOE
D: Where is she?
C: BOBBY
D: Get back in bed. All is well. Arthur's with her. Now, on to bigger and better...who do you want to be your birthing partner? Your choices are me or Mona.
N: Zoe starts to cry.
C: BOBBY
D: I know. They're shitty choices. Do you want me to call your scary lesbian friends from your group?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: I don't know.
C: BOBBY
D: We're going to get through this, okay? You just have to really think about it. Who do you want with you in the delivery room?
N: Zoe wipes her tears.
C: BOBBY
D: Who is the one person you want by your side?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. 77TH STREET - DAY
N: Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital gown.
C: ZOE
D: Taxi!
S: INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER
N: Zoe jumps in. The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror
C: CABBIE
D: You're not an escaped mental patient, are you?
C: ZOE
D: Kind of.
S: EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY
N: Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero. And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady herself.
C: ZOE
D: Ow. Son of a bitch, that hurts.
C: OLIVIA
D: Are you okay?
N: Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees Olivia.
C: OLIVIA
D: Are you in labor?
E: CONT'D
N: As soon as the contraction ends...
C: ZOE
D: Fuck off.
N: Zoe takes off again. Olivia watches her go.
S: EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER
N: Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan. ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading cheese.
C: ZOE
D: Stan!
N: Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.
C: FRED
D: Whoa. I've had nightmares that started like this.
C: ZOE
D: Stan!
N: Stan turns.
C: STAN
D: Zoe?
C: ZOE
D: Stan!
C: STAN
D: Are you okay? Don't run!
C: ZOE
D: I can't help it!
N: She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her. They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.
C: STAN
D: Are you all right?
C: ZOE
D: Great. I'm great.
E: panting
C: STAN
D: Why are you in a hospital gown?
C: ZOE
D: I'm in labor.
C: STAN
D: What? What the hell are you doing here?
C: ZOE
D: It's you.
C: STAN
D: What?
C: ZOE
D: Nana's my birthing partner, but she passed out and needed stitches, and Bobby asked me who I most wanted with me, and...it's you. It's only you. I don't want to be alone anymore. I love you. You don't know how much I love you.
E: then
N: Stan doesn't know what to say. He's literally speechless.
C: ZOE
D: More than anything in the world, I love you.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I've been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab.
N: Zoe bends over, holding her stomach. A contraction.
C: ZOE
D: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab, hee-hee, hoo-hoo.
N: The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again. Stan laughs and throws his arms around her.
C: ZOE
D: Ow. Ow. Ow.
E: CONT'D
C: STAN
D: I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just love you. I love you so much. Let's get the hell out of here.
E: then
C: ZOE
D: Yeah. I think I really need to go to the hospital now.
N: They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other. Stan has tears in his eyes.
C: STAN
D: Let's go have our babies.
N: People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help but applaud the big moment.
S: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
N: Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing... We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling. She does not look scared. And she does not look alone. WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side. And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr. Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one by one. We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to Zoe and Stan. Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other. They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: It's night. Zoe is asleep. She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed. To the side of the bed are two bassinets. Each baby sleeping soundly in a little pink hat. And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her forehead.
S: EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAY
N: Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER." We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both girls have flaming red hair. A woman pushing a stroller passes by. She smiles at Zoe and Stan. They smile back.
C: WOMAN
D: Hi.
C: ZOE
D: Hi.
C: STAN
D: Hi.
S: INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY
N: They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.
C: ZOE
D: Who knew you were such a romantic.
C: STAN
D: Well, it's the anniversary of our first date. Where else would I take you? Cheers.
E: then
N: They clink dogs and each take a bite.
C: STAN
D: What a year, huh?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Incredible. Wouldn't change a thing. Well, except for the part where you dumped me.
C: STAN
D: And the part where you dumped me. Girls...Mommy and Daddy were stupid.
E: to the babies
N: The babies smile and coo.
C: ZOE
D: Yes, we were. Yes, we were.
E: baby-talk
C: STAN
D: The first time we held hands was in here. It started out as a high- five, but then I strategically turned into a hand-hold.
C: ZOE
D: How do you remember that?
C: STAN
D: We both agreed that we were totally sick of weddings and hated when people wrote their own vows.
C: ZOE
D: That's right. I remember that.
C: STAN
D: So...I hope you won't hold it against me.
C: ZOE
D: What?
N: Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling. Zoe looks at them, confused.
C: ZOE
D: What are you doing here?
E: CONT'D
N: And then Bobby comes through the door.
C: ZOE
D: Bobby?
E: CONT'D
N: And then Mona.
C: ZOE
D: What's happening?
E: CONT'D
N: And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest. And we...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - LATER
N: Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to face in front of the guests and the priest.
C: STAN
D: I promise to love you even though you still eat chicken McNuggets in bed. I promise to name cheeses after all of our children no matter how embarrassed they are by it. I promise to always check out your ass when you walk away, and I promise to love you more tomorrow than I do today, which doesn't even seem impossible...
N: And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in... And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some things that really will last forever.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: THE END
