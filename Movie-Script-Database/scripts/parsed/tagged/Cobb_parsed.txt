N: Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Dylan Thomas Nice guys finish last. Leo Durocher
S: INT. OLD OFFICE (SANTA BARBARA, CA) - DAY (1960)
N: The room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and light spills in from a mission window. But we don't have any sense of place just yet. At first there are just details. EXTREME CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER KEYS of an old Underwood upright, well-worn and ancient. A woman's fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the keys. They wiggle. CLOSE ON PIPE IN ASHTRAY Smoke curls. A man's hand picks it up. CLOSE ON MAN'S HAT AND COAT on a coat rack.
C: CLOSE ON WASTE BASKET
D: Overflowing with crunched-up paper.
C: MAN
D: lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at something.
N: HIS POV - COURTYARD BELOW - BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE in high heels crosses the courtyard. She glances up toward Stump, then quickly turns away and disappears. CLOSE ON STUMP He sighs, and turns.
C: STUMP
D: The muse has not descended, Lucille. The muse has not descended. God damn it, Lucille, you hear me?
E: off her silence off her silence
N: ANGLE ON LUCILLE The woman at the typewriter, a 50-year old steno/secre- tary, responds calmly.
C: LUCILLE
D: The muse has not descended.
C: STUMP
D: Yes! The muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale -- only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest essay I've ever written! One word, the right word -- Flaubert called it 'le mot juste' -- I ever tell you that? Lucille is a longsuffering saint.
C: LUCILLE
D: 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story. Yessir, you've mentioned it.
C: STUMP
D: Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled...
C: LUCILLE
D: Yessir.
C: STUMP
D: What is this essay about again?
C: LUCILLE
D: Fishing.
C: STUMP
D: I mean what is it really about?
C: LUCILLE
D: You said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera -- that's what you said.
C: STUMP
D: Ohyeah... so... we end the essay with...
E: MORE
C: STUMP
D: 'The tarpon leaps shimmering into the late cross light of the keys, a primeval moment frozen in... ... frozen in'...
E: CONT'D dictating hesitates
N: Lucille types it out.
C: LUCILLE
D: Shimmering tarpon -- very good, Mr. Stump... ... 'frozen in' what?
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: I don't know, Lucille, that's what the Muse will tell me if she ever descends. ... 'frozen in'...
E: patiently considering
N: The PHONE RINGS -- Lucille answers it.
C: LUCILLE
D: Yes? Yes? Just a minute, I'll see if he's available. It's your wife -- are you and she speaking again? Stump's cavalier attitude stops cold. He starts to reach for the phone, then stops.
E: covers phone
C: STUMP
D: I dunno. How does she sound?
C: LUCILLE
D: Don't ask me to interpret.
N: Stump is suddenly a nervous wreck. He hesitates.
C: STUMP
D: Tell her... tell her... I'll talk... no... tell her I'm out -- I'll call her later... God damn it.
E: serious, dark
C: LUCILLE
D: Apparently he's out, Mrs. Stump -- I'll have him call you back. She hangs up. The mood has shifted.
E: on phone
C: STUMP
D: I need a drink.
C: LUCILLE
D: What about 'le mot juste,' Mr. Stump?
C: STUMP
D: Fuck 'le mot juste,' Lucille! Finish the damn thing yourself. 'The primeval moment is frozen in' whatever the hell you want it to be. Did you know that James Joyce let his secretary -- none other than Samuel Beckett -- revise and edit Molly's solliloquy in Ulysses? You're my Beckett -- I give you 'le mot juste!' Just get the damn thing in the mail so I can get paid.
E: snaps
N: Silence.
C: LUCILLE
D: Problems with the Mrs.?
N: Stump reaches for a beat-up pogo stick which leans against the wall in his office.
C: STUMP
D: I don't know. I need a drink. He grabs his hat and coat and we begin hearing the number one hit song of 1960, PERCY FAITH'S schmaltzy recording of "A Summer Place." CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Stump pogo sticks down the sidewalk, tipping his hat to pedestrians. They're not alarmed. He's the town eccentric. He pogos across a street and towards --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE SPORTSMAN'S LOUNGE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A watering hole like a million others. He pogo sticks right in the front door.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE SPORTSMAN'S - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A classic city bar, a hangout for drunks, philosophers, and especially sportswriters and journalists. Our man hops off his pogo stick -- nobody even notices, and joins his cronies, five sportswriters full of dogmatic opinions on every subject known to man. FRANK, a sportswriter, is at the jukebox feeding quarters. He looks up routinely, they're all regulars here.
C: FRANK
D: Hey, Stumpy... Stump addresses the sportswriters at the table as if they were a small audience in a lounge.
C: STUMP
D: Awright, awright... how do you get five old ladies to say 'fuck?'
C: CRONIES
D: Jeez, I dunno, how? Etc...
E: stumped
C: STUMP
D: Yell 'bingo.' Stump laughs. The others groan. REYNALDO, 40's, black, speaks up. He's one of the regulars.
C: REYNALDO
D: Okay, I got one -- A drunk is taking a piss in front of a bar, a bus drives by, real fast right along the curb, and knocks his thing off. Drunk picks up his thing, puts it in his pocket, goes into a bar, reaches into his pocket and puts his thing on the bar. 'Look't that,' he says, 'bus knocked my thing off.' Bartender says, 'that ain't your thing -- that's a cigar butt.'
E: beat MORE
C: REYNALDO
D: Drunk reaches into his other pocket and slaps another thing on the bar. 'There,' he says, 'bus knocked my thing off.' Bartender says, 'you're drunk and that ain't your thing either. That's another cigar butt.' Drunk looks down at both cigar butts and back up at the bartender and says, 'God damn it, I mushta smoked my dick.' Everyone roars, even Stump. But Frank, as usual, is hyper serious and never quite gets into the revelry.
E: CONT'D beat
C: FRANK
D: Amidst this levity, gentlemen, I have some real concerns. Mark my words, people will look back on this year and say that 1960 was the year that Western Civilization began its downward trajectory.
C: BILL
D: You need to get laid, Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Guys, guys, c'mon... do you really think things are as good as they used to be? You think Jack Kennedy is qualified to be President?
C: BILL
D: Kennedy may not be qualified, but -- Jackie's a babe -- and that's good enough for me.
C: REYNALDO
D: They're a happily married couple and that oughta stand for something these days...
N: Every man nods in solemn agreement.
C: MUD
D: Speaking of being happily married, Al, are you and your old lady still having problems?
C: STUMP
D: Oh no, the wife and I are all patched up -- doin' fantastic.
C: CRONIES
D: Good to hear... awright... way to go, Stumpy...
E: Etc.
C: FRANK
D: I mean look at us -- we call ourselves writers but we just watch ballgames and get drunk a lot. You call that writing?
C: STUMP
D: Yes I do.
C: MUD
D: In the department store of life, sports is the toy department -- so what?
C: BILL
D: Yeah, besides, Alan here's writing a serious novel, aren't ya?
C: MUD
D: Yeah, well I haven't started yet but I'm gonna. I've been busy.
C: FRANK
D: You guys are pathetic. Ya write for one reason -- a paycheck.
C: STUMP
D: More art was created for money than for passion. Take your platitudes and shove 'em, Frank. I'm gonna write a novel too, someday.
C: FRANK
D: The Great American Novel, I suppose?
E: cynically
C: STUMP
D: It could come from my pen.
C: FRANK
D: You're a barbershop writer, Al -- you write sugar-coated pieces for guys to skim when they're waiting for a haircut!
C: STUMP
D: Awright, that's it! Let's go! Settle this right here! Stump raises his fists as if to fight; Frank responds.
C: MUD
D: Hey! A scuffle breaks out, a lot of posturing, feinting, but they're all too chicken to do anything. Nobody wants to fight. A PHONE RINGS at the bar. The bartender answers the phone, shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters.
C: REYNALDO
D: Stump! For you. Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own "fight."
C: STUMP
D: Phone call saved your ass. Stump grabs the phone, covering an ear to hear better.
E: to Frank
C: STUMP
D: Yeah... yeah... who?... no... you're kidding?... when? Stump hangs up the phone and turns. His face registers shock, or more precisely, bewilderment and wonder.
E: on phone
C: STUMP
D: Hey... Shut up!
E: as they ignore him
N: They do, and give Stump their ruffled attention.
C: STUMP
D: Cobb wants to see me.
C: MUD
D: Cobb who?
C: STUMP
D: Ty Cobb! How many Cobbs are there?! This news instantly sobers the room.
C: FRANK
D: Ty Cobb? I thought he was dead?
C: STUMP
D: Not yet. He said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks.
C: BILL
D: You were just talking to Ty Cobb?
C: STUMP
D: The Georgia Peach himself. This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room. Even Stump is still a little dazed.
C: FRANK
D: They say Cobb is crazy. The meanest sonofabitch who ever lived.
C: MUD
D: I heard he killed a man.
C: BILL
D: Maybe so, but -- he was the greatest baseball player of them all.
C: CRONIES
D: Yeah, the best, no one close, etc...
N: Frank suddenly is cautionary, concerned, paternal.
C: FRANK
D: Listen, Al, be careful --
C: STUMP
D: I ain't gettin' my ass shot, don't worry...
C: FRANK
D: No, not that -- the story. This is like Ivan the Terrible inviting somebody into the Czar's palace before he died.
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: Except Ivan was a nicer guy...
C: FRANK
D: Don't let Cobb bullshit you. This is your shot. This is all our shot. When does he want to see you?
E: concerned, earnest as cronies agree
C: STUMP
D: Immediately.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEARLY EMPTY MOVIE THEATER - DAY
N: Al Stump sits alone in the theater, except for a teenaged boy sweeping the aisles, who stops to watch the screen.
C: STUMP
D: I gathered all the film footage that existed on Cobb -- which wasn't much -- and rented the local theater for the afternoon... I, too, had thought that the great Ty Cobb had been dead for awhile...
E: V.O. beat
C: ANGLE ON SCREEN
D: The screen fills with Movietone Newsreel footage of Ty Cobb, complete with overly sincere NARRATION and MUSIC.
E: B&W
C: NEWSREEL NARRATOR
D: This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old youth shows a peaches-and-cream complexion and the piercing eyes of a lad who would become, etc... Onscreen -- Cobb as a young ballplayer followed by images of Cobb's famous batting stance, Cobb clowning, etc.
E: V.O. B&W
C: STUMP
D: His reputation as being difficult at best, psychotic at worst, preceded him. But if there was one thing I knew after all my years as a journalist covering politicians, celebrities, and sports heroes, it was this --
E: V.O.
N: Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb with children, Cobb with celebri- ties, Cobb in a parade honoring him, and always, Cobb's dashing, swashbuckling style of play.
C: STUMP
D: The 'facts' -- and public perception of those 'facts' -- frequently bear little resemblance. Onscreen -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing. He slashes a ball up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second, and as the relay comes into third --
E: V.O. B&W
C: STUMP
D: One thing was beyond argument -- he was the most brilliant athlete of his time... perhaps of any time. I was determined to find out who was the real Ty Cobb. Cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust. There is something thrilling and terrifying in the image. CUT TO:
E: V.O. beat
S: EXT. MOTHER LODE COUNTRY (CALIFORNIA) - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Stump's car, a late model Buick, moves across the stunning grasslands at the western base of the Sierra Nevadas. We begin hearing his voice, then see him inside the car driving.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRAS - DUSK
N: Stump's car heads up into the darkening mountains.
C: STUMP
D: They said Cobb owned property all over the country, but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevadas.
E: V.O.
N: AERIAL SHOT - LONE PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS moving up into the Sierras, into rugged terrain and thick forests.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAR - DUSK
N: Stump straining to see the road, a bit wary of this drive.
C: STUMP
D: Driving into the Sierras at night with winter coming on wasn't the smartest decision I'd ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb. First drops of rain begin hitting the windshield -- Stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades begin ineffectively wiping the windshield. Stump struggles with his vision.
E: V.O.
C: STUMP
D: Shit...
C: POV SHOT THROUGH WINDSHIELD
D: A dismal, wet and obscured view of the mountain road, climbing higher into the Sierras. A small roadside gas station comes INTO VIEW, and -- Stump pulls his car into the station. CUT TO:
S: EXT. JONAH'S SERVICE STATION - DUSK (RAINING LIGHTLY)
N: Stump gets out, blows on his hands. It's cold, and a man comes out, the gas station owner, JONAH, 55. The man services the car throughout the conversation.
C: STUMP
D: Fill it up and replace the wiper blades.
C: JONAH
D: You got it.
C: STUMP
D: Colder than a witch's tit, eh?
C: JONAH
D: It's just starting. We got three- four feet of snow another thousand feet up. Where ya going? Skiing? I hate skiing.
C: STUMP
D: Actually, I'm going to meet Ty Cobb.
C: JONAH
D: Cobb?! He stopped here for gas once, I asked him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun don't shine.
C: STUMP
D: I hear he's got a way with kids...
N: Stump heads to a pay phone as the attendant replaces the wiper blades. Stump's breath hangs heavy in the air. It's cold. Freezing. He drops a set of coins in the call box. He blows on his hands and pulls up his collar -- he wasn't prepared for the weather to be this cold. He comes to life when he hears a voice on the other end -- a voice we never hear.
C: STUMP
D: Hey, baby, it's me... Al... your husband... I'm up in the woods somewhere on assignment... Listen, sweetheart, listen -- nobody can love you the way I love you and I want you to take me back. I made a mistake. Okay, lots of mistakes. I know I'm not worthy.
E: beat beat beat listens
N: We hear a CLICK.
C: STUMP
D: Honey? Sweetheart? Baby?
N: He flicks the receiver hook several times. She's gone.

N: RAIN POUNDS down as the car climbs to higher elevation.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT (RAINY)
N: Stump struggles with a map under the dome light as he drives.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN PASS - HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Stump's car passes a sign that tells all: DONNER PASS.
C: STUMP
D: I confess I was looking forward to seeing Cobb and being near his brilliance. My own life seemed on hold, somehow. Everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time... Cobb was a god whose brilliance, however difficult, could rub off on me. His problems were different than mine...
E: V.O.
C: ANGLE ON STUMP'S CAR
D: which pulls off the road and heads up a small mountain road among snow-covered pines.
N: A row of mailboxes catches Stump's attention, and he pulls over to review the names with a flashlight. He lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes -- nothing, until: The last box, enormously oversized, bears the name "COBB."
C: CLOSE ON STUMP
D: He smiles. Perfect.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: His car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards, comes around a bend in the trees and there it is --
N: POV SHOT - HUGE MOUNTAIN LODGE In the grand style but, like the mailbox, grotesquely oversized.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT
N: Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily. The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices. Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds refuge under the eave. The noise is frightening from that close. He stands unsurely -- does he knock? When -- The door is thrown open -- a black man, WILLIE, 40, with a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the house.
C: WILLIE
D: Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much dignity to spend another moment with you. I hope you die before the sun comes up and may you rot in hell! The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing there with his own suitcase.
C: WILLIE
D: Who are you?
C: STUMP
D: I'm a writer.
C: WILLIE
D: You mean he actually found somebody to take the job?
N: Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain as Stump just stares. Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT
N: Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall. Stump is terrified. A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news- paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of place.
C: STUMP
D: Mr. Cobb?
N: The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without speaking. More CRASHING sounds from upstairs.
C: STUMP
D: Mr. Cobb? The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing.
C: ANGLE ON STAIRS
D: Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just outside the half open door from which light spills. He hesitates...
C: STUMP
D: Hello? Mr. Cobb? A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door. Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air.
C: STUMP
D: Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, but I don't need this job that bad.
N: Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but -- ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP. Stump freeses one more time. Silence. Then the voice --
C: COBB
D: Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this job that bad.
E: MORE
C: COBB
D: Now come in here and meet the great Ty Cobb. I won't hurt you.
E: CONT'D beat calmly
N: Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate. And sees: POV SHOT - TY COBB Lying in bed in a robe. Unshaven. Bottles of booze and food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit on every surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. A small record player sits next to he bed. A record spins, filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS. He places the gun on his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices. When he speaks it is without a snarl, without threat -- simply, even sweetly, he says:
C: COBB
D: On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler. I'm a great admirer of his. I'm also a great admirer of yours.
N: BACK TO SCENE
C: STUMP
D: Thank you.
C: COBB
D: But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success.
C: STUMP
D: Sir, I am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success.'
C: COBB
D: Of course. Give me those pills over there.
E: beat
N: Stump retrieves some pills that Cobb is pointing towards. Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of Scotch. Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a folded letter which Stump opens to read.
C: COBB
D: That's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. You're taking me there -- when is it?
C: STUMP
D: A few weeks.
E: looking at the letter
C: COBB
D: All the great ones will be there -- The great Mickey Cochrane will be there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers... we used to have some parties, Stump, I'll tell ya that right now... We can't forget.
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: I won't forget.
C: COBB
D: Look at me closely, Al... Lie after lie has been written about me -- my whole life I've been misunderstood. You're gonna tell the real story of Ty Cobb.
E: with utmost sincerity beat
C: STUMP
D: What's the 'real' story? Cobb climbs slowly out of bed. His words are reasoned and not without passion.
C: COBB
D: That's why you're here. See, there's two kinds of writers. The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects... that's you.
E: beat MORE
C: COBB
D: Or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever. That could be you. Because I am that subject. Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window. The table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and booze.
E: CONT'D beat beat
C: COBB
D: Jameson! Get your ass up here!
E: suddenly bellowing
N: Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him. Then, suddenly, he holds up his hand. A calm comes over him as -- He stares out the window into the snowy woods. His rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus.
C: STUMP
D: You okay?
C: COBB
D: Mmmmmm...
N: POV SHOT - WOODS IN MOONLIGHT near the lodge. A bank of snow -- and a large buck moves INTO VIEW.
C: CLOSE ON COBB'S FACE
D: His eyes light. A flare in his nostrils. A twitch. And utter calm.
N: BACK TO SCENE Jameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in the back of the room. He takes notes when Cobb speaks.
C: JAMESON
D: Sir?
E: MAN
N: Cobb continues staring out the window at the buck.
C: COBB
D: There's a small oil company near Bakersfield called Honolulu Oil, sitting near the Elk Hills Reserve... I want you to buy all the stock you can.
E: beat
C: JAMESON
D: Honolulu Oil?
C: COBB
D: Getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that. I got a hunch... Stumpy, c'mere... Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly. Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb, sharing the view.
E: beat
C: COBB
D: I can take that buck. What'ya think?
C: STUMP
D: With a pistol? No way. Cobb smiles and loads the revolver. He pushes the window which swings slowly open.
N: POV SHOT - BUCK IN MOONLIGHT searches for leaves to eat in the snow. Serene. Unaware. BACK TO SCENE
C: COBB
D: There's a board meeting of Coca-Cola in Georgia next week. Call them up and tell them I can't make it for medical -- -- personal -- reasons... ... and sell all the 3-M stock we got.
E: to Jameson correcting himself beat
C: COBB
D: raises the gun -- he wobbles badly and steadies himself. The gun shakes. Then steadies.
N: Stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre action. POV SHOT - BUCK RAISES ITS HEAD Just as... KABLAM! The REVOLVER FIRES with a violent kick. The buck spins and runs back into the woods, kicking snow and disappearing in the brush.
C: BACK TO SCENE COBB
D: Got him.
C: STUMP
D: Like hell you did.
C: COBB
D: Right behind the ear.
C: STUMP
D: You're full of shit.
C: COBB
D: Jameson?
C: JAMESON
D: If Mr. Cobb said he got him, then he got him.
C: COBB
D: You have no vision, Stump. A writer without vision is a waste of my time. I think I picked the wrong man. Cobb stumbles back into bed, somewhat exhausted by the ordeal.
C: JAMESON
D: And I think I better get back to San Francisco before the storm hits. I'll take care of these transactions, Mr. Cobb. And Jameson exits the room.
C: STUMP
D: And I'll be leaving as well, sir, since you think I'm the wrong man for the job.
C: COBB
D: Shut up, Stump -- we both know that I'm your meal ticket. We need each other. And we start in the morning.
E: beat smiles
C: STUMP
D: No.
C: COBB
D: Yes. Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns UP the MUSIC so that the room is overwhelmed with Kreisler's violin. Stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure.
E: calmly
N: Cobb gradually slips into sleep, buried in the music, the booze, the pills, the pain...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - EARLY NEXT A.M.
N: Silence. The morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods. A rabbit scurries across the snow, some quail are flushed. PAN ACROSS the landscape REVEALS the lodge. Smoke curls from the chimney.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LODGE - MORNING
N: Stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on the kitchen table. Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes randomly. A teletype MACHINE sits on a table nearby -- Throughout the scene, a tape CLICKS endlessly out, piling on the floor. Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape.
C: STUMP
D: Ready, Mr. Cobb.
C: COBB
D: Chapter one, Page one...
C: STUMP
D: I'm ready.
C: COBB
D: 'Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.' Stump types it out, then stops.
C: STUMP
D: What the hell is that?
C: COBB
D: That's what Robert E. Lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at Fredricksburg.
C: STUMP
D: So I'm taking notes?
C: COBB
D: Hell no. That's the first line of my autobiography.
C: STUMP
D: I ain't writing it.
C: COBB
D: Why not?
C: STUMP
D: It's horseshit. It's a third person comment about someone who's already dead. An autobiography has to be in the first person -- plus it can't come from the other side of the God damn grave.
C: COBB
D: My story can come from any damn place I want.
C: STUMP
D: Not to mention you can't call yourself 'a prince and great man' -- that's for the world to decide.
C: COBB
D: What kind of a fucking writer you call yourself -- all tied up in rules and regulations. What's the point being a writer if you can't say what you want to?
C: STUMP
D: You're not treating me like a writer -- you're treating me like a stenographer.
N: BLAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT -- Stump types quickly, hunting and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud.
C: STUMP
D: Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day...
C: COBB
D: It has a certain ring to it...
C: STUMP
D: Yes it does.
C: COBB
D: I thought you might like it. It's yours, a gift from me. 'Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is' - This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written -- type it! Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across. Stump types.
E: beat demands from Stump
C: COBB
D: Bethlehem Steel's about to dive.
N: Cobb grabs a phone and dials -- Then barks into the phone.
C: COBB
D: Jameson. Bethlehem's going in the toilet. Dump it all! Cobb slams down the phone, momentarily lost in finance.
E: on phone
C: STUMP
D: You got a stock tip for me?
C: COBB
D: Yeah... buy Coca-Cola. We're about to go out in cans.
C: STUMP
D: Coke in cans? I don't think so. Cobb just stares back in disdain. Then, suddenly --
N: Cobb starts coughing terribly. He clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces.
C: COBB
D: You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb?
C: STUMP
D: What?
C: COBB
D: Every disease known to man -- I got 'em all! And they'll never get me in a hospital -- never! My heart leaks -- the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping... Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage. He flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments.
E: proudly beat
C: COBB
D: They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me Tace for something eatin' up my stomach, Fleets Compound for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes...
N: Cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber. Insulin spills as he does.
C: COBB
D: Fuckin' insulin...
N: He jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation. He takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an immediate relief from pain.
C: COBB
D: And if all that wasn't enough, it's been two years since I got my pecker in the air... The South may not rise again but my dick will.
E: beat
N: The PHONE RINGS.
C: COBB
D: I ain't here!
E: barks
N: Stump answers the phone.
C: STUMP
D: Cobb's residence... hello. He's not here -- who's calling? Ernie? Ernie who? My God... It's Ernest Hemingway... for you.
E: answering the phone beat his face drops to Cobb
C: COBB
D: Tell him to go to hell! Stump covers the receiver nervously.
C: STUMP
D: Jesus Christ, Ty, this is the great American writer -- this is the man who inspired me to become a writer!
C: COBB
D: Tell him to go to hell anyway.
C: STUMP
D: Why?
C: COBB
D: Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide.
C: STUMP
D: That's it? You didn't like a guide he hired? Cobb looks at Stump with a fierceness that is so over- whelming, so physical, that Stump melts.
C: COBB
D: You tell him to go fuck himself or I'll kick your Yankee ass!
N: Stump is terrified. He reluctantly uncovers the receiver.
C: STUMP
D: Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Cobb says... to go to hell. By the way I'm a big fan of yours -- CLICK, a hang up. Cobb settles into a chair, letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body.
E: awkwardly
C: COBB
D: Hemingway isn't a bullfighter -- he wrote about bullfighting. What the hell is that?! Bullshit... Damn painkillers... Cobb rubs his head -- The drugs are taking effect.
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: Ty, you okay?
C: COBB
D: It'll pass... Stumpy, listen to me -- you know what I need?
E: increasingly woozy
C: STUMP
D: What do you need?
C: COBB
D: I need a woman. A woman is definitely what I need...
E: muttering to sleep
N: And Cobb drifts to sleep in his chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers. Stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and when Cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LODGE - DUSK
N: Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside, and darkness is falling. He takes a deep breath.
C: STUMP
D: I couldn't be around the man for long without needing a break, which his painkillers gracefully provided. My sanity would soon depend upon a frequent breath of fresh air, a walk in the woods -- any escape from what one sportswriter had called 'Cobb's brooding soul that bubbled with violence.' Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail, away from the lodge, toward a ridge, all covered with snow. The flurries of snow are getting thicker now.
E: V.O. beat
C: STUMP
D: I knew most of the Cobb stories -- first man elected to the Hall of Fame, ahead of the incomparable Babe Ruth. Statistics that haven't been approached in three-quarters of a century. Stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially frozen Lake Tahoe in the lingering light.
E: V.O.
C: STUMP
D: But I'd known boxing champions and football players -- they were gentle souls outside the arena. How much of Cobb was an act, a lifetime of theatrical intimidation to preserve his own legend?
E: V.O. beat MORE
C: STUMP
D: Legends grow in time. Tough guys are tougher, women more beautiful, routine acts of self-preservation become heroic.
E: CONT'D
N: Stump continues walking down a crest of snow, through a stand of snow-covered pines. The light is dark, purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until, suddenly, he sees: A trail of blood in the snow. He follows it down a slope, past a tree, growing deeper, thicker. And there it is -- The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood. Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down and examines --
C: STUMP
D: My God... The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear.
N: Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around. The woods are silent. Snow falls from a branch. And... He hurries back through the woods up the ridge, momen- tarily lost as the snow swirls, he finally spots the lodge.

D: There's a blizzard out there!

N: He grabs a bottle of bourbon on the seat and chugs it down.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY IN BLIZZARD - DUSK
N: A treacherous cliff drops quickly away from the road, certain death protected by an inadequate guardrail. Into a blizzard, increasingly out of control, the cars slip and slide and skid down the mountain. Cobb leans on his HORN -- HONK, HONK, HONK.
S: INT. STUMP'S CAR - DUSK
N: Stump struggles to hang on as the car fishtails on the edge of losing control. He keeps glancing at Cobb who continues screaming.

E: muttering
N: Cobb steps on the gas -- His car pulls out into the oncoming lane and accelerates to pass.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY IN BLIZZARD - DUSK
N: Cobb's car passes Stump's car down the steep grade. Insane, impossible, suicidal -- not another car on the road, the highway closed, barely visible... and here comes Cobb. Stump stares in disbelief as he clings to the wheel.
C: STUMP'S POV

S: EXT. HIGHWAY
N: Stump's car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that plunges to a raging, icy river. The car fishtails, straightens, and continues on, slowly groping down the mountain. CLOSE ON STUMP Sheer terror. It takes his full powers of concentration to keep the car on the road.
C: STUMP
D: He's a goner, Al, save your own God damn ass...
E: to himself
N: CLOSER ON STUMP He sees something.

C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: Stump stops his car and gets out -- He hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly.
N: POV SHOT - COBB'S CAR lies nose down at the bottom of a snow-filled ravine, thirty feet away. The tail lights are still on. The car is totalled.
C: BACK TO SCENE STUMP
D: Cobb! Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting bad footing and snowdrifts, until -- He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive this. With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door of the huge car and wrestles it open.
N: Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car.
C: STUMP
D: Cobb?
N: Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried under the dash of the car. There's blood on his face.
C: COBB
D: It's about fucking time you got here!
C: STUMP
D: You've alive?
N: Cobb struggles to right himself, twisting and turning free.
C: COBB
D: I wouldn't call it living but it'll do. Help me outta here. Stump helps Cobb back out of the car. It is an awkward, clumsy, difficult task.
C: STUMP
D: There's blood!
C: COBB
D: Of course there's blood! I just put my head through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking jerk.
C: STUMP
D: Shut up!
C: COBB
D: Ty Cobb can't die like this! They'll bury me and nobody'll know who it is!
C: STUMP
D: I said shut up. Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high- way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road.
C: COBB
D: Look't that! No guard rail! I'm suing the State Highway Commission, I'm suing the Governor, I'm suing every God damn body! I coulda been killed!
E: outraged
C: STUMP
D: God damn it, shut up and get in the car! The blizzard swirls around the two men, now at Stump's car on the highway.

C: STUMP
D: I'm driving.
C: COBB
D: Do you know how to get to Reno? Hell, no! I'm driving.
C: STUMP
D: Over my dead body!
N: Cobb pulls a gun from his overcoat pocket and aims it right at Stump's head.
C: COBB
D: Your call.
C: STUMP
D: You miserable son of a bitch. You coward, you pathetic, frightened, desperate old man -- you can't do anything without that gun and frankly it doesn't impress me to keep flashing it because I know you're not gonna shoot me 'cause you need me worse than I need you. What, you're gonna kill me?
N: Cobb smiles. He loves it when someone stands up to him. He thrives on confrontation.
C: COBB
D: I've killed a man.
C: STUMP
D: Fine, then put me outta my fuckin' misery. I'm freezing.
N: Cobb hands the gun to Stump.
C: COBB

D: It's only another hour -- plenty of time to tell you my story before we find us some women.
C: STUMP
D: Women? Plural?
C: COBB
D: Some for you, some for me. We'll have a helluva time. The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.
C: STUMP
D: Dear God... And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain, every curve risking death. He seems at peace with the world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of being utterly out of control.
E: muttering
C: COBB
D: I suppose you want to know about my childhood. Writers usually do.
C: STUMP
D: None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen' stuff --
C: COBB
D: My philosophy is simply this -- Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends shouldn't mind what he does or says, and those who are not his friends, well, to hell with 'em. And Cobb drifts into a story of his youth. He's suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road.
C: COBB
D: I was born in a small town in Georgia, of course... my sweet sister Florence still lives there...
E: MORE

C: COBB
D: Hey, greaseball, check your wife -- one of the players is missing!
N: The pitcher flips Cobb the finger and takes a sign, deliv- ering a pitch which is swung on and missed, strike three. Cobb heads to the plate, passing his dejected teammate who has just struck out.
C: COBB
D: Who the hell ever signed you?
C: TEAMMATE
D: Go to hell.

C: COBB
D: Hey, Cyclops, you're missing a good game.
C: UMPIRE
D: Shut up, Cobb. As Cobb digs in, he reaches into his back pocket and drops something on home plate, in front of the CATCHER.
C: COBB
D: Here ya go... The Catcher holds up a pair of women's panties.
C: COBB
D: Your old lady left 'em in my car last night -- I thought you could give 'em back to her.
N: CLOSE ON CATCHER He flips his thumb, a sign for the pitcher to deck Cobb.
C: CATCHER
D: You're going down, Cobb.
C: COBB
D: Let's go.
N: The pitcher delivers a fastball right at Cobb's head -- He hits the dirt just before the pitch arrives (and this is long before players wore protective headgear). Cobb rises, laughing defiantly.
C: COBB
D: That's as hard as you can throw?! Shit, it that was my fastball I'd wear a dress!
E: to the pitcher
N: Then Cobb shouts at the shortstop, a large German-American athlete, the great HONUS WAGNER.
C: COBB
D: Hey, Wagner! I'd shade me a little up the middle if I was you! Wagner doesn't budge, comfortable in his position, not drawn into Cobb's taunts. Stoic, implacable -- far from Cobb.
C: COBB
D: You try to take my head off then you throw a sinker away, in and out, same old shit -- sinker away...
E: to catcher
C: CLOSE ON COBB
D: His chatter stops, his focus is intense and sudden. He holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left- handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the ground. For all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in the way he holds the bat. A baton, a paintbrush, a magic wand...
N: NEW ANGLE Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes a swing that is at once quick and powerful. He drives the ball to left, the opposite way -- Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into left. Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and returning to first when the throw rifles into second. Cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher.
C: COBB
D: You God damn coward! You shoulda thrown at me again! You shoulda hit me in the fucking head!
N: Cobb looks down at Wagner who stands implacably at short- stop, a large, powerfully-built man.
C: COBB
D: Hey, Krauthead, I'm coming down.
C: CLOSE ON WAGNER
D: He just nods.
C: NEW ANGLE
D: The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.
N: Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up slide. And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free. Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth- ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has stolen second. Both men seem satisfied.
C: BACK IN DUGOUT
D: More money is wagered.
C: PITCHER
D: Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third. The throw is high -- he slides in safely.
N: IN STANDS Bets are doubled. The stands are full of wagering. The whole ballpark is like a giant saloon -- drinking, smoking, wagering -- and the game is played by thugs and brigands. COBB ON THIRD Yells at the pitcher and Catcher.
C: COBB
D: You want in on the action? My mother has a better arm than you! I'm coming to you, greaseball! Coming to kick your dago ass!
E: to the Catcher
C: CATCHER
D: steals a glance at Cobb who takes a menacing lead off third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.
N: PITCHER nods, winds up, and as he does -- Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher digs in to take on Cobb -- Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm. A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe. Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As the police rush out to break up the brawl...

N: Like an out of control bobsled -- Cobb races and Stump hangs on for his life.
C: COBB
D: After World War Two, General Patton asked me for an autograph -- he said he patterned himself after me! Are you getting this?
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: I'll remember.
C: COBB
D: Why aren't you writing?!
C: STUMP
D: 'Cause I'm trying to have a good grip on things when this car goes over the next cliff! I ain't ready to die yet! Cobb's tone changes suddenly -- he questions Stump with- out guile or anger, as if his answer is obvious.
C: COBB
D: But neither am I.
N: Cobb stares at Stump, waiting for an answer, and forgets about the road. Stump looks up in fear and points at the road.
C: STUMP
D: Ty!
N: Cobb swerves wildly back onto the road, such as it exists in the blizzard.
C: COBB
D: I said I'm not ready to die.
C: STUMP
D: Then watch the fucking road.
C: COBB
D: But you're not listening to me! I may have every God damn disease known to man but I am never going to check into a hospital because I am alive and I am going to get laid in Reno!

D: You queer?!
C: STUMP
D: I'm married.
C: COBB
D: I thought you were divorced.
C: STUMP
D: We're in the middle of a... problem. We're talking.
C: COBB
D: Talking my ass! Quit hanging on -- get a divorce. Is that why you don't wanta get laid in Reno? 'Cause you're feeling loyal to a woman you're divorcing? That's really stupid, Stumpy...
C: STUMP
D: I'm not getting a divorce. I'm being loyal.
C: COBB
D: Is that why you used to wine and dine that little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in Santa Barbara? Stump is nailed.
C: STUMP
D: What do you know about her?!
C: COBB
D: I do my homework, Stumpy. I know where the bodies are buried.
C: STUMP
D: It didn't last long!
E: defensively
C: COBB
D: Hey, no need to defend yourself. When it comes to women I'm a total shit -- the difference is, Stumpy, that I know I'm a shit.
C: STUMP
D: Nobody knows about the brunette.
C: COBB
D: Our little secret, huh? And that part about me being a shit with women? That ain't gonna be in the book.
E: beat
C: STUMP
D: I gotta put your family in my book.
C: COBB
D: Your book?! My book! And nothing about my ex-wives or children are gonna be in it. My book is about baseball!

C: COBB
D: Cobb is baseball! INTERCUT:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY
N: Suddenly something appears ahead on the roadside. Cobb doesn't see it. Stump does. It looks like a figure, huddled, wrapped, immobile in the swirling snow. It can't be...
C: STUMP
D: Ty! Look! It's a man!
N: THEIR POV - FIGURE attempts to wave at the car. A nearly-frozen, desperate attempt to flag down the car.
C: BACK TO SCENE COBB
D: Fuck him...
C: STUMP
D: Stop the car!
N: Cobb brakes -- the car spins to a stop some distance past the figure standing knee-deep in snow.
C: COBB
D: Whoever it is he's gotta be pretty stupid to be out in this shit.
C: STUMP
D: We're out in this shit! And Stump climbs out of the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SIDE OF ROAD (BLIZZARD) - DUSK
N: Stump trudges back to the half-frozen figure who flails his arms stiffly at the apparition of a car in all this. The figure is wrapped in blankets, his head covered. We cannot see who it is until we are in his face.
C: FIGURE IN SNOW
D: Help me. Please help me.
C: STUMP
D: My God... it's you. Are you okay? It is Willie, the black man who Cobb fired the day before.
C: WILLIE
D: I can't believe you found me...
E: FIGURE IN SNOW
C: STUMP
D: Let me help you to the car.
C: WILLIE
D: I told you that you'd only last one day with the bastard.
C: STUMP
D: Cobb's in the car. He's driving.
N: Willie stops trudging toward the car.
C: WILLIE
D: Mr. Cobb's in the car?
C: STUMP
D: Yeah...
C: WILLIE
D: Then I'm not getting in the car with that son of a bitch. I'd rather take my chances out here.
C: STUMP
D: You're coming!
N: And Stump drags Willie to the car, though the man is re- luctant the whole way, he is in no condition to resist.
C: WILLIE
D: He hates me. He hates black people...
E: muttering the whole way
C: STUMP
D: He fucking hates everybody. Don't give him the pleasure of dying out here.
C: WILLIE
D: If dying out here gives him pleasure then I won't die out here. They get to the car -- Stump opens the back door to help the nearly-frozen man into the car. Cobb grumbles.
C: STUMP
D: Ty, it's Willie. We can give him a lift to town.
C: COBB
D: Bullshit! I ain't givin' no nigger a ride nowhere!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STUMP'S CAR - DUSK
N: And Stump loses it -- he grabs Cobb's pistol off the seat of the car and aims it right at Cobb's head.
C: STUMP
D: Shut the fuck up and give him a ride!
C: COBB
D: Now who's the coward! You won't shoot me! You need me! Stump hands the gun to Willie.....
C: STUMP
D: No. But I'm sure Willie would take great pleasure in it. Willie climbs into the back seat with the gun. Cobb is livid.
C: COBB
D: You'll pay for this, Stumpy...
C: STUMP
D: Say, Willie, you a baseball fan?
C: WILLIE
D: Yessir...
C: STUMP
D: Who's the greatest ballplayer of all time, in your opinion?
C: WILLIE
D: Willie Mays, no doubt about it.
C: COBB
D: That nigger couldn't hold my jock!
C: STUMP
D: Excuse me, Mr. Cobb, the man is speaking...
C: NEW ANGLE
D: And Cobb jumps on the gas -- the car races off, back down the mountain, fishtailing as it goes.
C: WILLIE
D: And I'd say the second greatest player of all time is Jackie Robinson... or maybe Josh Gibson...
C: COBB
D: Shut up!!
C: WILLIE
D: And of course, the greatest base runner of all time isn't riding in this car -- the fastest baseball player of all time was Cool Papa Bell -- Cool Papa would've easily broke all your stolen base records --
C: COBB
D: Noooooo!
C: WILLIE
D: Cool Papa was so fast that when he entered a hotel room and flipped the light switch off, he'd be asleep in bed before it got dark...
C: STUMP
D: And then there's Satchel Paige...
C: WILLIE
D: Oh yeah, Satchel Paige could throw a porkchop past a wolf, Mr. Cobb, ol' Satchel woulda had you eatin' outta his hand, he woulda had you hittin' .220 and kissin' his black ass to boot...
C: COBB
D: Shut this man up!
C: WILLIE
D: The man with the gun does the talking, you wretched, old prick...
N: LONG SHOT - CAR racing down the highway in the snow, and we go out hearing Willie recount the greatest ballplayers of all time -- all of them black -- as Cobb seethes, a gun to his head. Stump feeds Willie, watching Cobb's racism simmer. Into the storm the car disappears -- fishtailing down the mountain. The blizzard grows thicker, the flurries taking over the mountain, until all we see is -- The thick snow falling from the dark sky. Suddenly --
C: STUMP
D: Ice! Slow down! Tyyyy!
N: POV - STEEP DOWNGRADE as slick as a bobsled run. CLOSE ON STUMP Terror. CLOSE ON WILLIE Terror. He lowers the gun and hangs on for dear life. CLOSE ON COBB He accelerates with vengeance. CAR wobbles and starts spinning -- out of control, then spinning continuous 360s down the grade.
C: CLOSE ON THREE MEN
D: The world spins around them as they cling for their lives. Until: THUD -- the car slams into a bank of snow. Suddenly, silence.
N: The three men sit without speaking for several beats, slowly acknowledging that they have survived. Finally:
C: COBB
D: Fucked up roads. They don't build highways like they used to.
N: POV - HOTEL SIGN IN DISTANCE glows a welcome sign in the night. It is no longer snowing. BACK TO SCENE
C: WILLIE
D: Well, Mr. Cobb, thank you for a lift into town... Willie hands the gun to Stump and climbs out of the car, bidding farewell to Stump as he does.
C: WILLIE
D: And you, sir, should leave this disgusting, wretched, sorry son of a bitch immediately. Good evening.
N: Willie tips his hat and trudges to the neon glow in the distance. Cobb and Stump alone in the car. They both look out -- the car is buried, hood deep, in the bank of snow.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EDGE OF RENO - NIGHT
N: Under the famous arch that reads: "The Biggest Little City in the World," a tow truck pulls Stump's car into town, and up to:
S: EXT. LAST CHANCE HOTEL - NIGHT
N: The truck stops -- Stump helps Cobb out and into the old style building adjacent to the gaudier casinos.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LAST CHANCE HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Stump helps Cobb to the registration desk in a clean, but very modest old hotel. A WOMAN, 30s, stands at the counter in the middle of some dispute with the clerk. She wears a long, cheap, plain- cloth overcoat and galoshes. Stump bursts in, oblivious to the conversation in progress.
C: STUMP
D: Two rooms, please...
N: The woman turns to confront the two men. Now we see her. On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck a yellow slicker-type rain hat. The ear flaps are awry, the platinum-blonde wig curls up around it -- the effect is thrilling.
C: WOMAN IN WIG
D: Stand back, you old farts. I'm in the middle of something -- The heat's on the blink and the mattress is lumpy -- I want a discount.
E: back to clerk
C: CLERK
D: Aw, c'mon, you always want a discount, Mona.
C: RAMONA
D: Ra-mona... and the mattress is always lumpy --
E: WOMAN
N: Cobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey. The Clerk looks on with alarm.
C: STUMP
D: Excuse me, I've gotta get him checked in. He's very sick.
C: RAMONA
D: We're all sick in the eyes of God -- but some of us still have manners.
N: She whirls and leaves the lobby, leaving the three men.
C: STUMP
D: Two rooms, next to each other.
T: CUT TO;
S: INT. COBB'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Stump helps Cobb shoot up with insulin -- The needle clumsily groping for a vein in the old man's arm. CLOSE ON COBB His face looks terrible, drawn, drained. Cobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of cash and security notes, tied neatly with a string.
C: COBB
D: My money...
E: barely audible
C: STUMP
D: Your money's okay, Ty, right here...
C: COBB
D: My gun...
C: STUMP
D: Your gun's okay, too... right here...
N: And Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol, which Cobb takes with great affection and comfort. Stump helps Cobb into bed, covering him with a blanket. The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his head. Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out from pain, drugs, and exhaustion.
C: COBB
D: We haven't missed the testimonial dinner, have we?
C: STUMP
D: No we haven't missed the dinner...
C: COBB
D: Good, good... Cobb manages a small, pained smile before drifting off into sleep. Stump turns off the light and exits.

S: INT. STUMP'S ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT
N: Stump pours a glass of vodka, settles into a chair, and dials the phone. He swallows deeply of the drink, and waits.
C: STUMP
D: Hello? Happy Birthday! It's your Daddy! Yeah! Your birthday was yesterday?! No, it couldn't be!
E: on phone beat
N: Stump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes he's missed his son's birthday.
C: STUMP
D: Omigod, what can I say? I feel terrible -- no, it's not okay, jeez... When I get off the road we'll do something special -- a late birthday, eh? Maybe you can go to spring training or something with me, eh? Yeah... Listen, is your mother there? I know she doesn't want to speak to me, but I want to speak to her. Okay, okay -- I feel terrible about the birthday... I'll call you real soon. And tell your mother I'm not drinking anymore. Okay... 'bye, 'bye... Stump hangs up the phone -- Takes a deep breath, and... He pours another drink, and sits down to his typewriter.
E: on phone beat beat waits for answer
C: STUMP
D: Fuck it... Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away. His VOICE OVER indicates what he is writing.
C: STUMP
D: I was a fool for thinking Cobb's brilliance might be what I needed at this moment of my life... Ty Cobb was the last thing I needed. He was not misunderstood -- he was understood perfectly well. He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics -- he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world... At times it seemed like he would drop dead in front of me... ... and other times he seemed indestructible...
E: V.O. beat beat beat MORE

C: COBB
D: 'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past!' What is this shit?!
N: Stump awakens slowly, disoriented, amidst a shattered bottle.
C: STUMP
D: Those are my notes! You can't look at my notes!
C: COBB
D: You're notes -- my life! You're gonna betray me, you son of a bitch!

D: Whose truth?

E: slightly defensive
C: COBB
D: Don't you understand anything about 'greatness'?

D: Maybe you should find another writer.
C: COBB
D: There's not enough time left. This frank admission momentarily stops Stump.
C: STUMP
D: I'm entitled to my opinions --
C: COBB
D: Now that's pathetic. Who gives a good God damn about the opinions of Al Stump?! What people want to know about is Ty Cobb! And they don't want to know who he hates 'cause everybody hates somebody! They don't wanta know if he had two wives or ten! They don't wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him!
C: STUMP
D: You think they wanta know how to steal second base?
C: COBB
D: Yes! Precisely!
C: STUMP
D: Well I don't!
C: COBB
D: Oh, oh, oh... I get it. You're one of them college psychology type guys. You wanta find the missing piece to finish the puzzle known as the Madman Cobb -- you think you're the next Hemingway but you're just a moderate success in a moderate-sized pond.
C: STUMP
D: Fuck you, Cobb! I'm much more than a moderate success!

N: Cobb spits on the papers of Stump's text.

D: Well I was a prick before it happened and a bigger prick after it happened so stick that up your Sigmund Freud ass!
N: Silence. Stump is shaken by this story.
C: STUMP
D: Your mother killed your father?
C: COBB
D: And you ain't printing it.
C: STUMP
D: I have to.
C: COBB
D: Not if I say so. I don't think you understand something -- I have final editorial approval of the book.
C: STUMP
D: No, I do. I always have it.
C: COBB
D: Did you read your contract?
C: STUMP
D: It's my standard contract. I just signed. I would never have agreed to this if you had final approval.
N: Cobb calmly picks up the phone and hands it to Stump.
C: COBB
D: Call your agent. Stump quickly dials and gets an answer.
C: STUMP
D: Hello? Charlie? Al... I'm in Reno... yeah... things are fine... Yeah, listen... I'm just checking... did we give away final editorial approval on this Cobb book? We did? Cobb has it? Jesus... Stump listens long and hard -- his face sinks. Cobb smiles and hangs the phone back up for Stump who reaches for the bottle on the nightstand and pours himself a morning drink of vodka.
E: beat long beat of disbelief
C: COBB
D: Well, you were pretty stupid to give up approval, weren't ya?
C: STUMP
D: Fuck you, Cobb?
C: COBB
D: Fuck me? Why me? Why you mad at me? Your agent made the deal, your lawyer, your publisher, you didn't even read the contract because you trusted them! Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent?! If I was Al Stump, the guy I'd be pissed off at would be Al Stump!
E: suddenly charming
C: STUMP
D: Listen to me, you son of a bitch -- if you die before the book is finished, I'll write the story I want.

D: But I ain't dying first.

D: I'll die slow.

D: At the hotel -- checking in.
C: RAMONA
D: Ohyeah, you were the asshole. Cobb is suddenly gallant, gentlemanly, even charming.
C: COBB
D: Excuse me, young lady, I must apologize for the behavior of my friend -- he has a crude side. Ramona delivers the cigars and collects the money. Stump is a bit chagrined and caught off guard by this Cobb.
C: RAMONA
D: I accept.

N: BACK ONSTAGE - LOUIS PRIMA motions to his band.

D: And this one's for the Georgia Peach! They break into "Sweet Georgia Brown."
C: LOUIS PRIMA/KEELY SMITH
D: No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown, Two left feet but oh so sweet is Sweet Georgia Brown... Cobb breaks into a little dance with Ramona at the table, much to Stump's amazement. For a moment, at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once was.
E: and Ramona's
C: LOUIS PRIMA
D: The great Ty Cobb! C'mon up here!
C: STUMP
D: They want you, Ty --
C: COBB

C: RAMONA
D: Who's that?
C: STUMP
D: The greatest baseball player of all time.
C: RAMONA
D: I don't know baseball from shmaseball but I know a nice man when I see one and I also know it's time for my coffee break. Hasta luego. And she's off with her trayful of tobacco to the cocktail lounge.

C: LOUIS PRIMA
D: My great pleasure, sir -- I've always wanted to ask you something, Mr. Cobb, with all the great ballplayers playing right now -- how well do you think you'd do against today's players?
E: shaking hands
C: COBB
D: Well, I figure against today's pitchers I'd only hit about .275, .280...
C: LOUIS PRIMA
D: That's amazing, Mr. Cobb, considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher. Why do you think you'd only hit .275 against today's pitchers?
C: COBB
D: Because I'm 72 fucking years old, that's why, God damn it. Give me that thing. Cobb grabs the mike and takes over.
C: COBB
D: First of all I wanta thank you for that song, 'Sweet Georgia Brown... it's a great song about my home state and I appreciate it... That song has become the theme song for the Harlem Globetrotters... It's too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear...
E: beat as Prima nods with a smile
N: Prima and his cohorts are aghast. They cling to the hope that this is some put-on, some joke. They force a small, unnatural laugh. Stump winces and leaves the room, heading for the bar.
C: COBB
D: 'Course the Globetrotters are owned by a Jew named Saperstein so whadda you expect? A disaster. Prima tries gamely to seize the mike back.
C: LOUIS PRIMA
D: Thank you very much. Another round of applause for the Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb!
C: COBB
D: I got the mike, Dago -- gimme a God damn minute. Nobody's got respect for their elders any more. Cobb turns to the crowd which, even in it's drunken state, is appalled and in disbelief.
C: COBB
D: Now let me explain to you how to hit a baseball. It's a lost art. Ever since that half-nigger Ruth started hitting home runs, the skill, the art, and the science have been lost.
N: Cobb grabs a clarinet from a member of Prima's band.
C: COBB
D: Now, say this is a bat...
N: BACKSTAGE The CASINO MANAGERS and SECURITY FORCES are quickly gathering to figure out what to do.

C: OFFSTAGE
D: The Casino Manager winces and consults.
C: CASINO MANAGER
D: Oh God, here we go...
C: COBB
D: Hitting a baseball is really very easy... you can't force it... you can't overpower it... you go with the pitch... you let the bat do the work... it's all rhythm and flow... And Cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the bewildered audience and casino staff. He strikes that familiar, strange stance -- choked up on the bat, a split grip, the bat held parallel to the ground... CUT TO:

D: It's the wig. Ramona pulls the wig off her head revealing a sea of bobby pins and hair pins tying her natural brown hair to her head. She sets the wig on the counter and scratches her natural scalp.
C: RAMONA
D: The damn thing itches but it's good for tips. Give me a scratch, will ya? Stump scratches the back of her scalp, somewhat embar- rassed and somewhat aroused.
C: RAMON
D: Turn you on? Hey, Harvey, another round. On him.
C: STUMP
D: Vodka and grapefruit juice. Ramona slaps the wig back on her head. Slightly akilter. She doesn't care. Harvey delivers another round.

D: I'm sorry. I didn't know. I mean I'm not good at this.
C: RAMONA
D: Just divorced, huh?
C: STUMP
D: Not yet...
C: RAMONA
D: It's written all over ya. Giant letters right across the forehead. D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Ha! Plain as day. Ramona lets out a loud, hearty laugh without inhibition.
C: STUMP
D: It's obvious, huh?
C: RAMONA
D: Obvious. So, if ya wanta pay me to screw, I won't do it.
E: beat

D: Whichever.
C: RAMONA
D: So ya don't wanta screw?
C: STUMP
D: No, I do.
C: RAMONA
D: All this ambiguity -- I see why she's divorcing ya. Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona.
C: STUMP
D: I don't know what I'm saying or doing anymore... I'm trying to speak my heart.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh God...
C: STUMP
D: I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said 'okay' -- then I realized maybe I don't.
C: RAMONA
D: Then go back to her.
C: STUMP
D: No.
C: RAMONA
D: Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise!
C: STUMP
D: I'm not myself.
C: RAMONA
D: Who is? A sigh. Stump is lost. He motions to the bartender.
C: STUMP
D: Another round, Harvey. This assignment has me befuddled. I'm supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a prince. I'm supposed to lie.
E: back to Ramona
C: RAMONA
D: You being paid?
C: STUMP
D: Very well.
C: RAMONA
D: Then it's not a lie. It's a job. Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with.
C: STUMP
D: I can't.
C: RAMONA
D: Then quit.
C: STUMP
D: No!
C: RAMONA
D: For godsakes why not? Stump has to think about this for a while.
C: STUMP
D: He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. She looks at him like he's crazy.
C: RAMONA
D: Greatness is overrated.
C: STUMP
D: Maybe you're right, maybe you're right...
C: RAMONA
D: So what do you want?
N: Stump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement.
C: STUMP
D: I want to be in someone's arms tonight.
C: RAMONA
D: Oh that. Why do men have such a hard time saying what they want?

S: INT. STUMP'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Stump and Ramona stagger in drunkenly -- they are awkward and passionate. She grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle.

C: RAMONA
D: Ya think I won't be able to screw if I'm too drunk?
C: STUMP
D: Well... yeah...
C: RAMONA
D: Screwed, stewed, and tattooed! She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out.
C: STUMP
D: C'mere... I want to hold you.
C: RAMONA
D: You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober. You'd be good husband material.
C: STUMP
D: Not so fast --
C: RAMONA
D: I didn't mean --
C: STUMP
D: Come here.
N: They embrace -- and hold each other fully, doing nothing but holding on. Stump relaxes.

N: The door bursts open -- the LOCK SPLINTERS with a CRASH, and: Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage.
C: COBB
D: You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I'll kill you!
C: STUMP
D: She's not 'your' girl! And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again.
N: Stump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the table.
C: RAMONA
D: What're you doing?! And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her down.
N: Stump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as -- Cobb grabs Ramona, pulling his everpresent gun from his pocket as he does.
C: COBB
D: You're coming with me!
C: RAMONA
D: I don't want to!
N: Cobb jams the pistol into her jaw. STUMP'S POV A dizzying view of Cobb dragging the woman out of his room. And he passes out.

D: That don't scare me 'cause if you kill me I'll be dead and you ain't gonna screw a dead lady.
C: COBB
D: I might.
N: She stares at the madman.
C: RAMONA
D: You're right. You might.
C: COBB
D: Take your clothes off.
N: Ramona removes her top -- her breasts are jammed into a classic 50's push-up bra.
C: COBB
D: You got big tits. I like big tits.
C: RAMONA
D: They aren't so big. They're average, actually -- but these bras are great. Push 'em right up there. I owe a lot to the bras and wigs. A girl needs what she needs --
E: terrified
C: COBB
D: Shut up. Take it off. She does. And covers her breasts with her hands.
C: COBB
D: Shy, huh? Get on the bed. Ramona gets on the bed -- Cobb circles the bed continuously.

D: You're a beauty. Roll over.

D: Terror and tears.

D: A thousand dollars... He holds out the money for her.
C: RAMONA
D: Do what you gotta do and get it over with, Mr. Cobb.
N: Silence. Cobb takes a big, sloppy hit from a bottle, throwing in a few pills for good measure.
C: COBB
D: I want you to tell everyone you meet that you fucked me and I was the best fuck you ever had.
C: RAMONA
D: That's all?
C: COBB
D: That's a lot.
C: RAMONA
D: For a thousand bucks? Hell yes. He reaches out and straightens her wig which is pretty crooked by now. She lets him. Then he falls apart, vio- lently grabbing his crotch.
C: COBB
D: I'm looking at the most beautiful woman in the world, do you hear me?!
N: Cobb grabs his crotch with the violence he does everything.
C: COBB
D: And I'm dead down here! Dead! Nothing! And it's been like that for over two years! Nothing! Now get outta here before I hit you!
N: Cobb lashes out at Ramona -- a vicious right hand. She ducks as his fist slams through the headboard.
C: RAMONA
D: Georgia Peach my ass -- Georgia trash is what you are!
N: Ramona grabs her clothes and runs from the room, past Stump who has heard it all. He enters Cobb's room. Cobb sits at the foot of the bed, thoroughly flustered. Stump helps him into his bed where he curls up with his money and his gun, barely conscious.
C: COBB
D: She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best I ever had...
C: STUMP
D: Good, good...
C: COBB
D: Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner?
C: STUMP
D: No we haven't, Ty... now get some sleep... Stump tucks Cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep, turns off the light, and heads back to his own room.
C: CLOSE ON COBB
D: asleep. Even in sleep, dying, he is twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy.

C: COBB
D: Y'see how it works, Stumpy... they boo ya your whole career, then when you're about to kiss off, they put ya on a pedestal. That's what being a legend's all about.
N: Arriving at a craps table, Cobb barges right in.
C: COBB
D: Send the dice to the Peach, boys, and belly up to the bar...
N: The croupier pushes the dice to Cobb who places a bet, as do the others. Cobb rolls the dice -- but he sees something. Somebody.

D: Stumpy, what is that?!
N: POV - RAMONA AND WILLIE are rolling dice at a nearby table. They appear friendly, not intimate, two among twelve. BACK TO SCENE
C: COBB

E: V.O.
S: INT. CAR ON HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Cobb is in an upbeat mood. He's reading a map. A tape recorder with hand mike sits between them.

D: Swear on a Bible, Stumpy -- I feel I can trust you now.

D: Whenever we got into a fight with the New Yorkers, 24 of our guys would fight 24 of their guys and me and Ruth would take on each other! As the benches clear -- Cobb races not at the pitcher but straight to right field where The Babe is charging in like a rhino straight for Cobb.

S: INT. THIRD FLOOR HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Cobb and Stump hurry along looking for Hornsby's room. LOUD MUSIC and LAUGHTER spills out of the room at the end of the hall. We see a woman enter the room.
C: COBB
D: There it is!
C: STUMP
D: You sure you're up for this?
C: COBB
D: I've never been readier! Cobb takes a hit on his flask and they knock at the door. Hornsby answers the door -- we can see a party behind him, full of old players, booze, cigars -- and even some women, though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than the smokers Cobb remembers.
C: COBB
D: Rajah!
C: HORNSBY
D: You ain't comin' in, Ty.

C: COCHRANE
D: I can't let ya in, Ty. It's Rogers' party. I'm an invited guest.
C: COBB
D: God damn it, let me in! Cobb tries to break into the party but Hornsby rushes over and shoves the door in his face, leaving Ty and Stump alone.
C: COBB
D: Presidents of the United States of America used to invite me to the White House to drink their Scotch and smoke their cigars and fuck their women.
C: STUMP
D: Let's go to the motel, Ty... Cobb heads down the hallway pounding on every door -- he's ready to explode.
C: COBB
D: Let me in, God damn it! I invented this game! Let me in!

S: INT. HALL OF FAME - NIGHT
N: The director flips on a couple lights -- the hall is partially lit. Charles stays in the b.g., as -- Cobb leads Stump past all the displays, various shrines and photos and old bats and balls and records, until -- A glass case full of Cobb's things -- his original Detroit Tiger uniform hangs there. Three of his famous "Black Betsy" bats, his glove, a couple balls, and his spikes. Cobb stands in front of the case just staring. Stump stands respectfully a few paces away. Cobb stares at his old uniform. Stump stares at Cobb. And Cobb starts crying, softly at first, then swelling until the muffled deep, convulsive sounds become more audible. He starts crying like a baby. Stump stands quietly nearby, afraid to move, until, finally: Cobb sucks up the tears and finally turns to Stump.
C: COBB
D: What did you see on that film tonight?
C: STUMP
D: I saw Ty Cobb playing baseball.
C: COBB
D: That's all?
C: STUMP
D: That's all.
C: COBB
D: I was raised in the Baptist Church but I know that Heaven is just the ol' oskefagus -- the change-up. You swing from your ass 'cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and you're all off balance and looking stupid, the ball just kinda flutters across home, slow and juicy and hittable, and as it crosses the plate, the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher's mitt... We don't just lose -- we're made fools of.

D: He loved the manuscript, as well he should -- it made him out to be a saint -- Cobb looks up from the manuscript.
E: V.O.
C: COBB
D: Greatest biography ever written --
C: STUMP
D: The book, like Cobb, was almost finished. But he was dying slower than I was writing, and like everything else, he viewed it as a competition that he was not going to lose.
E: V.O.
C: CLOSE ON COBB
D: Sweating, pale, hanging on. A grim smile.
C: STUMP
D: To me, we weren't riding to Georgia in a limo... We were riding in a hearse...

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN ROYSTON - DAY
N: The limo moves slowly and ominously through the town. Old folks, black and white, sitting on chairs and benches in front of the stores, under awnings, stare at the strange sight of a limo cruising slowly.
C: STUMP
D: It wasn't exactly the 'grand re- entrance to a home town' that he talked about...
E: V.O.
N: CLOSE ON TWO OLD BLACK MEN sitting under an awning. They point and discuss among themselves who this could be.

E: O.S. slightly confused

D: About fifteen years ago. But she understands me... There! No... damn....
E: points

D: The limo cruises slowly through a quiet neighborhood.

D: Maybe she moved.
E: O.S.
C: COBB
D: There! I think...

N: COBB'S POV FROM CAR - STUMP AND SOMEBODY He can't quite see who it is from his angle.
C: BACK TO SCENE FLORENCE
D: I don't wish to see him.
C: STUMP
D: It's been a long time, he said. He's not well.
C: FLORENCE
D: I have nothing to say to him, and wish to hear nothing he has to say to me.
C: STUMP
D: I know there's been problems, but the family is very important to him.
C: FLORENCE
D: Young man, the family he talks about never existed.
C: STUMP
D: He loved his father.
C: FLORENCE
D: If his father, if my father, was such a great man, why did Tyrus turn out to be so evil? Stump hesitates. He doesn't have a ready answer.
C: STUMP
D: He's dying. He just wants to see you.
C: FLORENCE
D: No.
N: And she politely closes the door in Stump's face. Stump turns, sees that the limo is at such a distance that Cobb couldn't possibly have seen, or heard, her. He returns to the limo.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIMO - DAY
N: Stump climbs back in next to Cobb. He motions to the driver to head off -- the limo does.
C: COBB
D: Well?
C: STUMP
D: It wasn't your sister. The woman in the house said your sister moved a long time ago... she doesn't know where.
C: COBB
D: You cocksucking liar. My sister doesn't want to see me and you're lying. And Stump, at last, goes off --
C: STUMP
D: Liar?! A cocksucking liar?! Of course I'm a liar! That's what I'm paid to do, isn't it?! Lie about Ty Cobb?!
C: COBB
D: If you didn't like the job, why didn't you quit?
C: STUMP
D: Who would take care of you?
C: COBB
D: Don't give me the sob-sister routine.

D: I listen to your bullshit, I interpret and shape and find words for your bullshit and you give me nothing but grief!
C: COBB
D: You love being this close to greatness!

S: EXT. CAR BY ROADSIDE - DAY
N: Stump walks away from the car and from Cobb. Some wind blows, and the threat of rain.
C: STUMP
D: I wish you'd die!
C: COBB
D: I will, Stumpy, I will... Cobb is out of the car on his cane -- following Stump.
C: STUMP
D: And go to hell! A line of lightning signals a storm in the distance.
C: COBB
D: Oh, I'll do that, too. And look how convenient you've made it.
E: beat
N: They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery. A casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill.
C: STUMP
D: That was your sister alright, and she didn't want anything to do with you either!
C: COBB
D: I forgive her. Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at Cobb's comment.
C: STUMP
D: You forgive her?! That's rich!
C: COBB
D: Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth.
E: following along
C: STUMP
D: Religious growth?!
C: COBB
D: We all need to forgive more, Al... you oughta try it. You're too angry. You're all pent up.
C: STUMP
D: I'm angry? Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. Cobb following steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump.
N: THUNDER shakes the ground. And more lightning.
C: COBB
D: Are you angry because I discovered you were a whore? Is that it, Alimony?
C: STUMP
D: I'm angry?!
C: COBB
D: Is it the divorce? You gotta let go of it...
C: STUMP
D: I love her! I don't want a divorce!
C: COBB
D: Sure ya do. You're just so used to accommodating people that you don't know what you want anymore. I accommodate nobody. Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who continues making his way along, slowly and surely.
C: STUMP
D: But you have no friends!
C: COBB
D: Do you? Who are they?! Those drunken hacks you hang out with who all think they're gonna write the great American novel but all they're gonna ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy leads about high school football games? How about the brunette in the courtyard? Is she your friend? I heard she fucks everybody -- she must be everybody's friend! A mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even elegant. One simple word is above the door, carved in granite: COBB.
C: COBB
D: I'm glad we're here -- I was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later -- Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word COBB.
C: STUMP
D: Which Cobb of Georgia is that? Several beats as the men take it all in. Finally:
C: COBB
D: That is me.
E: with pride
N: And rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to soak the two men. Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MAUSOLEUM - DAY
N: Just enough room for the two men to stand. On either side of them are two crypts, enough for four burial vaults. Cobb is very calm now, and lucid. Rain falls heavily outside.
C: COBB
D: When I die, my mother and father will be moved in here and, in time, my dear sister, Florence will join us as well. The family will be together again.

N: Stump is still fuming, angry and cynical.
C: STUMP
D: Under one roof? That's romantic! You want that in the book? Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of Heaven whole!
C: COBB
D: You mock my family -- you mock me. Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the eye.
C: COBB
D: My father was a great man!
C: STUMP
D: Then why are you such a bastard?
C: COBB
D: Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness. I, too, am a great man.
C: STUMP
D: Let me go!
C: COBB
D: My mother didn't kill my father.
C: STUMP
D: What're you talking about? Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear. Outside the mausoleum, RAIN pours down now, a Southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents.
C: COBB
D: My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse... CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOONLIT ROAD THROUGH SOME WOODS - NIGHT (B&W)

C: COB
D: I stood by my mother when she was tried for murder a few months later. I said she was noble and true and loved my father completely and the whole thing was an accident and she was acquitted as she should have been...
E: V.O.

C: COBB
D: Because my mother did not kill my father.

D: CUT TO:
S: INT. MAUSOLEUM - DAY
N: The rain pours down on the cemetery. THUNDER. Lightning. Cobb still holds Stump by the throat.
C: COBB
D: Well?! Is that what you want?! 'Cause that's all I know and the only other people who know about it are dead! But it ain't going in the book, either, 'cause you're the only friend I got left, and you're the only man I can trust. Cobb lets Stump go, relaxing his grip and --
N: Stump rages back outside into the rain. Cobb stays dry in the doorway of the mausoleum.
C: STUMP
D: I don't want to be your friend! I don't want to feel sorry for you! So your mother's lover blew your father's head off! I don't care. You were a prick before it happened, you were a prick after it happened, you've been a prick ever since, and you're a prick now! Cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway of the mausoleum, watching Stump rant and rave in the rain.
C: COBB
D: Public relations are overrated.
C: STUMP
D: What the hell're you talking about? Cobb holds out his flask for Stump.
C: COBB
D: You need a drink.
C: STUMP
D: Fuck the drink!
N: Cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards them.
C: COBB
D: You're too angry, Al, you just gotta learn to let it out. Stump stands in the rain screaming at Cobb who stands out of the rain, calm, centered, drinking, dying.
C: STUMP
D: I'm gonna tell the truth about you, Cobb! I'm gonna tell the world you hate women, Jews, and niggers!
C: COBB
D: You shouldn't use the word 'nigger', Stumpy, it's racist and demeaning. And I don't hate women -- I'm just not very good with 'em, which puts me in the same boat with you and every other man I know.
E: calmly
C: STUMP
D: You treat people like dirt!
N: Cobb comes out into the rain toward Stump.
C: COBB
D: The children of America need heroes, Al, you know that... Cobb takes him by the arm and tries to lead him to the limo.
C: STUMP
D: Get your hands off me!
C: COBB
D: C'mon, Al... You're making a fool of yourself out here. It's not dignified... Come in out of the rain...

S: INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Both men are sitting in rocking chairs in front of a fireplace. Stump is in a bathrobe, his feet in a big pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand. He looks a mess. Cobb is idly playing with his pistol. He's calm, introspective.
C: COBB
D: You're an educated man... tell me what you think... Stump just sits there, drinking.
C: COBB
D: Either my father was... inadequate ... for my mother... he was not the man I thought he was... not a great man... not even a good man... ... or my mother was... trash... a common whore... It's that simple, isn't it?
E: beat beat
N: Stump just shrugs and takes another hit.
C: COBB
D: As a boy I stood in court next to her because suddenly I was the man of the house but as I stood there steadfastly by her side and heard the jury say 'not guilty' I knew she'd been with another man the night of the killing. Stump drinks deeply once again.
C: COBB
D: A man must defend his mother at all times, isn't that right, Al? Or am I a fool?
C: STUMP
D: A man must defend his mother at all times.
C: COBB
D: That's what I thought... And the two men sit there silently, rocking slightly, trying to stay warm, when there is -- Suddenly a KNOCK at the door -- They stare at each other.
N: Cobb puts down the gun, struggles to the door and answers it. A MAN stands in the rain, carrying a briefcase, trying vainly to keep dry.
C: MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
D: Al Stump?
C: COBB
D: In here.
N: Cobb lets the man inside -- points to Stump in the chair.

D: But my wife and I are still talking?!
C: COBB
D: Yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you.'
C: STUMP
D: Fuck me? Well fuck her. No, fuck him. Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man.
C: STUMP
D: You ain't serving me no papers.
N: The Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the chair -- drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun.
C: MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
D: I'm just doing a job.
C: STUMP
D: I love my wife.
C: COBB
D: We all loved our wives, Al, that's got nothing to do with it.
C: MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
D: You'll find somebody else.
C: COBB
D: There's a million broads out there, Stumpy -- put down the gun.
N: KABLAM! Stump FIRES at the man but the shot goes wild. He's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking.
C: STUMP
D: I am not going to accommodate this man, Tyrus.
C: COBB
D: You're all mixed up. Give me the gun.
C: STUMP
D: You're absolutely right, Tyrus, I've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here. You've killed a man. I'll kill a man. KABLAM! KABLAM! He misses again.

N: The Man drops to his knees, begging for his life.

C: COBB
D: Al... no... Al... Al...
N: Stump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm. He aims the gun at the man's head, looks at Cobb with wild glee.
C: STUMP
D: Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends don't care what he says or does. You're my friend, Ty, right? You're my friend!
C: COBB
D: No! Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK. Empty.
N: As the Man looks up, realizing he's alive, Stump strikes him across the face with the gun, drawing blood. The Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room, grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door.
C: MAN WITH BRIEFCASE
D: You're crazy! No wonder she wants to divorce you! You're crazy! And the Man runs into the rainy night, leaving Cobb and Stump. Stump's head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered, exhausted. The two men sit alone for several beats before Stump speaks. He is completely lost.
C: STUMP
D: I almost killed a man.
C: COBB
D: A little drunken excess...
C: STUMP
D: No. I put a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger. I wanted to kill him.
C: COBB
D: It's forgotten already. I saw nothing. Nothing happened.
C: STUMP
D: Yes it did.
C: COBB
D: Al, listen to me.
E: MORE
C: COBB
D: If I was hired to write a biography of the greatest sportswriter of our time -- a biography of Al Stump -- would I include what happened tonight? Attorneys are pigs -- divorce attorneys are lower than pigs. What happened tonight was private. An intimacy. Your own business. Our own business. Nobody else's. It wouldn't belong in a book about greatness.
E: CONT'D
C: STUMP
D: Nobody's gonna write my biography.
C: COBB
D: And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you, I know what happened, Al. A warm summer breeze, the smell of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse -- you came to life again, you got hard -- and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear... it's okay, Al, it's okay... The brunette ain't gonna be in the book either... Stump looks up at Cobb but says nothing. He picks up a nearly-empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit.
E: beat
C: COBB
D: And the drinking? Well, they used to say ol' Ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now... no problem... and nobody's God damn business, either... Stump raises his hand, motioning Cobb to stop.
C: STUMP
D: I get it... I get it... A moment. A look.
C: COBB
D: Then get some sleep. You look pathetic.
N: Stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat. Cobb helps Stump lie down, pulling a blanket over him. Stump rolls over to go to sleep, Cobb tucks the blanket around him, and picks up the bottle from the pillow. Cobb takes a last hit of the bottle -- Finishing it off. He throws it to the ground, and looks around the room for another. COBB'S POV - STUMP'S SUITCASE lies open on a chair. A nearly-full bottle of Scotch is visible.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: He makes it to the bottle -- Steadies himself -- he's ex- hausted. He takes a deep swig from the Scotch. Several deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him steady himself. And he sees something in the suitcase -- He looks down at --
N: COBB'S POV - CARDBOARD BOX which Stump has been filling with his secret manuscript. BACK TO SCENE Cobb opens the box and pulls out a paper. He reads it. He looks at Stump, and -- Cobb takes the box and the bottle to the chair by the fireplace, where he sits down, puts on his reading glasses, and starts reading "the real story." CLOSE ON COBB He reads page one slowly and carefully, then starts mov- ing through the box full of odd sizes of paper, hotel stationery, cocktail napkins, legal pads, all handwritten in secret. He keeps glancing up at the bed where Stump is in the deep stupor of sleep.

D: You don't have a point of view, Stumpy, you ain't worth killing...
N: Cobb puts the gun into his own mouth -- He clears his throat, as if to make room for the gun barrel. He gags slightly and closes his eyes, he thinks for the last time.

Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive -- Aw, fuck it... little late for that sob sister stuff... Cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again. He grabs a hand towel and daubs his face with it. A bit more blood trickles from his mouth. And gradually a deep calm seems to settle over him.
E: beat
C: COBB
D: ... so this is what it feels like...
N: COBB returns to the bedroom and sits down on the edge of the bed, next to Stump who continues his deep, drunken sleep. Cobb picks up the phone and dials as he continues mopping his chin with the towel. He speaks with great calm.
C: COBB
D: Can you get me the Emory Hospital? Hello, Ma'am? This is Ty Cobb. Can you please prepare your finest room for me? Tomorrow morning would be fine.

S: INT. COBB'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

D: Hey, Stumpy, where you been? You can't believe the shit they call food in this joint. You get some sleep? Good. I had quite a read last night... A Nurse enters warily, but determined, with a small sy- ringe.

D: Come and get it. The Older Doctor turns and leaves. Stump enjoys the show.
