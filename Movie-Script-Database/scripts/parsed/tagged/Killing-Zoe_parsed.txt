S: INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY
N: Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport. Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab we hear the sounds of the airport: the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings. Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga". Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair. His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.
C: ZED
D: Hotel Mondial.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Le Mondial. Tres bien.
N: He starts driving.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause du 14 Juillet.
N: He drives for a while.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: [Do you mind the radio?]
N: Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away. He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: [Do you want me to turn the radio off?]
C: ZED
D: I don't speak French.
E: realizing he's being asked a question
N: The driver turns around.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Ah. American?
E: in broken English
C: ZED
D: That's right.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: That's good because I speak a little English.
N: Zed nods.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: I asked if you mind the radio. Music. You know.
N: Zed shakes his head "no".
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Super cool.
E: with a smile
N: Zed adjusts his watch.
C: ZED
D: What time is it?
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Time, time, time. I don't know. Daytime.
N: Zed forgets the adjustment for now.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Are you in town for business?
C: ZED
D: Yes.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: It's a nice hotel. Your hotel. Very big rooms.
N: He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Do you know Paris?
C: ZED
D: I've been here once before. When I was younger.
N: The cab driver smiles.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Those were the days.
N: They drive for a while.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Married?
C: ZED
D: I beg your pardon?
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Do you have a wife?
C: ZED
D: No. Why?
E: then after thinking about it for a while
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Well, if you need a wife for the night... Une escorte. Pour vous faire visiter. For business. I give you my number. Very nice girl. French. Like when you were young.
E: searching for the right words in French then back to his broken English
N: He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Know what I mean?
N: Zed smiles at this and nods.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: Speaks the language of love. Take you to heaven and back. You just tell me and I set it up.
N: Zed shakes his head and laughs.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: What you laughing at? You let Moises set it up. She treat you right. She treat you fine.
N: Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY
N: A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel. From around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag. Zed is right behind him. They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, walks into the room. He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room. Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.
C: BELLBOY
D: Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night.
E: in broken English
N: He points to the telephone.
C: BELLBOY
D: Ah...telephone, for the room service.
N: He motions toward the bathroom.
C: BELLBOY
D: The toilet.
N: He opens the closet door.
C: BELLBOY
D: To hang the clothes.
N: He points to a control console next to the bed.
C: BELLBOY
D: From here you can operate the television.
N: Then he pauses at the door before he goes out. Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, he starts fingering through it. Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which bills to give him.
C: BELLBOY
D: Merci.
E: after getting what he wanted
N: He starts to leave.
C: ZED
D: Oh, wait.
N: The bellboy turns around.
C: ZED
D: What time is it?
C: BELLBOY
D: What time is it?
E: confused
C: ZED
D: Time.
E: pointing at his watch
C: BELLBOY
D: Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures moins dix.
N: The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door. Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed. Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package. Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table. He is asleep.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY
N: Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in. Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package. Inside of it is a black steel briefcase. The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it. On the bedside table we see Zed's watch. It reads 12:10 P.M. Next to it is the phone. Next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads: 45.63.53.37.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY
N: Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body. He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits some out with a spurt. Then he stops, attentive, listening for something. He turns the shower off. Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
N: Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower. He makes his way toward the knocking.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist. He opens it. In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than twenty. She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.
C: ZOEY
D: Bonjour.
C: ZED
D: Bonjour.
E: a little awkwardly
N: Zed opens up the door and lets her in. She checks out the room and places her bag on the bed. Then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city.
C: ZOEY
D: Wow. Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.
N: She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room.
C: ZOEY
D: Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. Toute la nuit pour 700. D'avance. Et faudra porter un--
C: ZED
D: I...don't speak French.
N: She blows a bubble.
C: ZOEY
D: It's okay.
N: She takes a seat on the bed.
C: ZOEY
D: It will be one thousand francs for all night. In advance.
N: Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.
C: ZOEY
D: We can do it now if you want.
C: ZED
D: Well, let me just dry up.
C: ZOEY
D: Okay, but it's not necessary.
N: He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself. She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console. A French talk show comes on. She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu". She smiles and sits back to watch.
C: ZED
D: What's your name?
E: O.S. from the bathroom
C: ZOEY
D: Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.
C: ZED
D: My name's Zed.
E: O.S.
C: ZOEY
D: That's funny. We both have Z names.
E: smiling at this
N: Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair. His pants are on.
C: ZED
D: What was that?
N: She notices his pants.
C: ZOEY
D: You can take those off. The pants.
C: ZED
D: I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
C: ZOEY
D: Alright.
E: matter-of-factly
N: She stands up and starts to lift her top off. He stops her.
C: ZED
D: Slower.
N: He lays down on the bed. She stands there looking at him and then smiles.
C: ZOEY
D: Alright Mister America. Zed.
N: Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.
C: ZOEY
D: Slow enough for you?
N: Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants. She removes the pants and climbs on top of him. They begin to make love. On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays. Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion. She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp. An IMAGE overcomes her mind. They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied. She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.
C: ZOEY
D: C'etait formidable.
N: She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten. They rest there for a while...holding each other.
C: ZOEY
D: I'm cold.
N: She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.
C: ZOEY
D: Zed?
C: ZED
D: Yes?
C: ZOEY
D: Moises told me you were in town for business.
C: ZED
D: Yes.
C: ZOEY
D: What kind of business?
C: ZED
D: Why?
C: ZOEY
D: I don't know. I'm just curious.
C: ZED
D: Do you ask all your clients questions?
C: ZOEY
D: No. Just the ones I like.
C: ZED
D: So you like me?
C: ZOEY
D: Yes.
C: ZED
D: Why?
C: ZOEY
D: Because you're...a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.
C: ZED
D: How do you know I'm a good person?
C: ZOEY
D: Body language. We fit together.
C: ZED
D: All men and women fit together. Hell, even some men fit together.
C: ZOEY
D: No, but you know, we clicked. You made me orgasm. Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?
C: ZED
D: No I don't.
C: ZOEY
D: Usually never. They're almost always fat like pigs.
N: Zed laughs at this.
C: ZOEY
D: And you make me feel safe. That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.
C: ZED
D: I never really thought of it like that.
C: ZOEY
D: Well, it's true.
N: Zed nods at this.
C: ZOEY
D: Turn off the television.
N: Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.
C: ZOEY
D: So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much.
C: ZED
D: Well, I like you too Zoe.
C: ZOEY
D: Honest?
N: He nods.
C: ZOEY
D: Why? For the same reason? Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.
N: Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.
C: ZED
D: Well, I like your honesty. You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.
N: She doesn't like the sound of this. She slaps him.
C: ZOEY
D: I am not a prostitute!
N: Zed is a little surprised at this.
C: ZED
D: Really? Can I have my francs back then?
C: ZOEY
D: I'm a student. And to pay for the classes I became an escort. It's my choice to sleep with you.
C: ZED
D: I see.
C: ZOEY
D: What? You don't understand.
C: ZED
D: No, I do.
C: ZOEY
D: Hey, it's not easy.
C: ZED
D: I didn't say it was.
C: ZOEY
D: I'm here because I want to.
C: ZED
D: Okay, okay relax. What school do you go to?
C: ZOEY
D: The Centre du Art, Paris.
C: ZED
D: That's really interesting. What kind of art do you study?
C: ZOEY
D: Not any of the old shit.
C: ZED
D: Oh.
C: ZOEY
D: I have a day job too. Three times a week.
N: She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed.
C: ZOEY
D: But someday there will be only my art.
C: ZED
D: What kind of things do you paint?
C: ZOEY
D: I don't paint. I make things. Objects. Not like sculpture. Like life...but with no narrative. I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world. Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny. Those are left for me. They belong only to me. If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine. I have failed. And I would destroy it. I don't care how much cash they would offer me. It would be shit. I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed. They told too much about me. And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself. The way I'm telling you.
N: She looks back at him.
C: ZOEY
D: What I do I do only for the objects.
C: ZED
D: I'd like to see one of these.
C: ZOEY
D: What? So you could see the work of a whore?
N: He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.
C: ZED
D: Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute. I didn't understand the difference.
C: ZOEY
D: The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.
N: He gives her a kiss.
C: ZED
D: If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.
C: ZOEY
D: If I do...you'll never know which one it is. Because I'll be the only one who understands. I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.
N: Zed is unable to speak. They look into each others eyes for a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window. Then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zed is asleep. Zoey is asleep in his arms. There is a knocking at the door. Zed opens his eyes. The knock becomes a pound. Zed gets up and puts on his pants. Zoey gets up and looks around.
C: ZOEY
D: What time is it?
E: groggily
C: ZED
D: I have no idea. Night time.
N: There is more pounding on the door.
C: ZOEY
D: I'm going to take a shower.
N: She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower. Zed walks over to the door and opens it up. Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age wearing baggy French-style clothes.
C: ERIC
D: Hey you madman!
E: with a thick accent
N: Zed's happy to see him.
C: ZED
D: Eric. Come in.
N: They hug.
C: ERIC
D: What happened to you? I thought you were going to call.
N: Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love making around the room.
C: ERIC
D: Oh I see. You have been busy.
E: smiling
C: ZED
D: Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a wake up call.
C: ERIC
D: That's good, but now I am here. So let's go. We have a lot to talk about.
C: ZED
D: What about the girl?
C: ERIC
D: Is she your girlfriend?
C: ZED
D: No.
C: ERIC
D: Fuck her.
N: He peeks into the bathroom.
C: ERIC
D: She's a dishrag whore. Kick her out.
C: ZED
D: I'll let her stay here tonight.
C: ERIC
D: Don't be silly. It's dangerous.
N: Eric walks into the bathroom.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door. Zoey is obviously surprised to see him.
C: ERIC
D: [Okay. Get out of the shower. It's time for you to leave.]
E: in French with English subtitles
C: ZOEY
D: [Fuck you.]
N: Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.
C: ERIC
D: [No. Come on you fucking slut!]
N: She shrieks.
C: ZOEY
D: [Let go of me you shit!!]
N: He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zed can't believe this.
C: ZED
D: Eric.
C: ERIC
D: Don't worry about her. [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!]
E: to Zed to Zoey in French
N: She bites his hand. He yells in pain.
C: ERIC
D: God damn it!
N: He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.
C: ERIC
D: [Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore!]
N: He opens the door and throws her into the hall.
S: INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT
N: Naked, Zoey falls into the hall. Eric slams the door shut. She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds on the door.
C: ZOEY
D: [Give me my clothes you asshole!]
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: She is pounding on the door.
C: ERIC
D: God damn it. Look at my hand.
E: looking at his hand wound
C: ZED
D: Jesus Eric.
E: shocked at the whole incident
C: ZOEY
D: Ouvres! Je veux mes habits!
E: O.S.
N: Eric listens.
C: ERIC
D: Oh shit. Her clothes.
N: He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at him.
C: ZOEY
D: Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?
E: almost too quick to understand
C: ERIC
D: La ferme!
N: He slams the door shut. Then he turns to Zed.
C: ERIC
D: So tell me, what have you been up to?
N: Zed sits down on the bed.
C: ZOEY
D: Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!
E: O.S.
C: ZED
D: Eric, I liked that girl.
C: ERIC
D: Oh. Well, then why didn't you stop me.
C: ZED
D: Because you were on a rampage.
C: ERIC
D: Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores. A girl like that will give you AIDS. Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs?
C: ZED
D: Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it.
C: ERIC
D: Just use your hand like me.
C: ZED
D: Sometimes you just need honesty...and security.
C: ERIC
D: I don't understand. Anyway, it's too late. Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys.
C: ZED
D: Okay, let me take a shower.
C: ERIC
D: No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking. It will make them respect you.
C: ZED
D: Oh.
C: ERIC
D: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.
N: Zed starts to get dressed
S: EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
N: The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue Soufflot is bustling. Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
S: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in Eric's car. The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio.
C: ERIC
D: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
C: ZED
D: Years.
C: ERIC
D: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.
C: ZED
D: Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states.
C: ERIC
D: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came. That's good.
C: ZED
D: How could I resist your invitation?
C: ERIC
D: You would have been stupid to.
C: ZED
D: So what have you been doing here?
C: ERIC
D: After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The newspaper.
C: ZED
D: Really?
C: ERIC
D: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like terrorists.
N: Zed looks over at him.
C: ERIC
D: It's fun.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where Eric's flat is. On the top landing there is a dead cat laying. Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the door. There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.
C: ERIC
D: The people next door are on holiday. We took their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.
C: ZED
D: Is that cat dead?
C: ERIC
D: I don't know. I think it's asleep but it's been there for days.
N: Eric gives it a kick. No response.
C: ERIC
D: I guess it is dead.
N: They walk into the flat.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster. Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing. Sitting at the table playing cards are three men: FRANCOIS, RICARDO, and JEAN. Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE and OLIVER. They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.
C: ERIC
D: Hello.
N: They all return the greeting.
C: ERIC
D: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude. Got it?
E: to Zed
C: ZED
D: I will.
C: ERIC
D: They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa salauds. Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.
E: to the rest of them
N: Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.
C: OLIVER
D: Zed, would you like a beer?
E: with an English accent
C: ZED
D: Thanks.
C: OLIVER
D: Don't think of it.
C: CLAUDE
D: Come. Sit down.
E: to Zed
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The kitchen is an absolute pig stye. Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter. Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude. Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes. Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.
C: CLAUDE
D: Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to claim you.
E: to Zed
N: Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder.
C: CLAUDE
D: Let me introduce you properly. This is Enrique.
N: The monkey screeches.
C: CLAUDE
D: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like...do we?
N: Again, the hideous creature screeches.
C: CLAUDE
D: Tais-toi! Do you like hash?
E: to Enrique then to Zed
N: Then Eric interrupts.
C: ERIC
D: Don't sit next to that junkie.
E: jokingly
C: CLAUDE
D: Ahhhhhh!
N: Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks. They laugh.
C: ERIC
D: That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums. Next time he's out the door. Zed, come here.
E: to Claude to Zed
N: Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom. On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer.
C: OLIVER
D: Here you go mate.
C: ZED
D: Thanks.
N: Oliver sits down next to Claude.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But, there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.
C: ERIC
D: Don't ask me where we got this.
C: ZED
D: Okay.
C: ERIC
D: On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.
N: He places his hand on the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
N: Zed smiles.
C: ERIC
D: We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
N: Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.
C: ERIC
D: As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him. Then we can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed.
E: he hands it to Zed he points it out on the blueprint
C: ZED
D: Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
E: turning the schematic around
C: ERIC
D: Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don't worry about that.
N: He points to the main floor vault.
C: ERIC
D: Here. This is where they keep the days reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
N: He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.
C: ZED
D: What kind of vault is that?
N: He checks the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: Ah...Swiss made. A Caliber.
C: ZED
D: Caliber? It'll take three hours.
E: he thinks about it
C: ERIC
D: No, that's too long.
C: ZED
D: That's how long it'll take.
C: ERIC
D: Well shit. It's too long. We have to be in and out. Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and...
E: he snaps his fingers
N: He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."
C: ZED
D: Well hold on a second. What's this?
E: pointing to the blueprint
N: Eric looks down at the blueprint. There is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.
C: ERIC
D: Another vault.
C: ZED
D: No this.
N: Eric looks closely at the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: I don't know...it connects the two vaults.
C: ZED
D: Well, what kind of vault is this other one?
C: ERIC
D: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
E: reading the blueprint
C: ZED
D: Why would those two vaults be connected?
C: ERIC
D: I don't know.
C: ZED
D: Because I can get into this vault in half an hour. Maybe less.
C: ERIC

N: EXTREME CLOSE ON: Eric making heroin. The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water. Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.
C: OLIVER
D: You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain.
E: so high he's wobbling
N: No one is really listening to Oliver. Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil.
C: OLIVER
D: Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer. He drifts between the two. Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes.

D: [Cotton.]
N: Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.

C: ERIC
D: [Here, shut up and hold this.]
E: to Oliver
N: He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle. Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe. Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

N: They all laugh at this.

C: ZED
D: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
N: Jean and Claude laugh at this.
C: JEAN
D: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right.
N: Jean snorts a line. Claude offers Zed the spliff. Zed shakes his head "no".
C: CLAUDE
D: Okay.
C: JEAN
D: That's good.
E: recovering from the snort
N: Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing. Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed. Francois sits on the floor. Eric rolls up his sleeve.
C: ERIC
D: [Hold my arm.] My vein is like a rock.
E: to Ricardo in French then to Zed
N: Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes. Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood. It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in. He withdraws the needle. Ricardo lets go of his arm. Eric is in bliss. His eyes roll back into his head. He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. Then Jean takes another snort. Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it.
C: JEAN
D: Try some. It's called chasing the dragon. The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.
E: to Zed
C: ZED
D: I don't think so.
C: JEAN
D: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.
N: They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face. They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter. Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke. Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio.
C: ERIC
D: There. That's Notre Dame.
N: But before Zed can even look it has past by.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
N: Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar. Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing. An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club. Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics. ON STAGE a BAND is playing away. In the audience sit about TWELVE FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music. AT THE BUFFET In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it. Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and JOSEPHINE. Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine. Eric hands them some money. ZED'S TABLE Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club. Oliver sits next to Zed.
C: OLIVER
D: So, how long have you known Eric?
C: ZED
D: Well, Eric's mother is American.
C: OLIVER
D: Yeah, and his dad's French.
C: ZED
D: They're divorced. And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up. So every six months he would come back to the states. We were best friends. Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been...years.
C: OLIVER
D: Well, it's good to have you here. Eric speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films.
C: ZED
D: Well...I suppose. I used to be, when I was young.
C: OLIVER
D: Oh they're the best. Helmets with horns on them. Shit. That's fucking genius.
N: He starts laughing.
C: OLIVER
D: How 'bout Toy Jazz? You like it?
N: Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.
C: ZED
D: Yeah...I guess.
C: OLIVER
D: I love it. It's really good, you know? Like real music. It has a heart and culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.
C: ZED
D: Yeah.
C: OLIVER
D: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
N: Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine.
C: CLAUDE
D: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
N: He pours Zed a glass. Oliver passes on the wine.
C: OLIVER
D: Non merci, c'est de la merde.
E: to Claude
C: CLAUDE
D: La ferme. C'est du bon vin. The fucking English.
E: to Oliver to Zed
N: Zed sips some. He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not. ON STAGE Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. The band stands up. IN THE AUDIENCE The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything. ZED'S TABLE Suddenly, Zed notices something... ON STAGE Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band. ZED'S TABLE Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
C: OLIVER
D: Look at him. He's crazy.
N: ON STAGE And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good. Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment. ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown. Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician. The set is over. Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting.
S: EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
N: The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue Soufflot is bustling. Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
S: INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
N: Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in Eric's car. The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio.
C: ERIC
D: I'm glad you came. How long has it been?
C: ZED
D: Years.
C: ERIC
D: It's amazing, you know? Here you are. One day in America. Now here.
C: ZED
D: Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states.
C: ERIC
D: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came. That's good.
C: ZED
D: How could I resist your invitation?
C: ERIC
D: You would have been stupid to.
C: ZED
D: So what have you been doing here?
C: ERIC
D: After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The newspaper.
C: ZED
D: Really?
C: ERIC
D: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like terrorists.
N: Zed looks over at him.
C: ERIC
D: It's fun.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where Eric's flat is. On the top landing there is a dead cat laying. Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the door. There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.
C: ERIC
D: The people next door are on holiday. We took their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.
C: ZED
D: Is that cat dead?
C: ERIC
D: I don't know. I think it's asleep but it's been there for days.
N: Eric gives it a kick. No response.
C: ERIC
D: I guess it is dead.
N: They walk into the flat.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in. The room itself is a general mess. A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster. Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing. Sitting at the table playing cards are three men: FRANCOIS, RICARDO, and JEAN. Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE and OLIVER. They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.
C: ERIC
D: Hello.
N: They all return the greeting.
C: ERIC
D: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude. Got it?
E: to Zed
C: ZED
D: I will.
C: ERIC
D: They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa salauds. Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.
E: to the rest of them
N: Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.
C: OLIVER
D: Zed, would you like a beer?
E: with an English accent
C: ZED
D: Thanks.
C: OLIVER
D: Don't think of it.
C: CLAUDE
D: Come. Sit down.
E: to Zed
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The kitchen is an absolute pig stye. Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter. Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it. He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude. Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes. Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.
C: CLAUDE
D: Easy. Don't scare him. He just wants to claim you.
E: to Zed
N: Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder.
C: CLAUDE
D: Let me introduce you properly. This is Enrique.
N: The monkey screeches.
C: CLAUDE
D: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like...do we?
N: Again, the hideous creature screeches.
C: CLAUDE
D: Tais-toi! Do you like hash?
E: to Enrique then to Zed
N: Then Eric interrupts.
C: ERIC
D: Don't sit next to that junkie.
E: jokingly
C: CLAUDE
D: Ahhhhhh!
N: Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks. They laugh.
C: ERIC
D: That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums. Next time he's out the door. Zed, come here.
E: to Claude to Zed
N: Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom. On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer.
C: OLIVER
D: Here you go mate.
C: ZED
D: Thanks.
N: Oliver sits down next to Claude.
S: INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Eric's bed has probably never been made. In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment. But, there is a certain order to all this chaos. Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.
C: ERIC
D: Don't ask me where we got this.
C: ZED
D: Okay.
C: ERIC
D: On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.
N: He places his hand on the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day. Yes?
N: Zed smiles.
C: ERIC
D: We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
N: Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.
C: ERIC
D: As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him. Then we can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed.
E: he hands it to Zed he points it out on the blueprint
C: ZED
D: Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
E: turning the schematic around
C: ERIC
D: Ahhh! He's right next to the door. We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don't worry about that.
N: He points to the main floor vault.
C: ERIC
D: Here. This is where they keep the days reserve cash. Okay fuck that.
N: He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.
C: ZED
D: What kind of vault is that?
N: He checks the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: Ah...Swiss made. A Caliber.
C: ZED
D: Caliber? It'll take three hours.
E: he thinks about it
C: ERIC
D: No, that's too long.
C: ZED
D: That's how long it'll take.
C: ERIC
D: Well shit. It's too long. We have to be in and out. Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and...
E: he snaps his fingers
N: He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."
C: ZED
D: Well hold on a second. What's this?
E: pointing to the blueprint
N: Eric looks down at the blueprint. There is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.
C: ERIC
D: Another vault.
C: ZED
D: No this.
N: Eric looks closely at the blueprint.
C: ERIC
D: I don't know...it connects the two vaults.
C: ZED
D: Well, what kind of vault is this other one?
C: ERIC
D: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
E: reading the blueprint
C: ZED
D: Why would those two vaults be connected?
C: ERIC
D: I don't know.
C: ZED
D: Because I can get into this vault in half an hour. Maybe less.
C: ERIC
D: But this entry way is too small to get the platen out. We have a lot of merchandise in there.
C: ZED
D: No, don't you see? We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.

D: I love it. It's really good, you know? Like real music. It has a heart and culture all it's own. It's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.
C: ZED
D: Yeah.
C: OLIVER
D: Hungry cannibals'd like it.
N: Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine.
C: CLAUDE
D: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
N: He pours Zed a glass. Oliver passes on the wine.
C: OLIVER
D: Non merci, c'est de la merde.
E: to Claude
C: CLAUDE
D: La ferme. C'est du bon vin. The fucking English.
E: to Oliver to Zed
N: Zed sips some. He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not. ON STAGE Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. The band stands up. IN THE AUDIENCE The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything. ZED'S TABLE Suddenly, Zed notices something... ON STAGE Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band. ZED'S TABLE Zed blinks but it's true. Oliver and Claude start laughing.
C: OLIVER
D: Look at him. He's crazy.
N: ON STAGE And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good. Eric is all smile as he plays with them. Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment. ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown. Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician. The set is over. Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting.

C: SUB LOBBY TELLER
D: [Do the phones work?]
E: to assistant
C: SUB LOBBY ASSISTANT
D: [They went dead.]
C: SUB LOBBY TELLER
D: Merde!
N: They walk out into the sub lobby.
S: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
N: The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager start coming down the stairs. At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager. Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck.
C: ERIC
D: [Drop the gun!]
E: to the guard
N: He doesn't.
C: ERIC
D: [Drop your gun now and nobody dies!]
N: After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the floor.
C: ERIC
D: [Good boy.]
N: They descend down the stairs into the sub lobby. Oliver takes his gun.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - LOBBY - DAY
N: Francois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone behind the teller windows. Claude is on his way downstairs.
C: CLAUDE

D: [Now! On the ground! Face down!]
E: to the people
N: Then, for effect, he kicks a man.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - SUB LOBBY - DAY
N: Claude comes downstairs with his gun raised.
C: CLAUDE
D: [All clear down here?]
N: Everyone turns.
C: ERIC
D: [Take these two upstairs. And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut.]
N: Oliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby assistant toward Claude. Then he hands him a chain. Claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm.
C: CLAUDE
D: [The phones and video are down! We're locked up tight!] We fucking did it!
E: then in English
N: He takes the two upstairs. Eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager.
C: ERIC
D: [Any others I should worry about?]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [No.]
C: ERIC
D: [Well, just to be sure--]
E: to Oliver
N: Then, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard. All eyes turn to it. Oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in. The stodgy customer is kneeling in it. He instantly holds his hands high.
C: OLIVER
D: [Freeze motherfucker!]
N: Eric walks up, gun in hand.
C: ERIC
D: [Who the fuck are you?]
C: STODGY CUSTOMER
D: [Please don't shoot me!]
C: OLIVER
D: [On the ground!]
N: He does.
C: ERIC
D: [Making a deposit I hope.] [Bring him with us.]
E: to the bank manager he smiles to Oliver
N: They all make their way down through the sub lobby hall.
S: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
N: They're herding the men through the hall.
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [Vault locked?]
E: to the sub lobby teller
C: SUB LOBBY TELLER
D: [Yes.]
C: ERIC
D: [Shut your fucking mouths!]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [The vault doors are shut and time locked. You won't be able to open them.]
E: to Eric
N: They walk through a doorway into the storage/elevator area.
S: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
N: Eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway.
C: ERIC
D: [You think we're fucking amateurs? You think we're stupid? I've got news for you...we planned ahead my friend!]
E: to the bank manager
N: Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door.
C: ERIC
D: [Now save us a lot of time and just open the vault.]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [No.]
C: ERIC
D: [Okay.]
N: He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his handgun into the sub level tellers mouth.
C: ERIC
D: [Open the vault.]
N: The teller's eyes widen.
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [I cannot.]
C: ERIC
D: [Oh.] [Can you?]
E: to the teller
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [No. Once closed only I can open it.]
C: ERIC
D: [Then open it.]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [I cannot.]
N: The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager. Zed is watching the whole affair nervously.
C: ERIC
D: [Do you understand that I'll kill her if you don't open this fucking vault?]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [Do you understand that this is an international reserve bank? Robbing it is punishable by life imprisonment.]
N: Eric fires. The back of the sub lobby teller's head paints the wall red.
C: ZED
D: Jesus fucking Christ!
N: The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed. He knows he's an American. The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground. Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his temple.
C: ERIC
D: [Open the vault door or I'll kill this man next.]
N: The bank manager is freaking out, but after what was probably the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his ground.
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [I still cannot open the vault.]
C: ERIC
D: [Come on. It's only things in there. This man is flesh and blood.]
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [I will not open the vault.]
C: ZED
D: Eric no! I can open the vault!
C: ERIC
D: Shut the fuck up! [You're a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you. Do you have a family?]
E: then to the stodgy customer
N: He nods his head "yes".
C: ERIC
D: [Would you like to see them again?]
N: He nods his head again.
C: ERIC
D: [This man has a family he would like to have Bastille day dinner with tonight. So save us some time and open the vault.]
E: to the manager
N: After losing about a pound of sweat...
C: BANK MANAGER
D: [No.]
N: Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and fires two shots into the bank manager's face. The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the floor.
C: ERIC
D: Fucking idiot. [You seem like a nice man. Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family.]
E: then to the stodgy customer
N: He starts nodding his head.
C: STODGY CUSTOMER
D: Oui.
C: ERIC
D: [Take him upstairs.]
E: to Oliver
N: Oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people. Eric rips off his mask.
C: ERIC
D: Don't you ever conflict with me during work again! Do you hear!?
N: Zed off his clown mask.
C: ZED
D: You didn't have to shoot any of them!
C: ERIC
D: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in charge now. Nobody told me. If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour.
E: patronizing his temper flares
N: He charges into the reserve vault area.
S: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
N: They enter and Eric walks up to a bathroom door.
C: ZED
D: Eric. It's just that we've gone from being thieves to murderers.
C: ERIC
D: Oh fuck it doesn't matter! Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank.
C: ZED
D: I thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980?
C: ERIC
D: Ohhhh! That's what they tell you! But who cares? I need to take a piss.
N: Eric enters the bathroom.
C: ERIC
D: Why don't you open the vault?
E: on his way into the bathroom
N: Zed looks at the bathroom door close. After a fuming pause he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door.
T: CUT TO:

N: Francois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to the outside.
C: FRANCOIS
D: [Looks clear.]
N: In the meantime, behind the teller windows guarding the people who are laying on the floor, Jean and Ricardo are in the middle of a conversation. Oliver is sitting on the counter, having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs. Also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby guard #2.
C: JEAN
D: [What do you mean you're not sure if the alarm went off or not?]
C: RICARDO
D: [I mean I'm not sure.]
C: JEAN
D: [Well, either it did or it didn't.]
C: RICARDO
D: [And I'm not sure.]

D: [Well what kind of a fucking guess is that? You're saying it could have.]
C: RICARDO
D: [Yes.]
C: JEAN
D: [Well that's fucking great. Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with. I knew I should have been the one to kill him. You're always so damn slow.]

N: In the meantime Zoey is on the floor, unsure of what is going on.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
N: Zed opens up his steel briefcase. Inside of it are all sorts of electronic gear and tools. He takes out a tape measure and some callipers and measures out a point on the vault door. He marks the point with a piece of chalk.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: In one of the stalls Eric is preparing a syringe. He has just cooked the heroin and is now tapping on it to get the bubbles out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BANK - MEN'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Eric readies the needle and slaps his vein. He is shaking but trying to remain as still as possible. He places the needle at the end of a track on his arm and inserts it.

N: Zed starts drilling into the point he marked with the chalk on the vault door.

N: Zoey looks at all the people sitting around her. They're all scared. Jean, Ricardo, and Francois are talking amongst themselves.
C: JEAN
D: [Do you know one?]
E: in French to Ricardo
C: RICARDO
D: [Let's see. Okay. An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery. All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.]
N: Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.
C: RICARDO
D: [The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town. Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]
N: Jean is already laughing.
C: RICARDO
D: [I'm not done. Listen. "Where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days."]
N: Zoey glances at all of the people. Then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard.
C: RICARDO
D: ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!"]
N: The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.
C: RICARDO
D: ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "I'll see what I can do." So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]
N: Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it. His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it. Her eyes widen.
C: RICARDO
D: [After a little while, he came across a piece of egg. "That's funny," he thought to himself, "I don't think I had egg for breakfast." But he spat it out and kept eating away. Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth. "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn. "What is this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be sick."]
N: The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety. Zoey knows he's going to make his move.
C: RICARDO
D: ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what the last guy said."]
N: Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the .38 and fires three shots. Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest. He falls to the ground. The other hits Francois in the arm. In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor. Everyone is screaming and trying to get away. Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead. Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, killing them all. People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the ceiling.
C: CLAUDE
D: [No one fucking moves!]
N: Jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people.

D: [Nobody fucking moves! Nobody fucking moves!]
N: Claude motions to the dead security guard.
C: CLAUDE
D: [The gun! Somebody get it!]
N: Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time waving his gun at people.
C: OLIVER
D: [Don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with me!]
N: He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip. Eric storms in. He isn't wearing his mask.
C: ERIC
D: [What the fuck is going on!?]
N: Zoey notices Eric, she remembers him.
C: OLIVER
D: [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]
E: pointing at the dead man
N: Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage. Then everybody notices he isn't wearing a mask.
C: JEAN
D: [Eric, your mask.]
E: quietly
C: ERIC
D: Oh shit.
N: Then Oliver yanks his off.
C: OLIVER
D: Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway! I can't see a fucking think in this!
N: Everyone takes their masks off.
C: ERIC
D: [Is this what happens? Is this what happens when I walk away for five minutes?]
C: CLAUDE
D: [He had a hidden gun.]
C: ERIC
D: [He had a hidden gun.] [I don't care!]
E: mimicking a little child then back to normal
N: Then, one of the bank customers, a MALE TOURIST, speaks up.
C: MALE TOURIST
D: This is insane! I am a U.S. citizen! You must let me go!
E: holding up his passport
N: Eric looks at him.
C: MALE TOURIST
D: I'm an American! American! I'm just here exchanging dollars. If it wasn't for my country you'd all be speaking German!
N: Eric is tired of this outburst, he shoots him. Everyone screams.
C: ERIC
D: [I have had enough of this nonsense! The next person that speaks will die!]
E: to the people
N: Everyone is quiet. Francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm.
C: JEAN
D: [Eric, I'm sorry. Things got out of hand. But we're in control now.]
C: ERIC
D: [Good. Let's try to keep it that way. God what a mess.]
C: CLAUDE
D: Eric
C: ERIC
D: [What the fuck is it now!? You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss?]
C: CLAUDE
D: [I have a question.]
C: ERIC
D: [What?]
C: CLAUDE
D: [Do we know if the alarm went off or not?]
C: ERIC
D: [Yes.]
C: CLAUDE
D: [We do?]
C: ERIC
D: [Yes. It didn't go off. If it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked. But they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked. So if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions I'll go downstairs and see if we're in yet. Is that okay with you?]
N: Claude nods. Then, the phone rings. Everyone looks at it.
C: ERIC
D: [I thought the phones were dead.]
N: It rings again.
C: OLIVER
D: The phones are dead.
N: Eric grabs a WOMAN TELLER who is crying hysterically and lifts her to her feet. He drags her to the ringing phone.
C: ERIC
D: [Answer it!]
N: She is crying too hard. Eric puts his gun to her head.
C: ERIC
D: [Answer it or you will die.]
N: She slowly picks up the phone.
C: WOMAN TELLER
D: Banque Internationale de Paris.
E: answering phone through tears
N: She pauses, then hands the phone to Eric.
C: WOMAN TELLER
D: [It's for you.]
N: Eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor. He puts the receiver to his ear.
C: ERIC
D: [Hello.] [Who is this?]
E: into phone pause
N: Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows. Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds.
C: OLIVER
D: Oh my God! The police!
C: ERIC
D: [What do you want?]
E: into phone
N: Eric looks around at the dead bodies.
C: ERIC
D: [We're all fine in here.]
E: into phone
N: Oliver is pacing back and forth wildly. He starts loading extra ammo into his weapon.
C: ERIC
D: [No. I'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig. You send anyone near this building and I'll kill the first person I lay my hands on. I've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.] [Just stay put. We'll call you when we're ready. In the mean time, have a nice day.]
E: into phone pause
N: Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.
C: CLAUDE
D: [The silent alarm must have gone off after all!]
C: ERIC
D: [Shut the fuck up! The alarm didn't do shit. For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here. Anyhow it doesn't matter. Nothing has changed.]
C: JEAN
D: [My God! The police! What are we going to do?]
C: ERIC
D: [Nothing. We don't have to do anything. The plan stays the same, just slightly different.]
N: Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock. Eric smiles and winks. Then he turns to Jean with a whisper.
C: ERIC
D: [If the police decide to come in...kill them. And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else. This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]
N: Then he takes off downstairs, smiling. Jean is a little stumped.
S: INT. BANK - RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
N: As Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault area a look of intense concentration washes over his face. You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in his brain...the question is: are there any answers?
T: CUT TO:

E: turning to Eric
C: ERIC
D: Nothing. They were just scaring them.
C: ZED
D: Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?

D: Yes. They're assholes. Just having fun.
N: Zed looks into the hole. He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring.
C: ZED
D: Fucked up my drill bit.
C: ERIC
D: It's okay. You can buy another one.
N: Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the two prongs into the hole.
C: ZED
D: Cross your fingers.
N: Eric does. The volt meter's needle jumps.
C: ZED
D: Perfect.
C: ERIC
D: Excellent. What next?
C: ZED
D: We find the fuse box. It'll probably be upstairs.
N: Zed gets up.

D: It's okay. I'll find it for you.

D: No. I need to see it myself.
N: Zed jumps up and into the storage/elevator area with Eric close behind him.

S: INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY
N: Instead of walking upstairs, Zed finds the fuse box right in the next room.
C: ZED
D: Hold on. Here she is.
N: Eric is a bit relieved. Zed opens it up.
C: ZED
D: Let's see.
N: He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants.
C: ZED
D: Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and then back on when I call to you. Any other switch may set off the alarm.
N: Eric smirks.
C: ERIC
D: Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.
C: ZED
D: Got it?
E: serious
C: ERIC
D: Got it.
E: nodding
N: Zed goes back to the vaults.
S: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
N: Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a little gizmo from out of his briefcase. It is a little home- made black box with a series of LED's on it and two wires coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end. Three other wires are also coming out of it. He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them. He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself. The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt battery.
C: ZED
D: Come on sweetie don't fail me now.
N: He looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area.
C: ZED
D: Ready?!
E: calling to Eric
C: ERIC
D: Ready!
E: O.S. calling back
N: Zed turns on his little box, the LED's start flickering.
C: ZED
D: Now!
N: The lights go out and then back on. There is a whirring sound from the vault door. The LED's quickly go from red to green. There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.
C: ZED
D: Open seasame.
N: Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of the Poseidon vault. Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning.
C: ERIC
D: It worked!
N: He and Zed hug.
C: ERIC
D: Oh my God it worked!
N: Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting it to the main vault. It is covered by a small locked cage.
C: ZED
D: I can get through that lock in a minute.
C: ERIC
D: Then do it. We don't have all day.
N: Zed enters the Poseidon vault.
S: INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY
N: Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get him into the main vault. Eric is right behind him. Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock.
C: ZED
D: Dime store brand. Three minutes max.
C: ERIC
D: Good.
N: Then, there's a gunshot. The bullet comes from the Calibre vault through the window and almost hits Zed. Zed falls backwards onto the floor.
C: ZED
D: Fuck!
C: ERIC
D: Merde!
N: Then there's another gunshot. The bullet ricochets through the vault.
C: ZED
D: Jesus Christ!
N: Scrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of the Poseidon vault.
S: INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY
N: They take cover. Another shot is fired into the vault. Zed and Eric look into the vault.
C: ZED
D: Another security guard?
C: ERIC
D: Must be.
C: ZED
D: I think I stained my pants.
C: ERIC
D: Me too.
N: Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action.
C: OLIVER
D: What is it?! I came down to see how things were going and heard shots!
C: ERIC
D: Some asshole in the vault.
N: Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun.
C: OLIVER
D: We've got guns. Why don't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass! It's three against one! Let's give it the old--

D: [Hey you. Nice shooting. Play time's over. Why don't you throw out your gun?]
E: calling into the vault
C: VAULT GUARD #1
D: No!
E: O.S. calling from main vault
N: Oliver and Eric look at each other and smile.

D: [You'll have to!]
E: O.S.

E: quietly to Zed then to the guard
C: VAULT GUARD #1
D: [Look, don't take it personally. This is my job.]
E: O.S.
N: Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug. Then Eric sees something in Zed's briefcase. It looks like grey clay.
C: ERIC
D: [Then take a paid vacation. We won't tell if you won't.]
N: There is a pause. During this time Eric takes the clay and pushes a detonator into it.
C: ZED
D: What the Hell are you doing? Have you gone mad?
E: quietly
C: VAULT GUARD #1
D: [Sorry. I can't.]
E: O.S.

C: VAULT GUARD #1
D: [Okay.]
E: O.S.
N: Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric. Eric resists.
C: ZED
D: That's too much. It's dangerous.
E: holding his voice down
C: ERIC
D: I like danger. [Changed your mind yet?]
E: then to the guard
N: Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator. Zed and Oliver run for cover.
C: VAULT GUARD #1
D: [No. And I'm not going to. Why don't you just take the money from the other vaults?--]
E: O.S.
N: Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and makes a break for it. There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault. The walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window, blowing it open. The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent.

C: ZED
D: You asshole! You could have killed us all.
C: ERIC
D: But I didn't! Let's go check out the damage.
N: Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault. Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know what to think.
S: INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY
N: Eric laughs.
C: ERIC
D: Zed look!
N: He points to the caged window. It's been blown off it's hinges.
C: ERIC
D: I beat you! I opened it in under three minutes.
N: He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting passage into the Caliber vault. Zed, with his briefcase, follows.
C: ZED

E: to Oliver
C: OLIVER
D: Right. When you tell me, I'll open it up.

D: Right.
N: Zed crawls through the opening.
C: OLIVER
D: I'll be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me.
S: INT. CALIBER VAULT - DAY
N: The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it were blown up from the inside. On the floor is the still smoldering body of the security guard. The room is incredibly smokey. Zed squeezes through the opening. Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke with a brick sized bar of pure gold.
C: ERIC
D: Look at it! We're all rich!
N: The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked onto it. Eric starts laughing.
C: ERIC
D: We're rich!
N: Zed looks at him like he's crazy.
C: ERIC
D: We're rich!
C: ZED
D: We're not out of here yet.
C: ERIC
D: Yes but we're rich!
N: Zed takes a seat at the vault door. The backside of a vault door looks like an incredibly intricate clock. Zed removes the Plexiglass shielding.
C: ERIC
D: I'm going to show the others.
N: He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold. Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points.

N: Jean surveys the mess, the crying people.

N: They see the gold.

N: Eric slaps him across the face.
C: ERIC
D: [What are you doing Claude? Talking of all this false doubt. What do you think we're going to do?]
N: Claude is hurt, not physically but emotionally.
C: CLAUDE
D: [I don't know...not the original plan.]
C: ERIC
D: [Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough. And killing all these assholes-- [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of good now, is it?]
E: motioning to all the customers
C: CLAUDE
D: No.

N: Eric pats his shoulder.

D: [Claude, you are a mental giant. Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?]

D: [Okay.]
N: Eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs.

D: [I'm going to see how things are going.]

N: Eric is whistling while he walks, he pauses to perform a quick magic trick, then he continues.
S: INT. RESERVE VAULT AREA - DAY
N: Eric walks into the reserve vault area. He stops. He hears something. A scratching sound. He looks at it's source, TWO POLICEMEN, decked out in black flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a sewer manhole. Eric's eyes widen. He takes his silencer out of his coat and fixes it to his handgun. Then, like a man with intent to kill, he rapidly approaches them. The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see Eric fire into his chest. Then, Eric aims the gun into the tight crawlspace and fires into the other man. For safe measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway. He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other policeman into it. He then pushes a large utility wagon over the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.

N: Eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the stairs to the lobby.

D: [Eric! What are you doing?]
C: ERIC
D: [Clearing up the "how full of shit am I" question the cops are asking themselves right now.]
N: The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but Eric simply forces him along. Everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire from outside. They all scream. Eric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone.
C: ERIC
D: [Hello.] [Yes. I'll hold.] [I'm holding.]
E: into phone pause then to Claude
N: After a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end of the line.

Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.] [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people. Hear?] [No. None of that. We won't trade. That never works. Not in the movies, not in real life. Understand? We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city. And you're not going to follow us.] [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane? Us? No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you.

N: Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door. He glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a calculator. Then, there is a groaning sound. Zed, terrified, spins around. Another groaning sound. The vault security guard isn't dead. His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much alive. VAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...] Zed can't believe what he's seeing. He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind. VAULT GUARD #1 [I'm going to die...please hold my...hand. I don't...want to die...alone.] Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it. He gives it a nudge with his foot. The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever. Zed kneels down next to the body.
C: ZED
D: Are you still there?
N: Nothing. Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and checks for a pulse. Nothing. Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches. He has wired a battery to two leads. He takes out a wire
T: cutter and snips a wire.
N: There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks. Zed calls to Oliver from the passage.

D: [That's what you get!]
N: Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder.
C: CLAUDE
D: Eric.
N: Eric looks at him.

C: ERIC
D: [You fucking bitch!]
E: groaning
N: A few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's foot red. Eric lets go and falls to the ground. Claude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to what's going on. Zoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it. She showers the room with bullets. She starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude, Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages. Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up. Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot.

Then, her clip runs out. She sees Zed, their eyes lock. An IMAGE overcomes Zed. She runs down the stairs to the back.

N: Eric walks into the back office. The others look at each other. Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires. In the background the distinctive sound of European police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank. Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a bullhorn.

N: A single bullet passes through his torso. As Jean falls to the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling. Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man. From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold of Claude and wrestles him to the ground. The other customers start to flee for cover. Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and Claude. It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the upper hand.

N: Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching. Eric drops the gun but quickly whips out his knife. She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her shirt. Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back. Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back. Zoey falls to the floor.
C: ERIC
D: Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a sausage.
N: Zed is standing between Zoey and Eric.
C: ZED
D: Zoey, get out of here!

D: Did you see how she ran? Did you see how she ran? She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one. What do you say Zed?
N: He swipes again.
C: ERIC
D: I will kill you. And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here. I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed?
N: He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade. Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor. Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face. Eric reaches for the knife. Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric. Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair. She plunges her nails into his face.
C: ERIC
D: Fucking bitch!
N: Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath. Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes. Zed lets out a shrill scream. Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face. The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony. Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room. His body is a mass of bullet wounds.
C: OLIVER
D: Ox! Where is thy yoke!?
N: He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric. The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman could posses. He rolls over and throws Zoey off him. Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it. Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun. He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.
C: ERIC
D: Fuck both of you.
N: Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs. Eric turns back to them.
C: ERIC
D: Au revoir.
N: He aims to kill Zed.
C: ZOEY
D: No!
N: Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs. At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their guns. FRENCH POLICEMAN #1 [Stop!] Eric stops. It becomes quiet. Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun kick.
C: ERIC
D: I give you little kiss. Ciao.
N: He squeezes the trigger and... CLICK The police open fire with their French made assault machine guns and fill Eric with bullets. Instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red. The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed. An IMAGE overcomes Eric. Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of Zed. Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey. Zoey runs up to him and holds him.
