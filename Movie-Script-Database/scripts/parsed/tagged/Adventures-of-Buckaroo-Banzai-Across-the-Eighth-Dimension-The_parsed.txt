T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY 1
N: Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the operator lopsided...
C: NARRATOR
D: The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms. Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the project.
N: TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him...
C: NARRATOR
D: Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares himself anxious to work for the Allies. Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo." A tribute to his adopted homeland.

N: A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself:
C: NARRATOR
D: And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter.
N: The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian: 3
C: NARRATOR
D: Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced theoretical gravity catapult...
N: The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their instrument data, writing on a clipboard...
C: NARRATOR
D: Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion ...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.
N: ...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and mother exchange last-minute assurances... The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter...
S: EXT. SANDBAGS - DAY 5
N: ...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as... ...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT...
S: EXT. TEST SITE - DAY 6
N: ...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out... ...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!

D: Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
N: Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the sleek device...
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: I ran it through the centrifuge, but I came up blank. It's definitely dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than copper does.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Super performance organic material.
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way. However... ...notice...although certain components resist identification, it corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.
E: slipping in another slide
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Too closely. Gotta be more than sheer coincidence. Rawhide, you're keen on bugs. What do you think?
E: scrutinizing
N: Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...
C: RENO
D: Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo. Sam's with the Jet Car and she's under lock and key. He's retiming her valves.
N: Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now brought over the female reporter...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Not really. This is pretty important.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: She wants a picture.
N: Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks... ...the shutter clicking...another commotion in the hallway...the dressing room door opening to admit the club owner, ARTIE DUNCAN, a fifty-year-old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him on a herd of REPORTERS and FANS...
C: ARTIE DUNCAN
D: I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another band. I want some music outta you characters.
C: RENO
D: You want it, Artie? You got it.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: I look great. Let's rock 'n' roll.
N: A pair of no-nonsense BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS appearing to escort them on-stage...as Rawhide returns the spectroscope to Professor Hikita...
C: RAWHIDE
D: No question about it. Something very akin to arachnoid tissue. If I hadda guess? A mutated species.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 111
N: Buckaroo, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, and their two Blue Shield escorts hustling down a corridor.
S: INT. NIGHTCLUB STAGE - NIGHT 112
N: Our boys arriving on stage...SHADOWY FORMS in the dramatically murky light...a FAMILIAR VOICE BOOMING OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM...
C: ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
D: Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night only...the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong Cavaliers!
N: LIGHTS UP! AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still! ...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general raucous good will. She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do the job. She's all alone. She needs some help. Her name is PENNY PRIDDY. On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves the Cavaliers to cease as well. EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I heard somebody crying. I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?
E: no response
N: Yes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly: 115
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...
N: Buckaroo squints, spots her. His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Raise your hand...where?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: This is so embarrassing...
E: raising her hand
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Penny. I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
N: For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers... ...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at nonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Did you say..."Peggy"?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you. I'm a nobody.
N: The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing a bit more easily...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record. He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
E: blowing her nose
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: He offered you money?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Do I look like that kinda girl? I lost my room this morning. I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going. What the hell else can I do? I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
E: to tell the truth
N: A few snickers...BUCKAROO shooting a disapproving look at those guilty of laughing at another person's misfortune...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn. Believe me, I've been there.
N: Buckaroo moving to a piano...starting to play...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: My name's, Penny! But who cares?
E: exasperated
N: Buckaroo and his men start to SING ANOTHER TUNE...slower, sexier. ...and Penny opens HER BIG CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE, removes first a dog- earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai...then a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK, its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with HANOI SHAN, THE MANCHU TERROR! Penny lays both publications on the table, continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC PISTOL... ON STAGE...as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction... Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears starting to flood her eyes... BUCKAROO CROONING, all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry glance, his animal presence...a real heart-breaker. Penny takes another drink, wraps her hand around the tiny pearl handle...SLOWLY MOVING THE GUN... ON STAGE, Buckaroo startled... ...as in the blink of an eye Penny ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT HERSELF, her arm accidentally deflected by a passing WAITRESS, the SHOT going harmlessly into the ceiling as... ...the crack Hong Kong Cavaliers whip out their GUNS, snapping back hammers, forming a human barricade around Buckaroo... ...while BLUE SHIELD SECURITY MEN materialize and drag Penny screaming from the room.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Everybody okay up here?
C: ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
D: Arrest the girl! Let's get this thing on the road, huh?
N: The Cavaliers holstering their weapons, resuming musical postures...Buckaroo too...but his mind still half on Penny Priddy.
S: INT. CRIMINALLY INSANCE COORIDOR - NIGHT 128
N: Recreation time. SEVERAL MADMEN playing video games, content. Doctor Lizardo's Philco TV now sitting on a watch desk, the guard who took it eating dinner, leaning back in his chair, his feet on the set...so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture quality...as a SHADOW falls across him...Doctor Lizardo...pulling a RATTY SUITCASE on tiny travel wheels, wearing an ANCIENT SPORTJACKET. Out for a stroll?
C: GUARD
D: Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?
N: An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone...
C: DR. LIZARDO
D: Operator! I wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems. Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it's John Whorfin calling. That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H- N!
N: Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, reaching for the dead man's keys...
C: DR. LIZARDO
D: Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool! Prepare for my return! The time has come. Haven't you heard? Don't you watch TV? Banzai and Hikita have done it! I'll meet you at the factory. Get that overthruster! And the little Jap! Alive! Banzai's too dangerous.
E: into phone
N: Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the room... ...those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when they see that...Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by simply reaching out and... ...touching THE BUCKAROO BANZAI VIDEO GAME, instantly shorting it out on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow.
S: INT. BEDROOM ON BUS - DAY 131
N: CLOSE ON a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the amazing Jet Car test... ...and down in a lower corner, A PHOTOGRAPH OF "WOULD-BE-ASSASSIN" PENNY PRIDDY being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL... ...a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific books everywhere...Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy staring back at him...Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some kind of slide show...THE WHOLE ROOM SWAYING MYSTERIOUSLY... ...the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the floor...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Pick those up, Reno.
C: RENO
D: I didn't drop 'em.
N: ...Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over Buckaroo's shoulder...then returning to Reno...their voices low...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: It's a spittin' image.
C: RENO
D: Doesn't look anything like her to me.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Pictures don't lie.
C: RENO
D: Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: It's Peggy to these eyes. Same nose, same hair. Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
N: Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide appearing, offering a COMPUTER PRINT-OUT...
C: RAWHIDE
D: Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo? The one you did the brain scan on--? He killed a guard last night, broke outta the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled it a block away.
N: Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name Lizardo...taking the print-out.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Then what?
C: RAWHIDE
D: Vanished. Thin air.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
C: RENO
D: You're thinking of Mr. Wizard. This guy's an eccentric genius.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
C: RAWHIDE
D: Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Have you warned Professor Hikita?
C: RAWHIDE
D: First thing I did.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Why? What's going on? Anything I oughta know? C'mon, Rawhide, spill it.
E: in the dark
N: Buckaroo nodding his permission...
C: RAWHIDE
D: The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension. Almost fifty years ago. Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other. But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy. His hair was orange...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
C: RAWHIDE
D: He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane. The professor told us they threw away the key.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Hey, any lock can be picked. So what's he up to?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
N: Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his pocket.
C: RAWHIDE
D: And another thing. Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without signing.
N: Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Wasn't me. I'd take a hundred, right?
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY 134
N: ...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS.
C: RADAR SHEILD ONE
D: Lookit this, Buckaroo. Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic disturbance over Connecticut. Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Doubt it. Check NORAD command. Could be a volcanic ash cloud. Work her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then shovel the data over to Reno.
S: INT. PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY 135
N: Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS...
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY 136
N: BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS emblazoned along its side.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 137
N: Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo... ...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach...
C: DR. ZWIBEL
D: Howdy, Buckaroo. Got your message about rendezvousing here. Barely had time to pack my saddlebags.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Sid, welcome aboard. Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel. He'll be riding with us from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around.
E: shaking hands
N: Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty...
C: RENO
D: The name's Reno. This here's Perfect Tommy.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Where do you hail from, Doc?
C: DR. ZWIBEL
D: New Jersey!
E: catching on
C: RENO NEVADA
D: Where's your spurs at?
C: DR. ZWIBEL
D: You making fun of me?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
C: RENO
D: Why me?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
N: Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase...
C: RENO
D: Follow me, pard'ner.
S: INT. CELL - DAY 138
N: Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives. She sees his reflection in the pitiful mirror above her toilet...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Go away. Let me rot?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Who were you really trying to kill last night?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: You. Like the papers all say.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Pretty terrible shot.
N: Silence. Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy bowtie...coming over to the bars...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Was she pretty?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Who?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: The girl I remind you of.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: It's kinda hard this way.
N: Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: No, I don't.
N: Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near him...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Which? The one in my throat.
N: Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Another 'you'?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: What? I don't understand you. I don't understand anything anymore.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have...
N: Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear. Perfect Tommy and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Running a little late, Buckaroo.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Let her out. In my custody.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Let her out? She's a killer.
N: Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: No she's not.
S: INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON 139
N: REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo. Over the refreshment table set up for reporters, TWO REDHEADED MEN WEARING GLASSES practically FILL THEIR CUPS WITH CUBES OF SUGAR...one of their arms ELONGATING (1) for more sugar...THE STRANGE MOVE UNNOTICED... ...as the crowd breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and Buckaroo Banzai enter, Penny Priddy beside him...the glamorous couple surrounded by the Hong Kong Cavaliers. JOHN O'CONNOR, and JOHN GOMEZ, those two nearsighted REDHEADS with the sweet coffee applauding only politely. Buckaroo taking Penny onto the dais with him, the Cavaliers assuming positions of security as... ...Buckaroo sits next to Professor Hikita who shields his remarks from what must be easily FIFTY MICROPHONES...
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
E: nodding
N: Professor Hikita removing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER from his battered briefcase and laying it on the table. Buckaroo taking a sip of water...
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Thank you for coming. Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with Doctor Emilio Lizardo.
N: 1st REPORTER The same Doctor Lizardo that just...?
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: One and the same.
N: SOMEONE ELSE'S NEARSIGHTED POV, PEERING AT THE BACK OF PROFESSOR HIKITA'S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE DAIS... John O'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as... ON THE DAIS: 146
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm talking twister physics. Quantum Mechanics. Now you see, now you don't. This table I'm sitting behind? It appears to be solid matter, right?
N: Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces off the table...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one quadrillionth of its total volume.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Exactly. So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables. And mountains.
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
N: 2nd REPORTER What about the Pentagon? The possibility of war in the Eighth Dimension, Mr. Secretary?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Hey, better there than here, huh?
N: SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen... ...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable... CLOSE ON: 148
C: RADAR SHIELD ONE
D: The President's calling you, Buckaroo.
E: a whisper
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: The president of what?
C: RADAR SHIELD ONE
D: The President of the United States.
N: ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship plainly visible...7541. EVERYONE CAPTIVATED. 150
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Is he still delirious?
C: RADAR SHIELD ONE
D: Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down the hall.
E: shrugging
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Now wait a minute here...
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Next transparency, please.
N: A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector proves to be a remarkable image... ...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL. 151 ...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny: 152
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster.
N: ...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: You keep an eye on it.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Any time.
S: EXT. OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON 153
N: Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT APPROACHES EARTH...
S: INT. SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON 154
N: A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE
D: Mr. President--? You there?
N: MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT...
S: INT. CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON 155
N: Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why the President doesn't answer.
C: RADAR SHIELD ONE
D: Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus. But they used the code.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Mr. President--? Some kind of interference...I can't...
N: Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators...
C: RAWHIDE
D: Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.
C: RENO
D: Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
E: to Radar Shield One
C: RAWHIDE
D: And try the President's private number at the hospital. Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
N: ...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, faster and faster... ...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ... ...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE... ...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR! 159
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Pencil! Quick! Pen! Anything!
N: Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available. A SPARK flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal! 160 Buckaroo finally settling for his hand, SCRIBBLING NUMBERS ON HIS PALM.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON 162
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Let me ask you to imagine the Oscillation Overthruster as a sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet Car as a giant super- conducting magnet.
N: The Secretary of Defense fascinated. 163
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Sure, sure, but what about the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Dimensions?
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: I don't guess they matter. It's like cheesecloth, I think. Minkowiski space...
E: thumbing through her paperback
N: ...as all eyes turn to see a still woozy Buckaroo Banzai returning, pointing dramatically at John Gomez and John O'Connor in the audience...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: There! Those two! Don't panic...
N: The Cavaliers haven't a clue what he's talking about...
C: RENO
D: Whadda you mean, Buckaroo? Where? What?
N: BUCKAROO'S POV...SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY...ACROSS THE ROOM, TWO GHASTLY ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES, HOLDING COFFEE CUPS...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!
N: RENO'S POV...NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...neither Reno nor anyone else in the room seeing what Buckaroo does, seeing instead only those two redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet, John O'Connor and John Gomez...COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THE CRIMSON CREATURES BUCKAROO THINKS ARE:
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Arachtoids! Stop 'em!
C: SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
D: Arachtoids?
N: Buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room, those two astonished RED ALIENS racing for the nearest exit! The Hong Kong Cavaliers rushing to help Buckaroo when suddenly the PIERCING SCREAM of Penny Priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and look toward the dais... ...where yet NOTHER REDHEAD called JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, in glasses and dark suit, a bandanna over his face, has just stepped from behind the curtain and seized Professor Hikita, pointing a revolver at the old man's head...the Cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais, outraged...
C: JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
D: Okay, wise guys!
N: ...the masked John Bigbooté FIRING once, wounding Reno in the shoulder...
C: JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
D: Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is history!
N: The pistol stuck in Professor Hikita's ear convincing the Cavaliers to obey, to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the curtain and out of sight...as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle bystanders around them:
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Is this the kind of society you want? A society of weak-kneed jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us off like flies?
C: SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
D: Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, with the cry "So far and no farther will we be pushed!"

C: PINKY CARRUTHERS
D: Knight Commander, Pinky Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people "need see" Buckaroo in person.
N: And with that Pinky Carruthers is gone, trotting up toward the mansion on his palomino... ...as a frustrated John Parker suddenly sticks his nose in the air, getting a whiff of something, causing him to get on his bike and pedal...
S: EXT. OUTSIDE SECURITY WALL - NIGHT 251
N: ...around the corner of Buckaroo's estate where he notices a PARKED VAN and THREE SHADOWY FIGURES lowering themselves into the ground near the high security wall...disappearing... ...John Parker approaching, beholding...that familiar "Yoyodyne" van...and a FRESHLY DUG HOLE, crawling into the hold himself.
S: EXT. BANZAI INSTITUTE GROUNDS - NIGHT 252
N: ...surfacing WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE ESTATE and again catching sight of THE SHADOWY FIGURES moving toward the buildings, John Parker following...quickly ducking behind a tree, trying to get himself a good view of the three intruders...
C: SUDDEN VOICE
D: That's as far as you go, pal.
N: John Parker jerking his head around, finding himself confronting the FRIGHTENING SILHOUETTE of a Blue Shield in camouflage commando gear... ...John Parker instinctively raising a hand to protect himself when without warning, a second BLUE SHIELD drops on his head from the tree above, knocking him down...
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 254
N: Closed...SAM, the mechanic, next to Buckaroo's precious JET CAR, tinkering with that damaged Harley Davidson...the garage door suddenly sliding open, startling Sam...no one there.
C: SAM
D: Okay, who's the funny guy?
S: EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT 255
N: In the buses, CLOSE ON SOMETHING WEIRD EMERGING SLOWLY FROM TEH ALIEN JOHN BIGBOOTÉ'S MOUTH...SHARP... Sam stepping forward...A FIVE-PRONGED ORGANIC STINGER THE SIZE OF A WALNUT FLYING OUT OF THE NIGHT! A scream dying in Sam's throat as he clutches his heart, John Bigbooté dragging him back into the garage.
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 256
N: ...while the red alien John Gomez remains outside as a lookout, the alien John O'Connor quickly peering into the locked Jet Car and smashing the window, searching in vain for the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...
C: JOHN O'CONNOR
D: Not here! No Overthruster!
C: JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
D: John Whorfin will kill us!
C: JOHN O'CONNOR
D: You look! It's not here!
C: JOHN GOMEZ
D: Professor Hikita!
S: EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT 257
N: Outside, John Gomez making a startling discovery: the figure of Professor Hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only yards away...when suddenly overhead... GOMEZ'S POV...CASPER LINDLEY'S CHOPPER...landing behind a stand of trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover.
S: INT. DEN - NIGHT 259
N: Mrs. Johnson sitting near a crackling fire, at a small desk stacked high with books and papers, her nose in an advanced chemical engineering text. ...looking up as the front door opens, admitting Buckaroo Banzai, Casper and Scooter bringing up the rear...
C: MRS. JOHNSON
D: Buckaroo!
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Is the professor here? Where's Penny?
C: MRS. JOHNSON
D: Both of 'em safe and sound. What's going on? Everybody's freakin' out.
N: A shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway...
C: RENO
D: They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: What? How do you know that?
C: RAWHIDE
D: It's all on the record. Come on-
N: Buckaroo heading up the stairs... UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his men, being debriefed on the run:
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
C: RENO
D: ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up! And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Orson Wells? What about Doctor Lizardo?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Lizardo caused it all. Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster.
C: RAWHIDE
D: Faulty design. It sucked.
C: RENO
D: ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Stole his body? When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What else?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here. It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: It? Who does?
S: INT. INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT 261
N: Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at... ...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES... ...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror.
S: INT. BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT 264
N: ...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations... ...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!
C: RENO
D: Stand back, man...
N: ...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM!
C: HOLOGRAM
D: Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai. I am John Emdall from Planet 10. A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 267
N: Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR. Mrs. Johnson gone, none the wiser.
S: INT. BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT 268
N: Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room...
C: MRS. JOHNSON
D: Oh, wow...
N: Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of Buckaroo's desk...
C: JOHN EMDALL
D: After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed too good for their ilk.
C: RENO
D: Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her?
C: MRS. JOHNSON
D: She's not in her room...I looked.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?
C: JOHN EMDALL
D: Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of existence.
N: Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room...
C: PINKY CARRUTHERS
D: "John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil. With a weird album...how the hell was I supposed to know he came from outer space?
N: Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM... John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man... 273
C: JOHN EMDALL
D: And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike!
C: JOHN EMDALL
D: Exactly, Perfect Tommy. The Soviets will retaliate. Your President Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed...
C: RENO
D: God, if it's not one thing it's another.
C: JOHN EMDALL
D: But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your planet. Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves. End of discussion.
N: There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals downward into the grooves of the record again.
C: CASPER LINDLEY
D: She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: You wanna take the chance, Casper?
C: CASPER LINDLEY
D: Not me. No way.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
C: SCOOTER LINDLEY
D: Wow, you know it!
N: Buckaroo heading for the door...
C: RENO
D: Where're you goin'?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: To get my guns.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: His guns? Holy shit.
S: INT. INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT 276
N: ...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a sight that nearly stops their hearts... THEIR POV 277 AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÉ...AND A RED ARACHTOID! Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes the window!
S: INT. INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 279
N: Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down the corridor, gun drawn...
S: INT. BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 280
N: Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM! Buckaroo whirling instinctively with twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY! ...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the closet, finding it locked...knocking...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Open up or I'll shoot it off.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova! I thought you liked me for myself. But why should you, huh? A jerk like me.
N: Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet- so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD RINGER FOR PENNY.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Penny, look-
C: PENNY'S VOICE
D: You look. Who is she?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet door.
C: PENNY'S VOICE
D: Yeah, whose world is coming to an end? You only wanted me because I remind you of her.
N: Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that's about all I can say. Right now. Penny?
E: no response
N: A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female clothing...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Married--? So that's it! Buckaroo Banzai, a married man. Where is she? With the kids some place?
N: Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: She was killed, Penny.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Oh, my.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
N: A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: How did she die? I wanna know.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: You don't wanna know.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Hanoi Shan--? The guy in your comic books. Boss of the World Crime League? Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death? The Pivot of Mystery himself? You're putting me on. He's a cartoon character.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I wish he was. He's real enough.
N: Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed photograph of Peggy...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: God, she's so young and beautiful. I don't remember her at all. Which I guess is good, under the circumstances. I bet you'll never forget her though.
N: One look at Buckaroo says it all...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Never.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this. Oh, boy...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I gotta go. We're on borrowed time.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Go where? Where're you going?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
E: squatting close to her
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Believe in Penny Priddy?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Absolutely.
N: Penny looks into his eyes...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: You've got your six guns strapped on. You're ridding off on another adventure? Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real. I should go with you. Please...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: It's too dangerous.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: That's just what you would say. This is so unreal. I'm dreaming...
N: Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK... ...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Buckaroo--! Sorry--
E: breathless
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: What is it, Tommy?
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Sam's dead! Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
N: Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny:
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Stay here, I'll be back.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Sure. I won't hold my breath.
S: EXT. BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT 282
N: Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward the research building...
S: INT. BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 283
N: Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, leering at her...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Whadda you want?
N: John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference...
C: JOHN O'CONNOR
D: Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.

D: Dead. Damnit!

D: Where's the professor?
C: RENO
D: Where's Rawhide?
C: CASPER
D: Who'd do a thing like this?
C: NEW JERSEY
D: Arachtoids.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Spread out. They can't be far.
S: INT. INSTITUTE CORRIDORS - NIGHT 286
N: SHOTS of Cavaliers in empty hallways, guns drawn, discovering evidence of intruders...OFFICES RANSACKED, FURNITURE UPSET...EXPERIMENTS FOULED UP... ...Buckaroo turning a corner, finding a SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE in the hallway...turning the corner...
S: INT. DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT 288
N: ...stepping into a LARGE ROOM clouded with SMOKE from a burning file cabinet, Rawhide and a HULDING FORM struggling in the gloom... ...Buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly Rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor, the "man" HISSING!
C: RAWHIDE
D: Look out, Buckaroo!
N: Rawhide putting himself in the line of fire, suddenly clutching his lower back...Buckaroo starting toward Rawhide but...
C: RAWHIDE
D: Behind you!
N: Buckaroo turning as THE SHADOW OF THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR falls on his back! ...Buckaroo firing his guns, wounding the creature, the disoriented FIGURE retreating out into the corridor as Buckaroo turns in time to see Rawhide's assailant dive into a hole in the floor! A hole in the floor?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: You okay?
C: RAWHIDE
D: Yeah. Just grazed me. The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
N: Buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum, going into it himself...
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 289
N: As Penny rushes in, her ears picking up weird noises...THE SOUND OF PEOPLE in the acoustical tiles overhead...Penny trying to follow the racket down the first-floor hallway...
S: INT. CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT 290
N: Buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space, making his way past air- conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up ahead...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Professor--!?
C: PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
D: Here, Buckaroo!
N: SOUNDS IN THE DARKNESS, Buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready but useless in these cramped quarters...Buckaroo finding a worklight, flicking it on...
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT 291
N: Penny meanwhile following the NOISES AND VOICES OVERHEAD into an empty office, grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Buckaroo! Rawhide! Reno? Anybody?
N: ANOTHER POV...unfortunately someone else is watching Penny from inside that very office...the wounded John O'Connor sitting in a swivel desk chair behind the door, oozing blood of a strange color and consistency, staring ferociously at Penny...MORE CLATTER OVERHEAD...as Penny elevates herself partially into the hole...
S: INT. CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT 293
N: PENNY'S POV...Professor Hikita only yards away, on his belly, able to come no further, unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct...the arachtoid John Bigbooté closing in behind the professor...Buckaroo closing in behind Bigbooté.
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Take it, young lady! Grab it!
N: Unseen by John Bigbooté, the OVERTHRUSTER skittering across the crawl space and into Penny's hands!
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT 295
N: Penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top, her back still to the wounded John O'Connor as she quickly stuffs the OVERTHRUSTER into her purse...an action unseen by the ghastly, bleeding thug who... ...EXTENDS HIS ARM UP AND ACROSS THE ROOM...HIS HUMAN HAND TIGHTENING AROUND HER MOUTH...
S: INT. CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT 297
N: Buckaroo advancing toward the professor...
C: PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
D: Go back, Buckaroo!
N: The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat.
S: INT. DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT 298
N: Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey... ...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, Rawhide forcing a smile...
C: RAWHIDE
D: You're a welcome sight...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Just 'grazed' you, huh?
N: New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's back. Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor...
C: RAWHIDE
D: Apache?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Arachtoid.
C: RAWHIDE
D: So I was right. That's nice to know...
N: Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker...
C: PINKY CARRUTHERS
D: We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to...
N: Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition. Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing there... Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Any antidote for these things?
N: John Parker holding the stinger in his palm...
C: JOHN PARKER
D: No, none.
N: ...as it suddenly comes alive! He drops it to the floor, stomps it to death...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: That mean you're on our side?
C: RAWHIDE
D: We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo.
E: sinking
N: Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy...

D: We will, old fried, we will.
C: RAWHIDE
D: Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
N: BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness mixed with anger...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: There's another one we owe 'em.
N: ...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP...

D: And they got Penny! Look!
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Don't shoot!
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: She has the Overthruster!
C: JOHN PARKER
D: Then your planet is doomed.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: No! We'll get it back.
E: calmer
N: Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now. BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER...
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 302
N: CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do we really know about any of 'em?
N: A NURSE appears with two little pills...
C: NURSE
D: These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President. Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like it was Swiss cheese! They gotta be just scared shitless!
E: desperate
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: As are all sane men today.
C: SECREATRY OF DEFENSE
D: Hey, and me too. That's why I'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us the technology, then Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take it! In the national interest.
N: The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly BEEPING, startling him and prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at... ...an astounding TV-telephone where the FACE OF BUCKAROO BANZAI APPEARS...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: World Watch One. Direct incoming transmission.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world?
N: Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming into Buckaroo's field of vision...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: Not too terrific, sir. I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
S: EXT. BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT 304
N: On a highway somewhere near the Eastern seaboard, Buckaroo's bus speeds toward Yoyodyne...
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT 305
N: Buckaroo standing at a TV-telephone in his MOBILE ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, the arachtoidal John Parker right at his side amid a flurry of activity... technicians accumulating INFO on THE ALIEN FATHER SHIP FROM PLANET 10...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.
N: ...Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning assault/chemical-warfare uniforms...little Scooter Lindley among them, too, doing like his dad. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV Yoyodyne Propulsion? The people working on our Truncheon bomber? Under control of alien nationals? Reds? Commies, you say? ...New Jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of THE AWESOME BLACK ARACHTOID SHIP HEADED TOWARD EARTH...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no. Real aliens. Giant red arachtoids camouflaged as human beings...and what they're really building, forget your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10.
N: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV Now wait one second...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too.
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 309
N: The President dumbfounded...John Parker on TV appearing as nothing more than a wild and wooly Rastafarian...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but...
C: JOHN PARKER ON TV
D: Time is short, Mr. President. To prevent John Whorfin's escape, my comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over New Jersey. This situation is explosive!
E: interrupting
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New Jersey--?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: No, sir. This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. President. He's a black arachtoid.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: That's some kind of spider, isn't it?
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT 310
N: New Jersey joins Professor Hikita at a microscope, analyzing a slide smeared with that weird alien 'blood'...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
D: Buckaroo, my good friend...I'd like to help you...but don't you think I would've heard from my SAC radar by now if...
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 311
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: SAC wouldn't know what to look for, sir. Because these black arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud.
N: The Secretary of Defense takes action, picks up a phone...
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Get me John Bigboote at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc. Then... ...the FBI. Let's see if this spade's wanted. What the hell's his name again? Jackson?
E: to the President
C: JOHN PARKER ON TV
D: Parker. I have delivered a hologram from my president, John Emdall, who has made it clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, she intends to fire an atomic beam from your American airspace...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: ...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: A what?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: A thermonuclear holocaust, sir. These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo. We know each other pretty well, I think.
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: John...? John Bigboote? Right, Bigbooté, sorry. Anyway, hey, guy, how's everything over there at Yoyodyne? How's my big bomber coming? Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary? Spiders? I know you're busy...lunch? Sounds good...when's good for you? Next Tuesday? I'm writing it down in my book. See you then...Uncle Sam's treat.
N: The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with the conversation just concluded.
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT 312
N: Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter squinting into the microscope...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
D: Well. I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"...
C: NEW JERSEY
D: There's your answer! Electromagnetic bacterial crap!
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Programmable!
C: NEW JERSEY
D: We inhale the bacteria. It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms our consciousness. Diabolical. We only see what they want us to see.
C: PROF. HIKITA
D: Electric brainwashing.
N: John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS... SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE... SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days?
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I've got it, Mr. Secretary. But unfortunately the Oscillation Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our way there right now.
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 313
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Who the hell's Penny Priddy?
N: The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' look...
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT 314
N: Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 315
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
D: Excuse me a moment, Mr. President. We're talking to the cloud right now.
T: And his image fades.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Good God...
N: The President picks up the phone...
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey-
S: INT. WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY 316
N: Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the alien cloud... The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering... 317
C: RENO
D: They're armed for bear, Buckaroo. Check out those radiation levels.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall.
E: to John Parker
C: JOHN PARKER
D: Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir.
E: into phone
N: Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone...
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: It's Whorfin, Buckaroo. Line 3.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Whorfin? Does he know we're coming?
S: INT. SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT 318
N: Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John Bigbooté looking on... Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT. BEGIN
T: INTERCUTTING.
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me? Ah, I'm flattered. We know the same people. In fact, one of them is here with me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: "Doctor"--?
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement. In the miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However... ...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster. Perhaps you can convince her to try.
E: a pause
N: Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Penny--?! Are you all right?
N: Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a second to torture Buckaroo's soul...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: She knows nothing, Lizardo.
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: Then shall we say "A Penny for your thoughts?" You can come in her place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster! He'll bring it. I know his type.
E: hanging up
N: Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS!
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: Take her to the pit! Use more honey. Find out what she knows.
N: Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat as the TINY ANTS dig in...
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Who are you? Hanoi Shan? The Scourge of Burma! The Pivot of Mystery? Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!
N: Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door...
S: INT. PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT 321
N: A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers. Casper and Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker. But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
C: JOHN PARKER
D: They will never surrender. They will fight to the end.
N: Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, SEEING NOW "THE ALIEN" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster. That'll be my job: get it back in one piece. Here's the main gate. I'll pass through first, alone. The rest of you divide into two strike groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect Tommy. John Parker'll ride with Chaparral.
N: Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to locate...maybe hard to get.
S: INT. BOWELS OF YOYODYNE - NIGHT 322
N: Penny being dragged by John O'Connor through a slimy underground corridor, past a strange piece of machinery.
S: INT. WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT 323
N: The President of the United States talks into a cigarette lighter and peeks up a nurse's skirt by means of his floor mirror... MIRRORED POV: The nurse's reflection replaced by that of his NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Buckaroo, come in...over. How does this damn thing work? Can anybody figure this lighter out?
C: NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
D: No, sir. I think the flint...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: What's happening with my call to SAC?
C: NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
D: Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
C: NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
D: Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar. It's unusual, but no cause for alarm. Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Should we be on Code Red?
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off half-cocked, Mr. President.
N: The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets.
C: SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
D: I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.
N: Senator Cunningham pacing nervously...
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, let's not panic here! I'm sure there's a rational explanation...
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: Russian radar is down, sir. They've just gone to Code Red.
E: turning from a strange phone
N: Silence. And then calmly and quietly:
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: We've got no choice then. Call my wife.
N: The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone:
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: Code Red. "Butch says we're crimson."
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men... ...or persons. I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm barely holding my fudge right now.
E: looking at Cunningham
C: SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
D: Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself together.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts! Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first. They think we're godless monsters just like them. Put yourself in their samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming into the Great Hall of the People. Now, do you think they're gonna listen to reason? I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think they will?
E: pause
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours. We're both totally defenseless. More or less.
E: being handed a dispatch
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: Hail Mary.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: So what's our counter option, General Catburd? Earn your salary.
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir. Hit 'em primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first.
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Larry, where's my Football?
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: Out in the hall, sir.
S: INT. WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 326
N: An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his head out of the President's room...
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: What're you waiting for, boy? Get in here with that thing.
N: ...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD...
C: MRS. JOHNSON
D: For the President! From Buckaroo Banzai!
S: EXT. RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT 327
N: A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne. A KOLODNY BROS. PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving Blue Shields:
C: RENO
D: We're waiting for the Jet Car. Billy's bringing it.
C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Asshole probably got lost.
C: NEW JERSEY
D: Or nailed for speeding.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Can I have everyone's attention? I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight. It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and we all saw what happened to Rawhide. So if for any reason this is good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs...
N: Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him...
C: RENO
D: What, Buckaroo? You trying to tell us something?
N: The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big engine still running.
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Let's just fry those arachtoids.
N: Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling on his helmet:
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Give me thirty minutes. Then come in and mop up.
N: Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his speed machine. PROF. HIKITA'S POV as Buckaroo blasts off...an exhaust trail of white smoke as he rockets up the highway!
S: INT. YOYODYNE - NIGHT 329
N: Penny Priddy, more bedraggled and filthy than ever, being dragged by John O'Connor deeper into the bowels of Yoyodyne, down a flooded subterranean corridor...
S: INT. WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 330
N: CLOSE ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE...JOHN EMDALL'S VOICE OVER...talking thermonuclear war...wrapping her speech up...WHOOSH!
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: Well... that's certainly food for thought.
N: Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic... ...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE.
C: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
D: No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence.
C: GENERAL CATBURD
D: Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators. The Plan D Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves a knockout little force posture...
C: SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
D: You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit more so that future generations of...
N: THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling out a special writing tray from the bed...
C: PRESIDENT WIDMARK
D: "Name of the enemy"? What, Planet 10? My hand's shaking. How on earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job. That's what the people put me here for.
S: INT. FATHER SHIP - NIGHT 332

S: INT. SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT 334
N: In the nerve center of Yoyodyne, a nervous John Bigbooté watches Dr. Lizardo addressing his ragtag followers on the floor below...Bigbooté with his hands on Lizardo's mike cord, trying to get up enough nerve to pull the plug on his boss...
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We must move! Escape or die!
N: OVER LIZARDO'S SHOULDER: A view down below on the littered floor of a huge aircraft factory that houses a GIANT SPOACESHIP OF BIZARRE DESIGN, a customized 747, wingless, jagged, the entire vehicle suspended twenty feet off the floor on movable cranes, work ladders stretching up to its several doors...
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to our homeland and seize power once again!
N: ...Lizardo's followers extending their three-fingered hands in fascist salutes as he whips them into a feverish state: BACK TO: 336

N: The Jet Car's engine shut down, Buckaroo CHECKING HIS OVERTHRUSTER HOMING DEVICE as he's trundled toward John Gomez, in a graveyard of HUGE YELLOW SPIKES, his eyes taking in everything, from the last-minute preparation of the GIANT SPACECRAFT to: BUCKAROO'S POV...the evil figures of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigbooté standing high in the speed operator's pulpit... Buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit...John Gomez poking at the JET CAR'S dashboard, ripping out its cassette deck, finding the crucial Overthruster missing and shaking his head in Lizardo's direction.
C: JOHN GOMEZ
D: Not here!
N: THEIR POV 341 An angry John Bigbooté racing down the stairs toward the Jet Car...as over the PUBLIC ADDRESS BOOMS:
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!
N: BACK TO: 342
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI

C: PERFECT TOMMY
D: Perfect Tommy.
N: That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall...
C: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
D: Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this shit. I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private sector. But instead, I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the- hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth more to this country than all the tea in China! I'm talking National Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten this thing out before somebody gets hurt! You got that?

HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring at her...

C: JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
D: Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two reasonable...

E: to no one in particular
N: The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids...
C: NEW JERSEY

D: Overthruster in place.
C: JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
D: It won't work! It won't!
C: DOCTOR LIZARDO
D: Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward!
N: John O'Connor pushing John Bigbooté aside as Lizardo hits another switch and for a fraction of a second ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, A BLINDING GREEN LIGHT!

C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Got a casualty list?

C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...

C: RADAR SHIELD TWO
D: Buckaroo, the President's on line on. Calling about is everything okay with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead and destroy Russia...?

Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish. His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S! And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both hands...SPARKS...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Penny!
N: ...shaking her, exhorting her...
C: BUCKAROO BANZAI
D: Open your eyes! Look at me! Penny!
N: ...but nothing, no more signs of life... ...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT! ...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero before her.
C: PENNY PRIDDY
D: Buckaroo...you look awful.
N: And indeed they both do, but who cares? ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home... ...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again a safe, snug harbor.
