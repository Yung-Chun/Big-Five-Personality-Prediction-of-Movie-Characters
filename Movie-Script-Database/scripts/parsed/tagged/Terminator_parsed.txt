S: EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT
N: Silence. Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible. A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings. Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows. This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood. ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium. A CAT enters FRAME. CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows. CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception. A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE. Papers blow across the pavement. The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster. Windows rattle in their frames. The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid PURPLE LIGHT. A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over- head blows in all the windows facing the yard. C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies. 1A/FX ANGLE - DUMPSTER 1A/FX ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT
N: SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides. FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard. He stands, slowly. The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision. C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless. His hair is military short. This man is the TERMINATOR. He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin. He brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning his surroundings.
T: CUT TO:
N: 2A/FX CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT 2A/FX CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below. The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky. The night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging a thunderstorm. Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
N: A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground. PULL BACK to include its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS, lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground. They sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets. The leader notices something and sits up.
C: LEADER
D: Hey, hey...what's wrong with this picture?
E: pointing
N: ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose- fully toward them. ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them. They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows.
C: LEADER
D: Nice night for a walk, eh?
N: Terminator stops right in front of them.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Nice night for a walk.
E: without inflec- tion
N: They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.
C: SECOND PUNK
D: Washday tomorrow, huh? Nothing clean, right?
N: Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried. Reptilian.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Nothing clean. Right.
C: LEADER
D: This guy's a couple bricks short.
N: Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the others.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Your clothes. Give them to me.
N: The punks exchange glances, dismayed.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Now.
E: coldly
C: SECOND PUNK
D: Fuck you, asshole.
E: bracing
N: Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed. The blow flings him with a CLANG into the jungle gym. He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one motion. Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip. Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down. The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless. Their bodies are in total shadow. The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure. Terminator jerks his fist back with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME. The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror. He backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds he is in a corner. Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous. The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes. Thunder peals overhead.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT
N: A light RAIN begins to fall. Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground, pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike the collar of the punk's jacket. The rain streams down over his face, running into and over his eyes. They do not blink.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Another part of the city. Seedy apartments and storefronts. The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic. SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined with trash containers and fire escapes. From a recessed doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement. An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally above the rain sounds. ANGLE - DOORWAY, The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork around him. A shockwave hurls trash into the air. Painted over windows shatter. Rat scurry, blinded. A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks the pavement with a muddy splash. C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed. A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive crouch. KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim. A crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead. Other scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body. The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING. The sound fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising scream of animal agony. Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

N: 5A/FX OMITTED 5A/FX
S: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
N: CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork. The man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering gasp. CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the shoulder by a railing. He has materialized in the same space occupied by the fire escape structure. The figure slumps, motionless. Reese quickly checks for signs of life. The man is dead. Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk huddled in the doorway. A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working girls, passes by the alley mouth. They do a double take when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride, completely jaded. He's certainly not a potential customer. Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.
C: DERELICT
D: Say, buddy...did you see a real bright light?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY/SAME - NIGHT
N: A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street. The search- light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers. The cruiser chirps to a stop. The doors fly open and two cops leap out.
C: FIRST COP
D: Hold it, right there!
N: Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot. The cops draw their guns and race into the alley after him. HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the narrow alley. He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans. Whips around a corner. Leaps the hood of a parked car in the cross alley. PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night maze.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CROSS ALLEY - NIGHT
N: PANAGLIDE WITH REESE as he hits a chain link gate at a dead run and scrambles over it.
S: EXT. ALLEY JUNCTION - NIGHT
N: WHIP PAN ON COPS, skidding to a stop at the corner in time to see Reese vault the fence. They separate. DOLLY WITH SECOND COP, as he runs to the gate.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY/NEARBY - NIGHT
N: LOW PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, running full tilt, displaying incredible agility. REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by. The view of a hot- wired rat in an urban maze. C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns, alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the electric glare of the city wheels about him. ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent cross-lighting in the B.G. Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him. Sandwiched. Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the lock, and vanishes into the darkness within. The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit. They open the back door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
N: Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount department store. A searchlight stabs in the front window as he dashes into the maze of aisles. Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door. FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness. He bolts the open space behind a display window. Sees the outside searchlight sweep toward him. Freezes. ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth- featured, smiling mannequins. As the light passes, Reese silently moves on. ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a hanger. Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT
N: With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA. ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely Doberman, flies toward Reese. He spins. Catches it by the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching precision. C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat, THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close. Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis- ing dominance. Some ancient communication seems to pass between the two. Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting a long overcoat from a rack. The dog backs away from him, stiff-legged and confused.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
N: TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still shrugging into his long coat. Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed. Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air like a cat. The cop FIRES. Misses. Goes down under Reese's tackle and they slide together on the polished floor. Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun, aiming it at the other's face two-handed.
C: REESE
D: What day is it? The date...
C: COP
D: Thursday...uh...May twelfth.
C: REESE
D: What year?
E: viciously
N: A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind Reese's head. He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor. Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police Special in his coat. Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the escalators.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
N: WHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays. He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes. Slaps one of a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot. Too small. Another. Holding the shoes he runs on.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SECOND FLOOR FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - NIGHT
N: A door opens quietly and Reese slips out. CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he moves like a panther along the narrow catwalk. TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser parked at the mouth of the alley.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY/STREET - NIGHT
N: Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car. Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips it under his coat. Cradled in a vertical position, the shortened weapon is virtually invisible. He walks out onto the street and away, unhurriedly, an innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT
N: Reese enters a telephone booth. Harsh light rakes across his face, outlining the long scar. He opens the directory, leafs through it. ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column. Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan white pages:
C: CONNOR, SARAH CONNOR, SARAH ANN
D: CONNOR, SARAH J.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING
N: The night's rain has given way to a typical L.A. morning of diffuse sunlight. MOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic. SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulner- able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists. Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BIG BOB'S RESTRAUNT - DAY
N: Sarah buzzes into the parking lot of Big Bob's Family Restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of Big Bob himself. The fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches out for fat kids. Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.
C: SARAH
D: Watch this for me, big buns.
E: to Big Bob
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA
N: HIGH WIDE SHOT prominently featuring a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA F.G. as Sarah enters below. She passes under another video eye as she crosses the main floor of the wholesomely appointed eatery. Sarah goes through the swinging STAFF doors under a third camera.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE
N: The office is closet-like, lit by the glow of several security monitors. CHUCK BREEN, day manager, pimply and officious,watches Sarah in an overhead view of the service corridor. He punches a switch and reaches for a microphone on a studio gooseneck.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR
N: Sarah glances up as Breen's voice rasps from a ceiling speaker.
C: BREEN
D: Sarah?

C: SARAH
D: Aren't I worth waiting for?
C: BREEN
D: Not really. Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
C: SARAH
D: I don't know. I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
E: grinning
C: BREEN
D: The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
C: SARAH
D: Thanks, Chuck. I need the
N: money. Can I still work the hours around my classes? Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's small accounting computer. Sarah looks over his shoulder as he modifies the week's schedule.
C: BREEN
D: Mmm. Same schedule's okay.
C: SARAH
D: Alright!
C: BREEN
D: Can you handle it?
E: gravely
C: SARAH
D: It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
N: Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.
C: BREEN
D: Here you go. You're a Bob's Girl now. Nancy will check you out.
C: SARAH
D: I won't let the fat kid down.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: ANGLE - TIGHT ON LOCKER DOOR as it slams shut, revealing Sarah transformed into a "Bob's Girl". Her hair is in a bun. White blouse. Short flared skirt and apron with a bow. She resembles a suburbanized peasant maid looking for a goat to milk. Sarah confronts her reflection in the mirror, pondering its absurdity. She pinches her sheeks. Smiles vacuously.
C: SARAH
D: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'll be you waitress. I'm so wholesome, I could puke.
E: pause
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
N: TIGHT ON CAR SIDE WINDOW, as a figure approaches, reflected in the glass. A fist punches through the window, shattering it. The thief unlocks the door and gets behind the wheel. It's Terminator.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. YELLOW MAVERICK - DAY
N: With a blow from the heel of his hand Terminator smashes loose the ignition assembly and strips the wires with a brutal twist of his fingers. Touching the proper wires he starts the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: 28A EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY 28A
N: Terminator walks past the long display window of an enormous pawnshop emporium. Signs declare, among other things, GUNS and AMMO is red block letters. Terminator passes the appliance section, and the pictures on a row of TV sets distort and break-up sequentially as he walks by, returning to normal behind him. He enters the store.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
N: TIGHT ON GLASS COUNTERTOP as an AR-180 ASSAULT RIFLE WITH SCOPE is laid beside a number of other guns: a COLT K- MODEL .45 ACP, a SMITH AND WESSON .38 FOUR-INCH, a BERETTA .225 ACP.
C: TERMINATOR
D: ...the Remington 1100 Autoloader...
E: V.O.
N: WIDE as the CLERK, who looks like a sick lizard, pallid and paunchy, takes the rifle from a wall rack. He lays it beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti-human artillery already on the glass counter. Terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec- tions.
C: CLERK
D: Anything else?
C: TERMINATOR
D: A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
C: CLERK
D: Just what you see, pal.
E: annoyed
N: He indicates the display case and wall racks with a minimal gesture.
C: TERMINATOR
D: The Uzi 9 millimeter.
C: CLERK
D: You know your weapons, buddy.
E: setting it out
N: Terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with curt, precise movements.
C: CLERK
D: Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
E: continuing
C: TERMINATOR
D: All.
N: The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile.
C: CLERK
D: Maybe I'll close early. Cash or charge?
N: Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells from a stack on the display case.
C: CLERK
D: Sorry, I can't sell the ammo with the guns. You'll have to---Hey!
N: Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the shotgun.
C: CLERK
D: You can't to that...

D: Wrong.
E: evenly
N: He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger. The gun THUNDERS.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. GAS STATION/PHONE BOOTH - DAY
N: The yellow Maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone booth. MOVING WITH TERMINATOR, as he gets out, walks to the booth and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy T-shirt, flinging him backward into the parking lot. The guy is bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance back as he steps in to take the man's place.
C: MAN
D: Hey, man...
E: outraged
T: CUT TO:
N: 31 PHONE BOOTH A woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the dangling receiver. Terminator leafs rapidly through the directory. ANGLE - C.U. PAGES FLIPPING ANGLE - MACRO SHOT, as Terminator's finger comes to rest beside a now-familiar listing: CONNOR, SARAH
T: CUT TO:
S: 32 INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA
N: Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of the dinner rush. In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'. She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a third. A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Honey, can I get that coffee now?
C: SARAH
D: Yes sir, just a second.
N: She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock-step.
C: SARAH
D: Who gets the Burly Burger?
C: CUSTOMER TWO
D: I ordered Barbecue Beef.
C: CUSTOMER THREE
D: Does mine come with fires?
C: CUSTOMER FOUR
D: He's got the Barbecue Beef, I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.
C: SARAH
D: Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?
S: CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE
N: Miss, we're ready to order. In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks over someone's water glass.
C: SARAH
D: Oh, sorry. That's not real leather, is it?
E: mopping fran- tically
N: As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of Sarah's apron She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned and sags with defeat. NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress, stops beside her to whisper.
C: NANCY
D: Look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care?
T: CUT TO:
S: 33 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
N: ANGLE on a standard-issue L.A. suburban street with kids racing Big Wheels B.G. LOW ANGLE with the FRAME comprising a single house, toy- littered lawn and mailbox. EXTREME F.G., by the curb, is a CHILD'S PLASTIC TRUCK. There is the sound of a CAR ENGINE approaching, and the front of the yellow Maverick appears, stopping at the curb. Its front tire CRUSHES the toy. PANAGLIDE ON TERMINATOR, preceding him as he steps out of the car, pauses by the mailbox to check the name, and strides toward the house. A YOUNG BOY, playing in the driveway, watches him pass. The boy's DOG, a small Terrier, growls low and mean, crouching back from Terminator. He rings the doorbell and waits, motionless. The door opens a few inches, held by a security chain, revealing a frail MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in apron and rubber cleaning gloves.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Sarah Connor?
C: WOMAN
D: No, she's upstairs. Who shall I say is--
N: Terminator breaks the chain and pushes past her as if she didn't exist.
T: CUT TO:
S: 33A INT. HOUSE/FOYER 33A
N: PANAGLIDE ON TERMINATOR, preceding his as he crosses the foyer and mounts the stairs. The woman starts after him.
C: WOMAN
D: What do you think you're-- My God!
N: She gasps and stops in her tracks as Terminator smoothly pulls the .45 from under his jacket and snaps the cocking slide.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh my God...Sarah!
E: screeching
T: CUT TO:
S: 33B INT. BEDROOM 33B
N: Installed on her bed for an afternoon of 'soaps' is the WRONG SARAH CONNOR. ELECTRODE PADS exercise her doughy thighs as the 35 year old divorcee watches "GENERAL HOSPITAL". She calls out distractedly:
C: WRONG SARAH CONNOR
D: What is it, Mom?
N: She jumps as the door BANGS open. And stares in dumb amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the strange clothes raises a pistol. And aims it at her face. It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that half-second before he FIRES.
T: CUT TO:
S: 33C INT. FOYER 33C
N: The mother is fumbling with a telephone when she hears the SHOT. The silence stretches for several BEATS. Then FIVE MORE SHOTS are heard. The woman screams and drops the phone as she stares upward. ANGLE ON CEILING above her. With each successive shot a chuck of plaster explodes off the ceiling.
T: CUT TO:
S: 33D INT. BEDROOM 33D
N: LOW ANGLE ON TERMINATOR, standing with the .45 aimed down at the dead woman, just OUT OF FRAME on the floor. He unhurriedly removes the spent clip, reloads the weapon and replaces it under his jacket. Crouching down, he turns the woman's body over, confirming that she is dead.
T: CUT TO:
S: 33E INT. FOYER 33E
N: The mother is frantically dialing the phone. She mis- dials, starts over. Then stops as she hears the bedroom door open. Terminator stands at the head of the stairs. His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's shoulder. He starts down the stairs. The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe. He reaches the main floor and walks toward her. She edges into a corner, eyes wide. He reaches out. And wipes his hands clean on her apron. Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the woman to sag to the floor in a faint.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT./EXT. SERVICE TUNNEL - DAY
N: TIGHT ON KYLE REESE'S HANDS as they make the last few strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from the riot gun. It clatters to the ground, leaving a short stump, like a pistol grip. CUT WIDER as Reese hefts the weapon. He is crouched in an underground service tunnel below a busy street. Shadows of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above him flicker past. They can't see him in the darkness below their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully. He slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry- rigged sling.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station, his overcoat done up to the top button. He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered, overbuilt commercial street. He is out of sync. A stranger in a strange land. He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he moves among the unconcerned pedestrians. His eyes flick rapidly about. He is seeing this Babylon for the first time. Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand. He watches people walk away with food. Moves closer. Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.
C: TAKE-OUT CUSTOMER
D: Gimme a falafel with yogurt dressing and, uh, Baco-bits.
N: The counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly as Reese steps up.
C: REESE
D: Gimme a falafel with, uh, yogurt and Baco-bits.
N: The counterman barely looks up as he passes the mess through the window.
C: COUNTERMAN
D: That'll be one-sixty.
N: He glances up and Reese is gone. He leans half out the window.
C: COUNTERMAN
D: Hey! Son-of-a-bitch.
E: continuing

S: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
N: Reese crouches in an alley, out of sight of passersby, wolfing his food. The sauce runs down his sleeve but he doesn't notice.

C: MR. MILLER
D: What's it to ya?
C: SARAH
D: You must have a girlfriend.
C: MR. MILLER
D: That's none of your business.
C: SARAH
D: Aha! Is she young?
N: Mr. Miller lowers his menu and glares at her.
C: MR. MILLER
D: Compared to me she is. How
N: come you're not at the cash anymore? They catch ya steal- ing?

S: INT. BIG BOB'S/SERVICE CORRIDOR
N: Sarah rounds the corner, walking fast as she undoes her apron. She calls out to the walls without looking up.
C: SARAH
D: I'm on break, Chuck. Carla's got my station.
N: As she approaches the locker room where the girls take their coffee breaks, the door bursts open and Nancy beckons to Sarah.
C: NANCY
D: Hurry up. It's about you... I mean sort of...Come on!
E: excitedly
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIG BOB'S/BREAK ROOM
N: Nancy guides Sarah to the small black and white portable TV in the corner. Two other girls, smoking cigarettes with their shoes off and nyloned feet on the table, are already watching. One glances at Sarah.
C: WAITRESS
D: Hey, Sarah. This is weird.
N: They huddle around the set, intent on a newscast in progress.
C: TV ANCHORWOMAN
D: ...and a police spokesman at the scene refused to speculate on a motive for the execution- style slaying of the Encino housewife. He did however say that an accurate description of the suspect has been compiled from several witnesses. Once again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five, mother of two, brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon.
N: As the news grinds on, Sarah gazes unseeingly at the screen. Nancy claps her on the shoulder, laughing.
C: NANCY
D: You're dead, honey.

S: EXT. HEALTH CLUB - DUSK
N: Sunlight is dying when Sarah swings her moped to the curb in front of the 'GOOD LIFE SPA', a large, crowded health club.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HEALTH CLUB/AEROBICS STUDIO
N: MUSIC BOOMS and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close F.G. as CAMERA DOLLIES along a row of panting, stretching women. In deep B.G. Sarah slips in through the door and waits against the wall while the human dynamo, GINGER VENTURA, leads the class energetically. Ginger, Sarah's roommate, is a party-stopper. Red-haired, athletic, sensuous. She's pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion. And she's in motion. Ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions to the BEAT of a MOTOWN FAVORITE. MARCO, a handsome, well-defined guy wearing a tight STAFF T-shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next to Sarah.
C: MARCO
D: Hi. I've seen you around. You're cute. Cute I remember.
C: SARAH
D: I'm Sarah. Ginger's roommate.
C: MARCO
D: Yeah, right. I'm Marco.
N: The dance tape ends.
C: GINGER
D: ...and three aaand four! And that's it ladies! Now, didn't that feel good?
N: The group collapses ensemble. A chorus of groans.
C: GINGER
D: Let's think positive or next time I'll play the FM version.
N: Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses. Marco is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the attention.
C: SARAH
D: ...yeah, really? Say some- thing in Italian.
N: Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym shorts out and peers down. She shakes her head.
C: GINGER
D: You're wasting your time, kiddo. Let's go.
N: She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door. Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her shoulder as the door closes.

N: PANAGLIDE WITH THE TWO GIRLS, as they descend to the first floor and enter a hallway Sarah is gasping with laughter.
C: SARAH
D: I don't believe you did that.
E: weakly
N: Ginger is adjusting her ever-present WALKMAN-TYPE CASSETTE PLAYER at her hip. She slips on the earphones as they walk along. Sarah feigns outrage.
C: SARAH
D: I had him hooked. He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
E: continuing
C: GINGER
D: That guy's a jerk. I did you a favor.
C: SARAH
D: I'll do the same for you sometime.
N: Sarah laughs and claps her friend on the back. They turn in at a door marked WEIGHT ROOM.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WEIGHT ROOM
N: SEVERAL ANGLES, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging into bio-mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome-steel levers and tubes. The CRASH and SQUEAL of metal against metal. In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening. Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing enormous weight on the Nautilus machine. Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest people you'd ever want to meet. His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push. He heaves it up with a guttural cry. Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms dangling at his side, eyes closed. A pair of female legs appear.
C: GINGER
D: What's this? Sleep therapy?
E: V.O.
N: Matt opens his eyes.
C: GINGER
D: You think somebody's gonna do this for you? Look at those shriveled bi's. And you haven't worked lat's or ab's since Wednesday.
E: continuing
C: MATT
D: Hello, sweetheart. Had a rough day?
E: smiling
C: GINGER
D: Come here, wimp.
E: softening
N: She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's bad for the other guys' discipline. Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.
C: SARAH
D: Hi, Matt.
N: Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.
C: MATT
D: Heeey! It's my favorite Sarah. Hi, babe.
E: grinning broadly
N: Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.
C: GINGER
D: Alright, warm-ups are over. Back to work, Bunky.
N: Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.
C: MATT
D: 'Bye beautiful. You too, Ginger.
N: Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.
C: WEIGHTLIFTER
D: Bunky?

S: EXT. HEALTH CLUB/STREETS - DUSK
N: Sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double. They swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through the bumper-to-bumper traffic. Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable. Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the near-misses. She does both.
T: CUT TO:
S: 44 EXT. STREET/CONSTRUCTION SIGHT - DUSK
N: On a side street the girls pass an excavation site between high-rises. They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade. In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching the powerful machines moving earth. He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site. Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights. A power-shovel moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GREY SEDAN
N: Reese sits motionless in the dark. Waiting. The clock in the dash ticks quietly. He flips on the radio. A fatuous POP ROCK STATION. Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor. His over- coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside him. His bare arms are sinewy and scarred. Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN. He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women. Fantasy women. Svelte and seamless. The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended whiskeys. His head sags against the door. He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they chew through the dirt. The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MELTED RUINS - NIGHT
N: TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris. The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of HUMAN BONES, burned black. There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent electronic WHINE. Incredibly bright searchlights play over the ground. PANNING with the moving treads through twisted wreckage, F.G. The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close. As the debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME, EXTREME F.G. The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably by the explosion. The wearer rips it off, revealing a younger Reese, minus his burn scar. His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle. The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates, casualties, unit placements, medic requests. Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself. DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage. Reese looks up. Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights. Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer mobile ground-unit. Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows and knees, past mounds of charred skulls. They pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center- punched with a smoking hole. The boy clutches a rifle. More bodies. Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs. WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN. They're all dirty and gaunt, scabrous. And still bleeding. Reese scrabbles past a dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it. Some of them are sobbing, or screaming. Another EXPLOSION. The GLARE lights the huddled few. Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been invented yet. Soldiers in a nightmare war. Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having outflanked the massive H-K. Its flashing blue lights flick across the walls, its searchlights sear through the debris. WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS. Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its path. One tread rolls over the explosive. Guns and searchlights swivel. The head turns ponderously. Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers. A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING HER INTO RED MIST. Reese is knocked down by the concussion. Gets up, running, as the charges blow. The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART. It lurches to a stop, burning. The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.
T: CUT FAST. IMPRESSIONS ONLY.
N: Running. Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs. ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers. LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter- part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE. Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN. It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless. The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly. They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through. Reese drives like a demon. Under other circumstances it would be considered insane. Here it is merely very good. The machine gun CHATTERS. A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights. A BOLT OF LIGHT. Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and crumpling. He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming despite his training. The only other survivor, an emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth to drag Reese out before it burns.

N: Reese's eyes open in a split-second, and suddenly there is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US. Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors of his arrival, and blinks at the boy. The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore. He backs away. We see that he is straddling a bicycle.

N: Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom, becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up. Ginger has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place, and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair. She is wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs. Sarah is in a skirt and bra. The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room to get it.

E: answering the phone
C: VOICE
D: First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts...

S: 56 EXT. VENICE STREET - NIGHT
N: An unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites in front of a funky Venice apartment building. A small crowd is gathered around the front steps. LIEUTENANT ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and strides through the crowd. He's fiftyish, short, but square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch. He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer. He's homely as an old boot. And he's not a smart cop, he's a wise one; rarer still. The onlookers, gathered patiently for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet, separate for him to pass.

He passes TWO UNIFORMED COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters to find a quiet flurry of activity. Several DETECTIVES and a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures. In the center of the living room floor is the body of a young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood. Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front of her. Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT. TRAXLER. Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

She fumbles in the dark to unlock the chain. She looks up. Did she hear something...masked by the rattle of the chain? POV - SARAH, there is no movement for the length of the garage.

It is Reese, his gaze impassive. Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek. He is motionless, sinister in his long coat. Sarah shudders. She walks on. POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching groups of pedestrians. They seem to be glancing at her. Was it always like that and she just never noticed? C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder. POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY. Reese is gone. She resists the urge to run. On the opposite side of the street an LAPD cruiser glides slowly by.

Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar. her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay phone and dials.

Through the dark living room. She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen. When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment, SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G. TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the counter with her arms full of snack stuff. A SUDDEN CRASH. A flurry of motion behind her. She spins, dropping half her load. Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch. Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet, repeated CLICKING. UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand, right above him. It slashes viciously downward. Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had been.
C: MATT
D: Whoah!
N: Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again. Matt grabs the wrist in both hands. The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of the killer's single arm... And still the blade moves closer to his throat. With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard. HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams his fists together into Terminator's temple. He picks up a brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force. Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt over the bed.

N: Oblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro- phone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT./INT. BALCONY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat and hurls himself upon the intruder. The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling. Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel chest. SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH. An inhuman grip. Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above the other's head.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: DOLLY PRECEDING GINGER as she returns from the kitchen with a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk. CAMERA passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to open the door. AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes through the door right in front of her...Matt's body propelled halfway through the door by enormous force. Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into the air. The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body creates resistance. Ginger SCREAMS and back away. The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with the massive .45 drawn. HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs. TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning with his eyes. BOOM! LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door. LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning. The implacable figure looms behind her. Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror. And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying? Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in a burning stable.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Ginger scrabbles pathetically for a grip on the tile floor as she pulls herself into the bathroom. She clutches the rim of the toilet. LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her. PAN UP, off her. He takes aim. And empties the clip. He calmly reloads.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM
N: CLOSE ON PHONE MACHINE, as the telephone rings loudly in the ensuing silence. Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source of the sound, but doesn't fire.

D: Hi there. Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're talking to a machine...
E: recorded pause
N: C.U. - TERMINATOR, motionless, listening.
C: GINGER'S VOICE
D: ...but don't be shy, it's okay. Machines need love too...
E: recorded, continuing
N: Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body. He turns it over, assuring himself that she is dead.
C: GINGER'S VOICE
D: ...so talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you. Wait for the beep.
E: continuing, recorded
N: There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.
C: SARAH'S VOICE
D: Ginger, this is Sarah...
E: on machine
N: Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening. He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues. TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.
C: SARAH'S VOICE
D: ...I'm in this sleazy bar called Stoker's on Pico but I'm too scared to leave. I'm really scared, kiddo...
E: on machine, contin- uing

E: continuing, B.G.
N: Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents of Sarah's small desk. SIREN'S WAIL, approaching. He picks up a small card. E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with color photo of her. MACRO ON PICTURE. E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down, after a fraction of a second's scan. Picks up something else. TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and slips out the balcony door. Climbing over the railing, he is gone.

N: The yellow Maverick hurtles along an empty street. CLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's face in flaring pulses.
T: CUT TO:

S: INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT
N: The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.
C: WAITRESS
D: Anything else?
N: Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling hands. She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind the bar. TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror. In the F.G. a man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes. It is Reese. He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away. C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic. ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou- etted briefly against a streetlight. Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure. C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer. His knuckles are white. He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat. There is a glint of metal in the shadows within. Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past him, out-of-focus F.G. Sarah looks up. E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel, a caress. His finger slips through the triggerguard of the riot gun. MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G. He sits slowly in the booth opposite her. The angle is OVER HIS SHOULDER.
C: SARAH
D: Lieutenant Vukovich?
E: uncertainly
N: REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich. Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT. Blue eyes so pure and deep. The eyes of a saint, perhaps. The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost in one motion. The bore seems enormous. BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide. We hold a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare. MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi- tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap. HE FIRES. ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES, simultaneously. Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face. Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder. An involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions. Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises from booth. OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires again, advancing on Sarah's booth. Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor. Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth. Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons. He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm. The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering, gaping. Sarah stops screaming. Reese stand motionless, gun aimed. In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud. ON TERMINATOR, very still. Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap. He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire. Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing. A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood. An orgy of shattering glass. Total pandemonium. SEVERAL ANGLES as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence. Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes her wrists. ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI one-handed. Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the UZI. ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches him in the chest. He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her. Reese fires, ducks, fires again. Tables crash over. A window is blown out. A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol behind the bar. It ignites with a WHOOSH. Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun. TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement amid the confusion. He drops a spent clip. Reaches for another with his bloody hand. MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts firing. At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into Terminator's belly.

N: Terminator crashes backwards through two tables and a plate glass window into the street.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT
N: The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly. The air is thick with smoke. Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the fire. He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her. TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical. When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide. C.U. - REESE, very intense.
C: REESE
D: Come with me if you want to live.
N: She looks where he is pointing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STOKER'S BAR/STREET - NIGHT
N: Terminator is rising unsteadily to his feet. Shattered glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood- drenched shirt and coat. C.U. - TERMINATOR, as he slowly look up, his blue eyes riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT

N: PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he clambers back through the window and starts through the burning bar.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT
N: PANAGLIDE MOVING IN ON REESE AND SARAH as he runs, drag- ging her with him, toward the back. REVERSE ON TERMINATOR, DOLLYING as he crashed through the wreckage in the swirling smoke, hurling burning tables out of his way.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY/EXIT CORRIDOR
N: PANAGLIDE FOLLOWING REESE AND SARAH, running headlong through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back hallway. Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to her feet without slowing. He hits a closed door, which crashes open. Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor. Slams and blot-latches it. An instant later an impact from the far side tears the latch-screws half out of the wall. They run on.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Terminator takes a step back from the closed door and slams into it again. It starts to give way. behind him the flames engulf a CAN OF CLEANING SOLVENT.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT./EXT. EXIT CORRIDOR/ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Reese and Sarah pelt down the narrow corridor, fling open the outside door and spin out into the alley. TIGHT ON DOOR at far end. It splinters open and Terminator sprints down the corridor.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The cleaning solvent EXPLODES.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EXIT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: DOLLYING AHEAD OF TERMINATOR, very fast, as he runs full- throttle. Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles down the narrow hallway. He clears the outer door an instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STOKER'S - NIGHT
N: Vukovich's plain car arrives, slewing to a stop in the glass-littered street in front of the blazing building. He leaps out, Traxler right in behind him.

D: What the fuck is going on?
E: shouting
N: TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them. He motions to the nearest one.
C: VUKOVICH
D: Cover the alley in back.
E: continuing
N: He heads for the inferno at a run.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND STOKER'S - NIGHT
N: DOLLYING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they run through the dark alley. Sarah stumbles over trashcans. Reese pulls her along mercilessly. WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner. The B.G. is a blur. The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots. No static angles. Relentless forward motion.
T: CUT TO:
S: 105/FX EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 105/FX
N: Behind them Terminator is moving with inhuman speed, bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other obstacles. TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through total shadow.
T: CUT TO:
S: 106/FX EXT. ALLEY/POV - TERMINATOR (HANDHELD) - NIGHT 106/FX
N: We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese are just ahead of us. But the image is bizarre, alien. Bright and hyper-real. There is a hint of digitization, and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the background, suggesting infra-red. The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT- type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms. The data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow. There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see. The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are digitized and enhanced as well.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley. This one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to the street. There is little room to run. Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells. Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining. LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair. As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard, pitching her on her face to the pavement. He flings open the car door...a shield. Drops to the ground. Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row just before Terminator reaches it. The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire. An inferno funneled between the enclosing walls. ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames roar over the hood. ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the wall of flame. Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car. Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN. The engine catches. A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames. Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead, impacts on the hood of Reese's car. His hair and coat are burning.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT./EXT. GREY SEDAN/ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle. The car backs down the alley. Terminator draws back his fist. Punches into the windshield. Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist shoots through. The lacerated fingers grope for her. WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER. Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the fingers grasp her blouse and pull. Reese cranks the wheel hard.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: The sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car. Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement. Reese's car shoots forward. PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering minions of the burning building, an arriving fire truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel- erate. Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands. He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry escape.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: LOW WIDE ANGLE on the empty street, which is narrow and tightly lines with parked cars. The ROAR of an engine builds. The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows with its lights off, doing ninety plus.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT
N: Sarah is in a daze. Paralyzed. Face bloodless. She is shivering silently, uncontrollably. Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window.
C: REESE
D: Hold on.
E: calmly
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
N: WIDE ANGLE, CLOSE TO SEDAN, and following it as it hurtles around a corner in an expertly controlled slide. Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street. Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car ahead and oncoming traffic. A dive into another dark side street.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GRAY SEDAN - NIGHT
N: Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption. His eyes flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back ...and the world spins outside. With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a clipped, military voice.
C: REESE
D: Are you injured? Are you shot?
N: No response. He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs, chest. Sarah flinches. She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER. She pushes his hand away and opens the door. Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her. Hard.
C: REESE
D: Do exactly what I say. Exactly. Don't move un- less I say. Don't make a sound unless I say. Do you understand?
E: continuing
N: As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would for a child. She doesn't answer.
C: REESE
D: Do you understand?
E: continuing/ shouting
C: SARAH
D: Yes. Don't hurt me.
E: a whisper
C: REESE
D: I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...

C: REESE
D: Assigned to protect you. You've been targetted for termination.
E: continuing
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT
N: The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police cruiser parked on the street beyond. Firelight from the back of Stoker's lights the street garishly. A young cop stands beside the car talking via radio with the mike cord pulled through the side window. He speaks with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.
C: COP
D: ...I don't know, it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley, the paint on the wall's starting to blister up...
N: The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in front of us. Eyes open. Listening.
C: COP
D: Better get another truck round to this side.
E: continuing
N: Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following. The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over him and opens the door. Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143. Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into gear, and pulls out. CAMERA PRECEDING CAR, HIDE WIDE ANGLE, as it accelerates rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing under it in a staccato rhythm.
T: CUT TO:

C: SARAH
D: This is a mistake. I haven't done anything.

C: REESE
D: No. But you will. It's very important that you live.
N: Sarah closes her eyes, as if to shut it all out.
C: SARAH
D: I can't believe this is happen- ing. How could than man get up after you...
N: Reese's tone is equal parts hatred and respect as he replies.
C: REESE
D: Not a man. A Terminator. Cyber Dynamics Model 101.

N: Terminator drives expressionlessly, monitoring the babble from Central Dispatch. He hears his number.
C: DISPATCHER
D: ...Suspect vehicle sighted on Motor at Pico, southbound. Units Two-Zero-Six and Five- Seven, attempt intercept. Unit One-Four-Three, come in.

C: TERMINATOR
D: This is One-Four-Three. West- bound on Olympic, approaching Overland.

C: SARAH
D: But...he was bleeding.
N: At that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above. Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a CHP cruiser coming alongside.
C: REESE
D: Just a second. Keep your head down.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
N: The helicopter is right above the, its spotlight burning on Reese. The cruiser flanks them, closing. Reese peels off to the right, inches in front of a tractor-trailer rig, brakes hard and slides into a four-wheel drift through a curving off-ramp. The helicopter banks, following. The cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad- side into the guardrail. Out of action.

E: cutting her off
C: SARAH
D: Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
C: REESE
D: No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.
N: Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool.
C: SARAH
D: So, it's from the future, is that right?
C: REESE
D: One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.
C: SARAH
D: And you're from the future too?
C: REESE
D: Right.
N: They come to a red light and Reese stops.
C: SARAH
D: Right...
E: patronizingly
N: Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react. He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. His grip doesn't slacken. Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door. His face shows no reaction. Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face. The light turns green and Reese drives on. Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.
C: REESE
D: Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't...do that...again.
E: coldly
N: He wipes his hand on his pants.
C: SARAH
D: Just let me go.
E: weakly, plead- ing
C: REESE
D: Listen. Understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.
E: slow, but intense
N: Sarah slump in utter resignation.

N: LOW ANGLE DOLLY, MOVING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they crawl behind a row of parked cars. He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.

He unlocks it and they slip inside.

Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash level. A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats above them. They hear the helicopter circling closer.
C: SARAH
D: Reese...why me? Why does it want me?

D: I don't understand...
C: REESE
D: Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
N: Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military briefing, quieter.
C: REESE
D: Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the H-K's.
E: continuing
C: SARAH
D: The what?
C: REESE
D: Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
N: He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm. Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto- matic-pricing marks on product packages.
C: REESE
D: Burned in by laser scan. Some of us were kept alive... to work. Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day. We were that close to going out forever...
E: continuing pause
N: The helicopter moves overhead. Its searchlight illum- inates the car interior, moves on. Before the rotor sound fads, Reese starts the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Several black-and-whites are moving among the parked cars, slowly. ANGLE ON TERMINATOR'S CRUISER rolling along just above idle. He peers into the row of cars, listening and seeing on level we can't.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BROWN BUICK - NIGHT
N: Reese is holding onto Sarah's shoulder tightly.
C: REESE
D: ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight. To storm the wire of the camps. To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk. He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor. John Connor... your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
E: continuing pause
N: Sarah stared at him.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The brown Buick is F.G. as the nose of Terminator's cruiser appears behind it, moving slowly. C.U. - TERMINATOR, scanning. LOW ANGLE, past the back of the Buick, as Terminator cruises by. The tailpipe, F.G., puffs quietly. Terminator's head snaps around. His eyes lock on Reese's car. He reaches for his shotgun.
T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars, approaching the exit. The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car. Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled. He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored. The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD. The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into a parked truck. TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around heading for the exit. SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react. The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars. Cruisers race to converge.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: LOW WIDE ANGLE, PRECEDING REESE'S BUICK as it hits the street, accelerating. Terminator's cruiser slides out behind it, fishtails, races forward. Engines roar as the cars go flat out. Buildings lining the street become a blur. The chopper arcs in behind them. Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit one by one. LOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges across all lanes ahead of it. Terminator gaining. They run an intersection at a hundred plus.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUICK - NIGHT
N: Reese is feeding his last two shells into the riot gun.

N: Holding the gun is both hands he leans out the window, still keeping the throttle mashed down. Sarah grabs the wheel, fighting to control the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET/BUICK - NIGHT

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET/CARS - NIGHT
N: MOVING WITH BOTH CARS as the Buick skids with rear tires locked. Reese and Terminator FIRE simultaneously. TIGHT ON REESE as the doorpost next to his shoulder is torn out by the other's blast. ON TERMINATOR, leaning to see around his shattered wind- shield. Too late. He hurtles into the intersection, past the skidding Buick. Clips the back of the semi. Spins radically. Vaults the curb in a screeching front-end roll. WHIP-PANNING WITH THE CRUISER as it crashes upside-down through the counter area of an A & W. LOW ANGLE as Reese and Sarah slide to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke. Transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood. An instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of LAPD, SHERIFF'S DEPT., and CHP CARS. The helicopter hovers overhead. MEDIUM ON SARAH AND REESE, he raises his hands, through the side window, in plain sight. A phalanx of cops, guns drawn, approaches the car warily. Sarah looks at Reese. Then at the cops. She opens the door and runs, staggering, toward them. Vukovich steps forward and pulls her away to safety. C.U. - REESE watching her go as a cop eases his door open.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. A & W - NIGHT
N: Two cops approach the overturned squad car jammed into the wreckage of the small building. They shine their flashlights inside. It is empty. The cyborg has VANISHED. A sign which reads 'DRIVE IN' detaches from an awning and crashed down across the crushed auto.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. VUKOVICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite Vukovich's desk. Motionless. Her eyes are fixed on the middle distance. She's been crying. Now she's emptied out. The door opens. At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes involuntarily. Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist. Silberman is smooth of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat. He is enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly. Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee. He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.
C: VUKOVICH
D: Here, drink some of this...
C: SARAH
D: Lieutenant, are you sure it's them? Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
E: voice flat, desperate
C: VUKOVICH
D: They've already been identi- fied. There's no doubt.
N: Sarah begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.
C: SARAH
D: Of, God...Ginger...kiddo, I'm so sorry.
E: to herself
N: Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and it starts to spill.
C: VUKOVICH
D: Sarah. Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man. I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you. Do you feel up to it?
E: gently pause
C: SARAH
D: I guess so. You're a doctor?
E: almost in- audible to Silberman
C: SILBERMAN
D: A criminal psychologist.
C: SARAH
D: Is Reese crazy?
C: SILBERMAN
D: That's what we're going to find out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of strategic value. A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the single BARE LIGHT BULB. It's Terminator, and he's a mess. A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest, shoulder and right wrist. MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table under the light. His eyebrows are singed off. Hair a charred stubble. Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards. Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS. He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props. one elbow on the table. ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam- ines it. He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into the skin of his forearm. His expression is one of mild concentration. E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS. They slide as he moves his fingers. RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the blood. With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis- assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DIVISION HQ/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: The room is small, furnished with only a table and two chairs. Reese, his arms handcuffed behind him, sits opposite Dr. Silberman. Behind Silberman is a large mirror. A DETECTIVE leans against the wall.
C: SILBERMAN
D: So. You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

D: And who was the enemy?
C: REESE
D: SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series
C: SILBERMAN
D: I see. And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived? A sort of retroactive abortion?
E: gravely

T: CUT TO:
S: 157 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
C: REESE
D: ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
C: SILBERMAN
D: Then how are you supposed to get back?
C: REESE
D: Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
T: CUT TO:
S: 158 INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: E.C.U. - TERMINATOR, in profile, showing his lacerated eye. He is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring intently. MACRO - X-ACTO KNIFE lying on the dresser. Terminator's fingers lift it. CAMERA TILTS TO FOLLOW as it rises to his face, holds TIGHT ON left eye. With a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part of the damaged eyelids. He wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision. Revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in a chrome socket by tiny servos. The eye whirs quietly as it tracks. SEQUENCE OF SHOTS, showing various repairs. Terminator's right hand, its wrist SUTURED crudely, holds a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal wound out of frame below. He slips a glove over the damaged hand. A motoring cap over the blistered scalp. A fresh shirt to hide his body wounds. This is followed by a new overcoat. C.U. - TERMINATOR, contemplating his reflection in the mirror. With the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up, and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt...though a bit gaunt and pale. A turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye in its metal socket into view. He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses. FULL SHOT as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained mattress. He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the AR-180 and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape.

E: excited
N: He starts the tape again.
C: SILBERMAN
D: Why were the other two women killed?
E: recorded
C: REESE
D: Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic.

C: VUKOVICH
D: Sarah, this is body armor. Out TAC guys wear it. It'll stop a 12 gauge round. This other individual must've had one under his coat.
N: Sarah want to believe him. God help her if he's wrong.
C: SARAH
D: But what about him punching through the windshield?
C: TRAXLER
D: Probably on PCP, broke every bone in his hand and won't feel it for hours. There was this guy once that...
E: shrugs
N: Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah on the bench.

S: INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT FOYER - NIGHT
N: Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK SERGEANT'S counter. The Sergeant hits a button and there is a loud BULL-CLACK. The electric bolt on the security door opens and Silberman steps out. As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in the front door. He glances at the pale apparition in cap and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on. Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances up when he speaks.
C: TERMINATOR
D: I'm a friend of Sarah Connor. I was told she is here. Can I see her, please?
C: SERGEANT
D: You can't see here. She's making a statement.
C: TERMINATOR
D: Where is she?
C: SERGEANT
D: Look. It's gonna be a while. You wanna wait. There's a bench.
E: laconically
N: Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric door, the rooms beyond.
C: TERMINATOR
D: I'll come back.
N: He turns and walks out through the front doors. ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights get BRIGHTER outside the doors. RAPIDLY. He glances up at the last second as the glare falls fully on him. CRASH! Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car smashes into the foyer. It blasts through the sergeant's booth, crushing him in the wreckage.

S: INT. DIVISION HQ/CORRIDOR
N: Through the hole in the splintered wall we see Terminator leap out of the car. He vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the wall. Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments. He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the .38 in the other. The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling. LOW ANGLE DOLLY, preceding him as he starts down the corridor. ANGLE ON LOUNGE DOORWAY as TWO COPS run into the hall, one carrying a cup of coffee. Terminator fires a burst from the assault rifle. ANGLE ON COPS - They are flung backward in a spray of coffee and plaster.

N: Terminator steps over the bodies of the two cops without breaking stride. OVER HIS SHOULDER, MOVING WITH HIM as he walks down the hall. Comes to a door. Tries it. Locked. Kicks it in. A DESK COP, drawing his gun, sprints for cover. ANGLE ON TERMINATOR raising the AR-180.

N: Terminator rips the cover off the station's main electrical panel. He pulls loose the hose-like 440 volt incoming line and feeds it directly into the lighting circuit.

Getting closer. SLOW DOLLY IN ON SARAH begins, ending in TIGHT C.U. as the sounds get louder. More SHOTS. Smoke begins to seep under the door. DETAIL - DOORKNOB rattling as it is tried from outside. E.C.U. - SARAH stifling a cry. She flinches as if slapped as SHOTS sound. DETAIL - DOOR KNOB, a series of SHOTS shatter the lock.

N: FAST PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he runs through the smoky rooms. A fire is burning, lighting everything a flickering orange. He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance. PAN to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to his shoulder. B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring away across the parking lot. TIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully. He pulls the trigger. It clicks...empty. Slowly he lowers the scope-sight from his eye and watches them go. Terminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks away as the fire spreads behind the windows of Division Headquarters.

Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight. He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first aid kit. Then he slams the trunk. Reaching through the side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off the shoulder, over the embankment. DOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis- appear among the trees. Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A. A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind. They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete, facing each other. They look beaten, grimy, exhausted. She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

D: You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
E: thoughtful
C: SARAH
D: Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
C: REESE
D: John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...
C: SARAH
D: Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
E: interrupting
C: REESE
D: I volunteered.
C: SARAH
D: You volunteered?
C: REESE
D: It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war.
N: She stops taping. She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.
C: SARAH
D: You talk about things I haven't done yet in the past tense. It's making me crazy. I can't think. Are you sure you've got the right person?
E: pause
N: Reese appraises her coldly.
C: REESE
D: I'm sure.
C: SARAH
D: Come on, me? The mother of the future? Am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook. I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
N: She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.
C: REESE
D: Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight.
C: SARAH
D: And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
C: REESE
D: You'll learn.
C: SARAH
D: Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
E: angry
C: REESE
D: John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.' That's all.
N: Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real to her. Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.
C: REESE
D: Good field-dressing.
E: continuing
C: SARAH
D: You like it? It's my first.
E: brightening
N: He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth- conserving embrace. Sarah gazes out the entrance, into the night.
C: REESE
D: Sleep. It'll be light soon.
C: SARAH
D: Okay. Talk some more.
E: closing her eyes
C: REESE
D: About what?
C: SARAH
D: About where you're from.
E: murmuring
N: Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.
C: REESE
D: Alright. You stay down by day, but at night you can move around. The H-K's use infra-red so you still have to watch out. But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them them. That's when the infiltra- tors started to appear. The Terminators were the newest, the worst...
E: pause
N: During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving black. A ROTOR ROAR fades up.
T: CUT IN BLACK TO:
S: 183/FX EXT. CITY RUINS, 2029 - NIGHT 183/FX
N: Black sky. Stars. With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead. It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search- lights which stab down. TILT DOWN to a vista of moonlit devastation. White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins. Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps. Searchlights sweep the night. Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing tracers into the ruins.
T: CUT TO:
S: 184/FX EXT. RUINS/STREET - NIGHT 184/FX
N: LOW ANGLE as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt skulls. Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the buildings. Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its 'torso'. After it passes a number of human figures dart from shadow to shadow, B.G.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT
N: Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered tunnel. PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of tunnels, pass several guard-posts. Reese has a GERMAN SHEPHERD on a short leash.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
N: The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking structure, in which a large group is gathering. As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns. Weapons are left at the sentry post. FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter. He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons. There are conventional military vehicles as well. He passes several family groups. Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET. Its glow bathes them. REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a small cookfire crackles inside the shell. Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it with a stick. Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle, a worn photograph. C.U. - REESE, gazing down. His head snaps around at the sudden sound of BARKING. ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.
C: SENTRY
D: Terminator!
E: shouting
N: An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE. He opens FIRE, running forward. ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd. MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.
T: RAPID CUTS:
N: POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people. Beams sear the darkness. A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit. ANGLE ON REESE running. He levels his energy-rifle and starts firing. A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING a support column behind him. Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES as Reese tumbles. Everything is lit as if by lightning. C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious. Burned. Bleeding. Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream- ing, a burning dog howling. DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen, forgotten. It catches fire and starts to curl. Before the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah. Reese looks up. A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish glare. THE TERMINATOR. Its eyes glow red. A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CULVERT - DAWN
N: C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight. Asleep. She grimaces and groans. In the distance a dog is barking. Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her face. An uncharacteristically tender gesture. He gently caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers. When she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away. Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented. Looks up at Reese.
C: SARAH
D: I was dreaming about dogs.
N: Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the culvert.
C: REESE
D: We used them to spot Terminators.
N: Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.
C: SARAH
D: Your world...it's pretty terrifying.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN
N: Sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and stop an approaching car. She pulls his gun hand down with both of hers.
C: SARAH
D: Put that away. I'll get one.
N: She hold out her thumb to passing traffic. Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.
C: SARAH
D: This works...really.
E: continuing
T: CUT TO:
S: 189A EXT. HIGHWAY/PICKUP - DAY 189A
N: Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer. Laid- back, long-haired and well-tanned. Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.
C: DRIVER
D: ...and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there. Not awesome, but I mean, worth the drive, if you're hardcore like me.
C: REESE
D: Rad tubes?
E: to Sarah
C: SARAH
D: He's a surfer.
E: to Reese
C: DRIVER
D: You from back East of something?
C: SARAH
D: No, he's from the future.
C: DRIVER
D: Whoah. I hear that. Listen, I had a rough night. I gotta stop and bag some Z's.
E: pause
N: They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
N: The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling stretch of meadows and woods. It consists of a bunker- like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA, beyond which are WOODS. People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day while children tear around after the forced inactivity of a long trip. The three of them get out on unsteady legs.
C: DRIVER
D: You can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours.
C: SARAH
D: Thanks.
C: REESE
D: Bag some Z's?
C: SARAH
D: Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
N: She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her inside.
C: REESE
D: Yours is over there.
E: pushing him out
N: Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room, Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain. A bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. Reese shambles through them like a zombie. He stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear. He watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music. Kids squeal. Dogs bark.
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: Can you get my balloon?
E: V.O.
N: DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about four. She points above his head. Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him. He pulls it down by the string and holds it, turning it over dully. He crouches down to her eye-level. She smiles.
C: REESE
D: Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this?
C: LITTLE GIRL
D: Huh?
N: Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him. The mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands. A teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs. The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares at Reese. She punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off. At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter. Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to go about it.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SERVICE STATION/PAY PHONE - DAY
N: Sarah is talking on an open pay phone.
C: SARAH
D: ...I know, Mom. This is the soonest I could...I know. Mom...Mom, I can't talk long. No, I'm okay. I was on TV? Really? Oh no, I hate that picture... why didn't you give them my graduation picture? I'm okay, really. Listen, I want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days. Just don't...no, don't ask any questions. Just do it. I gotta get going...gotta go. Bye, bye.
E: pause pause pause
N: Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY. On a whim she looks up something. She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing. Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SERVICE STATION/PICNIC TABLE - DAY
N: Sarah is sitting at a table under a tree, lettering something with a lipstick on a cardboard box-flap. E.C.U. - SIGN, as the last letters are finished. It reads: SILICON VALLEY FULL ON SARAH as she retracts the lipstick and leans across to hand it to a girl at the next table.
C: SARAH
D: Thanks a lot.
C: REESE
D: What's that?
E: V.O.
N: Sarah looks up, startled to see him standing beside her.
C: SARAH
D: That's where we're going.
C: REESE
D: Why?
N: Sarah point to the directory page lying on the table. MACRO - PAGE Sarah's finger points to a listing which reads:
C: CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION
D: 18144 El Camino Real, S'Vale
N: ANGLE ON SARAH AND REESE She looks smug.
C: SARAH
D: Look. I found it. Isn't that it? Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
C: REESE
D: What about it?
C: SARAH
D: Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
C: REESE
D: Molecular-memory.
C: SARAH
D: Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
C: REESE
D: That's the way it was told to me.
E: uneasy
N: Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.
C: SARAH
D: Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eighty-six it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something.
C: REESE
D: Tactically dangerous. We lay low.
E: very cold
C: SARAH
D: Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.
C: REESE
D: That's not my mission.
C: SARAH
D: Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me.
E: upset, mocking his manner
N: Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.
C: REESE
D: Let's go. Time to move out.
C: SARAH
D: Fuck you! Let go of me!
N: She jerks her arm free. He reaches for her again but she outdistances him, running.
C: REESE
D: Sarah!
E: warning tone
N: She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her sign. Reese follows her into the woods.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODS/CLEARING - DAY
N: Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over completely. PANNING WITH SARAH as she runs down the path. Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in the long spring grass. She struggles violently to get away.
C: SARAH
D: Let...go...bastard...
N: She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face. Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive crouch. Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his hand.
C: SARAH
D: Oh, that's real smart. Go on, shoot me. That's brilliant.
E: continuing, scared, but angry
N: Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun. Sarah too is shaking with emotion. Tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks.
C: SARAH
D: Jesus Christ, Reese. Can't you see I'm scared?
E: continuing
N: He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides. He turns away.
C: SARAH
D: I can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me...always looking over my shoulder, wondering if I left some tiny clue behind...
E: continuing
N: Reese doesn't respond. The gun slips from his fingers. His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees. The moment stretches. There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.
C: SARAH
D: Reese?
N: She crawls over to him. C.U. - REESE in profile, with Sarah in B.G. His eyes are closed. A tear meanders down his cheek.
C: SARAH
D: Kyle?
E: continuing, quietly
C: REESE
D: I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this...
E: a whisper
N: He gestures at their surroundings.
C: REESE
D: It's...like some dream. This...this...
E: continuing
N: He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.
C: REESE
D: ...and you...all so...beauti- ful. It hurts, Sarah. More than death.
E: continuing
N: He looks are her beseechingly.
C: REESE
D: Don't you understand...it's all gone!
E: continuing
N: Sarah puts her arm around him. She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.
C: SARAH
D: We can change it, Kyle. We have to try.
N: She takes his shoulder in her hands.
C: SARAH
D: There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right? Come on. Let's go, kiddo. Whaddya say?
E: continuing
N: He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TERMINATOR'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Terminator sits in his room with the blinds drawn tight. Murky. Claustrophobic. With knife-slits of hot sunlight. MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR sitting on the edge of the bed. His appearance isn't improving. A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath. A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips. He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every two seconds. C.U. - TERMINATOR his eyes tracking rapidly. His skin is waxy, WHITE, BRUISED, GANGRENOUS in places. He ignores the FEW FLIES crawling on his face.
T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: 200 EXT. MOTEL - DAY
N: The two fugitives walk toward an economy motel of the two-story park-by-the-door variety. Sarah turns to wave as a TRACTOR-TRAILER pulls away noisily, heading back to the Interstate. The driver answers her wave out the side window. Reese stops for a moment outside the motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch. The dog wags its tail and licks his hand. Reese opens the door and they go in.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MOTEL OFFICE - DAY
N: Reese pulls a crumpled wad of bills from his jeans and shows it to Sarah.
C: REESE
D: Is this enough?
C: SARAH
D: Yes. And I don't want to know where you got it.
N: She turns to the desk clerk, a female version of the pawn- shop lizard.

E: to clerk

N: Kyle and Sarah enter the spartan room.
C: SARAH
D: I'm dying for a shower. You could use one too. And we'd better check that bandage.
C: REESE
D: Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this.
N: He hands her the .38 he took off the detective. She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest idea of how to use it. She lays it gently on the dresser. As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it is pointing the other way. Sarah moves the curtain slightly and looks outside.
T: CUT TO:

D: But honey, I need to know where I can reach you or I'll be worried sick. It turns out I can't stay up here...the electricity's off...and I don't know just where I'll be.

E: V.O. filtered
N: The PAN comes to a table. Smashed plates. Spilled coffee. A spatter of blood. A phone. It follows the phone cord onto Terminator in CLOSE-UP as he continues in a perfect simulation of her mother's voice...
C: TERMINATOR
D: I love you too, sweetheart.
E: MOTHER'S VOICE

N: TIGHT ON SEVERAL GROCERY BAGS covering the counter beside the hot-plate in the tiny apartment. Reese's hands split one open and its contents spill out. FULL SHOT Sarah looks through Reese's haul.
C: SARAH
D: Let's see. Corn syrup. Ammonia. Moth balls... Mmm. What's for dinner?
C: REESE
D: Plastique.
E: preoccupied
N: There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape, scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils, substances, chemicals.
C: SARAH

N: The dashlight illuminated Terminator from beneath as he drives through the night. He looks like Death. His left eye glows a faint red in the darkness.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: A heartwarming domestic scene. Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a worktable. Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen, B.G. On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end. Kyle is showing Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe bombs and seal them shut.
C: REESE
D: Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
C: SARAH
D: You must have had a fun child- hood.
C: REESE
D: That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
C: SARAH
D: I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
C: REESE
D: Hot dogs?
C: SARAH
D: I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done. You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
C: REESE
D: My whole life has been combat.
C: SARAH
D: I want it to be over for you.
C: REESE
D: Not possible.
C: SARAH
D: I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now. Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
N: Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze. He reaches out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to comfort her. But he turns her wrist to read her watch.
C: REESE
D: We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want. I'll finish.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished. A nylon satchel lies nearby. The mess is cleaned up. WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the window. The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside. Sarah is asleep on the bed. Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid. The image of discipline. The .357 is held loosely in one hand on his lap. There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder. Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness. He looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.
C: SARAH
D: He'll find us, won't he?
C: REESE
D: Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed...
C: SARAH
D: Don't say that.
C: REESE
D: If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one.
C: SARAH
D: It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.
C: REESE
D: No. I'm not.
N: Several beats before Sarah speaks again. Her eyes seem luminous in the dark.
C: SARAH
D: Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
E: softly
C: REESE
D: Good fighters.
C: SARAH
D: That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
C: REESE
D: Someone?
C: SARAH
D: A girl. You know.
C: REESE
D: No. Never.
E: mechanically pause
N: He looks away, outside the window
C: SARAH
D: I'm sorry.
E: softly
N: Sarah studies him for a moment. She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips.
C: SARAH
D: So much pain.
C: REESE
D: Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
C: SARAH
D: And so you feel nothing.
C: REESE
D: It's better that way.
C: SARAH
D: Oh, Kyle.
E: with great sympathy
N: Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.
C: REESE
D: John Connor gave me a picture of you once. I never knew why. It was very old. Torn. Faded. You were young, like you are now. You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second.
N: He closes his eyes, reaches toward her. His fingertips trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.
C: REESE
D: I memorized every line, every curve...
E: continuing
N: He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.
C: REESE
D: Sarah, I came across time for you. I love you. I always have.
E: continuing
N: Sarah is quietly overwhelmed. Reese looks away.
C: REESE
D: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said...
E: continuing
C: SARAH
D: Kyle...
N: She leans forward and kisses him. His face is frozen. A mask. She continues, tenderly. He begins to respond. The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling embrace, clinging to her like life itself. Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed. She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips. He unbuttons her blouse very slowly. Sarah guides his powerful hands over her. A SEQUENCE OF CUTS. DETAILS. IMPRESSIONS. Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony. Reese, his face rapt. His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it. It is explosive, torrential. A confluence of fate and will.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM/LATER - NIGHT
N: TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms. Lying across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close drowsily.
C: SARAH
D: I bet you're ticklish.
C: REESE
D: Ticklish?
E: uncompre- hending
N: Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME. After a moment Reese looks down, puzzled.
C: REESE
D: What are you doing?
C: SARAH
D: You'll beg for mercy in a second.
E: continuing doggedly
N: Reese seems unperturbed. Finally he begins to squirm.
C: REESE
D: I don't think I like this.
C: SARAH
D: You're not supposed to.
N: Now Reese is becoming desperate. A grimace spreads across his face. It becomes a grin. Then he's laughing, trying to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing together. Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might have been, in another life. A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside. Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes alert. Feral as ever.

N: The digitized view is image-intensified, bright and stark as a lunar landscape. PAN OFF the lunging dog to the row of rooms facing the parking lot. HANDHELD as we approach the doors. It is WIDE ANGLE and the barrel of the AR-180 is visible at the bottom of FRAME. The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as we pass. The POV approaches a door. Number 14. The door is KICKED OPEN. Moving inside. The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct forms on the bed. Staccato glare. Approaching the bed. Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows. The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves toward it. Through the door. Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

S: INT./EXT. FREEWAY/PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Reese slides the truck into an ON-RAMP and guns in onto the freeway, burying the throttle. Traffic is light...a few 18-wheelers. The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it. They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow. ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward. An interchange flashes by in an instant. PACING WITH THE TRUCK, looking back as a single headlight arcs radically across all lanes behind them and grows BRIGHTER, CLOSING.

N: WIDE ANGLE, following close to Terminator, as he closes on the pickup, B.G. The truck swerves suddenly, diving around a TRACTOR-TRAILER. Terminator leans hard to follow. LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they swerve as high speed. Reese uses the slow semis as static obstacles. He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING. ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead. HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT and then skids LEFT. He slides toward the trailer in a FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right. M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES. SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across it as the pickup vanishes behind. Terminator skids the bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an OFF-RAMP.

Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that bares metal, the FIRES. Bullets rake the pickup. The windows are blown out. The side mirror explodes. Reese is hit. Drops the .357. Sarah screams and weaves, barely in control.

It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded. Terminator draws the .38. Takes aim. Sarah SCREAMS. HITS THE BREAKS HARD. CRANKS THE WHEEL. GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire. SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL. Terminator goes over the handle bars at a hundred miles per hour.

S: EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
N: From the railing Sarah sees the tanker below as a body falls beside it, rolling. The truck swings in a slow arc. TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE. Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway. She stares in numb horror. The nightmare refuses to end. She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat, shredded by a crumpled fender. She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE MOTORCYCLES. Finds them above the sun visor. Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the motorcycle strap-downs frantically. Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck. It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully. Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts it upright. KICKS the engine over. LOW ANGLE as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts UP THE OVERPASS. Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor. She kicks for her life. The bike catches for a moment. Dies. The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade. Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke. Again and again, furiously. The engine CATCHES.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
N: The tanker is twenty feet behind them as they clear the tunnel. Sarah dodges to one side and LOCKS THE BRAKES. The bike slides, fish-tailing. The truck roars past, hitting the air-brakes. The trailers force her closer and closer to the guardrail as Terminator tries to sandwich her. The bike slides to a stop. The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail right in front of Sarah. Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across all four lances behind the stopped semi.
T: CUT TO:

N: Sarah and Kyle scramble up and run across the STORAGE LOT of a MODERN FACTORY COMPLEX of LOW BUILDINGS. Kyle struggles to keep up, holding the satchel. LIKE A JUGGERNAUT the truck follows, smashing through parked cars and FLATTENING A PRE-FAB STORAGE BUILDING. They enter an alley-like space between two buildings. Kyle is fumbling to open the satchel. ANGLE BACK as the tanker enters the alley. It TEARS THE CORNER OFF ONE BUILDING as it turns in. Terminator looks down from his mountain of steel.

N: Reese crouches in a TRASH-DUMPSTER which is sandwiched between the wall and the tanker. There are only inches of clearance as the trailers pass by. He lights a PIPE CHARGE, jumps up and wedges it under the tank-cylinder of the second trailer. He ducks as it rolls on. Sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights. E.C.U. - PIPE BOMB, the fuse burning. M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, through the windshield, his eye glowing. C.U. - REESE huddles in the dumpster.

The dumpster topples and Kyle rolls out, surrounded by fire. 248/FX SEQUENCE - TERMINATOR 248/FX In the center of the inferno Terminator struggles violently. His FLESH FIRES AND SIZZLES. He tears loose from the TWISTED WRECKAGE and collapses to the ground. Sinks into a CHARRED MASS. STOPS MOVING. C.U. - TERMINATOR, mouth open, skull-like, motionless in the flames.

M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling from him like burning leaves. His gleaming structure is revealed in all its intricacy. No longer a 'He', but an 'It'. It looks like Death rendered in steel. A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF FLEXIBLE CABLE. In the sockets of the metal skull, the eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing red now. It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

They enter dark OFFICES to the sound of ALARMS and DISTANT SIRENS.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT
N: Sarah and Kyle run down a corridor. Through a door, which they close and lock. They move off down a cross-corridor. The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and staggers through. It starts after their receding figures as they round the corner at the end of the hall.

N: Sarah and Kyle look back at the sound of SHATTERING GLASS. PANAGLIDE PRECEDING THE TERMINATOR as it crashes forward, line-of-sight, through the maze. It splinters partitions. Flings desks out of the way. FOLLOWING SARAH AND KYLE as they reach a heavy FIREDOOR and go through.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MANUFACTURING AREA - NIGHT
N: Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor. Behind them are acres of machinery in darkness. Silence. CRASH! The Terminator hits the door from the far side. Hinges SQUEAL. Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it. Starts throwing switches. Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.

D: What are you doing?
E: panting
C: REESE
D: Cover...our footsteps...
E: weakly
N: He sags, sliding down the wall. She pulls him up. Half-carries him into the maze of machines. The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES, SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing mindlessly. Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to support him.
C: REESE
D: Leave me here.

E: continuing
N: She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.
C: SARAH
D: Move! Reese! Let's go. Move you ass!
E: continuing
N: She drags him to his feet and he staggers on. Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward. The Terminator scans the darkness. ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through the machines. The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically. Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery. Kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon. As they climb out onto a cat- walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over an innocuous CONTROL PANEL. Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON. With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams down an inch from her hand. Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk. The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non- rhythmic sound. Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the door there locked.
C: SARAH
D: Come on!
N: They double back to escape the cul-de-sac. The Terminator steps in front of them, cutting them off.
C: REESE

D: Run, damn it!

C: STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
D: Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.
N: ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to the factory floor twenty feet below. Sarah turns and runs. LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him. E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING. C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G. His eyes snap open. Sarah falls, gets up, runs on. The Terminator draws back for a death blow. And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising the pipe bomb he has been cradling. He jams it between two hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored rib- cage. Then rolls off the catwalk. Terminator has an instant to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES. Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the floor. Slams up against one wall. A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her. Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain- ing down. C.U. - SARAH, very still. She winces and opens her eyes. Slowly looks up. POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears. The Terminator is GONE. Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about. Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's body. LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above. Kyle's eyes are half-open. Still. His face peaceful. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD. It begins to rain. C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her. She looks down. Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED PIECE OF METAL. Shrapnel. Part of the cyborg. She pulls it out, grimacing. Her leg is broken. It is a long time before she can gather the will to move. SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away, beyond the debris from the explosion. She starts to crawl toward it. She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G. ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly! Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted metal. IT LUNGES FOR HER! Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob. The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel fingers clutching. Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away, crawling in agony. ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk onto the MOVING STRIP. She is carried into the intricate lattice of equipment. Sarah rolls off weakly before going under a set of sorting rollers. ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls after her, dragging its body. It tracks her unerringly, EYES GLOWING. Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery. Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and unforgiving mechanisms of steel. The Terminator clambers through after her. C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches sight of something. A familiar CONTROL BOX. She drags herself toward it. C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny crawl space. No way out. It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK. Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER. She is jammed in a corner. Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel, seeking the RED BUTTON. E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON. ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out. E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in that infinite instant. She clenches her teeth to keep from screaming as she WAITS. The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush the life out of her and end its long mission.
C: SARAH
D: You're...terminated...fucker!
E: voice icy
N: E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down. FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS. THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN! Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head and body like tin-foil. The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid. Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround- ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch. All the Terminator's energy is released in one second. ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates: a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT. TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably. The steel fingers are frozen an inch from her throat. She can only stare as water runs over her.

E: V.O.
N: COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station. All of its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish. Beyond lies an expanse of scrub desert. The sky scowls with an impending storm. Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark- complected attendant laconically fills her tank. She cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of her SWOLLEN BELLY. She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG. Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her breast. She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances her way. A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped boxes and suitcases.
C: SARAH
D: Should I tell you about your father? That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be. God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...
E: continuing
N: CLICK. WHIR. Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking her reverie. A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture with a beat-up Polaroid camera. He holds it out to her, speaking rapid Spanish.
C: ATTENDANT
D: He says you are very beautiful, Senora, and he is ashamed to ask five American dollars for this picture, but if he does not, his father will beat him.
C: SARAH
D: That's a pretty good hustle, kid. Four. Quatro.
N: The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop. It is a good photograph of her, the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought- ful, slightly sad. We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029. She slips it into her short pocket.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars American.
N: As she pays him, distant thunder rolls. The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

N: Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert. Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

N: CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the flat desert on a ribbon of highway. A brilliant flash crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the world.
