T: FADE UP ON:
N: The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver, dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways. On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic- looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his friend, CLAY (15). Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.
S: INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: They walk inside. We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another room.
S: INT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER
N: Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to powder. Laser watches.
C: LASER
D: I don't know, dude.
N: Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
C: CLAY
D: B minus in geometry, yo! This shits the bomb!
N: Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort. Then hands the rolled up bill to Laser.
C: CLAY
D: Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room. She pours over a game of Scrabble. Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18). Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE. Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her, calculating his next Scrabble move.
C: SASHA
D: Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week.
C: JAI
D: Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...
C: SASHA
D: Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.
C: SASHA
D: Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with?
E: CONT'D flip
N: Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their crush on each other.
C: SASHA
D: What? I'm just asking.
E: CONT'D
C: JAI
D: Uh, maybe because we're friends...
C: SASHA
D: Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.
S: INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER
N: Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad looks back, menacing.
C: CLAY'S FATHER
D: Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.
N: The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
C: CLAY'S FATHER
D: What did I just say?!
E: CONT'D
N: The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the brutal play. Clay laughs manically.
C: CLAY
D: Let me go!
C: CLAY'S FATHER
D: Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
C: CLAY
D: Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face.
N: OMITTED. OMITTED.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM
N: Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned, attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing, Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.
C: JONI
D: Laser! Knock it off!
C: LASER
D: What?! I'm not doing anything.
S: EXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MAGIC HOUR
N: NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: Nic enters. Drops her bag and heads for the table.
C: NIC
D: Hi guys. Sorry I'm late.
C: JULES
D: Don't worry. We just started.
C: NIC
D: 27 fibroids. All in the lining.
N: She kisses Jules.
C: JULES
D: Honey, that's disgusting. We're eating.
C: JONI
D: Did you do that laparoscopically?
C: NIC
D: That's right, Smart Girl. And we got `em all.
N: As Nic settles in...
C: NIC
D: Hey, whose truck is that?
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Mine.
C: NIC
D: Yours?
C: JULES
D: For the business.
C: NIC
D: What business?.. The gardening?
E: getting edgy
C: JONI
D: Isn't it landscaping.
E: protective
C: JULES
D: Yes, thank you very much.
C: NIC
D: Okay... Do we have any Cabarnet left?
E: strained then
C: JULES
D: I didn't look, honey.
N: Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine. Laser's cell phone RINGS. He answers it.
C: LASER
D: Hey, what's up?
N: Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.
C: JULES
D: Laser, no phone calls at the table.
C: LASER
D: Lemme hit you back.
E: into phone
N: Laser hangs up. Nic re-enters with a large glass of red.
C: NIC
D: Who was that?
E: sitting down
C: LASER
D: Nobody. Clay.
N: Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.
C: JULES
D: Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay?
C: LASER
D: What do you mean, "get"?
N: Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.
C: JULES
D: Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow?
C: LASER
D: Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
C: NIC
D: Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts?
C: JONI
D: Not yet. But I will...
C: NIC
D: I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh.
C: JONI
D: Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.
C: NIC
D: Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing.
C: JULES
D: Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go.
C: NIC
D: Okay, I'll let it go... I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes.
E: then
N: Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through increasingly plum-stained teeth.
C: NIC
D: I can't believe my baby's 18.
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: I know...
C: NIC
D: Big girl. You're a big girl...
E: devolving into baby talk
C: JONI
D: Mom...
N: Joni mimes wiping her teeth. Embarrassed, Nic starts licking at her stained teeth.
S: INT. JONI'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.
C: JONI
D: What? Laser looks nervous.
C: LASER
D: Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...?
C: JONI
D: Yeah. I don't want to.
C: LASER
D: Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind.
C: JONI
D: I haven't.
N: He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him. He turns back.
C: LASER
D: How can you not even be curious?
C: JONI
D: Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now. And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings...
E: co-dependent leak
C: LASER
D: God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it!
C: JONI
D: Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay?
C: LASER
D: I never ask you for anything.
N: Laser walks out of the room. Joni feels horrible.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.
C: NIC
D: I just don't understand why you bought the truck now.
C: JULES
D: Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.
C: NIC
D: Okay. It just seems a little cart before the horse.
C: JULES
D: What does that mean?
C: NIC
D: Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet.
C: JULES
D: Well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if!"
C: NIC
D: That's true. I do. You're right.
E: back peddling
N: The women settle back. Nic sees Jules feels bad.
C: NIC
D: Look, I'm sorry. It's good you bought the truck. Its proactive.
E: CONT'D
N: Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.
C: NIC
D: Hey...
E: CONT'D
N: Jules doesn't look at Nic. She keeps her eyes on the T.V.
C: NIC
D: Wanna watch a movie?
E: CONT'D
N: Jules perks up. Nic immediately regrets her suggestion.
C: JULES
D: A movie-movie?
C: NIC
D: Yeah. We haven't done that in a while.
N: MINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV. ANGLE ON - THE TV The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise longue. One guy fellating the other.
S: INT. STAIRCASE - SAME
N: Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer. She rummages though with clear intention. She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."
S: INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: ANGLE ON - THE BED We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket, and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into it, but having a hard time.
C: NIC
D: I don't like the guys in this one. They're too shaved.
C: JULES
D: Don't focus on it.
C: NIC
D: How about the one with the biker gang?
C: JULES
D: We left it in Hawaii.
N: Jules wrestles with the blankets. Wants them out of her way.
C: NIC
D: I'm cold, honey.
E: pulling them back up
C: JULES
D: Sorry. I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.
C: MAN IN MOVIE
D: Suck that fat cock mother-fucker...
C: NIC
D: Shit!! Where's the remote?!
C: MAN IN MOVIE
D: I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!... Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting and 70's disco music blares.
S: INT. OFFICE - JONI
N: Joni turns to the wall, confused. She hears the porno music pulsing though.
S: INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.
C: NIC
D: Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized.
C: NIC
D: The whole neighborhood heard that!
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: No, they didn't.
C: NIC
D: Well, that was a vibe kill.
N: Jules looks defeated.
S: INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big, open grin.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: EXT. FARM - DAY
N: We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni and Laser's biological father.
S: INT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - "WYSIWYG" - DAY
N: Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.
C: PAUL
D: How you doing, foxy?
C: TANYA
D: Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.
C: PAUL
D: Oh, sorry...
C: TANYA
D: No, I like it. It's earthy.
C: PAUL
D: What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.
E: looking at the seating chart
C: TANYA
D: Gonna be tight.
C: PAUL
D: Really...
N: Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen, answering.
C: PAUL
D: Hello.
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?
C: PAUL
D: It is. Who's this?
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank.
C: PAUL
D: Okay. What can I do for you?
C: WENDY
D: I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then...
S: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.
C: WENDY
D: As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent.
N: A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him. Paul nods: "Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.
C: PAUL
D: Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.
S: INT. PANTRY - SAME
N: Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.
C: WENDY
D: Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her.
E: O.S.
N: Paul's speechless.
S: INT. TANYA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Paul and Tanya enjoy a hot, sweaty fuck. LATER THAT NIGHT Paul gets dressed while Tanya lays on her messy bed.
C: TANYA
D: You must of figured you'd get a call at some point.
C: PAUL
D: Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff.
N: Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.
C: TANYA
D: Why? I'd use it.
C: PAUL
D: This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious...
E: ignoring the innuendo
C: TANYA
D: So what are you gonna do?
C: PAUL
D: I don't know.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM
N: Joni and Jules play scrabble at the table. Joni's cell rings. She grabs it off the counter and answers.
C: JONI
D: Hello?
S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
N: Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.
C: PAUL
D: Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.
C: JONI
D: This is she...
C: PAUL
D: Hi. This is Paul... Uh, your donor...?
E: clearing his throat
C: JONI
D: Oh! Hi...
N: Joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room to get some privacy away from her mom.
C: PAUL
D: Is this a good time to talk?
C: JONI
D: Yeah...
E: flustered
C: JULES
D: Where are you going? It's your turn.
N: Joni doesn't answer. She just walks out to her backyard.
C: PAUL
D: So... How are you?
E: doesn't know what to say
C: JONI
D: I'm good. How are you?
C: PAUL
D: I'm well, thanks. Banal, awkward pause. Paul jumps in to fill the void.
C: PAUL
D: So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
E: CONT'D
C: JONI
D: Actually, my brother asked if I'd call you because I'm 18 and he's only 15 which is too young to call-- anyway, he'd like to meet you...if you want to...
C: PAUL
D: Your brother?
E: thrown
C: JONI
D: Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm...
C: PAUL
D: No. I didn't know.
C: JONI
D: Oh.
C: PAUL
D: Both of them?
C: JONI
D: Yeah.
C: PAUL
D: Like in two?
C: JONI
D: Uh huh. Like in gay.
C: PAUL
D: Good deal. I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness. Joni doesn't know what to say.
N: OMITTED.
S: EXT. "WYSIWYG", PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY
N: Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.
C: JONI
D: I just don't want you to have big expectations.
C: LASER
D: Will you quit saying that? I don't have any expectations.
C: JONI
D: Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm...
C: LASER
D: Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo!
S: INT. "WYSIWYG" - DAY
N: Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance. He nervously checks the door as customers enter.
C: MINUTES LATER-
D: Joni and Laser enter the restaurant. They look nervous too.
N: ANGLE ON PAUL He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around. Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction, spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over. The moment is rife. Paul holds out his hand to Joni.
C: PAUL
D: Joni. Hey. Nice to meet you.
C: JONI
D: Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
C: PAUL
D: And Laser, right?
C: LASER
D: Right.
C: PAUL
D: Very cool name.
C: LASER
D: Thanks.
C: PAUL
D: Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next.
C: PAUL
D: Cool, I got a table set up for us out here...
E: CONT'D
N: Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area.
S: EXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER
N: They all sit eating. Paul can't help but study their faces.
C: PAUL
D: Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay? Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want.
E: off their stares
C: LASER/JONI
D: Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.
C: PAUL
D: Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
C: LASER
D: I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions...
C: PAUL
D: That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to?
E: helping him out
C: JONI
D: Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall.
C: PAUL
D: Oh yeah? Congratulations.
C: LASER
D: Joni's the brains in the family. She won a National Merit Scholarship.
C: PAUL
D: Shut the front door!
C: LASER
D: Yeah. And she got like an 800 on her Verbal SAT.
C: JONI
D: Okay, Laser...
C: LASER
D: What? I'm just saying you're really smart.
C: JONI
D: No, I just work harder than you.
C: PAUL
D: Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay.
C: LASER
D: Laser.
E: re: his name
C: PAUL
D: I'm sorry. Laser. So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? Laser freezes. So his sister jumps in.
E: beat
C: JONI
D: Laser's an amazing athlete.
C: PAUL
D: Oh yeah?
C: LASER
D: Did you play any sports in school?
C: PAUL
D: I played a little basketball in junior high.
C: LASER
D: That's it?
C: PAUL
D: Pretty much. The whole "team" thing got on my nerves, you know like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!" What about you?
C: LASER
D: I play some Soccer. Basketball. Baseball. You know, team sports.
N: Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that.
C: LASER
D: Yeah, I like teams.
N: We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to connect with Paul. Joni jumps in.
C: JONI
D: So this is your place?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant.
C: JONI
D: That's so cool. I'm totally into local.
E: excited
C: LASER
D: You are?
E: busting her
C: JONI
D: Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever.
N: Laser tries again to reconnect.
C: LASER
D: So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff?
C: PAUL
D: No. No pigs... But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime.
E: beat
C: JONI
D: Yeah...Definitely...
N: Excited, Joni turns to Laser. He seems uninterested.
S: EXT. WYSIWYG, PARKING LOT - DAY
N: The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.
C: LASER
D: Is that yours?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah. You like motorcycles?
C: LASER
D: Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle.
C: JONI
D: And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.
C: PAUL
D: That's too bad. They're fun.
N: Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here. After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.
C: PAUL
D: Well it was great to meet you guys.
E: CONT'D
N: He and Joni hug.
C: PAUL
D: I hope this was okay.
E: CONT'D
C: JONI
D: Yeah...totally...thank you.
N: Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug.
C: PAUL
D: Really nice to meet you, Laser.
C: LASER
D: Yeah.
N: Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up by the meeting.
S: INT. JONI'S CAR - DAY
N: Joni and Laser head back home.
C: JONI
D: I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?...
C: LASER
D: I guess...
C: JONI
D: You guess?
C: LASER
D: Yeah...
C: JONI
D: God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad!
C: LASER
D: I know.
C: JONI
D: Well what did you think of him?
C: LASER
D: I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house.
C: JULES
D: Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
C: LASER
D: I saw it. It was gnarly.
C: NIC
D: Where are you going?
C: LASER
D: Clay's.
N: Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look.
C: NIC
D: Don't be back late, okay?
C: LASER
D: I know.
C: JULES
D: Can I have a hug before you go?
C: LASER
D: Mom...
C: JULES
D: Just a quick one. Please!
C: LASER
D: Hug her. That's what she's there for.
N: Laser leaves. Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.
C: NIC
D: Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already.
C: JULES
D: What? "Are you and Clay fucking?"
C: NIC
D: "Exploring" is the word I'd use...
C: JULES
D: And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care?
C: NIC
D: We shouldn't... I just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.
E: then
C: JULES
D: Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions.
C: NIC
D: I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it.
N: Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules.
C: JULES
D: What are you trying to say?
C: NIC
D: What do you mean, what am I trying to say?
C: JULES
D: It feels like there's some subtext here.
C: NIC
D: What are you talking about?
C: JULES
D: I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?" Nic won't go there.
C: NIC
D: Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you're talking about.
C: JULES
D: Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet.
C: NIC
D: Yeah. Maybe not.
N: Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out.
S: INT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON
N: Paul and Tanya sit at the bar, eating family-meal.
C: TANYA
D: So what were they like?
C: PAUL
D: Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute.
C: TANYA
D: Sounds like you connected.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, we kinda did.
C: TANYA
D: Where'd you leave it?
C: PAUL
D: We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits.
C: BROOKE
D: Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket.
C: PAUL
D: Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season.
C: BROOKE
D: Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.
C: TANYA
D: "I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy."
E: mimicking Brooke
N: Paul can't help smiling at the nasty talk.
C: PAUL
D: Whoa...
S: INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser. Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable.
C: LASER
D: Dude, I don't think they smoke pot.
C: CLAY
D: Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.
C: CLAY
D: Whoa!
E: CONT'D
N: Clay turns on the dildo. It starts to gyrate.
C: CLAY
D: Yo, it's alive!
E: CONT'D
C: LASER
D: Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer. Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.
C: CLAY
D: Dude, we're watching this.
S: INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY
N: Laser and Clay sit on the bed. They look at each other. Then Laser hits play. ON SCREEN We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted.
C: CLAY
D: Think the whole thing's like this?
C: LASER
D: Want me to fast-forward?
N: Clay doesn't answer. They just keep watching.
S: EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over Laser's bike.
S: INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY
N: Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks in the room.
C: JULES
D: Laser, you left your bike out...
N: Laser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING
N: We enter a family conference already in progress. Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their 15-year-old son found their porn.
C: NIC
D: Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right?
C: LASER
D: Yeah.
C: NIC
D: And you know you can be open with us about anything.
C: LASER
D: Yeah, I know.
N: Jules steels herself for a frank discussion.
C: JULES
D: Laser, is there anything you want to talk about?
C: LASER
D: Like what?
C: NIC
D: Anything. Anything on your mind.
N: Laser cracks his knuckles.
C: LASER
D: Well there is something.
N: Nic and Jules share a look. "Here we go."
C: LASER
D: It's more of a question, really.
E: CONT'D
C: NIC
D: That's okay.
C: JULES
D: We won't judge you. Laser looks at his moms. Nic and Jules brace themselves.
C: LASER
D: Why do you guys watch gay man-porn? Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.
C: NIC
D: Well, first I have to say we rarely watch that movie-- Jules touches Nic's arm.
C: JULES
D: Honey...
C: NIC
D: And secondly, I really don't appreciate you snooping around our room. Was that Clay's idea? I have to say again, I don't like him. He seems untended...!
C: JULES
D: Honey, that's not what he asked--
C: NIC
D: Fine. Do you want to answer his question?!
E: snapping
C: JULES
D: Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive... For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know... ...externalized. Laser looks at them, still baffled.
E: soldiering on beat
C: JULES
D: Like with a penis.
E: CONT'D
C: LASER
D: But like, wouldn't you rather watch two women doing it?
C: JULES
D: You would think that. But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara--
C: NIC
D: Okay, that's enough! Laser, your mom and I have a sense there's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in.
C: LASER
D: What do you mean?
C: JULES
D: Are you having a relationship with someone?
C: NIC
D: You could tell us, honey. We'd understand and support you.
N: Laser looks confused. How did they find out about Paul?
C: LASER
D: I just met him once.
N: Nic and Jules share a worried look.
C: NIC
D: What do you mean once?
C: JULES
D: Did he find you on-line?!
C: LASER
D: What?!
C: NIC
D: Who did you meet once?
C: LASER
D: Paul! I met him with Joni.
C: NIC
D: Who's Paul?!
C: JULES
D: Why was Joni there?!
C: LASER
D: She set it up.
C: NIC
D: Forget the set-up! Who is Paul?!!
C: LASER
D: Our sperm donor. Jules and Nic go white.
C: LASER
D: Wait, did you guys think I was gay?!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible. Nic slugs a gulp of wine.
C: JULES
D: Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural.
C: NIC
D: But why didn't you tell us?
C: JONI
D: Because we knew you'd be upset.
C: NIC
D: WE'RE NOT UPSET!!
N: Jules calms her riled-up partner.
C: JULES
D: Honey... We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on--
E: to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly
C: JONI
D: Actually... I want to see him again.
E: sheepish beat
C: JULES LASER
D: You do?! You do?!
C: JONI
D: Yeah. I was gonna tell you.
E: CONT'D to Laser
C: NIC
D: Whoa! Whoa! No. No way. Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him!
E: regaining dominance
N: Joni looks at Laser. They knew this would happen.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss.
C: NIC
D: Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know?
C: JULES
D: Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way.
N: When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red hair out of the sink.
C: NIC
D: Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here!
N: Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
C: NIC
D: Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse.
E: getting tactical
C: JULES
D: I know...
C: NIC
D: Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed.
C: JULES
D: I'm with you, honey. We're gonna get through this, okay?
E: then
N: Nic smiles. She loves when Jules shows confidence.
C: NIC
D: I love you, chicken.
N: The women bump fists. They have a plan.
C: JULES
D: I love you too, pony.
S: EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
N: Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house.
S: INT/EXT. ALLGOOD FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON
N: Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces.
C: NIC
D: Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules.
N: Paul shakes their hands.
C: PAUL
D: Hi, great to meet you two.
C: JULES
D: I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.
C: PAUL
D: No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through.
N: Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.
C: NIC
D: Great. Well, come on in.
N: As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.
C: PAUL
D: This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it.
C: NIC
D: Are you kidding? We love it. And a Petit Syrah. What a treat! Let me get some glasses.
E: checking the label
N: Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence. Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.
C: PAUL
D: Beautiful house. How long you guys lived here?
C: JULES
D: Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long? We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall.
E: rambling nervously
N: Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.
C: PAUL
D: Okay.
N: Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul. Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for THE KITCHEN -- Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.
C: JULES
D: You okay?
C: NIC
D: Yeah. Fine.
E: not okay
N: Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.
C: JULES
D: Go easy on the wine, hon. It's day time.
C: NIC
D: Okay. And same goes for the micro- managing...
S: EXT. ALLGOOD PORCH - AFTERNOON
N: Everyone sits at the picnic table.
C: JULES
D: I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant.
C: PAUL
D: The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
C: NIC
D: So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry?
N: Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.
C: PAUL
D: Well, I always liked food.
C: NIC
D: No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations.
C: PAUL
D: Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school.
C: JONI
D: You dropped out of college?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, it wasn't my thing.
C: NIC
D: No? Why's that?
E: squinching
C: PAUL
D: It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.
C: PAUL
D: I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: PAUL
D: Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way. Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry.
E: CONT'D beat
C: LASER
D: See what he did there, mom? You said "food-services industry," then he said "food-services industry..."
C: NIC
D: Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks. So, Paul, what about your social life?
E: apropos of nothing
C: PAUL
D: My social life?
C: NIC
D: You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?
C: JONI
D: Mom!
C: NIC
D: What? We're getting to know Paul.
C: PAUL
D: No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now.
C: NIC
D: Oh.
N: Paul wants a break from the heat.
C: PAUL
D: So, how'd you guys meet?
N: Jules smiles, embarrassed. Nic jumps in.
C: NIC
D: We met at UCLA. I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency.
C: JULES
D: My tongue went numb.
C: PAUL
D: Really?
N: THUD! We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table.
C: JULES
D: Laser, that's not nice.
C: LASER
D: What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times!
C: PAUL
D: What happened to your tongue?
E: ignoring Laser
C: JULES
D: I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know...
C: PAUL
D: Choke? Die?...
C: JULES
D: Yeah...exactly...
C: NIC
D: Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine.
C: PAUL
D: So what'd you do for her?
C: NIC
D: Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around.
C: LASER
D: Mom, that's gross!
C: JULES
D: Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped.
E: ignoring Laser, to Nic
C: NIC
D: I was trying to distract you.
C: JULES
D: I know. And it worked. You were really funny.
C: NIC
D: You were really pretty.
N: Nic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand. Joni rolls her eyes, embarrassed.
C: JULES
D: So that's it. My tongue started working again.
C: NIC
D: And we've been glued at the hip ever since.
C: PAUL
D: That's a great story.
C: JULES
D: We like it.
E: beaming
N: Laser and Joni share a look.
C: PAUL
D: So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question.
C: JULES
D: Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college...
C: PAUL
D: Right...
C: JULES
D: But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born.
C: PAUL
D: Well, that happens...
C: JULES
D: When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business...
C: PAUL
D: Right on.
C: JULES
D: Yeah. But that didn't work out.
C: PAUL
D: Well, business aren't easy--
C: JULES
D: Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business.
C: PAUL
D: Good for you. What kind?
C: JULES
D: Landscape design... But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean?
E: before he can respond
C: PAUL
D: Absolutely.
N: In Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage. So she jumps in to save her.
C: NIC
D: Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech?
C: PAUL
D: No, she didn't.
C: NIC
D: It was incredible. So full of wisdom and hope... Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love to hear it...
E: turning to her Joni
C: JONI
D: No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
E: blushing
C: NIC
D: Sure he would. Come on. Go get it...
C: JONI
D: No, it's okay...
E: getting upset
C: NIC
D: Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.
C: JONI
D: I'm not embarrassed! Jesus! Give it a rest already!
N: This outburst stuns Nic into silence. Her daughter has never spoken to her like this. Laser stands up.
C: LASER
D: I'll get the ice-cream.
C: JONI
D: I'll help you.
E: standing up
N: Joni and Laser leave the room. Nic pours herself the last of Paul's Petit Syrah. Jules smiles, covering her anxiety.
C: JULES
D: Honey, that's your forth glass.
E: softly
C: NIC
D: Actually, it's my third. But thanks for counting. Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it?
C: JULES
D: Oh, that's okay.
E: insecure
C: PAUL
D: No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself.
C: JULES
D: Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it.
C: PAUL
D: Why? I just did. I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay--
E: then
C: JULES
D: No! I am! I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great? My first client." Nic looks less than pleased.
E: jumping on it getting excited
N: OMITTED.
S: INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
N: Nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies. Jules grabs a couple BAGS of fertilizer, throws them on top.
C: NIC
D: ...I'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement--
C: JULES
D: You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're--
C: NIC
D: He's not just a client, Jules. He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit Where You Eat?"
C: JULES
D: Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles. When they rejoin, Nic is contrite.
C: NIC
D: I'm sorry. He just seemed sort of...self-satisfied to me.
N: Jules grabs the olive branch.
C: JULES
D: Yeah, he was working the whole "alternative" thing pretty hard.
C: NIC
D: "I just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn. But that's just me. I'm weird that way."
E: mimicking
N: They both laugh. Nic's funny sometimes.
S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY
N: Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address. She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle.
S: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
N: Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating.
C: JULES
D: ...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary... ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you...
E: clocking his face
C: PAUL
D: What do you think?
C: JULES
D: Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund...
C: PAUL
D: Fecund?
C: JULES
D: I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
C: PAUL
D: No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often. More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.
E: thinking
N: Jules is staring at Paul.
C: PAUL
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions...
N: Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face.
C: JULES
D: You and Laser have the same mouth.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: You think so?
C: JULES
D: Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - ALLGOOD HOUSE - EVENING
N: Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese take-out for the family dinner.
C: NIC
D: What's the score?
C: JULES
D: Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.
C: LASER
D: 20-3...match point.
C: NIC
D: So how'd it go today?
C: JULES
D: Great. We settled on a concept.
C: NIC
D: What is it?
C: JULES
D: It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it.
C: NIC
D: Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card? Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was--
E: to Laser off his silence
C: LASER
D: Mom, settle! I will...
C: NIC
D: Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday.
C: LASER
D: Whatever, I have other plans anyway.
C: NIC
D: What other plans? I'm asking you a quest--
E: off his silence
C: LASER
D: I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:
C: NIC
D: You used to be so cute!
S: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
N: We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something. Laser is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.
C: PAUL
D: This may not be a good idea.
C: CLAY
D: Are you filming?!
E: O.S.
N: We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall. He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground.
C: PAUL
D: He's not gonna make it. Clay, you're not gonna make it!
E: to Laser calling to Clay
C: LASER
D: I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
C: CLAY
D: Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy.
N: VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up with an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally, he starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go into the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and Laser rush up and look over the edge.
C: PAUL/LASER
D: ARE YOU OKAY?!
N: There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.
C: CLAY
D: Did you get that?!
C: LASER
D: Seriously, dude, are you okay?
C: CLAY
D: I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?!
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLAY'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.
C: PAUL
D: Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me.
C: LASER
D: Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes.
C: PAUL
D: That's not amped. That's being a dick.
C: LASER
D: He's not a dick, that's just his way.
C: PAUL
D: Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you.
C: LASER
D: Well, you don't know him.
E: defensive
C: PAUL
D: You're right...I don't...
E: back-peddling
C: LASER
D: Hey, can I ask you a question?
C: PAUL
D: Sure.
C: LASER
D: Why'd you donate sperm?
C: PAUL
D: Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh. Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a "non-joke" answer.
C: PAUL
D: I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby...
E: CONT'D
N: Laser's not really buying that.
C: LASER
D: So you did it to help people?
C: PAUL
D: It was a long time ago...
C: LASER
D: How much did you get paid?
C: PAUL
D: Why do you want to know?
C: LASER
D: I'm just curious.
C: PAUL
D: I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.
C: LASER
D: That's it?
C: PAUL
D: It was worth more back then. You know. With inflation... Hey, I'm glad I did it...
E: off Laser's look
N: Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism. He looks over at him, then away.
S: INT. JONI'S ROOM - DAY
N: Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble. Sasha checks out the photos of Paul on Joni's phone.
C: SASHA
D: Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox.
C: JAI
D: Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty?
C: SASHA
D: I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single?
C: JONI
D: Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice.
N: Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.
C: SASHA
D: Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters...
N: Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension.
C: JONI
D: You want to keep playing?
C: JAI
D: Sure.
N: As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.
C: JAI
D: Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know...
E: CONT'D
C: JONI
D: Yeah...
N: Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch by inch. Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time. To the point where he lets slip...
C: JAI
D: It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks.
C: JONI
D: Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.
C: JULES
D: Wow. What's this?
C: NIC
D: Come here. Sit down.
N: Jules takes a seat beside her. Nic holds her hand.
C: NIC
D: I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self.
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Yeah, well...
C: NIC
D: You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized.
N: Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss. Jules is warming up.
C: NIC
D: Get in.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO - JULES
N: In the tub, revelling in the warm bubbly water. Nic is sitting on the ledge, massaging her feet.
C: JULES
D: Oh god, chicken, that's the spot.
C: NIC
D: How's the water?
C: JULES
D: Perfect. You wanna come in?
C: NIC
D: In a bit. You enjoy it first.
N: Nic goes deeper with the massage. Jules' eyes roll back.
C: NIC
D: Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.
E: CONT'D
N: Nic starts to get up. Jules grabs her hand.
C: JULES
D: No, don't stop...
C: NIC
D: No, I meant to put `em in....
N: Nic gets up and sashays to the door.
C: NIC
D: Don't move...
E: CONT'D
N: Nic exits. Jules sinks back, wishing Nic had stayed.
T: CUT TO JULES - MINUTES LATER
N: Still waiting. Getting impatient and upset.
C: JULES
D: Nic?!!
N: No response.
T: CUT TO THE KITCHEN --
N: Nic is on her cell with a patient, a glass of wine in her hand. Jules walks in wearing a bathrobe. Nic turns. Raises a finger and mouths: "Sorry..."
C: NIC
D: No, we're planning on being here through mid-August so... No, I promise, I'm not going anywhere.
E: beat
N: Jules' face drops; she turns and leaves. OMITTED.
S: INT./EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Paul watches Jules work in his backyard. Luis hauls shrubs.
S: INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
N: Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table, looking over her sketch for the yard.
C: JULES
D: Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea...
N: Jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter.
C: JULES
D: What's that?
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Strawberry rhubarb pie. Fresh from my garden.
N: Paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite. Her eyes roll back in her head.
C: PAUL
D: Good, huh?
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Oh my god. That is criminal.
C: PAUL
D: Have more.
C: JULES
D: No, please, just take it away...
C: PAUL
D: You had one bite.
C: JULES
D: I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up.
C: PAUL
D: Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
N: Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass.
C: JULES
D: So...you're good with the plants? Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you--
E: off his silence
C: PAUL
D: No, I'm just thinking. Hang on. Yeah, I'm good with the plants.
E: covers his eyes
C: JULES
D: Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism.
C: PAUL
D: I wasn't criticizing you.
C: JULES
D: No, I know...I just... Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist.
E: beat
C: PAUL
D: That doesn't mean you have to be negative.
N: Jules looks away. We HEAR a knock from the back.
C: LUIS
D: Excuse me, Senora? Hello?
E: O.S.
N: Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door.
C: JULES
D: What's up?
C: LUIS
D: 5 o'clock.
C: JULES
D: Yeah. Okay.
N: Jules wants Luis to leave her alone. But he's not going.
C: LUIS
D: Same time tomorrow?
C: JULES
D: Yes! Same time!
N: Luis leaves. Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously.
C: JULES
D: Okay. I'm gonna take off too...
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL

E: jumpy
C: NIC
D: I don't know. Did you break ground? Did you dig in? I don't know the terms.
C: JULES
D: No, we just talked...conceptually.
C: NIC
D: Oh, so it was less of a "doing" day, huh? Was he okay with that?
C: JULES

C: PAUL
D: Why? What's she doing?
C: JONI
D: She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult.
C: PAUL
D: She's your mom. That's her job.
C: JONI
D: What? To smother me to death? That's not her job.

C: CLAY
D: Why are you such a fag?!

D: You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?!

C: NIC
D: Really? You think so, Paul? Is that how it works? Jules walks up to intervene.
E: marinated in sarcasm
C: JULES
D: What's going on?
C: NIC
D: Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons.

C: JULES
D: I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now...
C: PAUL
D: Jules, it's okay. You don't have to defend her.
N: They stare at each other, unsure how to act.
C: JULES
D: And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, I sensed that.
N: She takes a step toward him, feverish.
C: JULES
D: I just wanted to clear the air.
N: They stare at each other. It's like watching two magnets.
C: PAUL
D: The air is clear.
N: Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses. It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.
C: JULES
D: Paul, I can't!
C: PAUL
D: You don't want to?!
C: JULES
D: No, I do! It's just... I have a guy outside!
E: urgent whisper
N: Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and Paul walks her into... HIS BEDROOM Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard. She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps. She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.
C: JULES
D: Oh. Well. Hel-lo!
N: Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate. Somewhere in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing.

C: PAUL
D: Oh god. Okay. Hit me.

C: PAUL
D: That's your question?
C: LASER
D: I want to be cremated.
C: PAUL
D: I think I'd rather be buried.
C: LASER
D: Why? That's just taking up more space in the earth.
C: PAUL
D: I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled--
C: LASER
D: What do you care? You won't even be conscious.
C: PAUL
D: That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me.
C: LASER
D: But why?! You'll be dead! You won't even know they're there!

D: God Sasha, that's totally gross! Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay? Especially when you act like a slut.
C: SASHA

N: Everyone stiffens. Jules is embarrassed.
C: JULES

E: self-pitying
C: NIC
D: Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control!
N: This is Jules' break-point.
C: NIC
D: What are you talking about?
C: JULES
D: Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife!
C: NIC
D: That is just not true!
C: JULES
D: You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career!
C: NIC

D: Yeah. I just got back.
C: JULES
D: That was fast!
C: LUIS
D: Yeah, no lines.

C: JULES
D: What's that look?
C: LUIS
D: What look?
C: JULES
D: The look you're giving me right now!
C: LUIS
D: That's no look. That just my face.
C: JULES
D: Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself!
C: LUIS
D: Senora, I didn't give no looks!
C: JULES
D: I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business...
C: LUIS
D: I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies!
C: JULES
D: Then why are you a gardener?!
N: Luis stares at Jules, innocent.

C: NIC
D: So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods. They recognize this is a big step for Nic.

C: PAUL
D: You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out." You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her. Tanya gets it.
C: TANYA

D: Right?! It means bloody!
C: PAUL
D: Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in. Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation.
C: JONI
D: I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be--
C: NIC
D: ...So Paul, I was checking out your album collection over there. Quite the eclectic mix...
E: interrupting
C: PAUL
D: Thanks...
C: NIC
D: You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell. Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.
C: PAUL
D: Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan?
C: NIC
D: Not really. We just named our daughter after her.
E: smug
C: PAUL
D: Cool. Right on...
C: NIC
D: What's your favorite Joni album?
C: PAUL
D: I think I have to go with "Blue." Nic raises her hand in a testify.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah? You too?
E: CONT'D
N: They high-five across the table.
C: NIC
D: Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album. That record kills me.
C: PAUL
D: I know, it never lets up, you got "River," "California..."
C: NIC
D: "A Case of You..."
C: PAUL
D: "All I Want.."
C: NIC
D: Mmm!!
N: Nic pulls her hands to her chest, shuts her eyes...and starts to sing.
C: NIC
D: I am on a lonely road and I am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh I hate you some, I hate you some/I love you some Oh I love you/when I forget about me...
E: CONT'D
N: Jules, Paul and the kids watch, open-mouthed as Nic soldiers on, skipping ahead to another verse.
C: NIC
D: I want to talk to you/I want to shampoo you/I want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When I think of your kisses/My mind see-saws...
E: CONT'D
N: Nic takes a breath. Just as Paul's about to say something, Nic resumes her unfortunate solo.
C: NIC
D: Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue...
E: CONT'D
N: Nic stops, eyes still closed. She's connected to a part of herself she rarely lets herself visit. The moment is punctured by her smart-ass 15-year-old son.
C: LASER
D: Don't quit your day job, mom.
C: PAUL
D: Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder.
C: LASER
D: You're right. I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul. Stunned. Then looks at Jules and points to Paul.
E: to Nic; contrite
C: NIC
D: I like this guy.
N: Paul looks at Joni.
C: PAUL
D: You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M.
C: JONI
D: It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up.
C: PAUL
D: I think it's cool.
C: NIC
D: Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?
E: getting up
C: PAUL
D: Just around there.
N: On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul.
C: NIC
D: You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle.
S: INT. PAUL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye. She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out... A few strands of long red hair. Nic pales.
T: CUT TO
N: Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain.
T: CUT TO
N: Nic skulks out of the bathroom. She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom.
T: CUT TO
N: Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed. Her look tells us she's found hair here as well.
T: THEN WE CUT TO
N: Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained. Nobody notices. The sound drops out.
C: NIC'S POV:
D: Paul and Jules talking comfortably.
N: Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family. REVERSE ONTO NIC: Totally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way down...
S: INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions. Jules is sonic-caring her teeth.
C: JULES
D: Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters...
E: through the sonic buzz
C: NIC
D: You're sleeping with him, aren't you.
C: JULES
D: What?
E: freaked
N: Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger.
C: NIC
D: Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now!
C: JULES
D: Where is this coming from?!
C: NIC
D: I found your hair in his drain!
C: JULES
D: What? I was working. I got dirty so I took a shower.
E: scrambling
C: NIC
D: Oh yeah? You take a nap, too?
N: Jules pauses a second too long. The jig is up.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES' BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: The truth has come out. Nic is so angry she's calm.
C: NIC
D: Are you in love with him?!
C: JULES
D: No!
C: NIC
D: What, are you straight now?!
C: JULES
D: No. It has nothing to do with that!
E: MORE
C: JULES
D: I've just felt so cut off from you lately...
E: CONT'D beat
C: NIC
D: Oh, right, so it's my fault!
C: JULES
D: No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me!
C: NIC
D: I'm listening! What?!
C: JULES
D: I just needed...
C: NIC
D: What? To be fucked?
C: JULES
D: No, appreciated!
C: NIC
D: It's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it? Well here's what I don't to you. I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!
N: Nic starts heading for the door. Jules follows.
C: JULES
D: He's not just "other people!"
C: NIC
D: No, you had to go fuck our sperm donor! You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me...
C: JULES
D: Where are you going?!
C: NIC
D: I need water! My mouth is dry!
N: Nic opens the door. There's Joni and Laser, looking devastated. They've been listening to the whole thing.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN
N: Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the couch. She looks like she hasn't slept at all.
S: INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAWN
N: Jules enters and walks over to her sleeping son. She gently nudges him awake.
C: JULES
D: Hey Laser. Honey?
N: Laser turns over, semi-conscious.
C: LASER
D: What?
N: She sits down on his bed.
C: JULES
D: Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now.
C: LASER
D: Okay.
C: JULES
D: I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything. Is there anything you want to talk about?
E: beat
C: LASER
D: Not really.
E: leave my room
C: JULES
D: Okay then. Go back to sleep.
E: fighting the impulse to push it
N: Jules pats her son and leaves.
S: INT. JONI'S BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Jules enters and touches Joni's shoulder.
C: JULES
D: Joni?
C: JONI
D: I don't want to talk to you.
C: JULES
D: Can we just--
C: JONI
D: I said I don't want to talk to you!!
C: JULES
D: Okay. I'm sorry.
N: Jules slowly retreats to the door.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Jules drinks coffee at the table. Nic walks in, dressed for work. Jules looks at her, wanting to "process." But Nic isn't in the mood. She grabs a banana from a bowl and walks out. Jules feels like a leper. OMITTED.
S: INT. SASHA'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: We can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole thing to Sasha.
C: SASHA
D: How's Nic doing?
C: JONI
D: She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before.
N: Joni's cell rings. She gets off the bed, looks at the phone. It's a picture of Paul.
C: SASHA
D: Is it him...?
N: Joni nods gravely, answers.
C: JONI
D: Hello.
E: cold
S: EXT. PAUL'S FARM - AFTERNOON
N: Paul's walking through rows of swiss chard, cell phone to his ear.
T: Conversation Intercut.
C: PAUL
D: Hey Joni, how you doing?
C: JONI
D: You're such a phony.
N: Beat.
C: PAUL
D: Excuse me?
C: JONI
D: You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person!
C: PAUL
D: What happened?
C: JONI
D: With my mom?!
C: PAUL
D: Listen, can I just come and talk with you--
C: JONI
D: What's wrong with you?!
C: PAUL
D: Joni...
C: JONI
D: Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying. Sasha hugs her.
S: EXT. PAUL'S FARM - CONTINUOUS
N: Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find fetching young Brooke, waiting for him with a wicker basket of huge cucumbers.
C: BROOKE
D: Hey Paul, look at these cukes...
N: Paul holds up his hand at her. This girl symbolizes every bad choice he's ever made. He gives her the universal, "Leave Me Alone" gesture. Brooke looks embarrassed.
S: EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
N: Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette. Her cell rings. She answers.
S: EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
N: Paul walks down the street, wigging out.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut.
C: JULES
D: Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette.
C: PAUL
D: What happened?
C: JULES
D: Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.
C: PAUL
D: The other night.
C: JULES
D: Yeah.
C: PAUL
D: Fuck...
C: JULES
D: Yeah. Beat.
C: PAUL
D: Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen.
C: JULES
D: Paul...
C: PAUL
D: No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing.
C: JULES
D: Paul, come on...
C: PAUL
D: No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready--
C: JULES
D: Jesus, Paul! I'm gay!
E: eye rolling
N: Jules tosses the phone away from her.
S: EXT. HOUSE PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Joni and Sasha stand at the makeshift "bar". Joni's downs several Tequila shots quickly.
C: SASHA
D: Slow down, tiger.
N: Across the room, Joni spots Jai chatting with a WAIFY GIRL in a sundress. Joni drops one more Tequila shot and walks up to Jai and Waify girl, interrupting them.
C: JONI
D: I like the scruff. It's sexy.
N: Waify girl juts out her hip territorially.
C: WAIFY GIRL
D: Uh, `scuuuse me...
C: JONI
D: You're excused. Hey, can I talk to you?
E: then back to Jai
N: Joni leads Jai to a private corner. She leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate. But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss.
C: JAI
D: Joni...Joni...
C: JONI
D: What?
N: Joni looks pained, embarrassed. Jai keeps holding her hands.
C: JAI
D: Are you okay?
C: JONI
D: Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake.
S: INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Jules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed.
C: JULES
D: Just getting another pillow. The couch is kind of saggy.
C: NIC
D: Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?
C: JULES
D: It's a little ache-y.
C: NIC
D: You should take some Advil.
N: Guess not. Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her bedroom.
C: JULES
D: Hey. How was the party?
N: Joni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze.
C: JONI
D: Fine.
C: JULES
D: How big was it?
C: JONI
D: I don't know. Medium...ish...
N: Jules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes.
C: JULES
D: Are you drunk?
C: JONI
D: No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece.
C: NIC
D: I hope you had a designated driver.
C: JONI
D: Why? I'm not drunk.
C: NIC
D: Well, you seem drunk to me.
C: JONI
D: Yeah, well, you should know.
C: NIC
D: What did you just say to me?!
E: furious; incredulous
C: JONI
D: I'm going to bed.
N: Joni starts to leave. Nic grabs her.
C: NIC
D: No, you're not! I'm not done talking to you!
N: Laser opens his door and watches the scene progress.
C: JONI
D: What do you want from me?! I did everything you wanted! I got all A's! I got in everywhere I applied! Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have!
C: JULES
D: Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules.
C: JONI
D: You're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?!
C: JULES
D: Hey, I'm still your mother.
C: JONI
D: Whatever...
N: Jules reaches out and Joni backs away, sickened.
C: JONI
D: Don't touch me!
E: CONT'D
N: Joni heads for her room.
C: JONI
D: I'm so sick of both of you!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DAWN - MOS
N: The sun rises on this formerly happy home.
S: INT. ALLGOOD LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: Jules wakes up on the couch. Sits up. Rubs her aching back.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - JONI'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half- filled packing boxes. She picks up a pile of clothes from the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her. She puts it aside, not sure what to do with it.
S: EXT. PAUL'S BACKYARD - DAY
N: Paul looks around his newly landscaped yard. It looks more abandoned than revived.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The family has their last supper - before Joni leaves.
C: NIC
D: Did you pack that lamp I gave you?
C: JONI
D: Yeah.
C: NIC
D: Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it, I mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding...
C: JONI
D: I'm not going to Siberia, mom.
N: Jules looks at the family unit, misty.
C: JULES
D: I can't believe this is our last dinner together.
C: LASER
D: Oh God, are you gonna cry?
N: Jules looks at her son, fed up.
C: JULES
D: I wish you were gay. You'd be so much more sensitive.
N: The doorbell rings.
C: JONI
D: It's probably Sasha. I'll get it.
N: Joni runs to the door. Opens it. It's not Sasha. It's Paul.
C: JONI
D: What are you doing here?
E: CONT'D shocked
C: PAUL
D: I needed to talk to you before you left.
C: JONI
D: There's nothing to talk about.
C: PAUL
D: I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it.
S: EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - SAME
N: Joni walks out for privacy, closes the door behind her.
C: JONI
D: So like, everything that happened between us. What was that? Was that just bullshit?!
C: PAUL
D: No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I know I don't seem credible right now but I really care about you... Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.
C: PAUL
D: ...and I just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again. Do you think that could maybe happen?
E: CONT'D
C: JONI
D: I don't know... Joni looks down welling up.
C: JONI
D: I just wish you could've been...
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: What?
N: Joni chokes back tears.
C: JONI
D: Better...
N: Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly flings open. Nic is there, fuming.
C: NIC
D: You've got some balls, mister!
C: PAUL
D: Nic, hold on...
N: Nic walks toward he and Joni. Joni ducks back inside.
C: NIC
D: No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids!
C: PAUL
D: Well, they're kinda my...
C: NIC
D: No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
E: cutting him off
C: PAUL
D: I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
C: NIC
D: If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.
N: Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate and walks out of view. Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike, helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making. Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle.
S: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV.
C: JULES
D: I need to say something.
N: Everyone sits up. Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked.
C: JULES
D: Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring. Jules soldiers on.
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would...
E: CONT'D
N: Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
C: JULES
D: Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually. Thank you.
E: CONT'D awkward
N: And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules' rambling apologia, especially Nic. OMITTED.
S: INT. JONI'S ROOM - MORNING
N: Joni wakes up. She looks around her room. There's nothing on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and labeled. It's time to go.
S: EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: Nic and Jules stuff the last of Joni's things in the back of their station wagon. Laser and Joni bring the last of the boxes out of the house.
S: INT. VOLVO STATION WAGON - DAY
N: The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college. OMITTED.
S: EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY - ESTABLISHING
N: The station wagon passes through the campus.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
N: As they drive past buildings and dorms, Joni sees STUDENTS swarming the campus. She takes it all in, nervous, excited. Nic and Jules steal looks back at Joni, feeling her nervousness, wishing they could take it away.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: The Allgoods pull up to the curb, get out. Laser piles Joni's boxes on his skateboard.
S: EXT. FRONT OF DORM - DAY
N: Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni and the moms follow behind.
S: INT. DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door. They all jam up at the threshold.
C: JONI
D: Guys, it's okay. I got it.
N: Nic and Jules get the hint. They move back and Joni enters the room alone. Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave.
S: INT. JONI'S DORM ROOM - BEDROOM - LATER
N: Joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. She goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out toward the hallway. Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out. She realizes her family isn't there.
S: EXT. DORM BUILDING - DAY
N: Joni exits, looking around to find her family. The station wagon is gone. She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she makes her way down a hill toward the road. Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her. The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out. Joni looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.
C: JONI
D: Where'd you go?!
C: NIC
D: We had to move the car.
C: JONI
D: I thought you left.
C: JULES
D: We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
C: NIC
D: Give us some credit.
N: And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.
C: LASER
D: It's gonna be weird not having you at home.
C: JONI
D: Sorry to leave you alone with them.
C: LASER
D: It's okay. I can handle it. Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces.
C: JONI
D: Guys, come on... Look, I'll talk to you soon.
E: beat
N: Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let go. They keep holding her and crying. Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down. Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up, unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying. The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder. Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure, resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her. Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go. They hold her tight to comfort her. They keep holding her until a calm sets in. The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face. Joni gives her moms one last smile. Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands watching as they drive off and her new life begins.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
N: The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back. No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds. Finally Laser breaks the spell.
C: LASER
D: I don't think you guys should break up. A long beat.
C: NIC
D: No? Why's that?
C: LASER
D: I think you're too old.
N: Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.
C: NIC
D: Thanks, Laser.
N: Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed. Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight. Nic and Jules look at each other, and then away. Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat. Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself, grateful for a sign.
T: FADE OUT
N: THE END
