S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and grips a tattered spiral notebook. Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear. Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses. Aibileen swallows hard.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County. An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.
C: WOMAN
D: Did you know as a girl, growing up, that one day you'd be a maid?
E: O.C.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am. I did.
C: WOMAN
D: And you knew that because?
E: O.C.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave.
C: WOMAN
D: Oh. The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.
E: 0.C.
C: WOMAN
D: A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay. Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.
E: O.C. CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Now, did you ever dream of being something else? Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.
E: O.C. CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Well then, what's it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home...being looked after by somebody else?
E: O.C. CONT'D
N: Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water. She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
C: AIBILEEN
D: I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING
N: MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying. AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes
C: AIBILEEN
D: I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into her expansive bosom.
E: V.O.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear.
E: V.O CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: You is kind. You is smart. You is important. Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and double-stick tape hold it all together. Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle hair.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour! Did you finish the chicken salad?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No paprika! Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Does this dress look homemade?
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: I reckon when you finish, it won't. Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPAER - OFFICE - SAME DAY
N: A smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA "SKEETER" PHELAN, 23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs have yellowed.
C: AIBILEEN
D: But, not Miss Skeeter... Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders. She carries a red satchel.
E: V.O.
C: AIBILEEN
D: No babies...No man...And not lookin'. She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a mean man. Smoke pours into the room.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: Shut the Goddamn door! He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: They announced last week cigarettes'll kill you.
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth. MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D) (CHEWING) Okay, let's see what you got. Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé. He skims it over, marking it violently with a red pen.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: "Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel Rouser Editor, double major, Junior League editor...Damn girl, didn't you have any fun?
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Is that...important? Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resumé back to Skeeter.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: You got any references? Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly. Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly, mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: That...is a rejection letter. Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Not exactly. Missus Stein-
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: -STEIN?! Missus who? Skeeter points toward the letterhead.
C: SKEETER
D: Elaine Stein, Senior Editor at Harper and Row Publishing. In New York. I'm going to be a serious writer, Mr. Blackly. So, when I applied to Harper and Row, Missus
N: STEIN WROTE-
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: -She told you "no."
C: SKEETER
D: Until I gain some experience, Mr. Blackly! See, it says it right there at the end. "Great potential...Gain some experience and please apply again." Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: Oh, Christ...I guess you'll do. Can you clean?
C: SKEETER
D: Clean? Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: Clean! Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and newspapers. He slams it down in front of Skeeter.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy on us, drunk hair spray or something. Read her past columns and all these letters. Answer them just like she did, nobody'll know the damn difference. Skeeter forces a smile.
E: CONT'D
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: You know who Miss Myrna is?
E: CONT'D
N: SKEETER (COVERING) I read her articles all the time.
C: MR. BLACKLY
D: Articles? Ha! It's a cleaning advice column, Miss Phelan. Eight bucks a week. Copy due Thursday. Mr. Blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone. Skeeter excitedly grabs the box of letters and leaves.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME DAY
N: HILLY HOLBROOK, 22, white and hefty, sits on a closed toilet seat in a well-appointed bathroom. She's covered in red plaid and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive. HILLY (SCREAMING UPWARD) Momma! We're late for bridge! Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder. She raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the first and second sheets of paper.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Miss Hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby. And it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment. `Cause once Miss Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too.
E: V.O.
N: She carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll.
C: HILLY
D: Minny! Go get Momma!
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - ENTRY FOYER STAIRWELL - SAME TIME
N: MINNY JACKSON, 33, black, plump and in uniform, rolls her eyes beneath a crystal chandelier. She shouts up the mahogany stairwell.
C: MINNY
D: Missus Walters?! You need help coming down? MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: I'm down! Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: Been down.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: Gone give me a heart attack! Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly tries to turn her toward the front door. Missus Walters resists.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: Minny, I'm getting my coat. Missus Walters opens the closet.
C: MINNY
D: It's ninety degrees out there, Missus Walters. Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print collar. The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard, Miss Hilly moved her and Minny in with her. Fired the maid she had just to make room. See, Minny about the best cook in Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted her. Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her plaid, fat thighs.
E: V.O.
N: She nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries it out the door. Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate pie. Hilly barks over her shoulder.
C: HILLY
D: Minny, William took Billy out for ice cream. So, hurry back and get Billy down for his nap. No dilly dallying.
C: MINNY
D: Yes, ma'am. Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of smashing it into her head.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Minny my best friend. A old lady like me lucky to have her.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM- SAME DAY
N: Aibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley who sits on a small children's training toilet.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: No!
C: AIBILEEN
D: It's a tricky thing...you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before it's time. If theys can't get the hang of it, theys get to thinking low a theyselves. Mae Mobley sticks her lip out.
E: V.O.
C: AIBILEEN
D: You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee.
E: CONT'D
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Nooo. Mae Mobley shakes her head.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I give you a cookie if you go. Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Mae Mobley! You going! Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now slants in the other direction.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen, the girls are pulling up, and the table isn't set!
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Mae Mobley go, Momma!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Get in your room! Right now! Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: I sorry. Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack of potatoes. Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her eyes have welled up. Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is destined to become income property one day. FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two collapsible card tables arranged in the living room. Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly.
E: V.O.
C: CLOSE ON:
D: Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK making sure it's hidden.
C: AIBILEEN
D: After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Hey, girls!
N: YOUNG WOMEN (IN UNISON) Hey, Hilly! Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm.
C: HILLY
D: Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip.
E: over her shoulder
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: I'm not deaf yet, Hilly. Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we go" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair. Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.
C: HILLY
D: Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. Hilly extends the coat with a smile.
C: HILLY
D: All yours. Aibileen takes the coat.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Thank you, Miss Hilly.
C: HILLY
D: Go on. Try it on.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Minny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's deviled eggs. Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Gots to have paprika on `em. Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have to kill that woman.
N: Aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Watch yo mouth, Minny.
C: MINNY
D: Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows. Aibileen shakes with silent laughter.
C: MINNY
D: And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Oh, law! Did she?
C: MINNY
D: Uh-hum. But, I carry paper in from my own damn house. That fool don't know.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Elizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus Walters sits on the couch watching "Guiding Light." Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door.
C: SKEETER
D: Hey, girls.
N: GIRLS (IN UNISON) Hey, Skeeter. JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter.
C: JOLENE
D: Well, if it isn't Long-Haul- Skeeter. We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole Miss.
C: SKEETER
D: Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene. Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh.
C: SKEETER
D: Sorry I'm late. I had to stop by the cleaners and pick up my black dress. Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel.
C: SKEETER
D: Again? Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.
C: HILLY
D: He can't get off the rig, Skeeter. It's offshore! Stuart is a very successful oil man.
C: SKEETER
D: I'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Raleigh called his cousin down in Hattiesburg. He'll drive up.
C: SKEETER
D: The cousin with one eye?! Elizabeth nods.
C: SKEETER
D: I guess his black patch will match my dress. Just forget it. Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: One eye?!
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THE SAME DAY
N: Aibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins. Hilly, Elizabeth and Skeeter sit with Jolene. Skeeter takes a deep breath and belts out her news.
C: SKEETER
D: I got a job today... at The Jackson Journal! Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself. Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg.
C: HILLY
D: They'd be a fool not to hire you. Jolene raises her glass.
C: JOLENE
D: To Skeeter...and her job. Last stop `til marriage. Hilly kicks Jolene under the table.
C: SKEETER
D: The Miss Myrna column. Have y'all read it?
C: HILLY
D: Well, no! But, I bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James. Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles.
C: SKEETER
D: Elizabeth, would you mind if I talk to Aibileen? To help me answer some of the letters? Just until I get a knack for it. Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing. Elizabeth gets very still.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen? My Aibileen? What can't you just get Constantine to help you? Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head.
C: SKEETER
D: Constantine...quit us.
C: ELIZABETH HILLY
D: What?! Oh, my gosh! Skeeter nods her head sadly.
C: HILLY
D: I'm so sorry, Skeeter.
C: SKEETER
D: I really don't want to talk about it. Okay? The girls nod.
C: SKEETER
D: Anyway...I don't know how to answer these letters. Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Well...I mean as long as it doesn't interfere with her work. A phone rings. Elizabeth nods to Aibileen.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Aibileen rushes in the kitchen and answers the phone.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Leefolt residence.
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME
C: CLOSE ON:
D: Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a black and white check floor.
C: CELIA FOOTE
D: Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in? Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a pink robe's collar.
E: O.C.
C: AIBILEEN
D: She having bridge club right now. May I take a message? CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country girl glory. She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity.
C: CELIA
D: Please tell her Celia Foote called again. I'll call back tomorrow.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am. Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.
C: CELIA
D: Ah-hem. Miss? "Miss" strikes Aibileen as very odd.
C: CELIA
D: I'm looking for some help at my house. You know any maids looking?
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: No, ma'am.
C: CELIA FOOTE
D: Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4. Bye, now. Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca- cola bottle.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Who was that on the phone?
C: AIBILEEN
D: Miss Celia Foote called again. Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I've never called her back, Hilly.
C: HILLY
D: She can't take a hint, can she?
C: JOLENE
D: Who's Celia Foote?
C: HILLY
D: That tacky girl Johnny married.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Girl? I heard she's twenty-eight.
C: JOLENE
D: Oh my God!
C: HILLY
D: Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. All the girls laugh.
C: SKEETER
D: Could have been you, Hilly.
C: HILLY
D: And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit.
C: SKEETER
D: Aren't we taking non-members? The benefit's gotten so big.
C: HILLY
D: Yes, but we're not telling her. Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles.
C: SKEETER
D: Thank you, Aibileen. Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point. Elizabeth leans over.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, Hilly, I wish you'd just go use the bathroom.
C: HILLY
D: Ah-hem. I'm fine. Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we. Elizabeth turns to Aibileen.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley. Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Just go use mine and Raleigh's. Hilly hiss-whispers.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too.
N: ELIZABETH
C: SHE DOES NOT!
D: Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops.
C: HILLY
D: Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject.
C: SKEETER
D: Did y'all see the cover of "Life" this week? Jackie's never looked
N: MORE REGAL-
C: HILLY
D: -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I can't ask Raleigh until tax season. But, it would be nice.
C: HILLY
D: That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative.
C: SKEETER
D: "The Home"...the what?!
C: HILLY
D: As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet.
C: SKEETER
D: Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly. The room grows eerily quiet.
C: HILLY
D: You ought not to joke about the colored situation. Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.
C: HILLY
D: I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and throws her cards to the table.
E: CONT'D
C: JOLENE
D: I have to skedaddle! Gotta get over to the station!
N: (EXCITEDLY) Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight!
S: EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY
N: Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers. As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison. Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.
E: V.O.
C: JOHNNY
D: Roses look like weeds next to you. Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.
C: CELIA
D: Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! Johnny begins kissing her neck.
C: CELIA
D: You're home early. Celia pushes him back.
E: CONT'D
C: CELIA
D: Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back.
E: CONT'D
C: JOHNNY
D: Oh, who cares, honey. We got all we need right here. Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.
C: CELIA
D: Johnny, honestly!
C: JOHNNY
D: Doctor's orders. Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him.
C: CELIA
D: I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.
C: JOHNNY
D: Hey, we've never done it in the yard. Maybe that's the trick. Celia seductively bites her lower lip.
C: CELIA
D: Watch my hair. Johnny's hand slides up her thigh.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY
N: Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye. A sermon plays over an old AM radio nestled between canisters of sugar and flour. Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups.
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen? Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: SKEETER
D: I had hoped to ask you myself if you could help me with the "Miss Myrna" letters...
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: SKEETER
D: So...Would you help me? Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times. Be good to get it right.
C: SKEETER
D: Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on splitting the pay with you, too. Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.
C: SKEETER
D: Listen...all that talk in there today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm sorry you had to hear that. Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir begins singing on the radio.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio?
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am, it is.
C: SKEETER
D: That reminds me so much of my maid growing up. Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Constantine and me...were in church circle together.
N: Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette.
C: SKEETER
D: She loved me like you love Mae Mobley.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am. Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen? How could she just quit like that? Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...
C: AIBILEEN
D: Quit?
C: SKEETER
D: Yes. When I got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit. Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago. She didn't leave me a note or anything. Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.
C: SKEETER
D: Could you do that to Mae Mobley? Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: No, ma'am. I couldn't...
C: SKEETER
D: Do you have an address for her or anything? Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in. Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm sorry. Did I interrupt something? Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads. Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers. Home Help Sanitation Initiative is written on the cover.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hilly wants this put in the League newsletter. Skeeter nods.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on Miss Myrna. Elizabeth looks at Aibileen.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Tomorrow is silver polishing day, so y'all make it quick, okay?
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT DAY
N: Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak trees in a white Cadillac.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I knew I had said too much to Miss Skeeter, but Constantine's story weren't mine to tell. Some things a girl shouldn't have to know about her own mother. Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of cotton.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CADILLAC (FANTASY SEQUENCE) - SAME TIME
N: Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands. The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone. Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting gravel road. Skeeter slowly turns down the old road.
S: EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack with a rusted-out tin roof. Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The front door is cracked opened. Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.
S: INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table, rocking chair and a wood burning stove. Past intruders have long since taken anything of value. As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries out from underneath. Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes suddenly catch something. Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE. Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes begin to well up.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks to the side of her family's graveyard. Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered porch. An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a porch swing.
C: SKEETER
D: Hey, Jameso.
C: JAMESO
D: Hello, Miss Eugenia.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - ENTRY FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter walks through the front door.
C: SKEETER
D: Momma! If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect antebellum home, Skeeter would be standing in it.
S: INT. PHELAN HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter enters and looks around curiously at an ARRAY OF WIGS resting atop a dresser.
C: SKEETER
D: Momma? Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50, glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats. Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored, `pixie' cut.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Is this a little too young?
C: SKEETER
D: It's a little too everything.
N: Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning hair detracts from her perfectly made up face. Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown.
C: SKEETER
D: Much better.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Your daddy bought me this dress in
C: SKEETER
D: Mom, I want to ask you about
N: CONSTANTINE-
C: CHARLOTTE
D: -Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl. Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Come on, you try it on.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: What really happened? Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I told you...she went to live with her people in Chicago...Now, Skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress. Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress. Skeeter begins taking off her clothes.
C: SKEETER
D: How could she just take off without telling me?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals.
C: SKEETER
D: Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow." She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: This looks precious on you! Four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with?
C: SKEETER CHARLOTTE
D: A diploma. A pretty piece of paper.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Hilly and Elizabeth have such lovely children.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: If only you'd show a little gumption, Eugenia...
C: SKEETER
D: Well, I did get a job today.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: You did?
C: SKEETER
D: Writing...for The Jackson Journal. Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Great. You can write my obituary. "Charlotte Phelan dead. Her daughter still single."
C: SKEETER
D: Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a love seat. They sit. This is serious.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I need to...ask you something, Skeeter. I read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts. Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Are you...do you...find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about... Charlotte shuts her eyes tight.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Girls or...or women?
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Oh my God!
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea. Skeeter jumps up.
C: SKEETER
D: Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Eugenia! Skeeter storms out of the room.
N: CHARLOTTE (CONT'D) (SHOUTING) Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner. Try to look presentable!
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles. The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of casseroles around the table. Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl of broth. Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60. Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fiancé, REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good looks.
C: CARLTON
D: What the hell do you know about cleaning a house, Skeeter?
C: SKEETER
D: It's a start, Carlton.
N: CARLTON (MOCKINGLY) I thought you wanted to write books.
C: ROBERT
D: Leave your sister alone, Son. I'm proud of you, Sweetheart. Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Oh, the irony of it all. Givin' advice on how to keep up a home when she... Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth. Pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in almonds onto Skeeter's plate. Skeeter stops her.
C: SKEETER
D: Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't have known this...But, see, I'm allergic to almonds.
C: PASCAGOLUA
D: Sorry, Miss Eugenia.
C: SKEETER
D: Last time I had an almond, I stopped liking men. Charlotte glares at Skeeter. Carlton lets out a chuckle. Rebecca is mortified.
C: REBECCA
D: Oh my Lord.
C: SKEETER
D: It's okay, Rebecca. They have a special root tea now.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: You have pushed it, Young Lady! Pascagolua scurries off. Skeeter turns to her father...
C: SKEETER
D: Daddy, what happened to Constantine? The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.
C: ROBERT
D: Ah...well, Constantine went to live with her family. People move on, Skeeter. But I do wish she'd stayed down here with us.
C: SKEETER
D: I don't believe you. Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself with scooping up more broth.
C: SKEETER
D: Mother, did you...fire her?
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: You wouldn't understand. Not until you've hired help of your own.
C: SKEETER
D: She raised me! Charlotte slaps the table and stands.
N: CHARLOTTE
C: SHE DID NOT!
D: Skeeter's eyes fill with tears...
C: SKEETER
D: She worked here for twenty-nine years. Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: It was a colored thing, and I've put it behind me. Charlotte passes behind Rebecca and kisses her head.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Excuse me, Rebecca. My daughter has upset my cancerous ulcers. As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like she's the worst person on earth. Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT
N: Skeeter, 13 and lanky, wears a party dress. Despite a tight bun, her strong-willed hair has started to frizz. Skeeter's father and brother race down the stairs with suitcases. Carlton wears a varsity sweater.
C: SKEETER
D: Good luck down there, Carlton.
C: CARLTON
D: Have fun at the dance, Skeeter Legs. Robert and Carlton race outside as Charlotte enters, healthy and glowing.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Eugenia! You've grown another inch since breakfast. Go put on a dress that fits before that boy and his daddy come pick you up. A horn blows. Charlotte kisses Skeeter on the cheek and then looks over to CONSTANTINE, 50.
N: Constantine stands tall. Her skin is black as night. Her eyes have a striking honey colored hue to them. She wears a white sleeping gown.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Pray Carlton doesn't like LSU, Constantine. It's so far. It might be the last we see of him. The horn blows again. Charlotte is out the door. Skeeter turns to Constantine who is all smiles.
E: CONT'D
C: CONSTANTINE
D: Gone be just you and me all weekend.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter sits at a picnic table smoking a cigarette. Constantine smokes tobacco out of a corn pipe.
C: SKEETER
D: I just couldn't tell her I didn't get asked to the dance.
C: CONSTANTINE
D: Some things we should just keep to ourselves. Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.
C: SKEETER
D: I'm already taller than the boys' basketball coach. How tall are you, Constantine?
C: CONSTANTINE
D: I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling sorry for yourself.
C: SKEETER
D: Momma was third runner up in the Miss South Carolina pageant.
C: CONSTANTINE
D: "Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You gone be "Miss Something Better." Constantine grabs Skeeter's hand and presses her thumb firmly to her palm.
C: CONSTANTINE
D: Now you listen. Your momma didn't pick her life. It pick her, and she done even know it. You gone do something big with yours. Bigger than your momma or your brother. Constantine lets go of Skeeter's palm and wipes a tear from her face.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: What about you? What did you want to be, Constantine? Constantine laughs.
C: CONSTANTINE
D: Oh, Child! We don't get to pick. This pick us, and that just how it is. Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug.
S: INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: Skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a rooster announces the morning. A sudden revelation washes over her. In a flash, Skeeter is out of bed and running down the stairs.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Pascagoula tends to a skillet full of eggs next to a black and white TV resting on the counter.
C: CLOSE ON TELEVISION:
D: Jolene French attempts to deliver the weather on WLBT.
C: JOLENE
D: Sunny skies and a high of ninety- eight today with ninety-nine percent humidity. There's a slight chance of afternoon showers so y'all carry an umbrella. Jolene pivots to camera, lowers her chin and smiles. Skeeter runs past Pascagoula with a phone and disappears inside the pantry.
S: INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK - LATER
N: ELAINE STEIN, 45, hard but stylish, talks on the phone in a large corner office. She lights a cigarette and swivels her chair toward the Manhattan skyline.
C: MISS STEIN
D: What gave you this idea, Miss Phelan? I'm...curious.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY - SAME TIME
N: Skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. A millennium's supply of can goods fills the shelves.
C: SKEETER
D: I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help.
C: MISS STEIN
D: Continue.
C: SKEETER
D: I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.
C: MISS STEIN
D: I'm listening.
C: SKEETER
D: Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here.
C: MISS STEIN
D: So, a side to this never before heard.
C: SKEETER
D: Yes! Charlotte knocks on the pantry door.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Skeeter, who are you talking to in there? Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.
E: O.C.
C: SKEETER
D: Go! Away! Skeeter slams the door.
C: SKEETER
D: So, yes, their side of the story. Skeeter leans back against the shelves.
E: CONT'D
C: MISS STEIN
D: Who was that?
C: SKEETER
D: My mother. She just dropped by to-
C: MISS STEIN
D: Look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth. That's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson, Mississippi. I watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news. Oy! They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail built for four. Skeeter panics.
C: SKEETER
D: I already have a maid. Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk.
C: MISS STEIN
D: Really? A negro maid has already agreed to talk to you? Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now.
C: SKEETER
D: Yes, ma'am...
C: MISS STEIN
D: Well...I suppose I could read what you come up with. The book biz could use a little rattling.
C: SKEETER
D: You'd do that?
C: MISS STEIN
D: I'm saying I'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing.
C: SKEETER
D: Oh, thank you, Miss Stein!
C: MISS STEIN
D: And for God's sake, you're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman. Go get an apartment. She hangs up.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY
N: Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the `Miss Myrna' letters. Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's forecast appears to be a bit off.
C: SKEETER
D: "Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too..."
C: AIBILEEN
D: Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. Skeeter writes this down.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Bout an hour. Let it dry. Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside. Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3, perched on her hip. A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans. Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to sprinkle outside.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.
C: HILLY
D: Oh, mercy! Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the moment.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? Aibileen turns slowly from the window.
C: SKEETER
D: I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Everthing's fine.
C: SKEETER
D: My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I never tolt you that! Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. Skeeter rises.
C: SKEETER
D: I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her?
C: SKEETER
D: I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Other maids?
C: SKEETER
D: I was hoping to get four or five. To really show what it's like in Jackson. To see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad. Aibileen shakes her head.
C: AIBILEEN
D: They set my cousin Shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station.
C: SKEETER
D: A book has never been written like this, Aibileen.
C: AIBILEEN
D: `Cause they's a reason. I do this with you, I might as well burn my own house down. Bam! The front door slams shut.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME (INTERCUT) - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Soaking wet, Elizabeth and her husband, RALEIGH, 25, stand toe to toe.
C: RALEIGH
D: I put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to New Orleans, but this takes the goddamn cake!
C: ELIZABETH
D: It'll confuse Mae Mobley if she sees Aibileen going inside. And we can't risk her health.
C: KITCHEN:
D: Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen.
N: LIVING ROOM:
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hilly spoke to the Surgeon General! She also said it'll add value to our home!
E: CONT'D
C: RALEIGH
D: Great! Mae Mobley can just go to college in that bathroom, too.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Honey, Hilly's covering the cost...and said you can just do William's taxes to pay her back.
C: RALEIGH
D: We don't take orders from the Holbrooks!
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Raleigh storms in and is surprised to see Skeeter.
C: RALEIGH
D: Skeeter? How you doing?
C: SKEETER
D: Fine.
C: RALEIGH
D: Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen. Raleigh storms out as Elizabeth charges into the kitchen.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen, Mae Mobley's crying her eyes out! Aibileen runs off. Elizabeth sees Skeeter and tries to compose herself.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Skeeter...Hello. I'm sorry but I think it's best if you leave now. Skeeter gathers her things.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: And...I don't think this Miss Myrna thing is gonna work out with Aibileen.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DEN - LATER THAT DAY
N: The storm has escalated. The Holbrook house is without power. Hilly runs around lighting candles. Missus Walters lies on the couch while Minny fans her with a newspaper.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: You're making it a lot hotter flapping your arm like that. Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. Missus Walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom. Lightning strikes. Leaves blow across the yard. Hilly plops down in a chair with a candle.
C: HILLY
D: That should do it. Minny, go get me and Momma some iced tea. Minny hesitates. She gulps.
C: MINNY
D: Uh...Miss Hilly?
C: HILLY
D: Yes.
C: MINNY
D: Never mind. As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: You go on ahead and use the guest bath, Minny. It's okay.
C: HILLY
D: Oh, for crying out loud. It's just a little rain. She can go get an umbrella up in William's Study!
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: I believe she was working for me before you dragged us both here. Minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair against the garage bathroom. Boom! Another crash of thunder. Large hail stones begin falling in the yard.
C: MINNY
D: I'm gone get your tea.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER
N: Minny sneaks into the guest bath with a candle and shuts the door. She carefully lowers the seat and sits. Relief spreads across her face. There's a knock on the door. She freezes.
C: HILLY
D: Minny? Minny panics, staying completely quiet.
E: O.C.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Hilly leans into the bathroom door.
C: HILLY
D: MINNYYYY, are you in there?
C: MINNY
D: Yes, ma'am...
C: HILLY
D: Are you sitting down? Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet. Hilly beats on the door.
N: HILLY (CONT'D) GET OFF OF MY TOILET!!! Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a freight train, intensifies. The top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house, shattering a window. Minny crouches down and covers her head. A draft sucks the candle's flame toward the bottom of the door.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall, holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear.
C: AIBILEEN
D: On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SAME TIME
N: Skeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson. Cool winds head toward the dark, swirling horizon. In the distance, lightning strikes.
S: EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME
N: Celia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes.
C: AIBILEEN
D: God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone.
E: V.O.
S: INT/EXT. BATHROOM/BACKYARD (INTERCUT) - THREE MONTHS LATER
N: Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a small window hugging the ceiling. Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single bulb hanging above.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade maternity dress.
E: V.O.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up, and I'm off to the doctor. Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley gets excited and points to the garage bathroom.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Aibee bafroom, Momma! Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Aibee? Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: No!
C: AIBILEEN
D: Be right there, Baby Girl. Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
N: Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun. Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves. Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up.
C: SKEETER
D: Afternoon, Aibileen. Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.
C: SKEETER
D: Can I talk to you? A bus pulls up.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: You got some "Miss Myrna" questions for me?
C: SKEETER
D: No. Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.
C: SKEETER
D: Please. Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am. The bus pulls away.
C: SKEETER
D: Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful.
C: AIBILEEN
D: This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Dark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated bus stop.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MISSISSIPPI LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING
N: Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high as if to provide a shield of sorts. Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling at the edges. It's titled: "Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South" Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown. She carefully combs and styles her wig for work in the morning. Her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound nubs. The rotary wall phone rings. Aibileen hangs the wig on her chair and answers.
S: INT. MINNY'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - SAME TIME
N: Minny is hysterical.
C: MINNY
D: Oh, Aibileen! I went and did it now! Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord.
C: MINNY
D: Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town I stole a candelabra! That's why I can't get no job.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Everbody know you honest, Minny.
C: MINNY
D: Oh, but I got her back...I did something awful, Aibileen.
C: AIBILEEN
D: What you did?!
S: EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY
N: Minny stands on Hilly's porch holding a chocolate pie.
C: MINNY
D: I cain't tell! I ain't tellin' nobody! I done a terrible awful thing to that woman. And now she knows what I did! Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. Minny presents the pie and says "I am sorry." Hilly waves Minny inside.
E: O.S.
S: INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
C: MINNY
D: She got what she deserve, Aibileen. But, now I ain't gone never get no work again...Leroy gone kill me. Minny's husband, LEROY, 40, approaches behind Minny. Minny slowly turns...
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Aibileen hears a loud slap and Minny's phone dropping to the floor. Yelling and screaming follows.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Minny! She can't bear to listen and hangs up the phone. She sees Skeeter's phone number taped to the wall. Aibileen's breath becomes heavy. Anger wells inside her. She picks up the phone again and begins to dial.
S: EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - NEXT NIGHT - DUSK
N: Wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red satchel, Skeeter approaches a small, one-story wood structure. White paint peels, hydrangeas fill the yard. Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust. Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times. The porch steps creak under her big feet. Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first scene.
C: SKEETER
D: I parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Got dropped two streets over? Skeeter nods.
C: SKEETER
D: Aibileen, I now know it's against the law for us to meet like this. Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. Aibileen self- consciously flattens our her dress.
C: SKEETER
D: I've never seen you out of uniform before. You look nice, Aibileen.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Thank you. Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace. A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies resting on folded napkins. As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I'm sorry. I've never had a white person in my house before. Skeeter sips her tea.

C: SKEETER
D: Do you want to talk about the bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss Leefolt? Anything about the way she pays you? Has she ever yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley? Aibileen shakes her head.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: I'm sorry, I- Aibileen covers her mouth with her hand. Skeeter becomes disgusted with herself.

S: INT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MORNING
N: A congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the large choir. Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her ear. Yule suddenly leans back, shocked, shaking her head "no." Minny watches from two pews back. Her curiosity is peaked.

C: CELIA

C: CELIA
D: Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis.
C: MINNY
D: I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live there. Celia changes the subject.

C: MINNY
D: Gone be eatin' for two. Double the cookin'. Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house.

D: I know it's an awful lot to do. Five other maids have already turned me down...Can I at least give you some bus money?
C: MINNY
D: When you hear me say I don't wanna clean this house?
C: CELIA
D: What? So...You'll do it?! Before Minny can nod. Celia throws her arms around her. Minny backs away.

C: MINNY
D: Okay. What time you want me here?
C: CELIA
D: After eight, and you have to leave at four.

C: MINNY
D: And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he comes home and finds a colored woman up in his kitchen?
C: CELIA

E: CONT'D
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING

C: SKEETER
D: Bible study.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: On a Saturday night?

C: AIBILEEN
D: You don't have to do this, Minny.
C: MINNY
D: You damn right I don't! You two givin' me the heart palpitations. Minny storms out the back door. Skeeter looks like she might get sick.
C: AIBILEEN
D: And that was a good mood. Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen.
C: MINNY
D: All right...I'm gone do it. I just want to make sure you know this ain't no game we're playing here. Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle of the kitchen and sits.
N: MINNY (CONT'D) (TO SKEETER) Slide your chair out from under that table and face me. I want to see you square on at all times. Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and just sits there staring at Minny.
C: MINNY

E: CONT'D

S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SUNRISE

D: Mister Johnny?!
E: CONT'D
C: CELIA
D: Oh, no! Hide! Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table.
C: CELIA

C: CHARLOTTE
D: How can you not know his last name?

C: SKEETER
D: What is that?!
C: CHARLOTTE
D: The Shinolator! It cost eleven dollars. I'm a good mother. Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and reads from the Shinolator manual.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: "The Miracle Straitening Cap" must remain on the head for two hours."
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Two hours?! Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine. Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter sits under the Shinolator buried in a magazine. Pascagoula enters and sets down a glass of tea.
C: SKEETER

S: INT. FARM TRUCK - COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Chunks of mud fly off the tires. The June sun has set the truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees. Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The Shinolator meets its match. A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly isn't an option. A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows. Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit. Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.
C: WILLIAM
D: With your daddy's endorsement, I can win that Senate seat. Stuart feigns interest.
C: STUART
D: I'll talk to him. Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink. Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a grandfather clock announcing half past the hour. The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.
C: SKEETER
D: Hey. As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand. Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.
C: HILLY
D: Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola. Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter sits on the toilet downing a Coca-Cola. Hilly twists the last of Skeeter's hair into giant rollers.
C: HILLY
D: Skeeter, you don't even have on lipstick! Skeeter dabs her armpits.
C: SKEETER
D: It was so goddamn awful. I hit a cat. Hilly sprays Final Net.
C: HILLY
D: Well...What do you think of him? Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.
C: SKEETER
D: He looks handsome. Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.
C: SKEETER
D: All right, give it to me. One to ten? Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Seven.
C: SKEETER
D: Really?! Seven? Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.
C: HILLY
D: Honey, you're beautiful. Just go on out there...you're gonna do great. It's your time, Skeeter. I just know it. Hilly hugs Skeeter.
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table adorned with white linens, silver and fine china. The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed as a JAZZ QUARTET plays softly in a corner. A WAITER approaches. Stuart leans into Skeeter without making eye contact.
C: STUART
D: You want a drink?
C: SKEETER
D: Just water, please.
N: STUART (TO WAITER) Double Old Kentucky straight...with a water back...Make that two backs.
C: SKEETER
D: THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama? Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.
C: HILLY
D: "Roll Tide." We still love him. Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.
C: SKEETER
D: Now you're in the oil business. Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.
C: STUART
D: The money's good. If that's what you really want to know.
C: SKEETER
D: That's not what I- Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on the front of the restaurant. Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.
C: STUART
D: Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly? Johnny Foote? Hilly scowls.
C: STUART
D: Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt. Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs.
C: STUART
D: So, what do you do with your time?
C: SKEETER
D: I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.
C: STUART
D: You mean housekeeping? Skeeter nods and grabs her water.
C: STUART
D: Jesus, I can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column. Except maybe writing one.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME TIME
N: Hilly and William finish shaking hands with the Lieutenant Governor. As he walks away, Hilly shouts out.
C: HILLY
D: We'd love your support on election day! Celia and Johnny walk up. Hilly stiffens.
C: JOHNNY
D: Hilly, you look lovely tonight.
C: HILLY
D: Thank you, Johnny.
C: JOHNNY
D: William, have you ever met Celia? William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand.
C: WILLIAM
D: Nice to meet you. Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm.
C: HILLY
D: Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. Celia musters up all the courage inside her.
C: CELIA FOOTE
D: Hilly, did you ever get the messages that I've been calling you?
C: HILLY
D: I did not.
C: CELIA FOOTE
D: Well, I would love to help with the benefit. I have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed.
C: HILLY
D: "Save the dates" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? Celia shakes her head.
C: HILLY
D: Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh?
E: CONT'D
N: HILLY (CONT'D) (TO WILLIAM) Now, come on, before they run out of Trout Almondine. Hilly pulls William away. Johnny grabs Celia's hand.
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: STUART
D: Sounds like a ploy to find a husband...becoming an expert on keeping house.
C: SKEETER
D: Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.
C: HILLY
D: What'd we miss?
C: STUART
D: Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in? Professional husband hunting?
C: SKEETER
D: I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.
C: HILLY
D: Who? Is? Hungry? Skeeter stands.
C: SKEETER
D: Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' Tables begin to stare.
C: STUART
D: Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart! As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING
N: Hilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers nervously.
C: HILLY
D: Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower.
C: YULE MAY
D: Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you and Mister William something. Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching her hands.
C: YULE MAY
D: My twin boys finished high school, both on the honor roll...My husband and I have been saving for years to send them to college.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Okay... Only now does William lower his paper.
C: YULE MAY
D: We are short seventy-five dollars on one of the tuitions. William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek.
C: WILLIAM
D: Well, I'm late. Gotta go. William leaves.
C: HILLY
D: Go on...
C: YULE MAY
D: Now...We're faced with having to choose. Which son gets to go...if we don't find all the money. Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.
C: YULE MAY
D: Would you consider givin' us a loan? I'll...I'll work for free until it's paid off.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: That's not working for free, Yule May. That's paying off a debt.
C: YULE MAY
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: HILLY
D: As a Christian, I'm going to do you a favor. Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms.
C: HILLY
D: God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able. You need to come up with this money on your own. You'll thank me one day. Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING
N: Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually. Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while shopping) keep quietly to themselves. White women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there. Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.
C: MINNY
D: That's her. Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting produce.
C: MINNY
D: Lord, she's trying to shop. Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato, hands it to Celia, and scurries away.
E: CONT'D
N: CELIA (SHOUTS OUT) Thanks, Doll!
C: MINNY
D: Miss Celia just don't see `em. The lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly, nobody. Aibileen just nods.
C: MINNY
D: What you so quiet for? I know you got a opinion `bout all this.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: You gone accuse me a philosophizing.
C: MINNY
D: I ain't afraid a no philosophy.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I don't believe in lines anymore. Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there. Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.
C: MINNY
D: Oh, they there. I know. I get punished for crossing them.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line...need to be punished.
C: MINNY
D: You know I ain't studying no line like that.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Cause it ain't there. `Cept in Leroy's head. Lines between black and white ain't there either. Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car.
C: MINNY
D: So, I ain't crossing no line if I tell Miss Celia she ain't good enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?
C: AIBILEEN
D: All I'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries. Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, approaches the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a
E: Medgar Evers wife
N: DAUGHTER, 8. Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a bench.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Law, the Evers children have gotten so big!
E: CONT'D
N: MINNY (QUIETLY) Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a good man...And you better not try to say they ain't no line between her Medgar and my Leroy.
C: AIBILEEN
D: No. You got me. A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.
S: EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY
N: Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby shower. A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and Hilly's best sliver. Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools. Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper. Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's one piece.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Mae Mo hungry, Momma. Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.
C: ELIZABETH
D: She's always hungry. All the women laugh except for Skeeter.
C: SKEETER
D: You know she can hear you, Elizabeth? Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen, we gave that scraper to Hilly and William for their wedding present. Chantilly!
C: AIBILEEN
D: It so pretty. Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.
C: HILLY
D: Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's? Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at Skeeter's red satchel.
C: HILLY
D: Nice to have your own, isn't it?
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am.
C: HILLY
D: Separate but equal. That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor.
C: SKEETER
D: Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government. Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.
C: HILLY
D: Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom? Sent the boys over and the equipment, too. Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something. Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am...And I thank you. Hilly smiles and nods.
C: HILLY
D: Well...You. Are. Welcome. Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into Hilly and hugs her.
C: AIBILEEN
D: One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. Hilly kisses her son gently.
E: V.O.
C: AIBILEEN
D: And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY
N: Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their "good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen.
C: YULE MAY
D: May I get you something?
C: SKEETER
D: No, thanks...
N: (HUSHED) Yule May, I wanted to talk to you. Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still cackling out on the street.
C: YULE MAY
D: I know what you want to ask, Miss Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny already did. Yule May closes the kitchen door.
C: YULE MAY
D: I'm trying to get my boys off to college. It's worthwhile what y'all doing, but my boys are worth more.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: I understand.
C: HILLY
D: What do you "understand," Skeeter? Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room.
E: O.C.
C: SKEETER
D: Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college.
C: HILLY
D: Is that true, Yule May?
C: YULE MAY
D: Yes, Ma'am. Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow laws in her hand.
C: HILLY
D: Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money?
C: SKEETER
D: Of course not, Hilly! Hilly approaches Skeeter.
C: HILLY
D: Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.
C: SKEETER
D: Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom.
C: HILLY
D: Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.
C: HILLY
D: But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff?
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: My dad had me get that for him.
C: HILLY
D: I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.
C: SKEETER
D: Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY
N: Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative." Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She types: Don't risk your children's and family's health!
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Yule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it. Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over. She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold. The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket.
S: INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON
N: As Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Skeeter!
C: SKEETER
D: What?!
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you.
C: SKEETER
D: He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat. And, you need a goat!
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room. Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches. Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red tie. His nose is pink from working in the sun. No one says a word. Finally...
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Stuart, would you like a cocktail? Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the..." look.
C: STUART
D: No, Ma'am. Little too early.
C: SKEETER
D: Ha! Charlotte moves on.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: What's your last name, Stuart?
C: STUART
D: Whitworth.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Hmm...Where are you from?
C: STUART
D: Natchez.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Really? Well, I know a Whitworth from Natchez...But he's a Senator up in Washington.
C: STUART
D: Yes, Ma'am. That's my daddy.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Who is?
C: STUART
D: Senator Whitworth. That's my father. Charlotte's jaw drops to her string of pearls.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Really? Stuart nods. Charlotte stands, flustered yet joyful.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Well...tell him I said "Hello"...I'm going to go see if Pascagoula needs some help in the kitchen. Charlotte backs away behind Stuart's chair. She points at Skeeter violently, as if to say, DON'T MESS THIS UP!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter and Stuart stand beneath an old Cypress tree as Charlotte peeps from an upstairs window.
C: STUART
D: Look. I know it was a few weeks back, but I came here to say I'm sorry for the way I acted.
C: SKEETER
D: Who sent you? William or Hilly?
C: STUART
D: Neither. I was rude, and I've been thinking about it a lot.
C: SKEETER
D: Well, I haven't. So, just go.
C: STUART
D: Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on any date. I wasn't even close to ready. Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.
C: STUART
D: I was engaged last year. She ended it. Skeeter refuses to pity him.
E: CONT'D
C: STUART
D: We'd been dating since we were fifteen. You know how it is.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Actually, I don't. I've never dated anyone before. Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.
C: STUART
D: Well! That must be it then.
C: SKEETER
D: What?
C: STUART
D: I've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking.
C: SKEETER
D: I've got plenty to say...
C: STUART
D: Would you like to...come downtown with me and have dinner? We could talk... We could listen to each other this time.
C: SKEETER
D: I can't think of anything worse. Stuart looks down and nods.
C: STUART
D: Then, I'm sorry. That's what I came to say and...I said it. Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously weaving his strong fingers through his hair. Skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out to Stuart.
C: SKEETER
D: Just give me a minute! Stuart turns.
C: SKEETER
D: Let me get my sweater.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Skeeter and Stuart sit closely as the same waiter as before approaches.
C: STUART
D: What do you want, Skeeter?
C: SKEETER
D: I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice.
C: STUART
D: No, I mean in life. What do you want? Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter is holding. Stuart nods as two glasses are set before them. The waiter leaves.
C: SKEETER
D: I want to be a journalist. Maybe a novelist. Maybe both.
C: STUART
D: I like that...I've been thinking about you. You're smart, you're pretty, you're...tall!
C: SKEETER
D: Pretty?
C: STUART
D: Yes. And I read your column. Very informative.
N: (SMILING) I never knew Crisco got rid of diaper rash. Skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully.
C: STUART
D: I hope you get to write something really good, Skeeter. Something you believe in. Stuart suddenly leans over and kisses Skeeter.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. DRIVE-IN-MOVIE - ONE WEEK LATER
N: Stuart and Skeeter make out HARD in the back of the Holbrook's convertible. Hilly and William sit in the front. Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view. Proud of herself, she pats William's leg. William slides his hand up Hilly's leg. She jerks it away.
S: EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
N: Aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket. She feverishly scours grease off the baseboards. Elizabeth's car pulls up. Aibileen smiles.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Baby girl home.
N: The car door slams shut.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen! My trunk's full! Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee. Outside, Elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically.
E: O.C.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mae Mobley! No! Stop! Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window.
E: O.C. CONT'D
S: INT. LEEFOLT BACKYARD - SAME TIME
N: Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage. Door wide open, pants around her ankles.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma. Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her hard on the behind.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It! Is! Not! Mae Mobley begins to cry. Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss- whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm.
C: ELIZABETH
D: This is dirty out here! You'll catch diseases. Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: No! No! No!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie. Mae Mobley's face is red and damp.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. Aibileen kisses her on the cheek.
C: AIBILEEN
D: You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? Mae Mobley nods. The phone rings. Aibileen rises.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: I got it!
E: O.C.
N: Aibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley.
C: AIBILEEN
D: One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Martian? How big?
C: AIBILEEN
D: Oh, he about six-two.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: What's his name?
C: AIBILEEN
D: Martian Luther King.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: What did he look like?
C: AIBILEEN
D: Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Why Aibee? Why was they so mean?
C: AIBILEEN
D: `Cause he was green. Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen! Come on! We have to go help Hilly. Now! Come on! Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley.
S: EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow. A stream of people walk toward them, laughing. They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn. Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top, providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by. The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof. Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's supervision. Aibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Look! Look, Aibee. Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of her.
C: HILLY
D: Get out of here! Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.
C: HILLY
D: Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach. Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Go help those boys GET THOSE
E: CONT'D
N: TOILETS OFF MY LAWN!
S: INT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a YOUNG BLACK MAN. Two white men sit right behind the white driver. The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road. In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block. A few people gather.
C: DRIVER
D: Y'all stay put. Let me find out what's going on. As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle and looks ahead. The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.
C: YOUNG BLACK MAN
D: What happen up there, Mister?
C: DRIVER
D: Colored people off. White people lemme know where y'all are going. I'll get you as close as I can.
N: As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white passenger taps the driver on the shoulder.
C: WHITE PASSENGER
D: What's going on? Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs.
C: DRIVER
D: I don't know. Some nigger got shot. Where you headed? The bus door shuts and the driver backs away.
S: EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER
N: Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air.
C: YOUNG BLACK MAN
D: You all right? You close to home?
C: AIBILEEN
D: I be all right. My house is seven blocks from here.
C: YOUNG BLACK MAN
D: Want me to walk you?
C: AIBILEEN
D: Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law, I hope this ain't as bad as- Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run. She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls hard to her knees. Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch light and pulls herself up.
S: INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER
N: Minny sits with all five of her children, Sugar, LEROY JR, 12, KINDRA, 10, FELICIA, 6, and BENNY, 4. They all listen anxiously to a radio on the table. Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor. Minny jumps up to help her. She sees blood and grass stains streaking the knees of Aibileen's panty hose.
C: MINNY
D: Aibileen! You okay? Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: Almost ten years serving as the Field Secretary for the NAACP...Medgar Evers is dead. Aibileen swallows hard.
E: O.S.
C: MINNY
D: KKK shot him! Hour ago. Right in front a his children, Aibileen.
C: AIBILEEN
D: We gone pray for the Evers. We gone pray for Myrlie. Minny raises her fists.
C: MINNY
D: We living in hell! We trapped. Our kids is trapped. Minny turns to Sugar.

D: There's so much blood. Why is there so much blood this time? Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags.
C: CELIA
D: Please, Minny. Will you get it out? I can't look at it again. Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on Celia's neck and pushes it down.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Shhh! There's a knock at door.

C: MINNY
D: Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mister Johnny. They mad you married one a they mens. Especially since Mister Johnny and Miss Hilly had just broke up, too.
C: CELIA
D: So, Hilly probably thinks I was fooling around with Johnny while they were still going steady.
C: MINNY
D: Missus Walters says Miss Hilly still sweet on Mister Johnny, too. Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.
C: CELIA
D: No wonder! They don't hate me...They hate what they think I did!
C: MINNY
D: They hate you cause they think you're white trash! And don't be takin' pies to those women!
C: CELIA
D: Well, I'm just going to have to let Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend stealer. In fact, I'll tell her Friday night at the benefit. Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.
C: MINNY
D: Now, Miss Celia...please don't be going to that benefit. Celia gets some ice out of the fridge.
C: MINNY
D: Did you hear what I said? Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She looks at the cut above her eye.

E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes.
C: CALLIE
D: I used to take a shortcut ever day to work at Doctor Dixon's house. Cut through this farmer's lower forty to get there. One day, that farmer was waitin' on me with a gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I walk on his land again. Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres. Told him he `bout to start farmin' too. But he bought it just for me. So I could get to work easy. He did. Skeeter closes her eyes for moment. When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING
C: BEFORE HER.
D: Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the vision is gone. Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.
C: GRETCHEN
D: All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they?
C: SKEETER
D: Yes. Very nice.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Well, they hate you. You know this? Every little thing about you. But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor. Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback.
C: SKEETER
D: You don't have to do this.
C: GRETCHEN
D: You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me? Gave me the heel of her bread. These women are playing a trick on you. They'll never tell you the truth!
C: SKEETER
D: You don't know what they've said.
C: GRETCHEN
D: Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you. Nigger. Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen.
C: AIBILEEN
D: That's enough, Gretchen.
C: GRETCHEN
D: You just as dumb as she is.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Get out a my house!
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely. Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles. About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot. Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me.
C: AIBILEEN

D: Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies.
E: CONT'D
N: Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads the card aloud.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is touched. The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers. Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her. The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen waves back and smiles. Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I guess. And you didn't just eat one. You ate two slices! Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in. As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up.

D: You trying to get yourself killed?!

On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie promises to again be a big money maker. Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous, pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts command attention. The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her dress and jiggle across the ceiling. A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's shoe.
C: OLD HUSBAND
D: Look at the jugs on that one!
E: a little too loudly
N: Other wives dig fingernails into husbands' arms. The man's wife responds louder.
C: OLD WIFE
D: Bosoms are for bedrooms and breast- feeding. Not occasions of dignity. Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny.
C: CELIA
D: Do you think I might have overdressed a little? It's supposed to be formal, but this looks like a funeral.
C: JOHNNY
D: You look gorgeous. Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.
C: MINNY
D: Look what she got on. Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Lord have mercy. Ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight. Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their relationship.
N: MINNY (REGARDING JOHNNY) And that's the man that don't even know he's paying me. Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative.
C: AIBILEEN
D: There's Skeeter and that must be Stuart. He's handsome... Missus Walters?! Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.
C: MINNY
D: Hilly can throw her in a home, but she can't keep the taxis away.
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Celia approaches Elizabeth and Jolene who talk next to a punch bowl. Celia is now drinking some kind of pink drink with an umbrella sticking out of it.
C: CELIA
D: Well, hello, Elizabeth.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hi. Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet potato sack cinched with red ribbon.
C: CELIA
D: Those are lovely dresses.
C: JOLENE
D: Yours too.
C: CELIA
D: Really?! I was worried I was a tad overdressed. Jolene reaches out an pats Celia's shoulder.
C: JOLENE
D: Oh, no. You're just perfect. Elizabeth pulls Jolene away. Celia downs her drink.
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
N: The guests are now seated at twenty-eight round tables. Scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates. Hilly makes her way to the podium.
C: HILLY
D: Everybody enjoying their dinner? The room claps enthusiastically.
N: HILLY (CONT'D) (FLATLY) Let's give a nice round of applause for all the men and women that have helped make tonight possible. Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room.
C: HILLY
D: A cause I'm sure is dear to their hearts as well. Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies down. Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair.
E: CONT'D
C: CELIA
D: Woo-hoo! Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down. Celia reaches for Johnny's glass of wine.
C: JOHNNY
D: Honey, maybe you've had enough to drink. Try to eat your dinner.
C: CELIA
D: And have my stomach poke out?!
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LATER THAT EVENING
N: As Celia looks at the prize table's bids, Johnny and Stuart lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men. Hilly suddenly slides next to Johnny completely ignoring Stuart.
C: HILLY
D: Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised to see you here. Everybody knows you can't stand parties like this. Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.
C: JOHNNY
D: Celia wouldn't have missed this for anything.
C: HILLY
D: Where is that wife of yours? Out selling hotdogs? Johnny looks away.
C: HILLY
D: Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We dated long enough where I can do that, can't I? Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge Stuart. She and Stuart never look each other's way.
E: CONT'D
N: HILLY (CONT'D) (FLATLY) Stuart. STUART (FLATTER) Hilly. Hilly walks away as Jolene approaches the podium.
C: JOLENE
D: I've got the list of winners!
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jolene finishes up the winners list.
C: JOLENE
D: I hope you enjoy your new set of tires, Missus Atwell. Now, on to the baked goods. Jolene flips a page.
C: JOLENE
D: Oh, yum! Yum! The highest bid in baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's chocolate pie. Congratulations, Hilly Holbrook! The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts. Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they don't know. Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes very alert.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: What? I didn't bid on anything. Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.
C: HILLY
D: Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie.
E: CONT'D
N: SKEETER (TO STUART) Oh, no. Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred.
C: CELIA
D: Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies. Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve.
C: CELIA
D: I've wanted to talk to you all night. Minny told me why you won't be my friend. You think me and Johnny went behind your back.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Let me go! Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through the air. Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.
C: STUART
D: Oh, God.
C: CELIA
D: I'm so sorry.
N: HILLY (GRITTED TEETH) What are you trying to do to me? What are you and that nigra up to? Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice.
C: CELIA
D: I don't know what you-
C: HILLY
D: -You liar! Who did you tell?! Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but Celia is still yelling.
C: CELIA
D: Hilly, I got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up! The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's noses wrinkle.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: Oh, shit.
C: HILLY
D: Shut up, Mother. Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm. Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.
C: CELIA
D: Johnny never cheated on you...At least, not with me. Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.
C: HILLY
D: Johnny would never-
C: CELIA
D: And I'm sorry I thought you'd be tickled to win that pie.
C: HILLY
D: You tell that nigra if she tells anybody, I will make her suffer. Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen. They all immediately look away. Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth.
C: JOHNNY
D: Celia, what's wrong, Honey?
C: CELIA
D: Uh-oh. Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet. The entire room gasps in horror.
C: JOHNNY
D: Oh, shit! Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and runs for the bathroom. He follows. Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.
C: HILLY
D: Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Yes, ma'am.
S: INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink filled with sudsy water, washing dishes. Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five other young girls.
C: SUGAR
D: That big-boobed lady Momma works for was drunker than an Injun on payday. Upchucked in front a everbody! As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of her head.
C: MINNY
D: Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth. Clothes on your back! You hear me? Minny storms off.
N: SUGAR (TO HERSELF) You do it all the time.
S: EXT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Hilly and William walk to their car. Missus Walters follows closely behind, holding Minny's pie.
C: HILLY
D: Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: No thanks, I got a pie to eat. Hilly spins around and sees the pie.
C: HILLY
D: You throw that pie away right now!
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: I spent good money on this. Won it just for you...
C: HILLY
D: You?! You signed me up? Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.
C: MISSUS WALTERS
D: I may have trouble remembering my own name and what country I live in. But there's two things I can't seem to forget. That my own daughter threw me in a nursing home...And that she ate Minny's shit. Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi cab.
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON
N: Celia lies in bed with the covers pulled over her face. Minny enters carrying a tray of food, setting it down next to two other trays of uneaten food.
C: MINNY
D: Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how dinner got on the table if you laid up in bed? Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.
C: CELIA
D: The way Hilly looked at me. Like I was trash on the road. Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.
C: CELIA
D: She billed me for her dress. In lieu of payment, she's asked that I send two-hundred dollars to the African Children's Fund and then she banned me from all future League events.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: She don't count. Don't judge yourself by the way she see you.
C: CELIA
D: I'm not right for this kind of life, Minny. I don't need a dinner table for twelve people.
C: CELIA
D: I couldn't get two people over here if I begged. She called me a liar and accused me of getting her that pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if it wasn't for that! I can't do this anymore to Johnny. I'm going back to Sugar Ditch.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: You gone leave your husband cause you threw up at some party? Celia sobs.
C: MINNY
D: Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Celia stares at Minny, wide-eyed and disgusted.
C: MINNY
D: Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout "The Terrible Awful," that you were making fun a her. It's my fault she pounced on you. But if you leave Mister Johnny, then Miss Hilly done won the whole ball game. Then she done beat me, and she done beat you. Celia lies there. Minny's concerned she's said too much.
C: CELIA
D: Thank you. For telling me that.
S: INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NEW ORLEANS - ONE WEEK LATER
N: Stuart lies on a bed inside the Presidential Suite of the Roosevelt Hotel. He's on the phone with Skeeter.
C: STUART
D: Hey, Honey.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME
N: Skeeter talks to Stuart. Pascagoula cooks breakfast.
C: SKEETER
D: Stuart! How are you calling me? Aren't you on the rig?
C: STUART
D: What if I told you I have twenty- four hours in New Orleans?
C: STUART
D: That I'm in the Presidential Suite of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we have dinner reservations in the Blue Room tonight and lunch tomorrow at Galatoires. Skeeter becomes troubled...
E: CONT'D
C: STUART
D: Did you hear me? I spoke to your dad, and he's gonna have Jameso drive you down right now.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Oh, Stuart.
C: STUART
D: What?
C: SKEETER
D: I have to work.
C: STUART
D: Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter, it's a cleaning column.
C: SKEETER
D: I have a deadline, Sweetie. You should have asked me about this.
C: STUART
D: I'm trying to be romantic...
C: SKEETER
D: I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come. Stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone.
S: INT. FAYE BELLE'S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Aibileen and Skeeter sit across from, FAYE BELLE, 101, palsied and gray skinned and hunched in a wheelchair. Aibileen grabs Faye Belle's hand stirring a sudden flash of memory. Her voice is coarse and hard to understand.
C: FAYE BELLE
D: I remember hiding with Miss Lilia in a steamer trunk while Yankee soldiers stomped through Master's house. We were both four. Eighty- five years later she died in my arms. We's were friends `til the end. Her grandson still pays my rent. Buys all my groceries too.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The manuscript sits before Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.
C: SKEETER
D: I have one more story to type, but other than that, we are done.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Law, look at all them pages. Two- hundred and sixty-six of `em.
C: MINNY
D: Now we just wait and see? Hopin' Missus Stein publish it? Skeeter nods.
C: MINNY
D: What story you got left to type?
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Mine. Aibileen looks at Skeeter.
C: AIBILEEN
D: If your momma won't tell you, I reckon I will.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room. A bowl rests on the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side. Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Have you been crying? You know that ages your skin, Dear.
C: SKEETER
D: Mother, I need to talk to you about Constantine.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.
C: SKEETER
D: Well, I have to speak to her.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Now, you look. I was good to Constantine. Oh, she talked back plenty of times, and I put up with it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice...
C: SKEETER
D: What...happened?
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Charlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon. Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time. Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly. The effects of arthritis are apparent.
E: V.O.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived. A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a point about the damp floor...
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch. As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to Charlotte.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Then, she burned the coffee. She had gotten so old, Skeeter. Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly. Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman. Her hands tremble.
E: V.O.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and I had had it. The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Watch out! With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Get a hold of yourself, Constantine! Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted, she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: And that's when it happened. Constantine wets herself. Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from her. Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room. Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to Constantine's aid. Constantine looks to Charlotte.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER
N: Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time at the Phelan Plantation...
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter trembles. Charlotte won't look at her.
C: SKEETER
D: How could you humiliate her like that?!
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I didn't mean to.
C: SKEETER
D: Why didn't you help her?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I was upset. I didn't know what else to do.
C: SKEETER
D: So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I didn't throw her away, Skeeter. Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back. But she had already moved to Chicago. Left everything behind.
C: SKEETER
D: `Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart!
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Please don't do this to me, Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you have to remember, they're not like us. They are different. Charlotte gets defensive.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: And you idolized her too much! You always have!
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: I needed somebody to look up to. Skeeter turns to leave.
C: SKEETER
D: I have to go find her. She needs me.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago...so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine. Skeeter turns back to her mother.
C: SKEETER
D: And?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: When he got there...she was dead, Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey. Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's hand.
C: SKEETER
D: Why didn't y'all tell me all this?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I knew you'd blame me...when it wasn't my fault. It just happened, and it was so unfortunate. I'm sorry, Eugenia.
C: SKEETER
D: When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago?
N: Charlotte pulls the white basin closer, hugs it to her side.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Two weeks. Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: Skeeter stands on the back patio crying. She slowly walks off into the yard.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Constantine's story finally made it in our book. But the reason she got fired did not. Miss Skeeter just couldn't put that kind a shame on her own mother.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. BOOKSTORE - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - SIX MONTHS LATER
N: The front window of a bookstore displays many of the nation's top selling books. A clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner.
C: AIBILEEN
D: They printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance Miss Stein had ever seen. The stack is "The Help," in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MINNY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Minny stands over the stove frying chicken as Sugar enters with the day's mail. Minny snatches the mail from her and sees an envelope from Harper and Row. Minny tears it open. Her eyes go wide.
C: AIBILEEN
D: We got four hundred dollars. Got another four hundred when it got printed. Divided thirteen ways that came to sixty-one fifty-three a person. Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check as the chicken sizzles.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen and Minny hug each other as the jump up and down with checks in hand.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: Minny knocks on the door holding bags of groceries.
C: MINNY
D: Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a that bed and let me in. It's twelve noon. I did all the shopping just like you asked. The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch, looking beautiful, still dressed tacky.
C: MINNY
D: Well, look at you, Miss Celia.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Celia leads Minny into the dining room. The table, set beautifully in silver and crystal, is covered with delicious looking casseroles and fried chicken.
C: MINNY
D: What's all this?
C: CELIA
D: I cooked it all by myself. I wanted to do something special. I wanted to say "thank you."
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Celia and Minny dine, and Minny's enjoying it.
C: MINNY
D: Greens got just the right amount a hock taste to `em. That's a good pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught you to cook like this? Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens.
C: MINNY
D: Corn bread's happy now. Celia lays down her fork.
E: CONT'D
C: CELIA
D: Are you happy, Minny?
C: MINNY
D: Why you ask such a funny question?
C: CELIA
D: Are you?
C: MINNY
D: A course I's happy. You happy too. Big house, big yard, good husband.
C: CELIA
D: You know, if I were you, I'd give it right back to him. I'd hit him over the head with a skillet and tell him to go straight to hell... Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses.
C: MINNY
D: Maybe I will. Celia jumps up.
C: CELIA
D: I almost forgot the dessert. Minny smiles softly as Celia disappears into the kitchen.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
N: Aibileen irons as Elizabeth enters with shopping bags. She races to the television and turns it on. As the tube warms up, we hear the conclusion of a Tide commercial. WLBT's lunchtime show, "People Will Talk," continues. INTERCUT WITH STUDIO, LEEFOLT HOME, HILLY'S HOME, AND ALL OTHER VIEWERS' HOMES.
S: INT. WLBT TELEVISION STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jolene French sits on the set of Jackson's morning show. A MALE HOST watches as the show runner counts down.
C: SHOW RUNNER
D: Five, four, three, two, one.
C: MALE HOST
D: Welcome back to "People Will Talk." And do we have something to talk about. Jolene has quite a book to review. Jolene shakes her head, visibly upset.
S: INT. HOLBROOK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Hilly watches Jolene on television as her new maid, ERNESTINE, pours a cup of coffee with her right hand. Ernestine's left arm is missing. The maid pickings for Hilly have gotten slim.
C: HILLY
D: Why are you frowning, Jolene? Hilly leans over and taps her television.
C: HILLY
D: You don't look cute that way.
E: CONT'D
N: LEEFOLT HOUSE
C: MALE HOST
D: It's called "The Help." A new book by an anonymous author. Aibileen jerks her head toward the television.
C: MALE HOST
D: Touching and enlightening, it's filled with testimonials from Mississippi's own housekeepers.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Minny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in front of the television.
C: CELIA
D: Look how cute that dress is.
C: MALE HOST
D: Takes place in the fictional town of "Niceville." The book is dedicated to C and T. If you're out there C and T, we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me. The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps.
C: JOLENE FRENCH
D: It's not Jackson! It's a disgrace to the South! A disgrace to good Southern women who've spent their lives taking care of their help.
C: LEEFOLT HOME
D: Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt.
C: MALE HOST
D: But did you read that ending?
C: JOLENE FRENCH
D: I know I personally treat my help like family, and every one of my friends does the same.
N: MALE HOST (INTO CAMERA) Bertha, if you're listening, I have a new found respect for what you do. And, believe me, I'll be passin' on dessert at your table!
C: FOOTE LIVING ROOM
D: Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty plate, never taking her eyes off the television.
C: JOLENE FRENCH
D: Do not buy this book! Ladies of Jackson, do not support slander with your husband's hard earned- Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream commercial.
N: HILLY'S HOME
C: HILLY
D: Don't cut her off like that.
N: LEEFOLT HOME
C: ELIZABETH
D: What's that book called, Aibileen?
C: AIBILEEN
D: I...I wasn't paying attention.
S: INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER THAT DAY
N: Stacks of "The Help" rest on tables in the store. Elizabeth enters, pick up two copies and pulls them close to her body. She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy.
C: TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY
D: Back at the table of books, we see in rapid succession the books quickly disappearing by the hands of Jacksonians.
S: INT - AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
N: Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table. Aibileen's phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer.
C: SKEETER
D: I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared.
C: MINNY
D: `One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour. She better read it quick and start the "this ain't Jackson crusade."
C: SKEETER
D: Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book.
C: MINNY
D: Oh, she gone read it. Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee. She gone read it.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME/HOLBROOK HOME (INTERCUT) - DAY
N: Elizabeth and Hilly read the book aloud over the phone with each other. They stop and nod with speculation.
S: INT. BUS - DAY
N: A bus is filled with domestics en route to work. Everyone is either reading the book or having it read to them.
S: INT. NURSING HOME - NIGHT
N: Missus Walters reads to a group of women in the home.
S: INT. PHELAN HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Charlotte lies in bed reading the book next to Robert, who is asleep. As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization. Troubled, she starts to wake Robert but doesn't. Charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her chest. She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - DUSK
N: Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes.
C: STUART
D: That month felt like a year. I missed you so much.
C: SKEETER
D: Me, too.
C: STUART
D: Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket and places it in Skeeter's lap. A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires. Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring.
C: SKEETER
D: Stuart...I have to tell you something.
C: STUART
D: How about "yes?!" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. Skeeter touches Stuart's face.
C: SKEETER
D: I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone.
C: STUART
D: Hang on. Did you say `yes'?
C: SKEETER
D: Yes. Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.
C: SKEETER
D: But listen. Can I have your word? Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.
E: CONT'D
C: STUART
D: Sure. You have my word.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Stuart storms off the porch, dumbfounded. Finally.
C: STUART
D: This is what you've been writing for the last twelve months?! What happened to the cleaning column?
C: SKEETER
D: I did both.
N: Skeeter approaches Stuart.
C: STUART
D: So, the talk in town? I said they were dead wrong. Told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that. Skeeter reaches to calm him. He pulls away.
C: STUART
D: That joke you played on Hilly with the toilets. Hell, that's funny. But this? I don't understand why you did this...why you even care.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: What?
C: STUART
D: Things are fine around here. Why stir up trouble?
C: SKEETER
D: I'm not stirring up trouble, Stuart. Trouble's already here.

D: I guess it is. Skeeter grabs his arm.
C: SKEETER
D: I had to tell you. You needed to know. Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...
C: STUART
D: I guess I don't really know you, Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody I don't know. Stuart looks down at the ring.
C: STUART

E: CONT'D
C: STUART

E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Just leave.

C: CHARLOTTE
D: Finally!
C: SKEETER
D: You knew?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Of course. He had to ask Daddy for your hand. She lifts Skeeter's ring hand. Seeing her bare finger, Charlotte's smile fades. Skeeter prepares for the worst.
C: SKEETER
D: Just say it.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: What did you do?!
C: SKEETER
D: Nothing! Skeeter stands to walk away.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Young lady, I'm talking to you! Skeeter sits back down...
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Stuart'll come around. It's a funny dance. Took this one a year. Anyway, my news. After a long talk with your daddy, I've made a decision. My health's been on the uptick these past few weeks. And I know the doctor says it's some kind of last

E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Oh, Momma. Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away.

C: AIBILEEN
D: The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes William's campaign poster taped to the window.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Hilly reads the book in bed. William is fast asleep. Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy. She slowly turns a page and freezes. Her face turns white. Hilly balls both fists, looks to the ceiling and screams louder than humanly possible. THE SCREAM CONTINUES OVER:
S: INT. SKEETER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: Skeeter lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: Aibileen lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.
S: INT. MINNY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: Minny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder. Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake. Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny.
C: SUGAR
D: Momma, there's a white man at our door!
C: MAN
D: Minny Jackson! Are you in there?! Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and grabs a bat from behind the door.

C: JOHNNY
D: Finally, I meet Minny Jackson... As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny turns and stops the bat with his hand.
C: JOHNNY
D: What the hell are you doin'?! Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her hands in front of her.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: Please don't hurt me! My babies are in the house. Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor.

S: INT. MINNY'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Johnny and Minny sit at her kitchen table.

C: JOHNNY
D: Well, I know the day you came to our house, she started getting better. And I'm not just talking about the cookin' either.
C: MINNY
D: You knew I was there?
C: JOHNNY
D: Fried chicken and okra on the first night? Y'all should have at least put corn pone on the table.
C: MINNY
D: I couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny.
C: JOHNNY
D: Next morning, I snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were. Given ol' Oscar a wipe down. Minny smiles for the first time.

D: You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house with the usual suspects, except Skeeter. LOU ANN TEMPLETON has taken her place. Aibileen nervously pours coffee.
C: JOLENE FRENCH
D: I heard that Betty character might be Charlene.
C: HILLY
D: It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage. I bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra. Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup.
C: LOU ANN TEMPLETON
D: And, Jolene, didn't your momma leave Cora to you in her will?
C: JOLENE
D: Well, yes...But that's not odd is it? Happens all the time, right? A sudden realization washes over Jolene.
C: LOU ANN TEMPLETON
D: Did anybody ever figured out who C and T are?
C: HILLY
D: The book is NOT ABOUT JACKSON! Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate.
C: HILLY
D: You spilled some, Aibileen. Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee. Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them.
E: CONT'D

D: Get me a new plate. One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth.

S: INT. MOUNT ZION BABTIST CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER
N: As Minny and Aibileen enter the church. Four-hundred members stand at once. The congregation begins to clap. Minny and Aibileen look around trying to figure out the source of adulation. They both start clapping too. Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Who we clappin' for? The woman laughs.
C: WOMAN
D: Honey, we clappin' for you. The woman raises a copy of "The Help." Aibileen notices a copy of the book in each member's hand. Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it. A REVEREND approaches, hands Aibileen a copy of the book.
C: REVEREND
D: Aibileen, this is an important time for you and our church. We know you couldn't put your name in here, so we all signed our own. The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper, tied with a blue ribbon.
C: REVEREND
D: This is for the white lady. Tell her we love her like family.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Skeeter sits between Aibileen and Minny on the sofa thumbing through her signed book. Hundreds of signatures cover the pages.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Churches over two counties signed our books. All for you and me. Aibileen points to the inside back cover.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Doctor King signed it, too. He readin' our book. Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr. King.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: We did something. We did something good.
C: SKEETER
D: It's beautiful. Skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully.
C: AIBILEEN
D: What's wrong? Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse.
C: SKEETER
D: I got a job offer from Harper and Row...in New York.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Congratulations!

D: That real good, Miss Skeeter.
C: SKEETER
D: I not taking it. I just wanted to share it with you both. There's no one else I can tell.
C: AIBILEEN
D: What you mean you not takin' it? This is what you been dreaming of.
C: SKEETER
D: I can't leave you two right when things are getting bad from a mess I created. I set out to write a book to make white people thankful. But in the end, what we should say is "sorry."
C: AIBILEEN
D: If bad things happen, they ain't nothing you can do about it. And if they happen, at least now theys a reason behind it. A reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of... Skeeter nods with little relief.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Now, I don't mean to rub salt in your wound, but...you ain't got a good life here in Jackson. Plus, your momma's getting better- Minny aggressively chimes in.
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League. You done burned ever bridge there is. And you ain't never gone get another man in this town, and ever body know it.

C: MINNY
D: And you listen to me. I'm on take care a Aibileen, and she gone take care a me. Skeeter nods.
E: CONT'D
C: AIBILEEN
D: Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.
S: EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - NIGHT
N: Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time. Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car moving toward her with the headlights off. Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be seen in an upstairs window. Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's. Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car. Skeeter charges toward her.
C: SKEETER
D: What are you doing here? Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.
C: HILLY
D: Don't you get an inch closer! Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain to contain a newly developed layer of fat. A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.
C: HILLY
D: I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie Goodman. He's the best libel attorney in Mississippi. You're in big trouble, Missy. And you're going to jail.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: You can't prove anything, Hilly.
C: HILLY
D: I one-hundred-percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you. Those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble.
C: SKEETER
D: Exactly who are you talking about? You don't know anything.
C: HILLY
D: I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh- huh. Remember her? Had you in her wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the L- shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's dining table. And that nigra, Minny? Do I have plans for her.
C: SKEETER
D: Careful, Hilly. Don't give yourself away now.
C: HILLY
D: That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE! Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.
C: SKEETER
D: I did not invite you here! Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.
C: HILLY
D: I've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become. She's gonna be disgusted by you. Skeeter can't help but laugh.
C: SKEETER
D: You're telling my mother on me? Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.
C: SKEETER
D: You get out of here! Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Why, Hilly...It's been such a long time, Dear. Everything okay, you two? Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.
C: HILLY
D: Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill? Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.
C: HILLY
D: Well, I...I didn't have time to get fixed up before-
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this. Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: And that...that is horrendous.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Missus Phelan, I'm here-
C: CHARLOTTE
D: You know, Hilly. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too many...SWEETS? Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte moves in for the kill.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get one of those on our lip. Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother, not knowing what to say. Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into the living room. Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.
E: CONT'D
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Eugenia?
E: O.C. CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: Yes, Ma'am.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Come in here, please. Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.
E: O.C.
S: INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Charlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits.
C: SKEETER
D: Ma'am?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible study? Anything like that?
C: SKEETER
D: No, Ma'am.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Good. We're going shopping. Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.
C: CHARLOTTE
D: `Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.
E: CONT'D
C: SKEETER
D: What?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: I'm very proud of you, Eugenia.
C: SKEETER
D: How do you know about New York?
C: CHARLOTTE
D: A friend of Constantine's told me. Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help".
C: CHARLOTTE
D: Would you do me the honor of signing my copy? Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good it would feel.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Aibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring. She answers. Minny screams on the other end of the line.
S: EXT. GAS STATION (INTERCUT) - SAME TIME

Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes.
C: AIBILEEN
D: You hear me?
E: CONT'D
C: MINNY
D: I hear you... The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Aibileen?
E: O.C.
S: INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her. Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Good morning. Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table, drawing Aibileen's attention to it.
C: HILLY
D: Aibileen, the silver I lent Elizabeth last week.
C: AIBILEEN
D: It not polished good? Humidity been fighting me on polishing day.
C: HILLY
D: When you returned it, three pieces were missing out of the felt wrapper. A fork and two spoons.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Lemme...lemme go look in the kitchen, maybe I left some behind.
C: HILLY
D: You know as well as I do that silver's not in the kitchen. Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.
C: AIBILEEN
D: You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She been putting things-
C: HILLY
D: Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's trying to blame it on a toddler. Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I ain't stole no silver. Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.
C: ELIZABETH
D: She says she doesn't have them.
C: HILLY
D: Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen. And I'll be calling the police. They know me. Mae Mobley enters the room.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Aibee, my froat hurts. Mae Mobley coughs.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I go get her some syrup, Miss Leefolt.
C: HILLY
D: Elizabeth can take care of her child. Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this suggestion.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'll go get the couch syrup. Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall.
C: HILLY
D: I won't tolerate liars! Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I didn't steal no silver.
C: HILLY
D: I'm not talking about silver. I'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but I can send you to jail for being a thief. And your friend, Minny? That nigra's got a nice surprise coming to her. Johnny Foote listens to what I say. She's as good as- Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Woman!...I know something about you. Don't you forget that. Hilly narrows her eyes.
C: AIBILEEN
D: From what Yule May says, they's a lot a time to write letters from jail. Plenty a time to write ever person in Jackson the truth about you, and the paper is free.
E: CONT'D
C: HILLY
D: Nobody would believe something you wrote.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I don't know. Already sold a lot a books. Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.
C: HILLY
D: Get out of here!
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Don't go, Aibiee! Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Baby, you need to get back to bed. You got a fever.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please don't leave.
C: AIBILEEN
D: I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Why? Are you going to take care of another little girl?
C: AIBILEEN
D: No, Baby, that's not the reason. I don't want to leave you, but...It's time for me to retire. You my last little girl.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Noooo!
C: AIBILEEN
D: Baby Girl, I need you to remember ever thing I told you. Okay? Do you remember what I told you?
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: To wipe my bottom good?
C: AIBILEEN
D: No, Baby. The other. What you are.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: You is kind. You is smart. You is important.
C: AIBILEEN
D: That's right, Baby Girl. Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both cry together. Hilly speaks up.
C: HILLY
D: You need to go now, Aibileen! Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Give my sweet girl a chance. Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away. As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.
S: EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
N: Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse. She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her face. Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats on the glass from inside.
C: MAE MOBLEY
D: Aibeeeee! Don't go! Aibileen never turns.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Mae Mobley was my last baby. In just thirty minutes, I felt like my whole life was done. Of the thirteen maids, seven of us got fired. Several other maids got fired who had nothin' to do with our book. Guess our stories weren't so unique after all...But, like Minny, we was all free.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
N: Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail.
C: AIBILEEN
D: And we's was a lot freer than Hilly Holbrook. She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms. She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out to: TWO-SLICE HILLY! Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - YARD - DAY
N: Minny folds laundry on a picnic table.

N: Close on tombstone:
C: CONSTANTINE JEFFERSON
D: Born December 24th 1883 Died March 15th, 1963 A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A copy of "The Help" leans against it. In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside.
S: INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
N: Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old typewriter. We watch as keys write out the rest of Aibileen's voice over.
C: AIBILEEN
D: Thousands of our books went out all over the world. We had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldn't believe it... Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and places it behind two hundred other typed out pages. She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from the table with pride.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HARPER AND ROW - SKEETER'S OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY
N: Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office. The Manhattan skyline rises behind her. She wears Pucci. Her hair is perfectly styled. She looks gorgeous. She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone. The book's cover reads: "All My Babies" By Aibileen Clark Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe rests inside. AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck. As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much bigger, well furnished and beautiful. She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side. At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom. She enters the bathroom and closes the door.
