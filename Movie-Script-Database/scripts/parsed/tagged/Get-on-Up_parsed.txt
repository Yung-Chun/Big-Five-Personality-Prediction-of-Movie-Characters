S: EXT. ROAD. AUGUSTA. 1988.
N: A hot muggy Georgia morning. A pickup truck comes around a corner and moves towards us. Inside, music plays on the radio. We can't quite see who's driving.
S: INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/AUGUSTA STREETS. MOMENTS LATER
N: The driver heads down the road. He beats his hand on the steering wheel to the rhythm of the music. The driver turns up the music. As the rhythm speeds, so does the truck.
S: INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME
N: A WOMAN, 40, sits on toilet within a stall using the bathroom. She's smoking a cigarette.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT. MOMENTS LATER.
N: Cars parked in rows. The pickup pulls into the lot and screech-stops.
S: INT. ADJACENT OFFICE. INSURANCE SEMINAR. DAY.
N: About 30 people are attending a seminar. Behind a SEMINAR PRESENTER, The truck can be seen outside a window, stereo thumping.
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition.
N: Annoyed, the presenter turns momentarily to the truck.
S: INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK / PARKING LOT
N: A fifty-five year, out of shape black man in mirror shades and a shell-suit. He's breathing heavily. Patting the dashboard, as the song ends. The man sits there a moment and exits. JAMES BROWN hitches up his pants, and walks across the lot.
S: INT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE
N: There's no one around. He's jumpy. His movements odd. Twitchy.
C: JAMES
D: Where's everybody?
E: To himself
N: Around a corner he comes face to face with a cleaner, MAVIS, who is wearing headphones as she vacuums. Mavis screams and removes her headphones.
C: MAVIS
D: Mr. Brown. You scared me!
C: JAMES
D: Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'.
C: MAVIS
D: It's Sunday, Mr. Brown.
C: JAMES
D: No, it's Tuesday, Mavis.
N: James is caught flat-footed. SOMEWHERE OFF a toilet flushes. He rounds the corner. No-one. Opens the bathroom door. Looks inside. Sniffs. Slams it and storms off down the corridor passing a sign outside his office that reads: GET ON UP.
S: INT./EXT. ADJACENT OFFICE/ PARKING LOT. DAY.
N: As the INSURANCE SEMINAR presenter continues, the woman who was on the toilet takes her seat.
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different.
E: MORE
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: You can't possibly sell the same monthly premium to just anyone who strolls through your door. If you learn one lesson this weekend, let it be this: We must accommodate the specific condition of the client. Bottom line! Their needs are-
E: CONT'D
N: The adjoining door flies opens as James enters, pissed.
C: JAMES
D: OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there?
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: Excuse me?
C: JAMES
D: I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it?
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar.
C: JAMES
D: I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was?
C: INSURANCE SALESMAN
D: It is. It's fuckin' him.
N: BACK AT THE FRONT someone sniggers. James spins round. SILENCE. Someone sniggers behind him. James spins back round and approaches the salesman.
C: JAMES
D: Something funny?
C: INSURANCE SALESMAN
D: No, sir.
C: JAMES
D: Then why you cats laughing?
C: INSURANCE SALESMAN
D: I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me.
N: James stares at the man. Turns on his heel. He storms out of the building and across the lot to his pickup truck THE PAYBACK starts: insanely tight, deep funk.
C: INSURANCE SALESMAN
D: I'm telling you that was James Brown.
E: CONT'D
N: Outside a window behind the seminar presenter, James can be seen rifling through the back of his pickup truck. The woman who used his bathroom watches James' every move.
C: SEMINAR PRESENTER
D: Look, I suggest we just continue... OK. So. How does the program work? Initially, participating dentists undergo an extensive credentialing process which, if approved, allows customers to pay the minimum deductible allowed and the remainder is insured. But with non- participating dentists the cost per visit is much higher and comes completely out of pocket. So some people may want a high deductible because they have more to cover, but most common folks simply want the lowest possible plan... and remember our key takeaway!?
N: Entire seminar in UNISON. We must accommodate the specific condition of- The office door flies open. James comes back in with a SHOTGUN.
C: JAMES
D: OK listen up people.
N: The room goes still and completely silent.
C: JAMES
D: Being it's Sunday and all I'm gone ask each of you to imagine you're sittin' in church right now. While today's sermon may be good they's something else on your mind. You realize you gotta take a shit.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: JAMES
D: Real bad. And you don't want to shit at the church house, naw sir. So you just sit there and think about getting home to your own toilet in your own master bath on Beech Island, South Carolina. I gotta a bidet in my master bath. Love my bidet. And a big pretty oval tub too.
E: CONT'D
N: James spins around to man.
C: JAMES
D: You got a bidet, Sir?
E: CONT'D
N: He shakes his head. James looks to a woman.
C: JAMES
D: You?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head.
C: JAMES
D: Well you gotta get you one. You all gotta get you a bidet. Are y'all sure its really Sunday today?
E: CONT'D
N: A woman nods.
C: JAMES
D: What was just saying... Oh, that's right. Yes! You gotta take shit. So, after church, you speed back home and you run like hell to the house scared you ain't gonna make it. But you do. Now imagine unhitching your pants as your open your bathroom door. And then you see me. James Brown. Sittin' on your master toilet taking a break. What would you do?
E: CONT'D
N: More sniggers from all over the room. James raises his gun and KABLOOM!!! James accidentally blasts an enormous hole in the ceiling. SCREAMS AS EVERYONE HITS THE DECK. James looks up the the hole in the ceiling.
C: JAMES
D: Good God. Tear up the devil. I'm gone have to get that fixed.
E: CONT'D sotto
N: James looks to the gun unsure of how it went off.
C: JAMES
D: Now I'm a busy man, and I'm guessin' you cats are too. But someone has abused a personal convenience. Now I ask you nicely. I'm gone ask you again. Which one of you gentlefolk hung a number two in my commode?

E: CONT'D
C: INSURANCE SALESMAN
D: Don't shoot.
C: JAMES
D: I ain't gone shoot nobody, son.
N: Then, as if told by God, James spins around and locks eyes with the woman who used his bathroom. He approaches her.
C: JAMES
D: Ma'am, it was you wasn't it? You took a break in my bathroom, didn't you?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head and begins to cry.
C: FEMALE SALESWOMAN
D: Yes sir, Mister Brown.
C: JAMES
D: Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay.
N: James lowers the gun to the floor. As he tries to console the woman.
C: JAMES
D: You had to use the toilet. You saw an opportunity and you took it. Yeah, I got mad but, Lady, you did right by yourself. I've spent my whole life doing right by myself. I'm James Brown and I made a difference.
E: CONT'D
N: JAMES LOOKS TO CAMERA AND TALKS DIRECTLY TO US:
C: JAMES
D: You cats may not own my records but you can bet every record you have got a piece of me in `em. Ain't nobody singing today that ain't been touched by James Brown.
E: CONT'D
N: James turns back to the woman.
C: JAMES
D: So, Lady, you did right by yourself. And there ain't no other way to live. You understand me?
E: CONT'D
N: The woman nods. James turns back to us.
C: JAMES
D: You understand me?
E: CONT'D
N: Police sirens are heard in the distance. James turns to his truck outside the window.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
N: SUDDENLY - a pickup truck passes at a hundred MPH. FOLLOWED A MOMENT LATER by two city cop cars.
S: INT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY.
N: James rocks in his seat. Odd guttural sounds. In the rearview. The two cop cars close upon him. Hits the gas, hard.
S: HELICOPTER SHOT: EXT. ON RAMP - I-20. DAY
N: The pickup truck skids onto the interstate where two city cars are now joined by two Highway Patrol cars.
C: 11A 11A
D: EXT. STREET LEVEL
N: A police car pulls up next to him, the officer aiming a weapon and flagging the car down. James sees him and flinches.
C: JAMES
D: Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me.
N: He rams the cop car. It retreats.
S: EXT. I-20. DAY
N: Three prowlers and a highway patrol RV form a road block. A high engine note pierces the air. The police take up firing positions.
S: INT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY
N: James sees the roadblock ahead.
C: JAMES
D: Don't stop me. Don't stop me.
N: He smashes through road block. The windscreen is blown out with gunfire showering James with glass. He glances in the mirror as wind whips around the truck: Up ahead another police car sits in the middle of the road. A policeman steps out from the car firing his pistol at the pickup truck. James makes a hard right down a dirt road.
S: INT/EXT. PICKUP TRUCK. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY
N: James's front tires are blown out. James struggles to control the skidding vehicle.
C: JAMES
D: C'mon. C'mon.
S: EXT. GRAVEL PITTS, DAY
N: The pickup truck rolls to a stop. Five various police cars from different jurisdictions enter the Pitts from five different entrances and take up positions blocking exit routes.
S: INT. PICKUP TRUCK. DAY.
N: James sits staring straight ahead. Breathing hard. A loud hailer off screen: "EXIT THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD." James opens the door scattering glass onto the ground. Around the perimeter armed police tense. Safety's off. Keeping James in their sights. A young officer sweats nervously. James stands next to the bullet riddled wreckage of his pickup, hands above his head. He leans back and sings to the sky.
C: JAMES
D: "I Don't Feel Noways Tired".
S: EXT. AUGUSTA COUNTRY CLUB. NIGHT. 1942 JAMES 9 YRS
N: A wide, opulent looking club has taken residence in a huge antebellum home with wrap around porches. A crowd of Deep Southern white folk, in cocktail attire, fill both levels of the porches and spill out onto the lawn surrounding a BOXING RING. A GROUP OF SIX BLACK MUSICIANS FORM A DIXIELAND BAND. Without inspiration they play methodically to the all white crowd. A FAT, SWEATING ANNOUNCER, walks into the ring, grasps a dangling mic.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Aaannd now folks, before the main event, the Augusta Country club is proud to present to y'all it's Annual Charity ex-travagaaanza..! Ladies and gentlemen..The Battle... Royale!
E: Drum-roll
N: Music. HALF A DOZEN BLACK BOYS enter the ring. Hyped. A glove is pulled onto one hand. The other tied behind their backs. They are blind-folded. A WHITE MAN with a BUCKET OF WHITE PAINT daubs a number onto each boy's chest. DING! DING! The boys stagger out, blindly swinging. The crowd roars, bangs the tables as they stumble, lurch, in the baying din. The smallest of the boys stands stiff. He struggles to throw much less land a punch. The number "One" is painted on his chest. A much bigger boy, "Number Six" punches "One" in the gut. "One" goes down but then slowly rises. The dixieland band watches the exploitation with both horror and intrigue as they can't help but wonder who will be left standing. The band's sound begins to change. It becomes as energized as the match before them. They sink into the rhythm, and the effect is one of heightened energy. The drummer begins to pull the beat and the bass player instantly follows suit finding the new pocket. The drummer and bass player share a glance. This inspired pocket soars across the lawn and into the ears of boy "Number One". We are now transported into the mind of "Number One". Complete silence except for the sound of the band. Then one by one all other instruments fade away leaving only the drum and bass. James turns to the band and lowers his blindfold from over one eye. He catches eyes with the drummer and bass player. The drummer nods at James and smiles. James nods back and closes his eye. The sound morphs again as "Number One" begins to arrange the music in his head to his own liking. James opens his one eye and sees only the drummer and bass player on the stage. They are now playing what we and James are hearing in his head. James covers his eye again with the blindfold and forms a slight smile. His stance becomes more relaxed. His body begins to swing and morph like rubber. He throws a punch. IT LANDS. ALL AT ONCE "Number One" dances forward, dips, swings and sweetly CONNECTS to "Number Four". As the vanquished head hits the canvas, the victor, "Number One", bloodied, panting in the waves of laughter and summer heat, stands alone. As the boys hit the deck and are deemed "out" they are pulled off the mat and carried to the bed of a parked truck. "Three" goes down. Then "Two" and "Five". A ringside punter THUMPS the canvas with a fistful of dollars, berating him. People screaming with laughter. Only "One" and "Six" remain. Panicky, jerky, they stalk one another. Listening. "Number One" connects with lighting speed. "Six" removes his blindfold, jumps off the ring and runs across the lawn disappearing into the nearby woods. "Number One" stands victorious. The crowd goes wild. "Number One" absorbs the admiration as he slowly pushes up the blindfold and looks toward the bandstand. All the band members have returned to the stand as in reality they always were. They clap wildly as the beat and rhythm of this budding continues in his head. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD JAMES BROWN LOOKS RIGHT AT US. A level gaze. That million dollar smile, teeth coated with blood. THE BEAT CONTINUES OVER... CLOSE UP ON: The June 1968 cover of Look Magazine: A silhouette portrait of James: "IS THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT BLACK MAN IN AMERICA?"

N: James flashes five fingers at Maceo four times.
C: JAMES
D: Watch that mouth, Maceo. That's twenty dollars right there.
N: The plane suddenly lurches forty five degree and lets out an awful groan. Everyone screams. Except James who is still standing like rubber even though he wasn't holding onto anything. Bobby sees this.
C: JAMES
D: Mr. Byrd, I've decided to open tonight's show with "I Got The Feeling".
E: CONT'D
N: James demeanor somehow gives comfort to Bobby. James nods at Bobby and smiles.
C: JAMES
D: How's that sound?
E: CONT'D
C: BOBBY
D: Sounds good, Mr. Brown.
N: Bobby smiles at James. The plane lurches again, Bobby screams.

The child stares up at the lynched man who is dressed in nice clothes. Then to his feet within beautiful leather shoes. Silence. He looks at him carefully. James reaches his small hand up to touch the suspended foot of the man. Pulls on his laces. His shoe comes off. James drops the shoe and removes the other.

N: JAMES struts to the side of the stage. On a television backstage we see a live feed of: ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: THE SUPREMES FINISHING THEIR PERFORMANCE. James waits in the wings. On the other side of the stage, the Rolling Stones watch. James flashes his trademark smile. They all wave back. Archival Footage: JAN AND DEAN approach the microphone and introduce the flames. ZAP -a white follow spot burns into James as he stands head bowed. Check jacket, waistcoat, black pipes and mirror boots. He throws his head back, steps forward and the groove starts. The screams rise to a deafening pitch- He's already on the move, in a snake hipped side slide, mash potatoes, up on one leg, level with the mike, spin and BAM!

N: Int. SHACK. KITCHEN TABLE. DAY. James sits opposite his father at the table. Joe eats and hums and sings a blues tune, No More My Lord. James beats his stick on the leg of the table perhaps to join in and impress his dad. Joe acknowledges the beat that James is creating. For a brief moment, father and son are making music together. Joe quits singing but James continues beating the stick on the table.

We push in tight. We pull back to reveal James now singing this song in the future at The Olympia show. He's sporting a "natural". Beautiful girls dancing behind him. Flash- We are back to "Ski Party". Now the boring extras are up on their feet. They dance with precision the way Mr. Brown would prefer. Just for us, James has transformed the "Ski Party" into something way cooler. James' feet slide and move him back toward the door of the ski lodge set.
C: JAMES
D: I feel good and I knew that I would now. So good. So good. Cause I got you.
E: CONT'D
N: James moves outside the door and does a split in the pile of fake snow. We are now back to reality. James is again wearing the sweater. The extras are now seated and clapping in a corny fashion. The stage bell rings. Over a loudspeaker-

N: A picturesque country road flanked by high, earthen embankments lined with trees. James sudden bolts out of the trees with the stolen suit and runs down the embankment. Just then a police car speeds down the road towards him. James drops the suit and runs to the opposite embankment. As James tries to climb the embankment, the police car stops, two officers get out. James can't get a footing on the steep embankment. We now see that James is wearing the lynched man's shoes. CLOSE ON SHOES: Digging deeper and deeper in the soil embankment. BLAM! A gun fires.

C: BIG KID
D: You eyeballin' me, Music-Box?
N: The big kid punches James in the gut. James struggles to his feet and punches the BIG KID and fights back fearlessly. All hell breaks loose. Two rough factions break out and the melee spreads. James picks up a chair and throws it at the big kid. He ducks.
T: CUT TO:

Bobby and James stay on each other through glass. James' talent hits Bobby like a ten pound hammer between the eyes. A warden forces James to his chair.

His voice soars sweetly over the congregation. Bobby's gaze softens. MRS. BYRD and GRANDPA watch on. Mrs. Byrd leans forward and catches Bobby's eye. Gives a small nod of approval. Bobby's smile is...more equivocal.

N: Ralph Bass speaks to James from the booth.
C: RALPH
D: James, this is a ballad. The pace we've set is perfect.
C: JAMES
D: I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep.

C: BOBBY
D: Let's just get it done OK?
C: JAMES
D: But it ain't right.

D: Please! Please! Please.
N: James lowers to the floor and belts his heart out as the song concludes. James walks off stage and just outside Big Bills. A bath towel is put over James' back and head to absorb his sweat. James is breathing hard, completely exhausted. The crowd is not wanting the show to end. The band is vamps amid cheers.
C: CROWD
D: James Brown, James Brown, James Brown.
N: James slowly rises his head from under his towel and looks right at us. He begins to smile. He then looks over to Bobby and nods. The band resumes Please, Please, Please. Suddenly James throws the towel off of himself and runs to the stage. The cape act is born.

E: Reads
N: The sleeve has clearly printed on it "James Brown and his Famous Flames."
C: BABY ROY
D: Sir, this ain't right.
C: BEN BART
D: We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home.
C: NAFLOYD
D: James?
E: Stunned

D: James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got.
N: James turns to Ben Bart.
C: BEN BART
D: James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts "Blow it fucker!" in the middle of The Magic Flute.

D: C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.
E: CONT'D
N: SUDDENLY and for the first time, we hear the classic James grunt, guttural. A THUMPING RHYTHM BEGINS. James, stock still, no longer looking out of the window. Head completely still. Out of the window: a line of people. On and on. We round the corner. More people. Another corner. More. The doors of the theatre open as we pass. People rush forward as THE CAR PULLS UP. James gets out outside by the stage entrance. Ben follows.

S: INT. APOLLO THEATER. STAGE. NIGHT. 1962
N: ONE BY ONE TWELVE PAIRS OF PATENT LEATHER SHOES HIT THE STAGE. THE NEW JAMES BROWN REVUE file in with instrument cases like some ultra hip sect. In the dimly lit back stage we see the motions of opening their cases and begin setting up their stations, A beautiful black girl pulls up her mini to reveal even more leg. James enters looking amazing in a cobalt sharkskin. He approaches the all new band. A member of the band, whose back is to us, peers out of the scarlet curtains towards the packed house.
C: JAMES
D: You ready Mr. Byrd?
N: Bobby Byrd turns from the curtains. THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE STARLIGHTERS. His profile lighted by a powerful spot.

N: CLOSE UP: Big two inch tape magnacorders turn on brushed aluminium spindles. Recording live. Ben Bart looks over at James at the curtain edge. A man possessed.
C: BEN BART
D: I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane.
N: James looks at Bobby. Bobby nods. James nods back. The band vamp.
C: JAMES
D: Watch me.
N: The curtain opens. BANG! James Brown & the New Revue are in perfect timing looking impeccable in their new sapphire blue suits. The crowd goes wild with excitement. Mr. Dynamite steps on stage-- and floats and dances across bare planks like they were polished ice. He reaches the mike.
C: JAMES
D: You know I feel alright. You know I feel alright children. I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight.
E: CONT'D Yeah! Yeah!
N: Les Buie whacks the guitar strings and the world ceases to spin. A rising 6/8 blues riff pulses up like adrenaline. As he sings the song, a shock wave blasts out from the stage of the theatre on 125th street and into the Universe. Bobby might as well be sitting on the moon. He never misses a beat.
T: CUT TO:
N: James Brown and the New Revue are tearing up their second number, "Think." SYD NATHAN now sits in the audience surrounded by a SEA OF BLACK FACES. We gather that Syd has never really experienced "The Show". He smiles and nods to the beat. Just then a female seated behind him shouts as the horns kick in.
C: FEMALE IN AUDIENCE
D: Blow it fuckers!!!
N: James stares into the darkness. He's already begun to sweat. The drums stop a six punch combination from the horns dead. He reaches for the mic without looking. Leans in and locks eyes with Syd.
C: JAMES
D: Think...Think...Think...About your bad self...
N: James drops to his knees. The crowd goes wild. A few rows behind Syd, we find Susie Brown sitting in the audience. James' mother has come to the show.

C: BART
D: Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because...
N: As Bart drones on, James loses interest and starts addressing us directly.

N: Bobby Byrd nods his head.
C: BOBBY BYRD
D: I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front.
N: He looks at Maceo with a calm, measured sense of reality.
C: BOBBY BYRD
D: You work so hard at this one thing and then one day you realize it ain't supposed to be you. You can get mad. Try to fight it but if it's God's truth. It's God's truth. James is supposed to be in front. I saw it happen. And the man in front has to BE the man in front. It ain't always pretty but that's the man's responsibility if he wanna stay there. And you and me can't know what that is. We ain't supposed to. So, don't lie to yourself Maceo. Every man in this band walks taller because he with James Brown. Every man in this band believe in himself a little more because he's with James Brown.
E: CONT'D
C: MACEO
D: You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front?

SUDDENLY there's a commotion in the mixing booth. James brings them to a stop.

Pushes the stand away. Zip! It's back. A kid at the front gets onto the stage and sprints for James only to be tackled by James' security. Another clambers up but is kicked back by a police officer. The audience react badly. Another kid gets on stage and cops harshly push him to the floor and throw him back into the audience. Police come out onto the right side of the stage and shine torches down into the audience. They shove people back down. A kid in a white jacket leaps on stage right in front of James. For a moment everyone stops. A white cop appears from nowhere and viciously bodychecks the kid back into the front row in full view of the cameras. The mayor stands in the wings flanked by policemen. Dede stands behind them watching nervously.

N: On stage James stops the band.
C: JAMES
D: Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine.

C: JAMES
D: Do you wanna dance son? You dance.

N: No longer held back by police more kids invade the stage. James respects them all, shaking hands and looking at them eye to eye. Kids throng around him on stage. He's losing control.

D: C'mon. C'mon now. Y'all go down. Go back down. Don't nobody else come up. Wait a minute. Wait. Ladies and gentleman. This is no way. This is. We are black. We are black. Wait a minute go back. Can't y'all go back down and lets do the show together. We're black don't make us all look bad. Let me finish the show. Step down there. Be a gentleman. Lets represent our own selves. Lets represent our own selves.
E: CONT'D Cheers.
N: One by one they step back down into the crowd.
C: JAMES
D: Now I ask the police to step back because I figure I could get some respect from my own people. Now we together ain't we. Hit that thing man.
E: CONT'D Cheers! Screams!

C: JAMES
D: Happy now?

C: JAMES
D: My record Live at the Apollo is the first R&B album in the history of the world to go top ten. Stayed up in there for 66 weeks..
N: James walks into the rear of the packed house. GIRLS AND GUYS SCREAMING, DANCING. JAMES IS INVISIBLE TO THEM. From the rear of the house, James watches himself and the band performing on stage. He and his band are IN MID-GROOVE. A BEAUTIFUL BLACK DANCER DANCES ON A RISER BEHIND THE BAND. Vicki Anderson, sings backup.

C: JAMES
D: And slowly, the whole World knew who we were.
N: James walks to each band member and places a twenty dollar bill in each of their pockets. They don't see the James who is talking directly to us. He straightens a band members tie. James turns to stage left and sees his son, Teddy Brown, dancing. He then gives Yvonne a wink who's also standing in the wings looking HOT.
C: JAMES
D: See in showbusiness, you got two parts. You got the show and you got the business. And brother. You better believe. You looking at both.
E: CONT'D Deadly serious
N: He spins around and runs up to the microphone. He replaces himself and begins to sing. SCREAMS. HORNS VAMPING. James performs out of his skin. A medley of three songs, "Soul Power," into "Sex Machine," into "Super Bad". Backup dancers and singers are tearing it up! On James' signal the rag tag band of kids behind the godfather of soul take off like a rocket ship into one of the above songs. It sounds nothing like the old version. Its raw urgent, stripped down. The Bootsy's bass rumbles like trouble brewing and Catfish's over driven guitar slicing clean through the hook. Before them a standing room crown dance and sing from the stage to all the way back to entrance James and Bobby look at each other. Holy shit. James drops into the splits, flips up again. The crowd is seeing something for the first time on European soil. They erupt with joy and begin dancing in their seats.

N: James TUNES IN

D: I'm ashamed of you, Bobby. And you should be ashamed of you. Now you tryin' to run around with Vicki. Don't jive yourself bro'. Now, Vicki, she could fill this place.
C: BOBBY

C: BOBBY
D: I can't do this no more, James.
C: JAMES BROWN
D: Damn right you can't do this no more.
C: BOBBY
D: I said I can't do this no more.
N: James looks absolutely poleaxed. THEN. He laughs. And looks at Bobby, almost affectionately.
C: JAMES BROWN
D: See, the funny part. You say that like it's a big thing. Like "oh my God, Bobby Byrd gone leave James Brown on his own."
N: Bobby fights to control himself. To find anything left to give.
C: BOBBY
D: I ain't leaving you on your own, Mr. Brown. You already on your own. Always were.
N: He shakes his head and walks across the stage. He turns.

N: FLASHBACK - Corridor in 1962. The Night of Live At The Apollo. MUSIC: Wonder When You're Coming Home plays over: A woman in a flower print dress and a cheap hat sits on a bench with a coat over her arm. A young Bobby comes out of the dressing room. She stands.
S: INT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT.
N: BOOM! A flashbulb goes off. James sits next to his mother, on a couch, SMILING Happily, having the moment documented. She is smiling too. Bobby and other guests in the room watch the photographers. The photographer is ushered out of the room by Bobby Byrd.
C: JAMES
D: Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside.
N: Bobby ushers the guests outside. James sits opposite his mother. She is very, very uncomfortable but trying to appear relaxed.
C: SUSIE
D: I was on the Subway last week, and the two kids next to me was arguing who was the best, James Brown or Little Willy John. And this one boy, he was saying "James Brown the best" "There ain't no one better than James Brown", he got so mad I thought he was gonna whup this other boy. And then-

D: Why tonight? Why you come here?
E: She stops, her face falls.
N: She starts to flap.
C: SUSIE
D: Well. Sugar, I live over in Brooklyn... and you my baby and you here playin' the Apollo.
C: JAMES

C: SUSIE
D: Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that.

D: See I thought about this. I know it weren't personal and that's why this ain't neither. It turned out fine. I didn't need you. I looked after James Brown. Made sure he was OK. No-one else. No-one help me.
N: She starts to cry.
C: SUSIE
D: I never wanted to be a momma. But I carried you, boy. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife or being a momma. But I carried you and I loved you when you were in me. I chose you. I chose you.
C: JAMES
D: Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

N: Susie looks back a James. She doesn't move.
C: JAMES
D: Why are you really here? What do you want?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head, searching his face. James looks back unmoved. James reaches in is pocket and pulls out some money. He hands it to her.
C: JAMES
D: Here. That's a hundred dollars. I'm sorry but I'm gonna ask you to leave now.
E: CONT'D
N: He sits perfectly still as she gets up. She walks to the door and turns to James.

D: You're so beautiful. You're so pretty.
N: Susie exits into the party outside and shuts the door.
S: EXT. CABIN - BARNWELL S.C. 1941. JAMES 8 YRS
N: We return to the day that Susie left. We stay on her face as she leaves her family behind. Tears stream down her cheek. James tries to chase after his mother but Joe restrains him. Joe pulls a pistol from his belt. He fires. Bark explodes from a tree a few feet from where Susie is walking. Susie flinches but never turns.
S: INT. CORRIDOR.
N: Bobby waits. The door opens, and Susie comes out, tears in her eyes. She looks wildly into Bobby's face who has clearly heard everything. She runs off down the corridor. Bobby looks through the open door. Devastated, James sits staring at the floor. He looks up at Bobby.
C: JAMES
D: Tell Pop to make sure she's taken care of. Whatever she needs.
N: As Bobby nods, James gets up, walks over to the door, and slowly closes it.
S: INT. JAMES BROWN'S HOME. 1988. 18 YEARS LATER.
N: JAMES 55 YRS CLOSE ON - Numerous framed pictures of Teddy span all ages of his life now fill the top of James' dresser. We widen to find James Brown sitting very alone in his bedroom staring at the pictures of his son. He wears a bathrobe. His hair is up in rollers. He's twitchy and sweating. He raises a glass pipe to his mouth, lites the PCP within and inhales it.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. LATER THAT DAY. 1988
N: A peaceful road. SUDDENLY - a pickup truck passes at a hundred MPH. FOLLOWED.. A MOMENT LATER - by nine cop cars. A cop car pulls up next to James' truck. James looks to the car. SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE: In the front a cop drives but James' father, Joe, rides in the back next to his mother, Susie. They stare blankly at James. Glass shatters in the truck. SLOW MOTION ENDS. James turns back to the cop car next to him. The vision of his parents is gone. Two cops ride together. The cop in the front seat aims his revolver directly at James. It's clear he intends to kill him. James speeds up as the cop fires. The bullet strikes the truck just behind him.
S: EXT. GRAVEL PITTS. 1988. DAY.
N: The pickup truck rolls to a stop. Police cars from different jurisdictions take up positions blocking exit routes.
S: INT./ EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/ GRAVEL PITTS. DAY.

D: I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm OK.
C: LOUD HAILER
D: EXIT THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD. DO NOT RUN. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO START THE VEHICLE.
N: James opens the door scattering glass onto the tarmac. Around the perimeter armed police tense. Keeping James in their sights. ONLY NOW, YOUNG JAMES STANDS IN PLACE OF HIS ADULT SELF. He stands next to the bullet riddled wreckage of his pickup, hands above his head. He leans back and sings to the sky.
C: YOUNG JAMES
D: "I Don't Feel Noways Tired"
S: INT. PRISON WING. DAY. 1988
N: A warden walks a dishevelled James along the corridor. They stop. The cell door buzzes open. They put him in the cell.
S: INT. CELL. DAY.
N: The doors slide close. CLANK. James leans on the tiny sink. He looks up into the mirror and faces what's he's become. His face is bloated, his eyes wild, hair unkempt. We feel James wanting to turn to us but shame won't allow it.
S: FLASHBACK - INT. ST. STEPHENS CHURCH. DAY. 1952
N: BOBBY, NAFLOYD, BABY ROY SARAH AND JAMES sing righteous gospel that first time together in St. Stephens Church. James is Really giving it up singing Send it on Down. His voice soars sweetly over the congregation. MRS. BYRD and GRANDPA watch on. Mrs. Byrd leans forward and catches Bobby's eye. Gives a small nod of approval for James. Bobby looks to James. They catch eyes. In awe of James' talent, Bobby unconsciously, stops singing. He just stands their watching and listening to his friend. END FLASHBACK - BACK AT THE MIRROR James pulls back from the mirror and splashes some water on his face and begins to press his hair down with his hands. He breathes harder and harder as he assesses his life. He stands straight and proud. Still looking in the mirror, he begins to chant quietly to himself.

D: James Brown, James Brown. James Brown, James brown.

N: Bobby pulls out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket as he walks behind the truck. He pulls out a smoke and lights up. Bobby soon notices a Limo parked on the other side of the street. He stares at it for a while. The door opens. James Browns gets out of the Limo and waves. Bobby watches as James approaches. He's clean and sober in a suit looking sharp. James' appearance and presence throws Bobby.

D: Right. Teddy's funeral. Damn. You look well. You shoulda called-
C: JAMES
D: You know, Bobby, they still don't know what happened to Teddy and that boy. Those boys weren't drinkin' or doin' drugs.

C: JAMES
D: No sir. Nothin' like that. He was a good boy. The car just hit that bridge head on. We ain't ever gone know how or why. They say he didn't feel a thing.

D: That's good, James.
C: JAMES
D: But we brought him back to Augusta didn't we? Got him home then sent him on to the Lord.
C: BOBBY
D: We did, Mr. Brown. We did.
N: James stands there, fixedly. The Pool cleaner comes from around the truck, breaks the tension.
C: POOL CLEANER
D: OK. Mr. Byrd. I fixed your problem. I'll be back in the Spring to open her up.
C: BOBBY
D: I'm much obliged. Do I have to-
C: POOL CLEANER
D: No no. We'll send the bill on. Well that's that. Good day Gentlemen.

C: JAMES
D: Look at that. We got white folk cleaning our pool. Come a long way huh, Mr. Byrd?
C: BOBBY
D: Yeah. We come a long way.
N: Suddenly this is awkward. For both of them. Bobby defuses it:

D: Here and there.
C: JAMES
D: You hurtin' a little in the hips?
C: BOBBY
D: A little. You?

N: Gertrude and the make-up artist look at each other. They leave him. Alone, he looks around the dressing room. At the walls. The ceiling fan. Finally at his reflection. He holds his own gaze.
