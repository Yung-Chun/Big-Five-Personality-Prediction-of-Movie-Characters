C: LUCY MOON
D: It has to.
C: GAYLE
D: It's bad luck if you don't.

C: LUCY MOON
D: Why don't you lick these clean for me?
E: whip cream

C: MONIX
D: And do what?
C: LYNN
D: I don't know... Kill yourself, I guess.
C: MONIX
D: Kill myself?
C: LYNN
D: You act like there's nothing else in the world besides basketball. If that's how you really feel, then go ahead and get it over with. I'm going to sleep.
C: MONIX
D: Thanks for the pep. talk.
C: LYNN
D: No problem.
C: MONIX
D: Lynn. Can I ask you for one favor?
E: she opens the door again
C: LYNN
D: You want a favor?
C: MONIX
D: My knee.
C: LYNN
D: Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It's 4 a.m. Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs.
C: MONIX
D: No one here can drain it right.
C: LYNN
D: Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door.

D: Your Mom would be proud of you today.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Not-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table. JACKIE is by far the youngest of the owners.
C: COMMISH
D: .I'm sure each of you have heard the rumors. And I'm here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be merging with the NBA at the end of this season.
N: JACKIE MOON
C: YES!!!
E: to an old guy
N: GIVE ME TEN, NORTON! YES!! (fists to the ceiling) EVERYONE CAN EAT SHIT! I AM THE GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD!
C: COMMISH
D: Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: You're a real owner. You're in the
E: to himself
N: NBA.
C: COMMISH
D: Four of our teams will be absorbed into the NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations.

D: Exactly! You know it! I'm sorry, wait, what?
E: now hearing
C: COMMISH
D: The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What's happening?
C: COMMISH
D: I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how. emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you. Jackie pounds the table.

C: THE COMMISH
D: We know you're upset, Jackie. But you'll be very well compensated.
N: LOSING OWNER #1 Everyone's agreed to a very large sum.
C: JACKIE MOON

E: to the losing owners
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What do the Spurs have that we don't?
E: to winning owners
C: THE COMMISH
D: A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT!
C: COMMISH
D: The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: The best four teams should go.
C: COMMISH
D: What?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums, the economic... Growing... package... inventions...
E: a little lost
N: WINNING OWNER #1 (correcting him) Economic growth pack-- JACKIE MOON I KNOW WHAT I SAID! (to the room) The four teams with the best records should merge. LOSING OWNER #2 He's right. LOSING OWNER #1 Yeah, that's the fairest way.
C: COMMISH
D: These four teams DO have the best records. Flint's only won six games all year!
C: JACKIE MOON
D: So far. The season isn't over.
N: LOSING OWNER #2 Yeah, maybe we should finish the season first.
C: COMMISH
D: This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but it's too late. The commissioner, me, has already decided.
N: LOSING OWNER #2 Actually, the terms of a merger can only be approved by a league mandate.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: YES. That's right. What he said.
N: LOSING OWNER #1 I move that we vote on the terms of the merger.

C: JACKIE MOON
D: C'mon you guys, let's try to stay psyched. This is a chance to become a real NBA franchise!
C: CLARENCE
D: There's no way we can make it to fourth place. It's mathematically impossible.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I ran the numbers. All we have to do is win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games.
C: CLARENCE
D: Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a lot?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Oh, c'mon! We just gotta start hitting our threes. Listen, I know this seems like bad news, but it doesn't have to be. This is a big road trip for us. We've just got to start playing solid Flint basketball.
E: guys look around, unsure
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: I don't know. We suck, man.

S: EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jackie and Dukes are next to the bus, discussing the check.
C: DUKES
D: I tried Jackie. They won't take it. They said it's 'symbolic.'
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What does symbolic mean?
C: DUKES
D: I don't know. But they said I need a real check.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't know what your bank is talking about. That is a real check. I signed it myself.
C: DUKES
D: It's written in glitter, dude. Can't you just give me, like, a regular sized one?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't get it. People are usually able to cash these. Maybe you should try another bank. If you run into any more trouble, let me know.
E: trying to wrap it up
C: DUKES
D: Okay Jackie, thanks man.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Any time, congratulations. Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus.

D: Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats. Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling. Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography. Clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are eating their hot dish.
C: MONIX
D: So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot dish' anyway?
C: CLARENCE
D: My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it?
C: MONIX
D: It's a compliment. It's good.
C: CLARENCE
D: If it's good, then it's good. Why do you gotta know what's in it? What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Hey Monix, what were the Celtics like?
C: MONIX
D: They were fast.
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: Fast? No one's faster than me. I should be on the Celtics.

C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: Hey, let us see that ring again.
C: MONIX
D: Not right now, okay Twiggy?
C: CLARENCE
D: Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday?
C: MONIX
D: Embarrassing?
C: CLARENCE
D: You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you ain't.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Oh, you're just jealous.
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: Yeah, Monix played solid minutes, for lots of teams. He's played in the NBA, that's more than you can say.
C: CLARENCE
D: Whatever. At least I never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion. You didn't do shit for that Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I'd yank that ring right off your neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word.
C: CLARENCE
D: He doesn't wear it on his finger because he knows he didn't earn it. He didn't even play.
N: Monix looks out the window.

C: JACKIE MOON
D: Alright. Now, a lot of people out there are writing us off. A lot people are saying things like 'Jackie Moon is an offensive liability.' They're saying 'Flint's turnovers led to sixty fast break points per game.' They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded brother is so retarded that his eyes look too big,. Like a French Bulldog.
E: Making this up
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: No one said that, man.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Yes they did. And we're going to use it as motivation, okay? THIS IS
E: trying to motivate

E: re: his wet uniform
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Gross. Well, I ain't guarding him. Monix notices this discussion.
C: MONIX
D: Quit talking and play defense! The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top.
N: GAME 5) Jackie Moon plays great defense, rejecting a shot! Monix grabs the ball and dribbles on a fast break. Clarence trails, in perfect position...
C: CLARENCE
D: Right on! I'm open baby! Try a behind-the-back! Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits him in the nuts.
C: CLARENCE
D: Ah, shit.
N: BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: PIPERS 105 TROPICS 91.
S: EXT. HOTEL STRIP - NIGHT
N: Angle on a big hotel with fancy lights -- but then we pan to reveal: A shitty motel. The 'Jet' is parked at the cheap place.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Two twin beds in a crap-box motel room. Monix has the phone to his ear, but it just keeps ringing. He'd leave a message for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet. He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his Championship ring necklace off. He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his duffle bag.
C: CLARENCE
D: I brought us some ice. Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters.
E: O.S.
C: MONIX
D: Ice? What for?
C: CLARENCE
D: I don't know, it's free. Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching.
C: CLARENCE
D: Want some?
C: MONIX
D: No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: That Root Beer machine took my fucking change, man. White people are assholes. Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of beauty. Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops at 'Love American Style.'
C: MONIX
D: You turned off the Celtics?
C: CLARENCE
D: I don't watch people play basketball. They watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.
C: MONIX
D: What the Hell is that?
E: re: the marijuana
C: CLARENCE
D: It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face. JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room.
E: as he inhales
C: MONIX
D: Why don't you shower in your room?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: My wife is using it. I'll be crashing with you guys tonight.
N: (NOTICING) Ice? Awesome. (as he eats ice, re: TV) Love American Style? Turn it up. Jackie doesn't say a word about the pot. Instead he keeps his eyes glued to the TV, then reaches for the joint and SMOKES IT.
C: MONIX
D: Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife?
N: JACKIE MOON (LYING) What? Are you kidding? Try, like, every weekend. She's so hot.
C: MONIX
D: Sounds like a great arrangement.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: You guys need to wake up. Quit living like it's the 1950's, man. Live it up. Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro.
E: showing off
C: MONIX
D: I'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: This stuff won't affect you. It's premium. Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.
E: as he inhales
C: MONIX
D: Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Well said. Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he
N: COUGHS LIKE CRAZY.
C: MONIX
D: What the Hell is this?
C: CLARENCE
D: What do you mean?
C: MONIX
D: It's harsh.
C: CLARENCE
D: Take that back.
C: MONIX
D: Take what back?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: His Mom grows it.
C: CLARENCE
D: Yeah, in the yard.
C: MONIX
D: Your Mom grew this?
C: CLARENCE
D: It's sweet grass.
C: MONIX
D: Well, I'm finished, thanks.
C: CLARENCE
D: What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you?
C: MONIX
D: I guess not.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: C'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed.
C: CLARENCE
D: That's it, I ain't sleeping in the same bed as this motherfucker.
S: INT. AMIGO STADIUM - ROAD TRIP GAME 6 - NEXT NIGHT
N: Television cameras are being set up. A camera man cleans the lens. Jackie studies the cameras, mesmerized by the idea of television. He speaks with the Amigo's manager.
C: AMIGO MANAGER
D: You want all the fans to sit on one side of the stadium?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Yeah, just move all those people over to this side.
N: (DEMONSTRATING) See, the TV cameras are going to face this way, right? Well, if we fill the seats on that side, we'll look sold out.
C: AMIGO MANAGER
D: Actually, that's not a bad idea. MEANWHILE, ON THE COURT: Both teams are warming up. Clarence now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words, there is barely space for a number. It's a mess.
C: CLARENCE
D: Check it out. I sewed it on the bus.
E: re: Jersey, new name
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: What's it say?
E: struggling to read it
C: CLARENCE
D: Jumping Johnny Johnson. The asshole, PETRELLI, wanders over near the Tropics side of the court.
C: PETRELLI
D: Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how's the needle point going?
C: CLARENCE
D: Kiss my ass, Petrelli.
C: PETRELLI
D: Hey man, I think you spelled 'Flint sucks balls' wrong.
E: re: the Jersey name
N: (BEAT) This guy's the next Betsy Ross! Aren't you Clarence? The guys laugh. MONIX walks up, defending his teammate.
C: MONIX
D: No one calls him Clarence. His name
N: IS-- (BEAT) What's your name?
C: CLARENCE
D: Jumping Johnny Johnson.
C: MONIX
D: His name's Jumping Johnny Johnson. You got that? Jackie hurries over.
E: nose to nose
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Alright, break it up. Everyone huddle up!... VAKIDIS! OVER HERE. Where is he walking to?
E: to his team
N: (BEAT) Fuck it. Listen up, we're on National TV tonight. And you all know what that means: The league needs a good clean game.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Oh, that's a bunch of dog shit.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Hey! You guys want to merge or not? Because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in the face while the commissioner is at home, watching the game with his kids... Children are very impressionable. Their minds are not yet soiled by the cruel realities of this world.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: What?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: No punching. Behind the huddle, FANS BEGIN WALKING RIGHT ACROSS THE COURT. Both teams turn to watch this strange thing. The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out, directing them across to the other side.
N: JACKIE MOON THAT'S RIGHT, JUST MOVE RIGHT ACROSS- IF YOU COULD JUST FILL IN ALL OF THOSE EMPTY SEATS IN THAT AREA, THAT'D BE GREAT.
S: INT. AMIGO'S STADIUM - LATER
N: The optical illusion has worked. The game does indeed look crowded. The game is in full swing.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: This sold out crowd is loving this one, the Amigos up by twenty-six here in the second. Monix drains a nice jumper, but out of nowhere, Petrelli, the guy we hate, throws a hard shoulder, knocking Monix to the floor.
E: V.0.
C: MONIX
D: That's a moving pick Father Pat! C'mon!
C: FATHER PAT THE REF
D: Play on. Monix can't believe it. Petrelli taunts Monix.
C: PETRELLI
D: What's wrong Monix, cat got your 'nads? Monix faces off.
N: JACKIE MOON MONIX! NO! (POINTING) Not with the cameras. (miming the commish') He's watching. Monix looks around and thinks...
C: MONIX
D: What about commercials?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What?
C: MONIX
D: Commercials, what about commercials? Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.'
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I like it. Time out Ref!
N: ANNOUNCER (V.0. ) A time out on the floor, 5:20 left before the half, the Amigos 45, the Tropics 19, we'll be right back after this message from Shasta. The camera's on air' red light turns off.
C: CAMERA MAN
D: And... You're clear.
E: rooting them on
N: JACKIE MOON SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY! BAM! MONIX CLOCKS PETRELLI. BAM! JACKIE MOON PUNCHES ANOTHER GUY. PETRELLI TAKES THE HIT AND TACKLES MONIX. BOTH BENCHES CLEAR. THE CROWD GOES NUTS.
S: INT. THE COMMISSIONER'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE
N: The commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids... A Shasta commercial is on TV.
C: SHASTA COMMERCIAL
D: I want a pop... I want a -- Shasta...
E: V.0. on TV
S: INT. AMIGO STADIUM - CONTINUOUS
N: MAYHEM. JACKIE MOON IS YANKING A FAN'S HAIR. A TALL GUY IS ABOUT TO POUND SHORT LITTLE KONG. BUT NOW KONG JUMPS IN THE AIR AND DOES A SWEET ROUND-HOUSE JUDO KICK, KNOCKING THE TALL GUY TO THE FLOOR.
C: KONG
D: Hi-Ya!
N: MEANWHILE: MONIX AND PETRELLI ARE TRADING HOCKEY PUNCHES...
C: CAMERA MAN
D: And we're back in -5-
E: Monix punches Petrelli
N: -4- (Petrelli punches Monix) -3- (Monix punches Petrelli) -2- (Monix ducks and punches) (cuing the announcers) AND WE'RE ON. THE 'RED LIGHT' GLOWS. ON A DIME: EVERYONE STOPS PUNCHING, STANDS UP STRAIGHT AND SMILES.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Welcome back to the ABA game of the week... Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the bench.
E: V.0.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: .The camaraderie and spirit of this league is on full display here tonight... Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's spleen.
E: V.0.
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME
N: Jackie runs the half time talk, standing in front of the chalk board.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some
C: ADJ--
D: Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon.
C: MONIX
D: --This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball...
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball. Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.
C: MONIX
D: Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.
C: MONIX
D: We're a bunch of selfish assholes -- And I've got news for you, we aren't going to finish in fourth, we're going to finish dead last. Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.
C: MONIX
D: One day, you're going to look back on your life... And you're going to look back on this time... And you're going to realize... Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually listening...
C: MONIX
D: .You're going to realize you never even played basketball. A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the door.
C: MONIX
D: Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the training room, draining my knee. Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: He's right.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Of course he's right. But what the Hell are we supposed to do about it? We don't even have plays.
S: INT. JACKIE MOON'S OFFICE - DAYS LATER
N: We're back in Flint. Jackie is back in his office, speaking on the phone.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Dukes! I don't make the rules. If they can't cash it, maybe you'll have to go out of state.
E: into phone
N: (BEAT) I would if I could, but if I give you another check, that would be two checks. That would be $20,000, not ten. What are you trying to pull here? (the other line rings) I've got to take this other call Dukes. Bye!-- (hits a button, answering) Flint Tropics hot line... Oh hey Commish ...
S: INT. FLINT MICHIGAN TROPICS STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER
N: On the floor, instead of a basketball court, the stadium holds an ice-rink. A 'Welcome to the Flint Ice Capades' sign is being removed. The entire basketball team is on their hands and knees ASSEMBLING THE HARD WOOD. This is a lot of work. Clarence hits his thumb with a hammer.
C: CLARENCE
D: Why do we have to put the court together?
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: I guess the Ice Capades sold out.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Yeah, kids love that stuff. Although, I find the wild-life masks realistic and frightening.
C: CLARENCE
D: Monix should be here helping us.
N: JACKIE MOON (O.S. ) Guys. The guys look up to find Jackie. He does not look happy.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: The commissioner just called.
C: CLARENCE
D: What's wrong?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I looks like we've got ourselves a situation. We've got some new 'terms and conditions' for this merger deal.
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: What'd he say?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Basically, we've got to average at least 2,000 fans per home game for the rest of the year.
C: TWIGGY MUNSON
D: 2,000 people? Every home game?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: He said the NBA will only take a franchise that has fans.
C: CLARENCE
D: Shit. Winning is going to be hard. But getting 2,000 people to watch is going to be impossible.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Let's try and stay positive. My Mother always believed Flint was a town of destiny. And I believe that. Now, I've already started work on a huge idea to promote us.
C: CLARENCE
D: What kind of huge idea?
S: INT. THE KREMLIN - DAY
N: Jackie's place is empty. Monix is drinking alone, totally blasted in the middle of the day. He hangs his head, barely able to order.
C: MONIX
D: Two more Johnny Walkers. And another pack of Kools.
C: BARTENDER
D: You could use some fresh air, Monix. You want to take a nap in the back of my truck?
N: MONIX (ANGRY) Just the drinks and the smokes, alright? (BEAT) Do you have any idea where Lynn is these days?
C: BARTENDER
D: She asked me to tell you to quit going to her house.
C: MONIX
D: Well, tell her that's just fine with me.
C: BARTENDER
D: Okay. Sorry man.
N: CLARENCE (O.S. ) Monix. REVEAL: Clarence.
C: MONIX
D: Well, well, well, look who it is. Brian, I'd like you to meet Jumping Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner- time finger-blast Fag-erton.
E: to the bartender
C: CLARENCE
D: Johnny for short. Two coffees.
E: to the bartender to Brian, re: Monix
C: MONIX
D: So, what brings you to the The Kremlin?
C: CLARENCE
D: Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies.
N: But I've been thinking about what you said the other night. This is gonna be our last chance. If I'm ever going to get into the NBA, it's going to be with the Tropics.
C: MONIX
D: I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the NBA.
C: CLARENCE
D: So maybe we won't. But like you said, I don't want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think of me. But I'm willing to put our differences aside. I'm telling you right now, I'll do whatever it takes to win.
C: MONIX
D: You mean, like, pass?
C: CLARENCE
D: I would consider passing, yes.
E: with a smile
C: MONIX
D: Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me.
C: CLARENCE
D: I'm not just talking about you playing point guard... I'm talking about you teaching us... Monix could not be less interested.
C: CLARENCE
D: Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it...
C: CLARENCE
D: All I'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can't get any worse.
C: MONIX
D: And why should I give a shit about the Tropics?
C: CLARENCE
D: I know you. You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head. I know you're dying to pass it down to somebody. Why not us?
C: MONIX
D: What about Jackie? He's the coach.
C: CLARENCE
D: Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets. He's obsessed.
E: looking up, re: TV
N: HEY! IT'S OUR VIDEO! TURN THE SOUND UP! ECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION. ON TV: The Tropics are performing a video not unlike 'The Super Bowl shuffle.' Each member takes a turn rapping, dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile.
C: ALL THE TROPICS
D: We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking on you -- But we're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- This is the worst video ever made. All the guys boogie around until Clarence steps forward, taking focus...
E: V.0. rapping badly
C: CLARENCE
D: I'm Johnny Johnson and I got the moves -- If you try and stop me, I'll just get smooth --
E: V.0. rapping badly
C: KONG
D: My name is Kong and I ain't five feet -- But I get more ass than a toilet seat --
E: V.0. rapping badly
C: JACKIE MOON
D: This is my team, so get to know them -- If you get near the lane I'll yank your scrotum --
E: V.O.
N: ALL THE TROPICS (V.0. ) -- We are the Tropics hooping crew, running and gunning and dunking too -- We're not here to talk no trash, we're just here to do the Tropical Mash -- The ball girls trot out and boogie with them.
C: BALL GIRLS
D: -- They're not here to talk no trash -- they're just here to do the Tropical Mash --
E: V.0.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: MONIX CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES. Either can the bartender. Monix ignores Clarence.
C: MONIX
D: Two more Johnny Walkers.
E: to the bartender
C: CLARENCE
D: So that's the way it's going to be? Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks out.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. MONIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Monix looks like shit, laying on the couch, as if he hasn't moved for days. Apparently he's been drinking and smoking, but not much else. KNOCK KNOCK. Someone's at the door. REVEAL: LYNN lets herself in. Monix is so depressed, he is non-plused.
C: LYNN
D: Looking good Monix.
C: MONIX
D: Thanks. You too.
C: LYNN
D: Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them.
S: INT. MONIX'S BATHROOM - LATER
N: ECU: A SHARP NEEDLE PIERCES FLESH. Lynn is draining Monix's knee. It looks painful.
C: MONIX
D: I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn.
C: LYNN
D: Stay still.
E: re: his knee
N: (BEAT) And that's the reason you won't coach them?
C: MONIX
D: It doesn't matter. The truth is, I hate basketball right now.
C: LYNN
D: Do you really hate basketball? Or do you hate yourself?
C: MONIX
D: Why would I hate myself?
C: LYNN
D: Well, for one, you cheated on me.
C: MONIX
D: You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just stares at him.
C: MONIX
D: Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.
C: LYNN
D: You don't wear the ring around your neck anymore. Where is it?
E: no response
C: MONIX
D: I rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn.
C: LYNN
D: Monix, that was greatest moment of your career. And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment.
C: MONIX
D: Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career?
C: LYNN
D: You did more than ride the bench, Monix.
C: MONIX
D: What else did I do?
C: LYNN
D: Every practice, you took your team to the limit. I know you did. I was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night. The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix. And when you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee's offense better than their first stringers ever could. Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe.
C: LYNN
D: By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee was going to be before their own players did. The Celtics made the right adjustments to win that series. And those adjustments came from you.
C: MONIX
D: So, I should be proud of running the scout team?
C: LYNN
D: Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand. And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a champion. And he meant it too.
C: MONIX
D: He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench.
C: LYNN
D: Your whole life, you've bitched about people playing selfish. It takes a team to win, right?
C: MONIX
D: That's right.
C: LYNN
D: But when you're on the team, your effort doesn't count? Is that it?
N: (BEAT) If you weren't on the Celtics that year, would they have won it?
C: MONIX
D: Watch that needle.
C: LYNN
D: Answer me. Would they have won?
C: MONIX
D: I don't know.
C: LYNN
D: Yes you do. You know. Monix looks away for a moment.
C: MONIX
D: Why are you doing this? What does any of this matter, anyway?
C: LYNN
D: What's it matter? You're drinking yourself to death!
N: (BEAT) God, I wish I hated you as much as you hate yourself! Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it.
C: LYNN
D: I made sacrifices! How many years did I support you? And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together, you got there, Monix! You made it, you won an NBA championship ring. It wasn't just about you, okay? And I'm sick of you acting like you're some kind of joke. You didn't blow it. You're not a fraud. You're not a fake champion. And all the time we spent together, fighting for you to get to that moment, was not a waste! You're a champion, you asshole!
N: (BEAT) But if you want to drink yourself to death, go ahead. Fuck you. With that, Lynn is gone. Monix stands alone in the bathroom, then checks his knee.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLISEUM - NEXT DAY
N: It's practice. But this isn't basketball, it's DANCE PRACTICE. The entire team performs a complicated 'intro- dance.' JACKIE MOON (CHOREOGRAPHING) 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like you mean it -- Bee Bee, Arch that back. Yes. Now, the waterfall... One by one, each dips down like a waterfall. And now a leg kick.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips are a coach's dream.
N: (BEAT) Now big finish -- and freeze. And then we start the game after that.
C: CLARENCE
D: Are we going to practice or what?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: This is practice, okay Clarence? We need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow people's minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever...
C: JACKIE MOON
D: From now on, I want our afros bigger... And shinier ... . I want our shorts shorter... And tighter... We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems to be looking off screen.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What's wrong?
N: REVEAL: Monix has been watching this whole thing. With Monix on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Hey, you're back! Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number.
C: CLARENCE
D: Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Coach? Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been made.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What do you mean, coach? What is this? What's going on? It's a Mutiny.
E: truly hurt staring his team down
C: CLARENCE
D: Jackie. Don't be like that.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Hold on a second. Last time I checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I'm coach until a new one is elected.
C: CLARENCE
D: Don't make us elect Monix, man. Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.
E: Jackie Moon holds firm
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Please God No.
C: TWIGGY MUNSON
D: Sorry Jackie.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy, I can handle it.
E: starting to cry
N: Jackie cries harder.
C: CLARENCE
D: Don't take it so hard, Jackie. You're a great owner. We all know that.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?'
C: CLARENCE
D: Yeah. Everyone thinks so.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that? Because it's not cool to mess with me about this.
C: CLARENCE
D: We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Here. You may need this. Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.
E: re: The whistle
C: JACKIE MOON
D: And here are some ideas for plays I've jotted down. Just thoughts.
E: handing him papers
C: MONIX
D: Thanks Jackie. The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games.
E: to the team
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I like it. Unselfish, guys.
C: MONIX
D: Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound.
N: (BEAT) Unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break NOT because you can get a DUNK -- and get your DICK SUCKED after the game -- but because if you sprint up the floor you might pull the defense out of position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs?
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: I vote we keep the blow jobs.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: All in favor? Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.
E: raising his hand
C: CLARENCE
D: Would everyone let the man talk please? Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.
S: INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER
N: The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout team, in blue jerseys.
C: MONIX
D: The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.
C: MONIX
D: Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball.
E: re: deflated ball
N: He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the knife closed.
C: MONIX
D: Alright, Clarence, run the offense.
C: CLARENCE
D: I don't get it.
C: MONIX
D: Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.
C: MONIX
D: Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand.
C: MONIX
D: Widen your stance. Plant your feet. Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie GO. Set a pick for Jackie. Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i rotating faster.
C: MONIX
D: Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and rotate to the rim like this... Everyone move to the open space. And Clarence you swing back out up top. They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The players look at each other, what's the big deal?
C: MONIX
D: You know what that was?
C: CLARENCE
D: What.
C: MONIX
D: A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. Let's do it again.
N: Ei 8.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Hey, how come you don't have to run with us? You're a player, just like the rest of us.
C: MONIX
D: I'm saving my knee for the games. Coach's decision. NOW RUN. Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same basic rotation.
C: MONIX
D: We're not just rotating, we're clearing out, making space. A pass and cut can change defensive match- ups. Creating seams can give us back door looks. Down screens can make a team vulnerable to penetration.
E: as they run
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Hold on. I'm lost.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: No shit. What's up with all of these fucked up words, man?
C: TWIGGY MUNSON
D: Yeah, what are we, building some kind of basketball space. ship?
C: MONIX
D: You don't have to understand it yet. Just run it again. You heard me -- AGAIN.
S: EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - DAY - LATER
N: It's many hours later...
S: INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER
N: The team is still doing the exact same thing. Nothing in their moves have changed at all. They're exhausted.
C: CLARENCE
D: We've been running this play for a long time, man.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Yeah, maybe we could try, like, play number two.
C: MONIX
D: No. We're running this play. We're running this play until we puke.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Basically, we have.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Yeah, I'm pretty beat.
C: MONIX
D: 'Until we puke' is not a figure of speech. We are literally going to puke.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What does he mean by 'literally?'
C: CLARENCE
D: I think he's talking about vomit.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Not cool.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Monix, can I talk to you for .a second?
C: MONIX
D: No. No talking.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Wait...
N: MONIX
C: GO!
D: Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.
C: MONIX
D: We need to get in shape fellas. And we need to learn some fundamentals quick. -- AGAIN! They run it again, getting more and more winded.
E: as they run
N: -17 0 .
C: MONIX
D: I want you to be brain dead. Because someday you're going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - - AGAIN! And when you are, this is the play I'm going to call. The play that your lungs and legs will have memorized. We will be able to run this in our sleep. Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.
C: MONIX
D: HEY! No sticking your fingers down your throat, Clarence, I saw that. You're going to puke. And it's going to be all natural -- AGAIN!

N: JACKIE IS THE LAST PLAYER LEFT. He crawls across the gym floor, dying. Monix screams down at his deflated body. MONIX MOVE MOVE MOVE! FOURTH QUARTER NOW! FOURTH QUARTER!
C: JACKIE MOON
D: You're fired!
C: MONIX
D: Fuck you.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Fuck you.
C: MONIX
D: Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Monix, I need to talk to you.
C: MONIX
D: We'll. talk after you puke. GO!
N: Jackie can't get up, but he crawls, dying...
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I can't puke Monix!
C: MONIX
D: Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Monix! You don't understand. I've never thrown up in my life.
C: MONIX
D: What are you talking about?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I've never puked. Ever.
C: MONIX
D: That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I haven't. I swear to God. I can eat anything. I can drink anything. I've been sick, but I've never puked. I swear to God.
C: MONIX
D: That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't puke. I can't do it! It's the truth! I swear on my Mother's grave. At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued.
C: MONIX
D: What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: My Mom said I never did. I swear. She said I was fascinating.
C: MONIX
D: No way.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: You can call my Dad! I've never puked. When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying.
C: MONIX
D: Isn't that kind of dangerous?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: What do you mean?
C: MONIX
D: What happens if you swallow poison?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't know. I ate bad sausage before. But nothing happened.
C: MONIX
D: Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up.
C: MONIX
D: Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't know. What's a Jejunum?
C: MONIX
D: It's part of your small intestine.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't know. I doubt--
N: BOOM. MONIX'S POWERFUL FIST LIFTS JACKIE'S TORSO IN THE AIR. ECU: Monix's knowing fist digs deep under Jackie's rib cage. It's the hardest punch ever filmed. ON JACKIE'S REACTION: He stands, beyond pain, empty of any possible air. The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome confused, watering strangely. Part of Jackie's brain wants tospeak,buthe feelsunhuman-- his lips separate only slightly. He wanders out of frame.
S: EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - LATER - DAY
N: A SIDE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. JACKIE STUMBLES OUT INTO DAYLIGHT, INTO THE GRASS. HE PAUSES, THEN SUDDENLY STARTS RUNNING, BUT STOPS, CONFUSED, LIKE A WOUNDED GAZELLE... JACKIE STAGGERS FURTHER, USING A TREE TO KEEP HIS BALANCE AS HE STRUGGLES TO STAY CONSCIOUS. JACKIE IS ABOUT TO SPEAK, BUT HIS BODY LURCHES. HE HOLDS HIS RIB CAGE, SHOCKED. A SUDDEN FEELING OF FEAR SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BONES.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Mom?
E: to the sky
N: WITH THAT, JACKIE PROJECTILE VOMITS. THE DISCHARGE IS BEYOND BELIEF. A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF TOXINS ARE LAUNCHED OVER A SHRUB. JACKIE WAILS IN DESPAIR. MONIX stands in the doorway, watching this.
C: MONIX
D: You okay? Jackie is about to speak, but then takes stock of his feelings. There is now an air of tranquility about him. Reborn. He's almost Euphoric...
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I'm beautiful.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT
N: An intense game is underway. The Flint team works hard away from the ball. As the Monix voice over continues, we watch the team move just like in practice. Monix is playing too. Note: The team also looks 'hot.' Clarence plays with an even bigger afro. Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube socks and the whitest thighs you've ever seen.
C: MONIX
D: .On offense, we share the ball. We look for the easy pass, not the spectacular pass... Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.
E: V.O.
C: MONIX
D: . If a guy's more open than you are, he gets the ball... Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we continue to the voice over from practice...
E: V.O.
C: MONIX
D: .On defense, we're going to learn to play together. We're going to use team traps to pressure people into turnovers. On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent. Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.
E: V.0.
C: LIVE ABA RADIO
D: Can you believe that? Jumping Johnny Johnson actually passed the ball.
E: V.0.
C: LOU REDWOOD
D: It was a great pass, too. The other team calls time out.
E: V.0.
C: LIVE ABA RADIO
D: And Jackie Moon has made several great defensive plays down the stretch. I tell you, Jackie's not afraid to knock people around in the lane. He's a monster.
E: V.O.
C: LOU REDWOOD
D: Like a retard in a China shop. A twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.
E: V.0.
C: MONIX
D: Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence, protect the ball and penetrate if you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard. Looking good, we're thirty seconds away from taking this one home. Let's bring it in.
E: huddling up
C: JACKIE MOON
D: He's right guys. But remember, we want to win, but not by too much.
N: '75 .
C: TWIGGY MUNSON
D: We don't want to win by too much?
C: MONIX
D: What the Hell is he talking about?
C: CLARENCE
D: He's worried about the corn dogs.
C: MONIX
D: What?
C: CLARENCE
D: If we score a hundred points, everyone gets a free corn dog. There are signs everywhere.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even have corn dogs.
C: MONIX
D: I don't give a shit. We're taking it to them.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: We're up by seven, Monix. Can't we just take it easy? We're talking about a lot of corn dogs here.
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: There could be a riot.
C: MONIX
D: I don't give a shit about the corn dogs, okay? We play hard every second. We're running the offense. Everyone got that? Everyone nods. WHISTLE!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: The Tropics are just one bucket away from the magic number. Listen to this crowd. They know what's at stake: A free corn dog. Monix has the ball in his hands. He in bounds to Clarence. Clarence penetrates and kicks it to Scootsie. Scootsie has an open look. He sizes up a jumper...
E: V.0.
N: FLYING IN LIKE THE WIND IS JACKIE MOON... JUMPING HIGHER THAN HE EVER HAS BEFORE IN HIS LIFE... REJECTED. SCOOTSIE'S SHOT IS BLOCKED.
C: LIVE ABA RADIO
D: Look at this, Jackie Moon has just blocked his own teammate's shot. I've never seen this before.

S: INT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - LATER
N: The daiquiri room is crowded with guys. JACKIE is having a team meeting.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private matter. As you know, I threw up recently.
E: everyone looks around
N: It was the first time in my life. And, well, it's made me feel... I guess you could say I've got a new clarity in life. (Everyone stares back) Since vomiting on Wednesday, I've been facing my demons. I'm not going to be an imposter any more. (BEAT) And I want you to know, I just mailed out 562 corn dog coupons. (BEAT) And I'd like to bring somebody special in... DUKES! Dukes walks in. He is still shirtless. Jackie hands him a duffel bag.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: In this bag, is ten thousand dollars.
C: DUKES
D: No way. Really?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Actually, it's twenty three hundred. But I'm going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down. From now on, I want my conscience clear.
C: DUKES
D: Wow. Thanks Jackie.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Can I confess something to everyone? It's something I've never told anybody.
C: CLARENCE
D: What is it?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?'
C: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
D: Everyone knows that song.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I stole it.
C: TWIGGY MUNSON
D: No.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: It's true. My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this.
E: turns away, dramatic
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Wait, your Mom wrote that? Was she a singer?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped the whole world. I'm nothing but a fraud.
N: (BEAT) It's true, I'm a famous singer. And I've landed the hottest wife in the world. But, to be honest, we usually only sleep together once a year. On VJ day.
C: CLARENCE
D: Damn. VJ day? That's cold.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: And even on that day, I don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with her.
E: ignoring Kong
C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: What does that mean?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: She married me because of my song, but I didn't write it. So sometimes I feel like it's not even me who's with her. Deep down, I feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her. When I hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth.
E: more emotional
C: DUKES
D: That's pretty weird.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I'm living in a prison, Dukes.
C: CLARENCE
D: Why don't you write a song yourself? Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more.
C: JACKIE MOON
D: Oh please! I could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me Sexy!' Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new day. I am going to be the greatest basketball owner you've ever seen. And we're going to make it to fourth place. MUSIC CUE: HOT CHOCOLATE 'EVERY 1's A WINNER.' MEGA-MONTAGE: THE TROPICAL FEVER SEQUENCE. . -PRE GAME: The Tropics do their 'intro dance.'

D: Well, don't worry, you'll pin him easy. It'll be fine.

C: CLARENCE THE REF
D: Just test him out a little. Maybe it won't be so bad. Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air. Now he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the bear is still motionless.

C: COMMISH
D: I'm sorry, but even if you beat the Spurs on Friday, we just can't have an NBA franchise in Flint.
C: MONIX
D: What are you saying?
C: COMMISH
D: It's just not good business. Flint isn't a big enough media market, okay? This stadium is small and, frankly, it needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry but nobody ever thought you guys could ever get this far.
C: CLARENCE
D: Well tough shit. This team did make it this far. Rules are rules.
C: COMMISH
D: Rules are rules... Until the expansion committee makes new rules. Then those rules are the rules. Everyone looks at each other. Jackie's brain has slipped into a deep trance. He is no longer inside his body.
C: COMMISH
D: Don't take this personally, Jackie. These other teams have strong markets, new stadiums. It's just not going to happen for you Flint boys. I'm sorry. The devastation of what is happening is palpable. Nothing has ever hurt this bad before.
C: COMMISH
D: I know you're going to punch me, Jackie. So let's just get it over with. The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out. Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows. The commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat...
C: COMMISH
D: How did I get out of that one? Suddenly KONG darts in and squeezes the commissioner's balls with a kung fu grip.

C: BEE BEE ELLIS
D: Are you crying?
C: JACKIE MOON
D: I don't know. I'm trying to. I wish I could just puke this away. Do it to my Jejunum, Monix. Help me. But Monix is leaving. He turns and walks off, alone down the dark street... The others walk away too...
