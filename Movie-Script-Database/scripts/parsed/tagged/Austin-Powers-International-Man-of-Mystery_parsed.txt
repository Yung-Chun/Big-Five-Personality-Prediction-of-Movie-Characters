We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of Mystery. He's a swinger, with medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National Health Services glasses. Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs. It is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies. Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

S: EXT. CARNABY STREET - DAY
N: Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF SCHOOLGIRLS. After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: Vanessa's one of our top agents.
C: AUSTIN
D: My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
E: out loud, to himself pause
N: There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.
C: VANESSA
D: Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

N: drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.

C: AUSTIN
D: Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
C: VANESSA
D: I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
C: AUSTIN
D: That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
C: VANESSA
D: I beg your pardon?
C: AUSTIN
D: I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.

D: My wedding tackle.
C: VANESSA
D: I'm sorry?
C: AUSTIN
D: My meat and two veg.

C: AUSTIN
D: Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
C: VANESSA
D: A Chigro?
C: AUSTIN
D: You know, a Chigro&emdash part Chinese, part Negro&emdash Chigro.
C: VANESSA
D: We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
E: offended
C: AUSTIN
D: That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
E: spotting the flight attendants
N: The STEWARDESSES enter. They're not dressed very sexily. One of them is a man and another wears braces.
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much.
C: AUSTIN
D: Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.
C: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
D: My name is Mrs. Wilkenson. There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these.
N: She holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits. FLIGHT ATTENDANT ALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY. IT SAYS HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 - Everyone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'?
C: AUSTIN
D: Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think...listen darling, I think you're a fabulous bird. Can I get your telephone number?
C: FLGHT ATTENDANT
D: Sure, it's easy to remember. It's 777-FILM. We have to prepare the craft for take-off now.
E: mock sexy writing on his hand
C: AUSTIN
D: Smashing! When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone.
N: The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.
C: AUSTIN
D: Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!
N: They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
C: VANESSA
D: Sure.
C: AUSTIN
D: Do I make you horny?
C: VANESSA
D: What?
C: AUSTIN
D: Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
C: VANESSA
D: I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
C: AUSTIN
D: Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash that's what I do, I swing.
C: VANESSA
D: I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

N: There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.

S: INT. DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
C: DR. EVIL
D: Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back. It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw. Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.
E: face again unseen
N: ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA. He is terrified and sweaty, eyes darting left and right.
C: MUSTAFA
D: But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
N: He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.
C: MUSTAFA
D: But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is&emdash --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
E: holding up tennis ball
C: DR. EVIL
D: And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
N: ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

D: Let me go around the table and introduce everyone. Frau Farbissina...
N: ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA

D: ...founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army. Random Task...
N: RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform.
C: DR. EVIL
D: ...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire. Show them what you do.
N: He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it. It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Thank you, Random Task. Patty O'Brien...
N: PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes.
C: DR. EVIL
D: ...ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?
N: Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet.
C: DR. EVIL

C: PATTY O'BRIEN
D: Yes, they're always after me lucky charms!
E: heavy Irish accent
N: Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.
C: PATTY O'BRIEN

N: They cannot contain their LAUGHTER.

E: through suppressed laughter pause
C: DR. EVIL
D: Finally, I come to my number two man. His name: Number Two.
N: NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch.
C: DR. EVIL
D: For thirty years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.
N: He hits a button. The conference table slowly rotates to reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted by various miniature models.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: Over the last thirty years, Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. About fifteen years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry. We own cable companies in thirty-eight states.
N: The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: In addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland.
N: A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland.
C: NUMBER TWO

N: The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
E: holds up plate
C: DR. EVIL
D: Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
N: There is an uncomfortable silence.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
C: DR. EVIL
D: People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around
E: pausing
N: the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom. There is another uncomfortable silence.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: Umm, that also has already happened.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Right. Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom... ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
E: pause pause dramatic pause
N: There is an uncomfortable pause.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
C: DR. EVIL
D: All right then... ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
E: dramatic pause
N: There is another uncomfortable pause.
C: NUMBER TWO
D: Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars. OK, make it happen. Anything else?
E: pleasantly surprised slightly irritated pause
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
C: DR. EVIL
D: Yes.
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
C: DR. EVIL
D: My son?
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Yes. Scott!
E: calling out
N: SCOTT EVIL walks out. He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a Kurt Cobain T-shirt.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Hi.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
E: emotional gesturing to globe
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!

D: You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
C: VANESSA

N: The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products&emdash floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental mirror, and cleaning tool.
C: AUSTIN
D: Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
C: VANESSA

C: AUSTIN
D: So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails? A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father.

HIS LUGGAGE: He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and Hai Karate cologne. HER LUGGAGE: She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - Top Secret."

C: AUSTIN
D: I can't. You're drunk.
C: VANESSA
D: It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.

C: VANESSA
D: Oh.

N: Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY.
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. Exposition. She's in from Tunbridge Wells
N: in Kent. Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old? Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: My God, Austin, what have you done?
C: AUSTIN
D: That's not your mother, that's a man!
N: Austin begins tugging on her hair.

N: The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

E: through pain
C: BASIL EXPOSIION
D: Don't worry, mother. Lie down. Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.
C: AUSTIN
D: I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
C: AUSTIN
D: You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
C: VANESSA
D: Really, Austin!
C: AUSTIN
D: Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: All right, Austin, I think you should go.

D: I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?
E: pause
C: AUSTIN
D: Yes, Basil?
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: Be careful.

N: Basil escorts his mother out.
C: VANESSA
D: Austin, may I have a word with you?
C: AUSTIN
D: Of course, luv.
C: VANESSA
D: Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious
N: feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
C: AUSTIN
D: Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
C: VANESSA
D: I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
E: stunned
C: AUSTIN
D: Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
C: VANESSA

C: AUSTIN
D: Only sailors use condoms, man.
C: VANESSA
D: Not in the Nineties.
C: AUSTIN
D: Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.
C: VANESSA
D: Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
E: pause
C: AUSTIN
D: It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.

S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: MUSIC: "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin looks at his address book. ANGLE ON THE PAGE: We see a list of names crossed out, with comments written in beside them. Beside Jimi Hendrix we see "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square". Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers. He picks up his new pair&emdash REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER PUMPS. He pumps them too much and they explode. Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below. We see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS. Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on. It explodes in a shower of sparks and soup. He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle. The NOISE is awful. Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III. His fighter gets his head ripped off, and blood spews out. Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

C: THERAPIST
D: We don't judge here.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
C: THERAPIST
D: And how do you feel about that?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: I don't wanna take over the family business.
C: DR. EVIL
D: But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Not me.
C: THERAPIST
D: What do you want to do, Scott?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
C: DR. EVIL
D: An evil vet?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
C: DR. EVIL
D: An evil petting zoo?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
E: shouting calm

C: SCOTT EVIL
D: No, he's really evil.
C: THERAPIST
D: Scott.
C: DR. EVIL
D: No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
C: THERAPIST
D: Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
C: THERAPIST
D: OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
N: The group LAUGHS.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
C: THERAPIST
D: We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
C: DR. EVIL
D: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
C: THERAPIST
D: That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
C: GROUP
D: Yes, of course. Go ahead, etc.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical.
N: Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shawn scrotum. At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical school. From there... ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP. They are stunned.

D: Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
C: AUSTIN
D: Sure.
N: They flash their security badges to the guard. ANGLE ON AUSTIN. WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE other, back and forth. MUSIC: Mystical Indian sitar.
C: AUSTIN
D: Everything seems to be in order.
E: hypnotist-like
C: GUARD
D: Hey, wait a minute&emdash
E: looking at the badges
N: ANGLE ON AUSTIN. He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.
C: GUARD
D: Everything seems to be in order.
E: trance-like, in Austin's English accent
C: VANESSA
D: That's amazing. Let's go!
C: AUSTIN
D: Hold on one second.
N: Austin again does his mind control trick.
C: AUSTIN
D: Here, have a piece of gum.
C: GUARD
D: Here, have a piece of gum.
E: in trace
N: He hands Austin a piece of gum.
C: AUSTIN
D: Don't mind if I do.
C: GUARD
D: Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
E: slipping out of trance
N: Austin does his mind-control again.
C: AUSTIN
D: No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
C: GUARD
D: No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.

D: Austin, we have to go!
E: irritated
N: She pulls him away.
C: GUARD
D: I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
E: O.S. faintly
N: Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN - TOP SECRET." They walk through.
S: INT. PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM
N: Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.
C: SCIENTIST
D: This is the strongest, sharpest drill bit ever produced by man. It weighs fifteen metric tones and can bore through a mile-thick bedrock of solid granite in seven seconds.
S: INT. VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM
N: A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count. They notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram. The guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.
S: INT. PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM
N: SFX: ALARM GOES OFF
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Attention, there are intruders in the complex.
E: on PA
N: All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin and Vanessa.
C: SCIENTIST
D: Get them!
N: The scientist approach. Austin knocks two of them out cold with judo chops.
C: AUSTIN
D: Judo chop! Judo chop!
N: Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks. SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway. Austin and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads "VIRTUCON STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."
S: INT. STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY
N: It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a large observation booth. Six STEAMROLLER go around a test track very slowly. Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving steamrollers. Security guards enter the facility and begin fanning out in a search.
C: AUSTIN
D: Our only way out of here is to drive out!
N: They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, push him off, and assume the controls.
C: P.A.
D: There they are!
E: O.S.
N: Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller. Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away. Austin punches the other one off.
C: AUSTIN
D: Hang on! I'm going to floor it!
N: He engages a lever. It goes only slightly faster. TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller. They are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a fast-approaching car.
C: GUARD
D: Noooooooooooooo!
C: AUSTIN
D: Where did you learn to shoot?
C: VANESSA
D: Where did you learn to drive?
N: ANGLE ON THE GUARDS. ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME." THE steamroller is now 8 yards away. The other army guy is still frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.
C: GUARD
D: Noooooooooooooo!
C: VANESSA
D: Austin, watch out!
C: AUSTIN
D: Where? Where?
E: looking around
N: ANGLE ON THE GUARD. HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS away.
C: GUARD
D: Noooooooooooooo!
N: ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA. AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO downshift. SFX: Metal grinds. The shifter breaks off along with a gaggle of wares. He desperately jams on the breaks. ANGLE ON THE GUARD. HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE STEAMROLLER. THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF blood and guts. By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door. They run out into the hallway.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: The coast is clear.
C: VANESSA
D: Thank God, Austin, we made it.
C: AUSTIN
D: Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
N: From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out. It is Random Task flanked by four SECURITY GUARDS.
S: INT. STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY
N: We see the aftermath. Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood and guts with large squeegees and brooms. One of them turns to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on his jumpsuit. Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and dust pail to sweep up blood. ZOOM IN on the steamrolled Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

D: Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin. Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. What? Killed? How? Run over by a steamroller? Oh my God. Thank you for calling.
E: pause pause pause pause pause pause
N: She HANGS UP. A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.
C: FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
D: Hi Mom! When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball.
C: MRS. HARWIN
D: Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news. As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
C: BILLY
D: Was? What is it, Mom?
C: MRS. HARWIN
D: Your brother was run over by a steamroller.
C: BILLY
D: A steamroller? No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.
E: bursting into tears
C: MRS. HARWIN
D: I'm sorry son. People never think how things affect the family of the henchman. I love you, Billy. I wonder if we'll be able to receive Steve's henchman's comp.
E: hugging him to herself, out loud

N: The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table. All the evil associates are present. Dr. Evil squeezes a tennis ball repeatedly. Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. Powers. Mrs. Kensington's daughter, how lovely. I believe your name is Vanessa? I'd shake your hands, except for obvious reasons.
C: VANESSA
D: I don't understand.
C: DR. EVIL
D: My hand, dammit! Look at it!
C: AUSTIN
D: What's wrong with your hand?
C: DR. EVIL
D: Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak!
N: Look at it, it's been rendered useless. He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually normal, just slightly aged.
C: AUSTIN
D: I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
N: A large telescreen comes on, showing the United Nations Secret Meeting Room.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.
N: He presses a button on his chair panel. A giant canvas falls, unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean bore&emdash the VULCAN. It is rather phallic.

D: Does that make you horny?
E: under his breath to Vanessa
C: VANESSA
D: Not now, Austin.
E: under her breath
C: DR. EVIL
D: The world's most powerful subterranean drill.
S: INT. UNITED NATIONS SECRET MEETING ROOM
N: ON SCREEN: Stock footage of volcanoes erupting and animated charts of magma squirting through the Earth's layers.
C: DR. EVIL
D: So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core. Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will erupt.
E: voice over
N: The various representatives are ABUZZ. Behind the British delegation sits Basil Exposition. To his right, sits Mrs. Exposition with a hideous BLACK EYE.
C: AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE
D: Why should we pay him the money? He's only got one warhead and he's going to detonate it deep underground.
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes. Imagine no United Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England...
E: the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks
C: BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE
D: Any word from Powers?
C: BASIL EXPOSITION
D: I'm afraid we've lost contact with him.
E: back to normal

N: Scott enters.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
E: trying to hide contempt
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
C: DR. EVIL
D: And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Yeah. What?
N: ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT. DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE button labeled "SCOTT." Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
C: DR. EVIL
D: In due time.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
C: DR. EVIL
D: I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
C: DR. EVIL
D: One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
N: A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa. Dr. Evil hits a button. One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner.
N: They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal. The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts them in the dipping mechanism.
C: AUSTIN
D: Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
C: DR. EVIL
D: No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
E: to guard
N: The guard do so. Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly towards the surface of the water.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
E: to the room
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Dr. Evil?
E: clearing her throat nervously
C: DR. EVIL
D: Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
E: disappointed to Austin
N: Frau clears her throat again.
C: DR. EVIL
D: What is it now?
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
C: DR. EVIL
D: I have one simple request&emdash sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people?
N: What do we have?
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Sea bass.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Right.
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: They're mutated sea bass.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Really? Are they ill-tempered?
C: FRAU FARBISSINA
D: Please allow me to demonstrate.
N: Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch through the air. The sea bass devour the lamb. She pulls the rope back. The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.
C: DR. EVIL
D: Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
E: to the room
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
C: DR. EVIL
D: No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
C: SCOTT EVIL
D: I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
C: DR. EVIL
D: No Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
N: Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the tank.
S: INT. TANK AREA
N: Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water. They can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.
C: VANESSA
D: What's your plan?
N: Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing Austin.
C: AUSTIN
D: First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
C: VANESSA
D: Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
N: She pulls out a container of dental floss.
C: AUSTIN
D: All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
C: VANESSA
D: No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
C: AUSTIN
D: Smashing idea! Give it to me.
N: Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo. He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches like a grappling hook. Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack. Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass. Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss. He keeps pulling out floss. More floss still. The mechanism continues to sink. Finally, the floss line goes TAUT. Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism. Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand. Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss. Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard. Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard loudly. He turns around.
C: AUSTIN
D: Judo chop!
N: Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes.
C: GUARD
D: My eyes! My eyes!
E: screaming, rubbing his eyes
N: Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends.
C: AUSTIN
D: Hold on, Vanessa!
N: She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. He and Austin STRUGGLE. The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water. SEA BASS circle. The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head.
C: VANESSA
D: Austin, watch out!
E: shouting
N: Austin FLIPS the guard over. The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender.
C: AUSTIN
D: Not a good time to lose one's head.
C: VANESSA
D: Indeed.
C: AUSTIN
D: That's not the way to get ahead in life.
C: VANESSA
D: Yes.
C: AUSTIN
D: It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
C: VANESSA
D: Shut up.
C: AUSTIN
D: Fair enough.
N: They head out a door. ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO. The name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

N: It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES.
S: INT. HOOTERS RESTAURANT
N: At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer. GUY 1 I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow. GUY 2 Where is Smittie anyways? It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party. GUY 3 Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil. Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy? I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor. There's a lot of love in this room. A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.
C: WAITRESS
D: Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.
N: GUY 1 Hello? (pause) Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. (pause) That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. (pause) What? He's dead? (pause) Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you. He hangs up. GUY 2 (to Guy 1) Hey Bill, what's wrong? Was that John? Is he coming late? GUY 1 Guys, John's not coming. GUY 2 Why? GUY 1 He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.
C: GUYS

N: MUSIC: Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive dance. He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch. He throws seven cigarettes one by one. Each cigarette lands perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth. Austin smokes the remaining cigarette. Austin begins to do a seductive striptease. The Fembots are aroused. He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot. She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder. Eventually her head explodes. Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and turns to another Fembot. Her head explodes. He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly. Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare foot. He gives a look of disguised pain. He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot. Her head explodes. He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, whose head explodes. Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes. Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining Fembots.
