I don't mean it's not right for you, Conrad. I mean I think that if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing.

S: EXT. CITY BUSINESS CENTER ­ DAY
N: Calvin walks with his business partner Ray Hanley (seen at the party).
C: RAY HANLEY
D: Well. At least she's an improvement. She doesn't crack gum in your face. That's what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing.
C: CALVIN
D: Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault. I just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it.
C: RAY HANLEY
D: Hold, hold it. Wait a minute. That's not the problem. Where are you?

C: CALVIN
D: Connie's all right. He is. He's okay.
C: RAY HANLEY
D: Look, I am sorry, it's none of my business, but I think you worry too much. You've been on the rack about him long enough. You're making it a habit. You've gotta let him go sometime.
C: CALVIN
D: I'm not on the rack about him.
C: RAY HANLEY
D: The thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go. Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year and not even go to school at all. Who knows?
C: CALVIN
D: I can't argue with "Who knows."
C: RAY HANLEY
D: I'm just try giving you the benefit of my experience.
C: CALVIN
D: Thanks.
C: RAY HANLEY
D: With Valerie, it's more than her living away from home... She's gone. Got her own friends, her own life. She breezes in ...for a couple of days on vacations, but... I don't know, maybe girls are different. Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between Nance and me. But they leave... And all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap. It's just wasted energy.

D: When I let myself feel low, I feel as lousy.
C: DR BERGER
D: Oh! I beg your pardon! I never promised you a rose garden...

C: CALVIN
D: What then? Explain it to me.
C: CONRAD
D: Ha! I can't! Everything is German pudding with you , dad. You don't see things!
C: CALVIN
D: What things?
N: Conrad sighs. CALVIN (cont'd) What things? Please, I want you to tell me.
C: CONRAD
D: That she hates me! Can't you see that?
C: CALVIN
D: Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad?
C: CONRAD
D: All right, all right. You're right. She doesn't. Please leave me alone, now.
N: Silence. Then Calvin stands up and goes to the door.
C: CALVIN
D: What about this Dr. Berger? Do you think he's helping you?
C: CONRAD
D: Don't blame it on Burger, it's not his fault!
N: Calvin opens the door.
C: CALVIN
D: I'll be downstairs if you need me.
N: Exit Calvin. Conrad remains lying on his back with his arm over his eyes. INT. Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE ­ EVENING
C: DR BERGER
D: Tuesday you felt great. You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay?
C: CONRAD
D: You're the doctor.
C: DR BERGER
D: Don't take refuge in one-liners like "You're the doctor". Okay? Because that pisses me off.
C: CONRAD
D: Okay. Okay.
C: DR BERGER
D: So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy.
C: CONRAD
D: Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled!
C: DR BERGER
D: What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit?
N: Conrad sighs. DR BERGER (cont'd) Come on. You must be able to come up with at least one example. And don't give me "I tried to kill myself", that's old turkey. What have you done lately?
C: CONRAD
D: Lately?
C: DR BERGER
D: Uh, uh.
C: CONRAD
D: Hey, come on, if you... Listen, I'm never gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right. If you think I'm gonna forgive... - that she's gonna forgive me...
N: Conrad stops. Dr. Berger looks at Conrad to signal him he just said something: Conrad realizes he just made a Freudian slip, looks at him,
C: DR BERGER
D: What?
N: Conrad stands up, reflects, looks outside window.
C: CONRAD
D: I think I just figured something out.
C: DR BERGER
D: What?
C: CONRAD
D: Who it is who can't forgive who...
C: DR BERGER
D: Well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution.
C: CONRAD
D: I've heard this all before.
C: DR BERGER
D: Doesn't make it any less true.
C: CONRAD
D: I'm so tired.
C: DR BERGER
D: Yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself.
C: CONRAD
D: So what do I do now?
C: DR BERGER
D: Recognize her limitations.
C: CONRAD
D: You mean, like she can't love me?
C: DR BERGER
D: Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love you enough. Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able.
C: CONRAD
D: But she loves my father. I know she loved my brother. It's me!
C: DR BERGER
D: Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that?
C: CONRAD
D: That's different. He feels responsible. Besides, he loves everybody.
C: DR BERGER
D: Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels.
C: CONRAD
D: What do you mean?
C: DR BERGER
D: I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.
C: CONRAD
D: You mean me?
N: Conrad is wondering. CONRAD (cont'd) For trying to off myself? Don't you sit there and stare at me. What for?
C: DR BERGER
D: Why don't you give yourself a break? Let yourself off the hook?
C: CONRAD
D: What did I do?
N: No answer. CONRAD (cont'd) What did I do?
C: DR BERGER
D: We'll talk about it on Thursday.
C: CONRAD
D: Come on!
C: DR BERGER
D: Time's up.
C: CONRAD
D: What do you mean? You're gonna pull the plug... Come on! What did I do?
C: DR BERGER
D: Come on, Con. You know the rules.
C: CONRAD
D: Rules? What rules? Can't I have a few minutes?
C: DR BERGER
D: You think about it. Just think about it.
N: Silence
C: CONRAD
D: Jesus!
N: Conrad is out of breath.
S: EXT. PARK ­ DAY
N: Calvin and Friend are jogging in sportswear. Calvin's friend explains a stock market deal he made.
C: FRIEND
D: Say. After going to a new high, it falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume. I shoot an order to buy 4000 at the market. If I get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know something's wrong.
E: MORE
N: FRIEND (cont'd) But suppose the order to buy the 4000 shares I put in at the price of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500 at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way up, so the last 500 shares I pay 115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm going to peel off here. Friend leaves Calvin and runs toward his home.
C: CALVIN
D: OK.
C: FRIEND
D: I'll see you, Cal.
C: CALVIN
D: See you later.
N: Now Calvin is running through the park alone. Different voices are echoing off screen.
C: FRIEND
D: Suppose the order to buy 4000 at 113 3/4...
E: OS
C: BETH
D: He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him...
E: OS
C: FRIEND
D: 500 at 114...
E: OS
C: CONRAD
D: It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things.
E: OS
C: BETH
D: You've been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital. And you just don't see that!
E: OS
C: CONRAD
D: Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!
E: OS
C: BETH
D: Buck never would have been in the hospital!
E: OS
C: CONRAD
D: She hates me! Can't you see that?
E: OS
N: Calvin trips, and falls in dead leaves. He sits up, thoughtfull.
C: CALVIN
D: I want to be clear.
E: OS
N: INT. Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE ­ EVENING Calvin laughs nervously, all smiles.
C: DR BERGER
D: That's good.
E: OS
C: CALVIN
D: In the car, I was thinking: "be clear.". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry.
C: DR BERGER
D: Okay.
C: CALVIN
D: I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.
C: DR BERGER
D: Neither do I.
N: Calvin laughs.
C: CALVIN
D: I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here.
C: DR BERGER
D: Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that?
C: CALVIN
D: I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an "A" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.
C: DR BERGER
D: But you still feel responsible?
C: CALVIN
D: Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck!
C: DR BERGER
D: You think of yourself as a lucky man, then?
C: CALVIN
D: No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the "accident". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it.
C: DR BERGER
D: That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney.
C: CALVIN
D: Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching.
C: DR BERGER
D: What would you want to do about that?
C: CALVIN
D: Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.
E: MORE
N: CALVIN (cont'd) I feel like I'm sitting on a fence, and I don't like it.
C: DR BERGER
D: And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence?
C: CALVIN
D: Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him.
C: DR BERGER
D: For what?
C: CALVIN
D: Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh...
C: DR BERGER
D: Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck?
C: CALVIN
D: Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?
C: DR BERGER
D: And you?
C: CALVIN
D: Me? I loved Buck.
C: DR BERGER
D: What I mean is, your wife's affection.
C: CALVIN
D: For me you mean?
C: DR BERGER
D: Yes.
C: CALVIN
D: Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?
C: DR BERGER
D: Mm-hmm. Very private.
C: CALVIN
D: I think I know why I came here. I think I came here to talk about myself.
C: DR BERGER
D: Okay. Why don't we?
S: INT. JARRETT'S HOME. GARAGE ­NIGHT
N: Calvin sits in the dark in his car behind the wheel, not looking too happy. Door to garage opens and Beth appears.

D: Hi!
N: Calvin slowly opens the door. Car Buzzer Alarm. Calvin heavily comes out. BETH (cont'd) Calvin? [Buzzing Continues] BETH (cont'd) What's the matter? Calvin heavily comes out of the car, and finally closes door. Buzzing stops.
C: CALVIN
D: This will sound strange.
N: What I'm gonna to say will sound strange.
C: BETH
D: What happened?
N: Come inside.
C: CALVIN
D: Could we talk about Buck's funeral?
C: BETH
D: What?
C: CALVIN
D: I know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and I'd just like to talk about it.
C: BETH
D: Why?
C: CALVIN
D: When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was...
C: BETH
D: Calvin, what's the matter with you?
C: CALVIN
D: Just let me get it off my chest,OK?
C: BETH
D: What could getting dressed for Buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now?
C: CALVIN
D: I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral?
C: BETH
D: Ha, ha.
N: Beth retreats inside the house to the kitchen.
C: CALVIN
D: Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen!
C: BETH
D: I won't listen to that! No one in their right mind would listen to that.
C: CALVIN
D: I just want to talk about something I always remembered.
C: BETH
D: Why do you want to remind me of it?
C: CALVIN
D: Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it.
N: She comes to him and takes him into her arms.
C: BETH
D: It's all right.

C: CAROLL
D: Fabulous! Is everything okay?

C: BETH
D: Oh... No, no. No. Thanks.
S: INT. MALL DINER ­ DAY
N: Beth and Conrad are having lunch at a table in the diner. Beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought.
C: BETH
D: We've got Bennett's, and Grant's and Foley's. Ha, Conrad should get something for my mother and father. He's not supposed to get something for his doctor, is he?
C: CALVIN
D: I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger.
N: Beth laughs.
C: BETH
D: What?
C: CALVIN
D: I think we could all go and see him together.
C: BETH
D: Why?
C: CALVIN
D: He thinks it's a good idea.
C: BETH
D: Ho... He thinks it's a good idea? What does he know about me, about this family? I've never even met him.
C: CALVIN
D: Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open.
C: BETH
D: About what? What are we gonna talk about? Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't want anymore changes in my life. For God's sake, hasn't enough happened? Let's just hold on to what we've got!
C: CALVIN
D: Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise.
C: BETH
D: I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry.
C: CALVIN
D: I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point.
C: BETH
D: I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong...
C: WAITRESS
D: Are you folks ready to order?
E: interrupting
C: CALVIN
D: Huh, no... Could you give me a couple of minutes, please?
C: WAITRESS
D: Sure.

C: BETH
D: We need time together, Calvin. You and I. We have to get away. New Years'. We can spend some time in Houston with my brother and Audrey. You know, play a little golf. Relax.
N: Calvin seems doubtfull. Beth goes softly. BETH (cont'd) I have already talked to Mother about it, and Conrad can stay with them. Please don't worry about it. Please, for his sake, don't indulge him. We need time together. Okay?
C: CALVIN
D: Okay. Okay.
N: Beth takes his hand but it seems almost like a handshake.
C: BETH
D: I love you.
C: CALVIN
D: I love you, too.
N: Beth stares at him.
C: BETH
D: Let's just give things time. Okay?
N: Calvin doesn't say anything.

C: JEANNINE
D: Why did you do it?
C: CONRAD
D: Uh... I don't know. It was like... falling into a hole. It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger, .and you can't get out, and then, .all of a sudden, it's inside...and you're the hole, and you're trapped, and it's all over. Something like that. And it's not really scary, except it is when you think back on it. 'Cause you know what you were feeling stange and new...

D: Yes. When those boys came in, it was awful and awkward. That's what I do when I get embarrassed. I laugh.
C: CONRAD
D: But they were all right. They were just up and they were having a good time, and I let them get in the way of what was happening. It was dumb. It was dumb. I've been doing lots of dumb things lately. I just didn't know wether or not you were being straight with me.
N: Jeannine is moved, she extends her hand to him then put it to her heart. CONRAD (cont'd) Yeah? Jeannine nods. CONRAD (cont'd) Anyway, I'd like to try it again. I thought it worked out okay. Well, except for the bowling. Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his eyes.

N: She pulls back and looks at him.
C: BETH
D: Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex?
C: CALVIN
D: Well, you said "vacation", so I just assumed you meant him too.
C: BETH
D: I'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here.

D: Ha! There's no point discussing it.
C: CALVIN
D: I think there is a point.
C: BETH
D: He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away.
C: CALVIN
D: He isn't the problem.
C: BETH
D: Isn't he?
C: CALVIN
D: No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you.
C: BETH
D: No, no. Let's talk about what's bothering you. Cos' that's what you want, isn't it?
C: CALVIN
D: Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me?
C: BETH
D: It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing.
C: CALVIN
D: Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?
C: BETH
D: No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it!
C: CALVIN
D: Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!
C: BETH
D: I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known.
C: CALVIN
D: Well, I'll tell you what he expects!
C: BETH
D: What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: "Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.". I can't!
C: CALVIN
D: All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it.
C: BETH
D: Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you?
C: CALVIN
D: I just try to keep this family together...
C: BETH
D: I don't know what everyone wants from me anymore!

C: BETH
D: Happy?
C: WARD
D: Yes.
C: BETH
D: Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!

D: I don't...
C: BETH
D: What did you say?
N: Calvin sits back in his chair. BETH (cont'd) Calvin. What did you say? Calvin produces a very deep sigh. BETH (cont'd) Tell me. Calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.
C: CALVIN
D: You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.
N: CALVIN (cont'd) Tell me something. Do you love me? Do you really love me?
C: BETH
D: I feel the way I've always felt about you.
N: Calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad.
C: CALVIN
D: We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know.
N: Calvin sighs. CALVIN (cont'd) Maybe it wasn't even Buck. Maybe it was just you. Maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried. (MORE) CALVIN (cont'd) But whatever it was, I don't know who you are. I don't know what we've been playing at. So I was crying.

D: You know, I used to figure you had a handle for everything. You knew it all.
N: Calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself. CONRAD (cont'd) I know that wasn't fair but you always made us feel like everything was gonna be all right. I thought about that a lot lately. I really admire you for it. Calvin is moved.
C: CALVIN
D: Well, don't admire people too much. They'll disappoint you sometimes.
C: CONRAD
D: I'm not disappointed. I love you.
N: Calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms.
C: CALVIN
D: I love you too.
N: They hug each other. [ Camera pulls back / Canon in D by Pachelbel ] Credits roll. THE END
