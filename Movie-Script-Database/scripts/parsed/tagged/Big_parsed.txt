M: Are you okay!
M: MR. M
M: I'm fine.
M: PAUL
M: You could kill somebody running around here like that!

M: MOM
M: I want proof that he's all right!
M: JOSH
M: Uh, well, all right. Ask me something that only he would know. Then

M: MOM
M: Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy.
M: JOSH
M: Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him?
M: MOM
M: Ask him!
M: JOSH
M: Oh, I got it! I got it! Memories, like the corner of my mind. Misty

M: way. Why did they change it?
M: MR. M
M: I don't know.
M: JOSH
M: You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the
M: pieces. But I never liked the Galactakons. You only get one robot,
M: and they don't come with a vehicle.
M: MR. M
M: I see.
M: JOSH
M: Plus you can't take them underwater. And if you do they...Neat!
M: MR. M

M: JOSH
M: No. No. They got a hundred of them. Are we ready?
M: WOMAN
M: Yes Mr. Baskin.
M: JOSH
M: Come on in.
M: BILLY
M: Look at this place! It's bigger than the principal's office!
M: JOSH
M: How would you know?
M: BILLY
M: Remember that explosion in science?
M: JOSH
M: Oh yes!
M: BILLY
M: Truck-a-Killer! $59.95?
M: JOSH
M: You know that only costs 10 bucks to make.
M: BILLY
M: Get out of here! ...What is this?
M: JOSH
M: Oh, well, this is just...They just put this in here...it doesn't mean
M: anything.
M: BILLY
M: So what do they make you do for all this?
M: JOSH
M: Well, I play with all of this stuff and then, I go in there and tell
M: them what I think.
M: BILLY
M: That's it?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah.
M: BILLY
M: And they pay you for that?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah.
M: BILLY
M: Suckers!
M: JOSH
M: Oh, thank you Miss Patterson. Hey! Miss Patterson. Could you call
M: down to Media and have them send up a video tape of the Giants Broncos
M: Super Bowl? And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and
M: stuff?
M: WOMAN
M: Yes Mr. Baskin.
M: JOSH
M: Miss Patterson.
M: BILLY
M: You're the luckiest guy I know.
M: SCENE 36
M: PAUL
M: Did you check Mattel?
M: SUSAN
M: Nothing.
M: PAUL
M: Colleco?
M: SUSAN
M: Zero.
M: PAUL
M: He can't come from nowhere Susan. He has to come from somewhere. How
M: about Hasbro?
M: SUSAN
M: Yes. And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder. I have called everywhere.
M: Nobody's ever heard of him!
M: PAUL
M: Great!
M: SUSAN
M: Face it Paul. The guy comes from data processing.
M: PAUL
M: Terrific. That is just terrific! This is just terrific!
M: SUSAN
M: You're being paranoid Paul.
M: SCENE 37
M: PAUL
M: These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind
M: format of eight over-lapping demographic groups. Every region of the
M: country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to
M: 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.
M: When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent
M: market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we
M: should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total
M: revenue from all of last year. Any questions? Yes? Yes?
M: JOSH
M: I don't get it.
M: PAUL
M: What exactly don't you get?
M: JOSH
M: It turns from a building into a robot, right?
M: PAUL
M: Precisely.
M: JOSH
M: Well, what's fun about that?
M: PAUL
M: Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our
M: success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45
M: percent in the last two years. There, that might help.
M: JOSH
M: Oh.
M: PAUL
M: Yes?
M: JOSH
M: I still don't get it.
M: PAUL
M: What?!
M: MR. M
M: What don't you get Josh?
M: JOSH
M: Well, there's a million robots that turn into something. And this is a
M: building that turns into a robot. So what's so fun about playing with
M: a building? That's not any fun!
M: PAUL
M: This is a skyscraper.
M: JOSH
M: Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug
M: or something?
M: PAUL
M: A bug?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah! Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that
M: could pick up a car and crush it like that!
M: MAN
M: A prehistoric transformer?
M: MR. M
M: Interesting.
M: PAUL
M: Gentlemen!
M: MAN
M: So the robot turns into a bug.
M: PAUL
M: Ah, gentlemen, listen...
M: MAN
M: Listen to him. He's got a very good idea here. The robot turns into a
M: bug.
M: MAN
M: This is a great idea!
M: JOSH
M: Different sizes and things. And...you could have them wreck
M: something...
M: MAN
M: A lady bug. Transformers for girls!
M: MR. M
M: This is a bug that moves....It's got all kinds of possibilities.
M: PAUL
M: This doesn't just happen. This doesn't happen. You don't just come to
M: a meeting and say "bugs."
M: SUSAN
M: I, uh....
M: MR. M
M: Well done, Josh. Well done.
M: SCENE 38
M: PAUL
M: Ho! Ho! Ho! He is vicious!
M: SUSAN
M: He's not vicious.
M: PAUL
M: Oh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself. That man is a killer!
M: SUSAN
M: All he said was "I don't get it."
M: PAUL
M: I don't get it! I don't get! I don't get! He's going for the throat,
M: trying to eviscerate me! Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!
M: SUSAN
M: Mmm Hmm.
M: SCENE 39
M: REALTOR
M: It's quite a unique space. The lines are so clean and you don't get
M: any of that partition quality. It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood
M: floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with
M: a jet stream jacuzzi.
M: BILLY
M: We'll take it.
M: SCENE 40
M: MAN
M: Baskin. Rental delivery!
M: JOSH
M: Dear Mom and Dad. They said that I could write you and let you know I
M: was okay. So far, they're treating me fine. I've got enough to eat
M: and I'm perfectly safe. They say that I'll get out of here in about a
M: month. In the mean time, it's a lot like camp! I watch TV and even
M: get outside once in a while. I know you miss me. But try not to
M: worry. I think this experience might even be good for me. I love you
M: very much and I know that I'll see you soon. Your son, Joshua. P.S.
M: Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother.
M: SCENE 41
M: WOMAN
M: It's very beautiful and I'm having a lovely time.
M: MR. M
M: I'm glad Miss Patterson.
M: WOMAN
M: It's much better than last year. I just wanted to tell you that.
M: MR. M
M: I'll have another scotch....Susan.
M: SUSAN
M: Love your tux.
M: MR. M
M: I think it's the same as the maitre's.
M: SUSAN
M: Have you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line?
M: MR. M
M: No, I haven't.
M: SUSAN
M: Well, uh, I think if you got everyone's input up front, I mean right
M: from the beginning....
M: MR. M
M: Susan, have a drink.
M: SUSAN
M: What?
M: MR. M
M: Have a couple drinks. It's a party.
M: SCENE 42
M: MR. M
M: Josh! Glad you could make it.
M: MAN
M: Bet he gets another raise.
M: MR. M
M: Now that's what I call a tuxedo.
M: JOSH
M: I rented it. This is a real bow tie though. I tied it myself. And
M: that's why I was late.
M: MR. M
M: No, you're not late at all. Come on, let me show you around.
M: JOSH
M: Hey, there's Miss Patterson! Hi! There's the guy from the meeting!
M: Hi!
M: SCENE 43
M: PAUL
M: The guy's a damn knock-off artist.
M: MAN
M: What do you mean?
M: PAUL
M: The Amphibian? He takes 10,000 G. I. Joes, slaps some gills on them,
M: webs their feet, and packages them in seaweed....So I show him the
M: schedule and he says, "It's not correct accounting procedure!" Give me
M: a goddamn break!
M: MAN
M: But the toy sold Paul.
M: SUSAN
M: Excuse me.
M: SCENE 44
M: SUSAN
M: Hi.
M: JOSH
M: Hi.
M: SUSAN
M: All the same people having all the same discussion. It's like they
M: cloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning it out again and again and
M: again. I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.
M: JOSH
M: Thanks.
M: SUSAN
M: They were so, incisive. It's Beluga. Macmillan orders it every
M: year....You all right? You okay? You want a glass of water? You want
M: something to drink?
M: JOSH
M: Could I have a milkshake or something?
M: SUSAN
M: I've got a car outside. You want to get out of here?
M: JOSH
M: Uh Huh.
M: SUSAN
M: Let's go.
M: SCENE 45
M: SUSAN
M: I'm not really a big one for parties. You know, I like things that are
M: a little more intimate.
M: JOSH
M: Wow! Is this your car?
M: SUSAN
M: Well, it's the company's car.
M: JOSH
M: Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
M: SUSAN
M: I mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a
M: chance to know them. I mean, just being with you here tonight, I
M: really get a sense of who you are.
M: JOSH
M: Are you gonna eat these fries?
M: SUSAN
M: No. No....
M: JOSH
M: Hey mister? You want some of these fries? We're not going to eat
M: them.
M: DRIVER
M: No, thank you.
M: SUSAN
M: You see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this
M: invisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you
M: going to call someone before...?
M: JOSH
M: No.
M: SUSAN
M: Uh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the
M: radio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now! You
M: know...I mean, I love my job and I....
M: JOSH
M: Ejector seat! This is great! Hey! Come on up! Hey, that was my
M: apartment.
M: SUSAN
M: Really? I'd love to see where you live.
M: SCENE 46
M: SUSAN
M: So have you always lived alone?
M: JOSH
M: No, not always.
M: SUSAN
M: Ah. Is it just recently or...?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah.
M: SUSAN
M: Give yourself a couple of days, it'll pass.
M: JOSH
M: Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.
M: SUSAN
M: Well, it can be painful but, that's what they invented Xanax for,
M: right?
M: JOSH
M: Watch your step.
M: SUSAN
M: I'm not sure we should do this yet.
M: JOSH
M: Do what?
M: SUSAN
M: Well, I mean I like you and I want to spend the night with you....
M: JOSH
M: Do you mean sleep over?
M: SUSAN
M: Well,...yeah!
M: JOSH
M: Okay! But I get to be on top!
M: SCENE 47
M: SUSAN
M: You live here?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah. It's nice, isn't it?
M: SUSAN
M: Yeah.
M: JOSH
M: You uh, want a soda?
M: SUSAN
M: Huh?
M: JOSH
M: Soda? You want one?
M: SUSAN
M: Yeah, sure.
M: JOSH
M: They rigged this up so you don't need any quarters....Don't! Don't...!
M: SUSAN
M: What?
M: JOSH
M: The glue's not dry. Sorry.
M: SUSAN
M: Sorry.
M: JOSH
M: It's okay....You wanna play pinball?
M: SUSAN
M: No.
M: JOSH
M: You don't need quarters for this either. It's free.
M: SUSAN
M: No, thank you.
M: JOSH
M: Okay.
M: SUSAN
M: Is that a trampoline?
M: JOSH
M: Yeah. You wanna try it?
M: SUSAN
M: No.
M: JOSH
M: You should. It's really fun. It's simple, too. Come on! Come on!
M: You'll like it and it's really easy to do.
M: SUSAN
M: No, I don't think...
M: JOSH
M: I'm serious...

M: JOSH
M: Take off your shoes...It's really easy....Let me get rid of these
M: balls.

M: JOSH
M: Come on. It's fun. I'll do it with you. Up you go. Excellent.
M: SUSAN
M: Help me up?

M: Sure.
M: SUSAN
M: Okay.
M: JOSH
M: Okay. Jump.
M: SUSAN
M: You want me to jump?
M: JOSH
M: Yes.
M: SUSAN
M: There. Now can we have a drink?
M: JOSH
M: No! No! No! I mean really jump. Now get some air between you and
M: the trampoline.
M: SUSAN
M: There.
M: JOSH
M: Oh, come on! I'll do it with you! All right? I'll show you how to do
M: it. You ready? Come on. Jump. See? There it is. That's all there
M: is to it. There you go. There you go. Yeah! It's easy! Anybody

M: PAUL
M: Did you have fun last night?
M: SUSAN
M: Sure. Yeah.
M: PAUL
M: Yeah...You left pretty quick.
M: SUSAN
M: I gave him a ride home Paul.
M: PAUL
M: Oh, did he enjoy it?
M: SUSAN
M: Don't be ridiculous.
M: PAUL
M: Ah, that's me, Mr. Ridiculous. Just a silly old guy.
M: SUSAN
M: I don't feel like going out tonight.
M: PAUL
M: What do you mean? They're your friends....Come on! Leave it! Leave
M: it! Would you quit it! Do you have to play with everything?
M: SCENE 50
M: PAUL
M: Baskin? Baskin!
M: JOSH
M: Wouldn't you rather play basketball? I know how to play that. We
M: could be like a team for the Macmillan Company.
M: PAUL
M: No.
M: JOSH
M: I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try. My best sport is
M: video hockey.
M: PAUL
M: That isn't a sport.
M: JOSH
M: Well, it takes eye to hand coordination.
M: PAUL
M: It's not a sport if you don't sweat!
M: JOSH
M: What about golf? You don't sweat and that's a sport.
M: PAUL
M: Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the
M: work!
M: JOSH
M: What about car racing?
M: PAUL
M: Aw shut up Baskin!
M: JOSH

M: PAUL
M: No I didn't.
M: JOSH
M: Yeah you did! You said it had to be over the line on a serve!
M: PAUL

M: SCENE 51
M: JOSH
M: He didn't have to punch me.
M: SUSAN
M: I know. He's scared of you. You don't play his game.
M: JOSH
M: I tried to play his game. He beat me up. If he's scared of me then
M: why did he punch me?
M: SUSAN
M: He punched you because he's scared of you.
M: JOSH
M: I don't get it.
M: SUSAN
M: It's just the way he is. Everything is a fight with him. Everyone's
M: an enemy. It's not just a job for him, it's a war.
M: JOSH
M: Well how come you're so nice?
M: SUSAN
M: What?
M: JOSH
M: Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that.
M: SUSAN
M: You don't...you don't know me that well.
M: JOSH
M: Yes I do. You're one of the nicest people I've met.
M: SUSAN
M: How do you do it?

M: What does it look like?! Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and
M: your exercise tape! Oh, and I want my keys back!
M: PAUL
M: Sure. It's just some scratches. He'll get over it.
M: SUSAN
M: Oh, it has nothing to do with him.
M: PAUL
M: Oh come on Susan! He's just another link in the chain! First it was
M: Tom Caulfield, then Handlen. Then Golding, then me! Am I missing
M: somebody?
M: SUSAN
M: It's not like that anymore!
M: PAUL
M: What is so special about Baskin?
M: SUSAN
M: He's a grown up!
M: PAUL
M: Susan.
M: SUSAN
M: I can't believe you brought up Golding.
M: SCENE 53

M: off!
M: JOSH
M: You don't get it, do you? This is important!
M: BILLY

M: months older than you are--asshole!
M: SCENE 69
M: JOSH
M: You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard. All around you are
M: the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs....Melt wizard....What do you want to
M: melt him with? ...Throw thermal pod.
M: SUSAN
M: Josh, what's wrong? What is it?
M: JOSH
M: I haven't told you something because if I did, I didn't think you'd
M: believe me. And even if you did believe me, I didn't think you were
M: going to like me anymore, so....
M: SUSAN
M: Oh, Honey, come here. You can tell me anything. What?
M: JOSH
M: Susan, I'm not what you think I am.
M: SUSAN
M: What do you mean?
M: JOSH
M: Before I met you I was in little league. I was in little league and I
M: rode my bike to school and I played with my friends and hung out with
M: them and....
M: SUSAN
M: Josh. Josh. What are you talking about?
M: JOSH
M: I want to go home. I miss my family Susan and I want to go home.
M: SUSAN
M: Oh my God! You're married!
M: JOSH
M: No! No!
M: SUSAN
M: I knew that this was too good to be true! I knew that there had to be
M: something!
M: JOSH
M: No. No. Susan, I'm not married.
M: SUSAN
M: You're not?
M: JOSH
M: No. I'm a child!
M: SUSAN
M: What?
M: JOSH
M: I'm a child Susan, and I'm not ready for all this.
M: SUSAN
M: Oh that's fine. That is just great!
M: JOSH
M: Well, you see what happened....
M: SUSAN
M: No. I understand. I'm not ready to make a commitment!
M: JOSH
M: No! No! No!
M: SUSAN
M: I'm not ready to accept responsibility!
M: JOSH
M: No! You don't understand! I mean, I'm thirteen years old!
M: SUSAN
M: Oh! And who isn't? You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside
M: of me, too!
M: JOSH
M: No! I mean I really am thirteen! I went to bed one night and I was a
M: kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up.
M: SUSAN
M: Oh right! And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails! Why
M: are you doing this Josh?
M: JOSH
M: There was this carnival in New Jersey. I made a wish on this machine.
M: It was called a Zoltar Machine...
M: SUSAN
M: Oh stop it!
M: JOSH
M: It was called a Zoltar Machine! It had this bobbing head that looked
M: just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you
M: could make a wish and I did! So I made a wish to be big! That is what
M: I'm trying to tell you! I changed into a grown up but I'm really just
M: a kid!
M: SUSAN
M: Fine Josh! You're a kid! Look, I really don't know what it is that
M: you're trying to tell me. But we have a very big presentation to give
M: tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.
M: SCENE 70
M: BILLY
M: Josh? Josh! Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin.
M: MOM
M: Hi. I was just looking around and...Your hair is getting longer.
M: BILLY
T: I got it cut yesterday.
C: MOM
D: He had a birthday.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, I know. He'll be coming back real soon. Everything is going to be okay.
C: MOM
D: Thanks.
C: BILLY
D: Goodnight.
N: SCENE 71
C: BILLY
D: Right there. Sea Point Park, New York! Well?
C: JOSH
D: Yes?
C: WOMAN
D: They're waiting for you Mr. Baskin.
C: JOSH
D: Thanks.
C: BILLY
D: See you around.
N: SCENE 72
C: JOSH
D: There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.
C: PAUL
D: Excuse me.
C: JOSH
D: Paul.
C: PAUL
D: I don't get it.
C: JOSH
D: Well, it's a comic book that....
C: SUSAN
D: See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. That's the point.
C: MR. M
D: Terrific Susan.
C: SUSAN
D: A kid makes his own decision.
C: MR. M
D: This is really possible?
C: SUSAN
D: Yeah. In fact, it's a very simple program. Isn't that right?
C: MAN
D: So what happens when you run out of choices?
C: SUSAN
D: Well, that's the great thing. You can just sell different adventures. Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.
C: MAN
D: We could market this on a comic book rack.
C: JOSH
D: I'll be right back.
N: SCENE 73
C: MR. M
D: How much would the unit cost?
C: SUSAN
D: Well, our initial figure is around...around $7.00, with a retail cost of around $18.95.
C: PAUL
D: You expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic book?
C: SUSAN
D: I think a kid....Would you excuse me?
N: SCENE 74
C: SUSAN
D: Josh! Josh!
N: SCENE 75
C: JOSH
D: Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?

N: SCENE 76
C: SUSAN
D: Excuse me. You know him? You know Josh?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah.
C: SUSAN
D: Look, you have to tell me where he went.
C: BILLY
D: Who are you?
C: SUSAN
D: I'm his girlfriend.
C: BILLY
D: Billy Kopecky.
C: SUSAN
D: Look, you have to tell me where he went. Where did he go? Please, tell me. Tell me!
N: SCENE 77
C: JOSH
D: Work! Damn it!....I wish I was a kid.
C: SUSAN
D: Josh!
C: JOSH
D: Susan!
C: SUSAN
D: You know, you don't walk out on somebody! You don't just get up and leave and walk out like that! You don't do that!
C: JOSH
D: I know. I know. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry but I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to say.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh God. You got your wish.
C: JOSH
D: I tried to tell you.
C: SUSAN
D: I didn't listen, I guess. I didn't hear you...
C: JOSH
D: I tried to tell you last night.
C: SUSAN
D: ...or want to...or how would I have...or even if I did listen, why would I know? Why would I know that?!
C: JOSH
D: I've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to stay.
C: SUSAN
D: What? What reason is that?
C: JOSH
D: Well, you...Oh, come on. Don't cry.
C: SUSAN
D: So, what are you? 15? 16?
C: JOSH
D: I'm 13.
C: SUSAN
D: Well, that explains it.
C: JOSH
D: Maybe you could come with me.
C: SUSAN
D: No. No.
C: JOSH
D: Why not?
C: SUSAN
D: I've been there before. It's hard enough the first time. You know what I mean? You don't know what I mean....Come on, I'll drive you home.
C: JOSH
D: I'm sorry.
C: SUSAN
D: No, I'll be okay. You'll be fine. In ten years, who knows? Maybe you should hold on to my number.
N: SCENE 78
C: SUSAN
D: So this is where you live. Which one is it?
C: JOSH
D: The one right there.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh. It's nice. I'm gonna miss you.
C: JOSH
D: I'm gonna miss you, too.
C: SUSAN
D: You won't even remember me.
C: JOSH
D: Oh yes I will.
N: SCENE 79
C: JOSH
D: Mom? Hello!
C: MOM
D: Josh? Josh! Josh! Oh my God! Oh, thank God you're home!
C: JOSH
D: Oh Ma, I missed you all so much!
N: SCENE 80
C: JOSH
D: I'm just not good enough.
C: BILLY
D: What are you talking about? You've been hitting the ball over the fence almost every time in stick ball. You just got to get used to a fatter bat.
C: JOSH
D: You really think I could do it?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah!
C: JOSH
D: Come on. We'll hit some after supper.
C: BILLY
N: Okay. I'll call you.
