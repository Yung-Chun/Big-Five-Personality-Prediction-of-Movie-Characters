S: EXT. TILBURY DOCKS. DAY.
N: Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption: "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space, which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
T: Then, FADE UP ON:
N: Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:
C: COMMENTATOR
D: "Returning to England are Britain's acting royalty Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier, better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none other than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe. When the world's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive, we can be sure that sparks will fly. Now, now Lady Olivier, don't worry - any romance is strictly for the camera!" As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -

S: EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DAY.
N: It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home, complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something profoundly English. We are a very long way from Hollywood.

S: EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY.
N: COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak doors. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2.
S: 3A INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY STAIRS. DAY. 3A
N: COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library.
S: 3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B
N: As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter, Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the painting.
C: KENNETH
D: ... and this is one of Carracci's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style, which is clearly rooted in the tradition of high renaissance and antiquity... COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams affectionately.
C: KENNETH
D: Colin! Come in. Have you met James and Anna? Two very brilliant pupils. He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no time to waste.
C: COLIN
D: I'm leaving for London now, Pa.
C: KENNETH
D: Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear boy... He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to walk him back to the door.
C: KENNETH
D: I can always get you a research position at the V&A when you've grown up a bit and got this film idea out of your system... COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.
C: JANE
D: Kenneth, you might have told Cook we were another two for dinner. What is everyone supposed to eat? Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling, there you are...
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A. She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress, eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a dozen things at once.
C: COLIN
D: I'm off now, Mama.
C: JANE
D: Off?
C: COLIN
D: My job interview, remember..? But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

S: 3C INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3C
N: JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.
C: JANE
D: Can't you stay for dinner? There's nothing to eat but I'm sure the conversation will be charming.
C: COLIN
D: I don't want to be late in the morning. As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.
C: JANE
D: I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be a famous film director in no time. I know your father's put in a word.
C: COLIN
D: I wish he hadn't done that. I can manage on my own. She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks around the garden with a frown.
C: JANE
D: I have to watch Jenkins like a hawk. One more of his murderous prunings and we'll lose the tea roses for ever. And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't help smiling at the madness of it all.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2B.
S: EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DRIVEWAY. DAY.
N: The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle. COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her attention fully to him for the first time.
C: JANE
D: Now go and have a lovely time, darling. We're always here when you're ready to talk your future. COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.
C: JANE
D: Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight. Then bring the car round. I must get to the village before the shop shuts... She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes. COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house. We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly his need to get away. He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun, the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for the road ahead.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3.
S: EXT. LONDON STREETS MONTAGE. EVENING
N: CUT TO CREDITS OVER A MONTAGE OF SCENES OF LONDON IN THE 1950s FROM COLIN'S POINT OF VIEW. AS HE MAKES HIS WAY INTO THE CITY WE SEE THE STATUE OF EROS AGAINST THE LIGHTS OF PICCADILLY CIRCUS, CROWDS MILLING AROUND TRAFALGAR SQUARE, YOUNG PEOPLE SPILLING OUT OF CLUBS AND COFFEE BARS IN
T: SOHO, UNTIL, WE FADE TO:
S: EXT. PICCADILLY STREETS. DAY.
N: A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside. It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and raincoats stream from the tube stations. COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave. COLIN waves back.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY.
N: Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS. Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and rings the bell.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 4.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY.
N: The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and plush sofas. VANESSA, the beautiful secretary, sits behind her imposing desk, gazing doubtfully at COLIN.
C: VANESSA
D: You're not in Mr. Perceval's diary.
C: COLIN
D: Larry told me to come. She pauses dubiously, then reaches for her telephone. We hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice carrying irritably.
N: PERCEVAL (OFF) Yes?
C: VANESSA
D: I have a Mr. Colin Clark here. He says Sir Laurence sent him. She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's familiarity.
N: PERCEVAL (OFF) Oh, God... not another one of Vivien's pretty boys. VANESSA looks at COLIN with amusement. His smile falters as he feels himself coming down to earth with a bump.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: HUGH PERCEVAL (40s) is Laurence Olivier's production executive. He is tall and gloomy, with black-rimmed spectacles and thinning dark hair. He looks at COLIN grimly as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Well, what do you want?
C: COLIN
D: A job on your Marilyn Monroe film.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 5.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Oh really, what as?
C: COLIN
D: I want to work on the production side. He smiles with as much charm as he can muster. PERCEVAL isn't impressed.
C: PERCEVAL
D: There are no jobs yet. We don't start shooting for eight weeks.
C: COLIN
D: May I wait?
C: PERCEVAL
D: What?
C: COLIN
D: Until there's a job.
C: PERCEVAL
D: For eight weeks?
C: COLIN
D: Something might come up. PERCEVAL is distracted as the telephone rings.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Terry? Larry wondered how the script was coming...

S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. (MONTAGE)
N: COLIN troops back to the sofa. VANESSA gives him a cool glance. COLIN looks at the clock. It has just gone 10.30. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 6. We see the day pass as COLIN sits on the sofa - the clock ticking slowly on the wall, VANESSA busy at her desk, COLIN looking up hopefully from time to time, only to be disappointed.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. (MONTAGE)
N: It is now nearly 6 o'clock. COLIN sits exactly as he was. PERCEVAL shares a look with VANESSA as he comes out of his office. He gazes drily at Colin.
C: PERCEVAL
D: There are no jobs.
C: COLIN
D: I'll come back tomorrow morning. Just in case.
C: PERCEVAL
D: It's a free country. He sounds as though he rather regrets it.
S: 11A EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY. (MONTAGE) 11A
N: COLIN arrives early, ready for another day.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. (MONTAGE)
N: COLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning. PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her eye optimistically but she ignores him.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY.
N: The clock ticks around with agonising slowness to 11.00. VANESSA finally gives Colin a pitying look.
C: VANESSA
D: Are you going to sit there all day?
C: COLIN
D: If I have to.
C: VANESSA
D: You're very determined.
C: COLIN
D: I'd do anything to be in the film business.
C: VANESSA
D: Anything?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 7. She smiles cheekily. He grins back, sensing an opportunity.
C: VANESSA
D: You can start by making me a cup of tea. White, two sugars.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY.
N: Close on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to 12.30. VANESSA puts on her gloves and collects her bag. She gives COLIN a sly look.
C: VANESSA
D: You can answer the telephone while I'm at lunch, if you like. She winks. COLIN grins. The phone rings. He picks it up.
C: COLIN
D: Laurence Olivier Productions...
N: CALLER (ON PHONE) Is Sir Laurence there?
C: COLIN
D: He's at Notley until the end of the week. Can I take a message?
N: CALLER (ON PHONE) I'll call back. No sooner has COLIN hung up than PERCEVAL appears. He stares at COLIN.
C: COLIN
D: Vanessa asked me to...
C: PERCEVAL
D: Oh, did she? Why didn't you put that call through?
C: COLIN
D: There didn't seem any need to bother you. But if you want me to transfer every single one... PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Use your judgement. He hesitates and looks back.
C: PERCEVAL
D: I need a number for Noel Coward. It won't be in the book, so you'll have to track him down. COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8A.
S: INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. HALL. DAY.
N: The phone rings in the beautiful central hall. JANE CLARK picks up the phone. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9. COLIN (ON PHONE) Hello, Mama.
C: JANE
D: Colin, darling! How are you getting on?
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. COLIN glances towards Perceval's office and talks quickly. COLIN (ON PHONE) This is urgent. I need Noel Coward's London number. My life depends on it.
C: JANE
D: How exciting. Let me see... it's Sloane 2965. Ask him if he's coming to Saltwood for the bank holiday.
C: COLIN
D: I will. Mama, you're an angel.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: PERCEVAL looks up as COLIN puts the number on his desk.
C: PERCEVAL
D: That was quick.
C: COLIN
D: I had a bit of luck. PERCEVAL looks at him shrewdly.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Am I supposed to be impressed? Did Mummy and Daddy help? Don't think they can do the job for you. The only way you'll get on in this business is through bloody hard work.
C: COLIN
D: Yes, sir. COLIN leaves.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9A.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY.
N: A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa. Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything changes. He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on his arm. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10. At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating. Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone who comes into contact with them. VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable bluster and bonhomie.
C: OLIVIER
D: Do you know, Hughie, it is simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on the telephone? The darling girl spends the entire day asleep. But great beauty has its way... He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices COLIN hovering by the sofa.
C: OLIVIER
D: Hello, boy... remind me? He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.
E: CONT'D
C: VIVIEN
D: You remember Colin, darling. You met him at the Clarks' party.
N: OLIVIER (NO IDEA) Of course. What are you doing here?
C: COLIN
D: You said there might be a job on your film. OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.
C: OLIVIER
D: Have a cigarette. Keep the pack. He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 11.
C: OLIVIER
D: There won't be any film unless Miss Monroe gets her splendid posterior out of bed.
E: CONT'D
C: PERCEVAL
D: The House Committee are threatening to withhold Miller's passport. They say he's a communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.
C: OLIVIER
D: I'll have a word with the American ambassador. I'm taking him to see Vivien in South Sea Bubble on Thursday... now, tell me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites in? He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they disappear together into Perceval's office. VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in amusement.
C: VIVIEN
D: They named them after Larry. The first actor since Du Maurier to have his own brand and they pay him an absolute fortune. I'm afraid they're rather ghastly. She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in mock awe.
E: Pause
C: VIVIEN
D: Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?
E: CONT'D
C: VANESSA
D: I suppose he's all right. VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly, getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12. VIVIEN (TO COLIN) Let's elope together and have the most glorious affair. (Arch) Oh, but then, who'd look after my poor Larry? Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation. VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.
C: VIVIEN
D: Now, darling, you must do something for Colin. You absolutely promised. OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back at PERCEVAL as he comes in.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIER
D: Let's try to find him something to do, Hughie. COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.
C: VIVIEN
D: You will take care of my precious Larrykins, won't you? She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss. COLIN's smile falters as he sees PERCEVAL looking at him grimly.
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: COLIN stands eagerly at PERCEVAL's desk. PERCEVAL looks at him, more than usually brusque.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Arthur Jacobs, Miss Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable.
S: 20 ALT INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY. ALT
N: COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold- up screen in the corner of the room. Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice of Colin. He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up, hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in character as Elsie Marina. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A. The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon. It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches, fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still holding the tray - PERCEVAL (TO CARDIFF) Larry says he particularly likes this dress. She looks radiant.
C: CARDIFF
D: Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit.
C: PERCEVAL
D: How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe?! COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at him stonily.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Marilyn Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable. COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the door when PERCEVAL barks at him again.
C: PERCEVAL
D: And leave the bloody tea. COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it down and hurries out.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
N: COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his foot.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13.
S: EXT. TIBBS FARM. DRIVE. DAY.
N: COLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming English cottage.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY.
N: COTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front door, looking down his nose at COLIN.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: Out of the question. I can't have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots.
C: COLIN
D: We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: My wife would never agree.
C: COLIN
D: That's a pity. I'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then. COTES-PREEDY double takes.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: Marilyn Monroe?
N: COLIN (NODS) She's making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping Prince. From the play by Terence Rattigan.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: I saw it in the West End a couple of years ago. Vivien Leigh was marvellous.
C: COLIN
D: It's Marilyn Monroe in the film. COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: I suppose I'd have to be introduced..?
E: After a second
T: CUT TO:
N: DELETED
S: EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY.
N: ARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped, pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly.
C: COLIN
D: Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope you had a pleasant flight.
C: JACOBS
D: Where's the fucking car?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY.
N: JACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he grunts in disgust.
C: JACOBS
D: Jeez, do you Brits actually read this stuff? He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows and on neat front lawns. COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY.
N: JACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the property.
C: JACOBS
D: What is this place? A brothel? COTES-PREEDY's face falls.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14A.
C: COTES-PREEDY
D: It's one of the best houses in the area.
C: JACOBS
D: Jesus. And I thought you Brits had taste.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 15. He glances at COLIN.
C: JACOBS
D: Is this the best you can do?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: It's very near Pinewood.
C: JACOBS
D: All right. We'll take it. But ditch the wallpaper. It's given me a migraine.
E: Pause
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: JACOBS slaps down a copy of the Evening Standard on the desk. The front page carries a picture of Tibbs Farm with the caption: "Exclusive - Marilyn's Luxury Home In England". He jabs a finger at it angrily.
C: OLIVIER
D: News travels fast.
C: JACOBS
D: That house was perfect for Marilyn.
C: PERCEVAL
D: We can't use it now.
C: COLIN
D: Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy wouldn't be able to keep this quiet. They stare to him in surprise. He looks at them boldly.
C: COLIN
D: When you asked me to find a house for Miss Monroe I took the precaution of finding two. The other one, Parkside, is much better and the owner is very discreet.
C: PERCEVAL
D: But now we have two expensive houses when we only wanted one.
C: COLIN
D: I thought someone else on the production might want it.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Oh, did you? There is a dangerous moment when things could go either way. COLIN has gambled everything in a bid to impress them.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 16. He waits in tense silence, staring at their puzzled expressions. But then JACOBS shrugs.
C: JACOBS
D: I guess Milton could use it. It's near the studio, near Marilyn. OLIVIER looks at COLIN, then bursts out laughing.
C: OLIVIER
D: What are we paying you, boy? He glances at COLIN with amusement.
C: COLIN
D: Nothing...
N: OLIVIER (LAUGHING) See to it, Hughie! PERCEVAL sighs grimly.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY.
N: Pinewood studios is the glamorous heart of the British film industry. COLIN drives up to the gate and smiles at the SECURITY MAN.
C: COLIN
D: Colin Clark. Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT/INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY.
N: ACTORS in full costume walk past, TECHNICIANS move lights and cameras, EXTRAS are herded to their scenes by harried ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. COLIN takes it all in with wondering eyes. To him the studio is a magical place.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DRESSING ROOMS. DAY.
N: The dressing rooms are little more than empty shells. JACOBS looks around. OLIVIER and PERCEVAL are with him, while COLIN waits attentively.
C: PERCEVAL
D: The set decorators will have it all sorted out in no time.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 16A.
C: JACOBS
D: Marilyn hates red. And blue. And green.
E: Pause
C: PERCEVAL
D: What about white?
C: JACOBS
D: I'd have to clear it with her. OLIVIER glances mischievously at Colin.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 17.
C: OLIVIER
D: Beige, then. Beige is rarely controversial. JACOBS considers this, unaware that Olivier is teasing him.
C: JACOBS
D: I guess that's okay. She's never said nothing about beige. Paula will need the room next door.
C: COLIN
D: Paula?
C: JACOBS
D: Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach. OLIVIER looks at him darkly. JACOBS shrugs.
C: JACOBS
D: She's nuts about the Method.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIER
D: Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they don't belong on a film set. Time is too tight. I'm sure Marilyn understands. He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly.
C: JACOBS
D: Who the hell is this Commie Stan Slavski?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY.
N: COLIN stands in the Production Office. DAVID ORTON (30s) the First Assistant Director, a thin, fair-haired man regards him with obvious irritation.
C: ORTON
D: I don't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here. There's nothing I can do for you.
C: COLIN
D: Why not?
C: ORTON
D: Are you in the union?
C: COLIN
D: No...
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18.
C: ORTON
D: Then you can't have a job on the film.
C: COLIN
D: How do I get in the union?
C: ORTON
D: By getting a job on the film.
C: COLIN
D: But you just said I couldn't have a job on the film unless I was in the union.
C: ORTON
D: Exactly. It's called a closed shop. COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little.
C: ORTON
D: I suppose I might be able to sort something out. The Union owes me a few favours. We haven't got a third yet.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: A third?
C: ORTON
D: Third Assistant Director. You do know what the job is?
E: Pause
C: COLIN
D: Assisting the director?
C: ORTON
D: Christ, no! That's the last thing you do. Lesson One. The third's job is to do whatever the fuck I tell him. ORTON walks to the door, then looks back.
N: ORTON (CONT'D) (SHOUTS) What are you waiting for? COLIN scrambles to follow him out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY.
N: As ORTON and COLIN pass the wardrobe department COLIN notices a pretty WARDROBE GIRL (LUCY) putting costumes on the racks. She has dark hair and laughing eyes and is a year or so younger than him. ORTON follows his gaze. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18A.
C: ORTON
D: Colin! COLIN jumps as ORTON glowers at him.
C: ORTON
D: Lesson Two. You don't shit on your own doorstep. Got it?
E: CONT'D

N: ORTON and COLIN hurry through Pinewood.
C: ORTON
D: Where are you staying?
C: COLIN
D: My father's place in the Albany.
C: ORTON
D: You can forget that. Lesson Three. The Third always stays nearby, not in some bloody palace in London. Book a room at the Dog And Duck down the road. It's a bit rough but you'll get used to it. He grins, enjoying himself.
E: Pause
C: ORTON
D: Now make yourself useful. Marilyn needs a bodyguard. Sort something out.

N: PERCEVAL sits with COLIN and ROGER SMITH. SMITH is a dignified figure in his mid-fifties. His erect bearing speaks of a lifetime in the police.
C: PERCEVAL
D: I'm sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job, Superintendant?
C: ROGER
D: No need for the title. I'm retired from the force. Something about looking after a cinema actress?
E: Pause
C: PERCEVAL
D: Not just any actress. Marilyn Monroe. He gets no reaction from the stolid ex-policeman.
C: ROGER
D: I've never had much time for the pictures.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 20.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Excellent. For the next four months you never leave her side, day or night. There will be crowds.
E: Pause
C: ROGER
D: That doesn't bother me. PERCEVAL pauses awkwardly.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Her behaviour is reputedly a little... erratic.
C: ROGER
D: She drinks?
C: PERCEVAL
D: Amongst other things.
C: ROGER
D: Pills? PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause.
C: PERCEVAL
D: It would be useful if you could keep us informed of her... domestic situation.
C: ROGER
D: You want me to spy on her? Perceval and Roger understand each other perfectly.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Just the odd early warning if you know she's going to be late on set. That kind of thing. Smith takes this in his stride; he seems wholly immune to the glamour of the movies.

N: JACOBS chases after OLIVIER trying to get his attention. OLIVIER is busy studying preliminary sketches of costumes and set.
C: JACOBS
D: You need to speak to the Coca-Cola people, Larry. They're crazy to be involved with Marilyn. PERCEVAL and COLIN meet them coming the other way.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 20A.
C: PERCEVAL
D: Good news. The House Committee have decided Miller isn't a communist after all.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 21.
C: JACOBS
D: Of course he is. All those pain in the ass New York intellectuals are reds. OLIVIER rolls his eyes behind JACOBS back. COLIN grins.
C: PERCEVAL
D: It means Marilyn will be flying in next week on schedule.
C: JACOBS
D: She'll have to be met.
C: OLIVIER
D: Naturally, Vivien and I will be there to greet her. But let's keep it low key, shall we?

D: Don't worry. I've got it all under control.

S: INT. LONDON AIRPORT. HALL. DAY.
N: Bedlam! The customs areas is besieged by shouting, pushing JOURNALISTS as the POLICE fight to keep control. In the middle of the chaos COLIN stands with ROGER SMITH watching OLIVIER and VIVIEN addressing the gathered press.
C: OLIVIER
D: It is a deep happiness to me to be translating Terence Rattigan's magnificent play to the screen... A voice suddenly rings out from the back of the previously attentive crowd.
C: REPORTER
D: The plane's landed! As one, the entire crowd turns away from Olivier and rushes towards the plane. Suddenly abandoned, OLIVIER and VIVIEN look momentarily startled before VIVIEN glances at him with a half-smile.

S: EXT. LONDON AIRPORT. TARMAC. DAY.
N: MARILYN and MILLER walks across the tarmac towards the terminal and the crowd of PRESS waiting for them.
C: REPORTER
D: There she is! Marilyn! The REPORTERS surge forward. COLIN follows their collective gaze. She looks exactly as she should. The radiant smile, the platinum blonde hair, the sexy wiggle. The most famous film star in the world, so much herself it is almost unreal. Walking through the crowd MARILYN smiles easily, whereas MILLER looks stern and a little dazed by the sudden flurry of attention. Flashbulbs pop as the POLICE struggle to contain the crowd. MARILYN puts her arm around MILLER, who grins blankly. The flashbulbs burst in front of them, a solid wall of dazzling light.
C: REPORTER
D: Marilyn! Over here, Marilyn!
E: CONT'D
N: REPORTER 2 Marilyn, this way..! ARTHUR JACOBS observes the chaotic scenes with obvious relish, grinning towards ROGER and COLIN.
C: JACOBS
D: Beautiful. You're looking at tomorrow's front page, boys. ROGER looks at COLIN.
C: ROGER
D: We have to get them to the hall. COLIN barges his way through the scrum behind ROGER and briefly finds himself directly in front of MARILYN. For a moment he is transfixed by her beauty and charisma but she doesn't even see him as she follows the commanding ROGER obediently, tugging Miller along behind her, leaving Colin in her wake.

D: It's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction.

D: How do you like being married, Marilyn?
C: MARILYN
D: I like it a lot.
C: REPORTER
D: Is this third time lucky?
C: MARILYN
D: You bet it is. Arthur's the greatest man I ever met. OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN takes off her sunglasses and blinks. She takes MILLER's arm and looks at him adoringly. He bites down savagely on his unlit pipe.
C: REPORTER
D: Marilyn, are you planning to see the sights?
C: MARILYN
D: I'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus. There is a appreciative laughter from reporters.
N: REPORTER 2 Is it true you want to be a classical actor now?
C: MARILYN
D: I want to be the best actress I can be.
N: REPORTER 2 There's a rumour you're going to be in The Brothers Karamazov on Broadway.
C: MARILYN
D: I'm considering it.
N: REPORTER 3 (SHOUTS) Which of them will you be playing? The agenda is clear - Marilyn is the dumb blonde and should act accordingly. But she takes it in her stride, smiling sweetly.
C: MARILYN
D: I'll be playing Grushenka.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 24. REPORTER 3 Can you spell that?
C: MARILYN
D: Sure. Can you? There is laughter at the reporter's expense.
C: REPORTER
D: So would you say you're an intellectual now?
C: MARILYN
D: My husband is. She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely.
N: REPORTER 2 What's your definition of an intellectual, Marilyn?
C: MARILYN
D: I guess you could look it up in a dictionary. This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side. One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN.
C: REPORTER
D: Vivien, you created the part of Elsie Marina on stage. Do you have any advice for Marilyn?
C: VIVIEN
D: I am sure if Miss Monroe needs any advice she'll get it from her director. I hear he's terribly good. The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously. But as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of jealous hurt in her eyes. OLIVIER intervenes quickly to continue his prepared speech of welcome.
C: OLIVIER
D: In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe's luminous and justly celebrated talent... He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him.

D: Marilyn, is it true you wear nothing in bed except Chanel No

C: MARILYN

S: EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. DAY.
N: Outside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER. ROGER watches unobtrusively.
C: VIVIEN
D: Are all your press conferences like that, darling?
C: MARILYN
D: Well, that was quieter than some. Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the proceedings with an eagle eye.
C: JACOBS
D: Okay, let's get a snap of the newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad. As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark- haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN.
C: MILTON
D: This is some place you found. He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.
C: OLIVIER
D: You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that. This is Milton Greene. You must be very nice to him. He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions.
E: Pause, he shepherds COLIN over
C: MILTON
D: Forty nine per cent, Larry. GREENE offers them a tired smile. OLIVIER produces one of his branded packets and offers a cigarette to Milton.

N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25A.
C: OLIVIER
D: Have a cigarette.
C: MILTON
D: I don't smoke. If he notices the "Olivier" name he doesn't show it. OLIVIER looks mildly put out.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 26.
C: OLIVIER
D: Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals. Let's talk.
C: MILTON
D: Sure. And the studio wants a new title. OLIVIER escorts Milton away. MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own. ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his ear. JACOBS nods and moves in to end the session.
C: JACOBS
D: The boys at the gate are getting restless.

N: COLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the flashbulbs pop all around her. A moment later he is surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow.
C: VIVIEN
D: Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose you're quite smitten. COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested.
C: COLIN
D: She's all right. A bit common.
N: VIVIEN (LAUGHS) Larry fell desperately in love with her in New York. He's determined to seduce her.
C: COLIN
D: But she's only been married three weeks.
C: VIVIEN
D: Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man of the world. She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27. VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) Of course, Larry would never leave me. (Pause) But, if anything were to happen, you would let me know, wouldn't you?
C: COLIN
D: I'm sure he loves you very much. There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.
C: VIVIEN
D: Oh, don't be such a boy! COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.
C: VIVIEN
D: At least you still adore me, don't you?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Of course. Everyone does. There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.

D: I'm 43, darling. No one will love me for much longer. Not even you. He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his lips, her smile quickly restored.

N: A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar. One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.
C: COLIN
D: Colin Clark. I booked a room. BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it around for COLIN to sign.
C: BARRY
D: What brings you up this way?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27A. COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.
C: COLIN
D: I'm here working on a film. The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.
C: BARRY
D: What film's that?
C: COLIN
D: It's called `The Sleeping Prince'. The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains steady.
C: ANDY
D: Sounds lousy.
C: BARRY
D: Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are you, Andy? ANDY doesn't look away from his game.
C: ANDY
D: Can't be bothered. COLIN tries to impress.
C: COLIN
D: Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be working with her.
C: BARRY
D: Oh, will you now? The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't look away from his game, as he offers laconically:
C: ANDY
D: The Queen and Prince Philip popped in for a pint earlier. Pity, you just missed them. There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS. COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.
C: BARRY
D: The room's three quid a week, first week in advance. You're in number two. COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with perfect deadpan timing:
C: BARRY
D: You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly. The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely.

S: INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY.
N: COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp. Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

N: The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied. DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully. RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.
C: WATTIS

D: He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.
C: PAULA

D: Marilyn, here you are, everyone is so excited to meet you... He gestures to the company.

D: Let us begin. Do sit down, please... SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the table and indicates the empty one at her side.
E: CONT'D
C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: How lovely you are. Here, I kept a place for you. PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to the empty one.
C: PAULA
D: I have to be next to Marilyn! The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way around the table to the seat next to SYBIL THORNDIKE.
N: SYBIL THORNDIKE (TO MARILYN) Don't worry, dear, we won't bite. PAULA looks at her in truculent apology.
C: PAULA
D: She likes me by her side.
C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: What a good idea! I wish we could all bring a friend. One does get so terribly nervous. It's just like the first day at school, isn't it?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30. She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as he makes his opening speech of welcome.
C: OLIVIER
D: Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity. We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness. Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned but clumsy joke. Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a sentimental flourish.
E: Pause, looks around
C: OLIVIER
D: So. My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together. With boldness and good fortune, may we strive to create a work of art that, led by your good graces, will be cherished as long as motion pictures may be remembered. He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK. There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the reading.

E: AS ELSIE
C: OLIVIER
D: "oh but of course I meant you. I had your name most carefully marked down on my programme. In matters of this kind I assure you I am most methodical. Who did you think I meant if not you?" MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.
E: AS REGENT
C: MARILYN
D: Gee, Mister Sir, I could listen to your accent all day. There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles kindly.

D: Remember why you're in the embassy, Marilyn. What does the Grand Duke want from Elsie? She thought there were going to be a lot of people here and it's just her. OLIVIER waits patiently.

N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 32. OLIVIER tries to continue but is yet again brought up short by PAULA's passionate whispering.
C: PAULA
D: Locate the experience, Marilyn. Look for the memory that helps you. Remember when you went to that party at Chaplin's house and you were the only guest? How did that make you feel? This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA.

C: PAULA
D: Marilyn has to begin finding the character.

C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: Aren't we going to have fun?

C: OLIVIER
D: We can't have two fucking directors!
C: MILTON
D: Marilyn wants Paula.
C: OLIVIER
D: Why? She's got me!

D: She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours. It's simply not fair. The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware of the scrutiny of the crew. She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her face. She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her dressing room. OLIVIER stares after her in shock.

D: That chair is a prop. Props are NATTKE. If ACT members are going to do NATTKE jobs, I'm calling my men out. Every eye is suddenly on Colin. Taking his shock for stubbornness TREVOR turns to the set and bellows.
C: TREVOR
D: Strike meeting! Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in horror. SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns in reproach.
E: CONT'D
C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: I'm sure we're all good union members here. There's no need to fall out over something so trivial.
C: TREVOR
D: It might be trivial to you, Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood. He's not in the union. Put the chair down. COLIN stares at him, frozen.
E: Pause, to Colin
C: TREVOR
D: Put the chair down now! COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the stage. SYBIL THORNDIKE bears down on TREVOR majestically.
E: CONT'D
C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: I rather think you've made your point. Solidarity is the important thing here. When unions fall out, it's only management that benefits. TREVOR pauses, not at all sure about this, but then shrugs magnanimously.
N: TREVOR (TO COLIN) If I see you doing a NATTKE job again I'll close this set down quicker than you can blink. He turns to one of his men.
C: TREVOR
D: Dave, Dame Sybil needs a chair.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 37A. DAVE picks up the same chair, moves it approximately six inches and places it behind SYBIL THORNDIKE, who finally sits down, her sunny good humour instantly restored.

D: I was on the picket lines in 1926, you know.
N: (MORE) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 38. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) Now that was a strike. We were all Bolsheviks then! She smiles nostalgically as ORTON appears to hustle COLIN away, muttering furiously.

N: MARILYN is at last on set and ready to shoot. SYBIL THORNDIKE, as the Queen Dowager, waits behind a door. OLIVIER is in front of the camera with MARILYN, who flutters her hands nervously in an odd calming gesture. PAULA mutters a last few words in her ear, reading her lines to her from her small brown notebook. COLIN watches intently. A bell rings and the red light goes on. The camera operator, DENYS, rolls the camera.

D: That was perfect, Marilyn. You're Elsie to the life! MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but SYBIL carries on with complete conviction. SYBIL THORNDIKE Perhaps we could practise our lines together later? You'd be doing me such a kindness. At my great age it's just so hard to make them stick! Why don't you come for tea tomorrow?

C: MARILYN
D: I just can't figure this movie out.
C: PAULA
D: You were wonderful. You are the most gifted actress I have ever known. You were superb, Marilyn. You were divine.
C: MARILYN
D: He was angry with me, I could tell.
C: PAULA
D: You were great. You are a great, great actress. All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide. She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his path blocked.
C: PAULA
D: Like this. I prayed to God on my knees. And he has given me you. You are that great actress, Marilyn.
E: CONT'D

N: The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant. Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them both a glass.
C: LUCY
D: Are you sure you can afford all this?
C: COLIN
D: Oh, it's all right.
C: LUCY
D: It must be costing a week's wages.
C: COLIN
D: It's worth it. LUCY can't help being charmed.
C: LUCY
D: You're not the average third, are you? Most of them would be happy with a swift half and a grope in the pub car park.
C: COLIN
D: I'm not living off my parents, if that's what you mean. I want to make my own way, no matter what.
C: LUCY
D: By making eyes at Vivien Leigh?
C: COLIN
D: Who told you that?
C: LUCY
D: Word gets around.
C: COLIN
D: Vivien's a friend of my father's.
C: LUCY
D: So there's nothing in it? You and Vivien? He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids him coolly.

C: COLIN
D: I was always going to pay, you know.
C: LUCY
D: Of course you were. He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile and he is grateful.
C: LUCY
D: Do you think Marilyn is beautiful?
C: COLIN
D: Not compared to you. LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.
C: LUCY
D: You don't have to try so hard to be charming. You're nice enough as it is. Well, you could be.

D: You know Marilyn's really still in love with Joe DiMaggio?
E: CONT'D

D: So they say.
C: LUCY
D: She married Miller on the rebound. The papers are calling them "The Hourglass and the Egghead".

D: That's my dad. She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR. ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas. He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at his daughter.
E: CONT'D
C: MR. ARMSTRONG
D: Time to be thinking about bed, darling. Early start tomorrow.

D: Marilyn, darling you are an angel, and I kiss the hem of your garment, but why can't you get here on time for the love of fuck?
C: MARILYN
D: Oh... you have that word in England too? She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence.
C: PAULA
D: Marilyn has to prepare properly. She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface. Acting isn't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose. OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's hand, leading her forward like a child.

S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY.
N: OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is an effective but theatrical performance. MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back row watching her performance from the same scene. She fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses, looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and reassurance.
C: MILLER
D: That one's pretty damn good. You knocked it out of the park. MARILYN glows at his praise.
C: MILTON
D: When Marilyn gets it right you just don't want to look at anyone else. OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his heart. At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on screen he begins to see things differently.

D: Why not only show her the good takes? Then she might feel better about herself. He looks self-conscious as they both turn to stare at him.
C: MILTON
D: The kid's right. She could use the confidence.
C: OLIVIER
D: I believe it's traditional for the producer of the film to watch rushes. Besides, she's an experienced actress. She should learn from her mistakes.

There are pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open door into the inner chamber. And stops dead in his tracks. MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head. She is completely naked. She looks at him in astonishment. He stares back, equally astounded. He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes, lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and a bottle of pills.

D: Your script...

D: I found it. Calmly she takes the towel from her hair and wraps it around herself. She smiles quizzically.

SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand. She glances at MILTON with an awkward laugh. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 52.

D: No one's recognised her.
C: COLIN
D: At least she can shop in peace.
C: MILTON
D: Marilyn's a star. Stars don't even pee alone. He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights up and he shouts -
C: PASSER-BY
D: It's Marilyn Monroe! MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come running to look, pushing and shoving to see. MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face. A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on her face.
C: ROGER
D: My God, she'll be torn apart...
C: MILLER
D: Get her out of here. COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what they can to keep the excited fans at bay. They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive in beside Marilyn. People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in violent hysteria. MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53.

D: Marilyn needs time to give a great performance. You should give her as long as it takes. Chaplin took eight months to make a movie.
C: OLIVIER
D: Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself. Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on . PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN looks up at her in anguish.

E: CONT'D

D: (Under his breath to
C: COLIN)
D: God knows, but I'm a weeping fucking willow.
N: PAULA (TO MARILYN) Think about the things you like, instead of him. Frank Sinatra. Coca Cola. Be specific. The character comes alive if you know what you're doing. MARILYN listens intently, a frown flitting across her face. She goes back to her mark. The whole crew is on tenterhooks. Camera running, speed, mark it... Action! Take four. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 56.
C: MARILYN
D: "Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?"
E: AS ELSIE

N: DELETED
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: The clapperboard snaps one final time. Take twenty three. MARILYN's smile is a grimace of terror. COLIN can hardly bear to look. Everyone holds their breath.
C: MARILYN
D: "Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right too, isn't it?" There is a stunned moment. WATTIS gapes and MARILYN looks around uncertainly. Did she say it? OLIVIER gestures frantically from behind the camera that she should carry on. She hesitates... ... there is an agonising beat... ... and then she panics and bolts for the side of the set.
E: AS ELSIE Pause
C: MARILYN
D: Paula!
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIER
D: Cut. What's the matter now? He takes her arm and whisks her away to the side of the set, lowering his voice, trying to conceal his exasperation with a honeyed tone.
C: OLIVIER
D: Forgive me, Marilyn. This is my failure, not yours. Tell me how I can help you.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: I don't know who Elsie is. I can't act her if I don't know who she is!
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 57.
C: OLIVIER
D: Elsie is all in the script
C: MARILYN
D: I can't find her. She's not there.
C: OLIVIER
D: But you have her precisely, you know her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift. We all are.
C: MARILYN
D: She's not real.
C: OLIVIER
D: Why not simply rely on your natural talents?
C: MARILYN
D: Are you saying I don't need to act? OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in genuine anguish.
C: OLIVIER
D: Marilyn, you are the most attractive woman in the world. I'm simply suggesting you be yourself.
N: MARILYN (SHOUTS) I don't want to be myself! (Pause) I want to be an actress playing a character.
C: OLIVIER
D: All you have to do, dear Marilyn, is be sexy. Isn't that what you do? MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through the set. COLIN watches in dismay.
E: Trying to be helpful
C: MARILYN
D: I want Lee.
C: OLIVIER
D: You've already got Paula, for heaven's sake. I'm the director. Speak to me.
C: PAULA
D: I am only Lee's representative.
C: OLIVIER
D: It's five in the morning in New York.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 57A. MARILYN I WANT LEE! MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 58. Her furious scream brings all activity to a halt. She storms off the set with PAULA following. The atmosphere is awful.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING ROOM.
C: DAY.
D: OLIVIER sits brooding savagely in front of his make-up mirror with MILTON GREENE. COLIN unobtrusively fetches whisky and cigarettes for them both as OLIVIER abruptly booms out to himself.
C: OLIVIER
D: "O, now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind/Farewell content/ Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars/That make ambition virtue O, farewell/Farewell..." Paula's not an actress. She not a director, not a teacher. Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn.
E: Pause, exasperated
C: MILTON
D: It would be worse if she wasn't around.
C: OLIVIER
D: You know what would make Marilyn Monroe a real actor? A season in rep. They wouldn't stand for this kind of nonsense at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.
C: MILTON
D: You have to be patient with her.
C: OLIVIER
D: Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger. MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it in his pocket.
C: MILTON
D: I better go see her. She'll need something to help her calm down. COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out.
C: OLIVIER
D: Pills to sleep, pills to wake up. Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy. No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater.
E: After a second
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59. COLIN looks at him tentatively.
C: COLIN
D: Maybe she's scared.
C: OLIVIER
D: We're all scared. It's part of being an actor.
C: COLIN
D: But you have the training to deal with it. OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him.
C: OLIVIER
D: I wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if I were you. Though heaven knows it's tempting. He sighs wistfully.
C: OLIVIER
D: And I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing. COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue.

D: Are you sure they won't mind?
C: ROGER
D: Help yourself. They can spare it. Marilyn's okay. She's taken some pills and gone to bed. He frowns darkly.

D: They like to keep her doped up. It makes her easier to control.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT.
N: COLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly. He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears something. Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow breaths, like sighs. COLIN is paralysed. A beat, then - A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into the corridor. MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook, its pages closely crammed with handwriting. MILLER (OFF) Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's not what you think. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61. She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice comes again, flat and tired. MILLER (CONT'D) (OFF) It's just a few ideas. Writer's stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book and let's get some sleep. Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door. As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in what feels like minutes.

C: OLIVIER
D: It's nearly lunch time.
C: MILTON
D: She isn't feeling the part.

D: She can't hide in her bloody dressing room all day.

D: Oh, yes she can.

S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. MARILYN'S DRESSING ROOM.
C: DAY.
D: COLIN knocks softly on the dressing room door. PAULA appears, opening it no more than a crack. She looks out suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the room.
C: PAULA
D: It's Colin. COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider. PAULA Come in. Marilyn wants to see you. COLIN stares at her in surprise.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. MARILYN'S DRESSING ROOM.
C: DAY.
D: COLIN comes in. The dressing room is in semi-darkness. PAULA settles down in the corner. MARILYN lies on a sofa, wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long pause. She sighs softly.
C: MARILYN
D: How old are you?
C: COLIN
D: 24. Nearly
E: Pause
C: MARILYN
D: You remind us of the young king in the movie. Kind of honest and innocent.
N: COLIN (WOUNDED) I'm not innocent. She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into the light.
C: MARILYN
D: What's your job on this picture?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 62A.
C: COLIN
D: I'm the third assistant director. Just a gopher really. Go for this, go for that...

D: You're Larry's assistant too. He shrugs awkwardly.
C: MARILYN
D: What were you doing in my house last night? Did he send you?
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63. COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.
C: COLIN
D: He was worried about you.
C: MARILYN
D: Are you spying on me?
C: COLIN
D: No! Of course not. Why would anyone spy on you? She sighs, and looks away.
C: COLIN
D: Are you all right, Miss Monroe? He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Colin? Whose side are you on? COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer anyone could give.
C: COLIN
D: Yours, Miss Monroe. She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face lighting up.
C: MARILYN
D: Call me Marilyn. He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is on her side now.

C: WATTIS
D: Marilyn's got a new boyfriend. Larry will get jealous.
C: HARDWICK
D: You can say that again. He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a lightness he doesn't feel.
C: COLIN
D: Nothing happened.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63A.
C: WATTIS
D: You were in there for ten minutes at least. Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 64.

D: The mind boggles, dear. COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance routine. Released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky, mildly silly and charming all at the same time. The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the doorway. Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his face as he watches.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. NIGHT.
N: The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about. MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.
C: MILLER
D: I dreamed last night I could hear singing. And then I realised it wasn't a dream. There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window. At two in the morning. It's a circus. A freak show. OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.
C: MILLER
D: I'm going back to New York for a few days. I need to see my kids. I need a break.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65.
C: OLIVIER
D: That won't help Marilyn.
C: MILLER
D: I can't help her. You know what she loves to do most? Sleep. It's what she lives for. Sleep is her demon. He pauses for a second.
E: After a moment Pause
C: MILLER
D: I've disappointed her. OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.
E: CONT'D
C: MILLER
D: She thought I could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke. That I could make her a new person. He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.
E: CONT'D
C: MILLER
D: She wants me to protect her but I can't. I can't even protect myself. She read some notes I made. They were nothing. Just a few ideas.
E: CONT'D Pause
C: OLIVIER
D: About her? He looks up and nods slowly.
C: MILLER
D: She took them the wrong way. He leaves a long, uneasy pause.
C: OLIVIER
D: But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky.

D: Hello, Colin darling. You look like Horatio defending the bridge. Are you going to let me in?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.
C: VIVIEN
D: I hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard. I know what a dreadful slave driver he can be. She sees ORTON and takes his hands.
C: VIVIEN
D: David, he would be lost without you.
E: CONT'D
C: ORTON
D: Just doing my job. Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock misery.

D: I'm getting old, Jack. I need you to work your miracles on me.
C: CARDIFF
D: You're more beautiful every year, Vivien. She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely.
C: VIVIEN
D: Now, you are looking after Larry like I told you?
C: COLIN
D: I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67. Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides towards her, hands extended.
C: VIVIEN
D: Darling Marilyn! She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands.
C: VIVIEN
D: Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb. I'm wild with jealousy.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage.
C: VIVIEN
D: But I'm too old to play her in the film. Larry was quite brutal about that. You see, the truth is all that matters to him. That's why we all admire him so very much. She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes.
C: VIVIEN
D: Now, I must let you work. I only came to wish you good luck! Goodbye, everyone! The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out. VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at him with bitter disappointment.

N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 68. OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly.

D: You shouldn't upset yourself. You are ten times the actress she will ever be.

D: If you could see yourself. The way you watch her...
C: OLIVIER
D: There's never been anything between Marilyn and me. She laughs hysterically.
C: VIVIEN
D: Only because she didn't want you.
C: OLIVIER
D: You're imagining things.
C: VIVIEN
D: Do you think I'm a fool? You didn't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier. She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred seething in her expression. VIVIEN But she saw through you, didn't she darling? Take away the actor and what's left of the man? You can't even play the husband properly without a script. I hope she makes your life hell!
E: CONT'D cont'd slaps him hard across the face.

C: COLIN
D: She wants to see me.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 71. He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic.
C: MILTON
D: He shouldn't be talking to her. He's just a kid. Supposing he says something? Why the hell didn't she call me? His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest, wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that can work to his advantage.

He looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the brandy and picks it up -
N: MARILYN (OFF) Help yourself to a drink. COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway, casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.
C: COLIN
D: I was just... checking you've got everything you need. She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the decanter from his hand.

E: CONT'D

E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73. COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind.
C: COLIN
D: I'll tell you what's wrong. It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress. And this film won't help either of you. He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self- conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens and coughs. She laughs.
C: MARILYN
D: Are you sure you can handle that? You don't look old enough to drink.

She giggles. He turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be. He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself together.

D: Hello? Milton? There is a long silence at the other end of the line.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:

N: MILTON turns pale. When he speaks again his anger is just barely under control.
C: MILTON
D: Let me speak to her, Colin.
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.
N: COLIN offers the phone to MARILYN but she shakes her head.
C: COLIN
D: She's tied up right now. This only sets MARILYN off again. She howls with laughter and COLIN can't help joining her.
T: CUT TO:
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 75.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY.
N: MILTON stares at the phone in disbelief.
C: MILTON
D: What's going on? Colin! Let me talk to her, damn it!
E: Shouts
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.
N: COLIN looks at MARILYN but she shakes her head between giggles. He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the words out between snorts of laughter.
C: COLIN
D: I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go. He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN smiles.
C: MARILYN
D: Let's walk in the garden. See if we can find any more reporters in the bushes. She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes his arm.
S: EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY/DUSK.
N: There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks. MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical closeness.
C: MARILYN
D: I didn't know it was so pretty out here.
C: COLIN
D: You should get out more. See the sights.
C: MARILYN
D: I am the sights. She giggles again, her mood lighter.
C: MARILYN
D: Look at us. We're just like Elsie and the young King. What would Sir Laurence say if he could see us now?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I don't think he'd mind.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76. MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a friendly way as they walk.
C: MARILYN
D: I wanted to be an artist. To grow as an actor. I was so proud to be working with the great Olivier. Now he thinks I'm the enemy. She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.
E: Pause
C: COLIN
D: He doesn't understand your kind of actor. He's hated the method ever since Vivien worked with Elia Kazan. It's all too new and strange. You're the future, and it frightens him.
C: MARILYN
D: Every time I walk into the studio I feel this sense of doom come over me. He looks at me like he's smelling a pile of rotten fish. And the crew hate me. Paula is the only person I can trust. Except for you now, maybe. She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses swim as he stares into them... ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.
E: Pause
C: ROGER
D: Phone call for you, Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller. MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing back briefly at Colin.
C: MARILYN
D: Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for telling me the truth. COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.
C: ROGER
D: You'll be leaving now, I expect.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING ROOM.
C: DAY.
D: The next morning. COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to
N: MILTON. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76A.
C: OLIVIER
D: I don't care if he fucks her sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her down. Oh, hello, boy. He smiles cheerfully.
E: Pause
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.
C: OLIVIER
D: I hear you spent last night with Marilyn.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I didn't spend the night with her. We just had a chat.
C: MILTON
D: I heard them chuckling. OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.
C: OLIVIER
D: Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself.
C: COLIN
D: She just wants a chum, that's all.
C: MILTON
D: A chum? Jesus Christ, what is this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up, kid. He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him. OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror and sighs abruptly.
C: OLIVIER
D: I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again. But I look dead in the rushes. Dead behind the eyes. He gazes at himself thoughtfully.
C: OLIVIER
D: Perhaps I'm angry with her because in my heart I know my own career is in a terrible rut. I wanted to renew myself through her but all I see reflected in that magnificent face is my own inadequacy. He leans back.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIER
D: You know, I admire Marilyn. I really do. Despite her behaviour. She has taken everything Hollywood can throw at her and triumphed. COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 78.
C: OLIVIER
D: An actress has to be pretty tough to get even a tenth as far as she has. He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and sympathetic.
E: CONT'D
C: OLIVIER
D: But be careful, boy. She doesn't need to be rescued. Not really.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS, PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.
C: SOUNDMAN
D: What was Marilyn like then, Col?
C: HARDWICK
D: Going over her lines with her, were you?
C: SOUNDMAN
D: Will she be in today or is she too tired? It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.
C: COLIN
D: She was just being friendly.
C: WATTIS
D: I'll bet. There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.
C: WATTIS
D: Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap? There you are, Colin the innocent little fly buzzing about happily, when suddenly a heavenly scent attracts you and - Snap!
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Oh, fuck off, Dickie. You've never slept with a woman in your life.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 79.
C: WATTIS
D: I know a Femme Fatale when I see one, love.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume attended to by LUCY.
C: ORTON
D: Three minutes, ladies and gents. Three minutes. It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an angry MILTON.
C: MILTON
D: Arthur Miller called me. He's not happy with you.
C: COLIN
D: He doesn't even know who I am.
C: MILTON
D: Marilyn must have said something.
C: COLIN
D: Maybe she was trying to make him jealous... ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.
S: EXT. STUDIO. DAY.
N: MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside the studio door.
C: MILTON
D: Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn for seven years. I fell in love with her, just like you've done. COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.
C: MILTON
D: We had ten days together and that was it. She picked me up, she put me down. That's what she does. She breaks hearts. She'll break yours. My advice to you is to quit before you get burned.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I don't need your advice. And I'm not in love with her.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80.
C: MILTON
D: Okay, have it your way. You don't see Marilyn again, you don't even talk to her. She is completely off-limits to you. Got it?
E: Pause
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY.
N: COLIN hurries along the corridor, looking for LUCY, who he sees pushing a rack of clothes. He stops awkwardly. She gazes at him meaningfully, hurt and puzzled.
C: LUCY
D: I waited for you on Friday.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, God... I'm sorry... I forgot... I've just been so busy.
N: LUCY (SHARP) So I hear. COLIN (SHRUGS) You know how crews gossip. There's nothing in it.
C: LUCY
D: Of course there isn't. Marilyn Monroe fancying you? Come on. COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like the idea being dismissed so lightly. Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt. Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.
C: MARILYN
D: Hi, Colin. COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns, looking at Lucy.
C: MARILYN
D: Hey, are you guys dating? That's what I heard. She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks in hard. He shrugs casually.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 81.
C: COLIN
D: Of course not. You know how crews like to gossip. His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.
C: MARILYN
D: Too bad. You look cute together. She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause. COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.
C: LUCY
D: I thought you were different.
C: COLIN
D: Lucy, I really like you. We've had such fun...
C: LUCY
D: And now it's time to set your sights a little higher. I get it. Who do you think you are, Cary Grant? She shoves the rack of clothes back towards the wardrobe department. Part of him knows he should go after her, but in the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an unworthy sense of relief.
E: Pause
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
N: COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to block it out.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY.
N: The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along, snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.
C: ROGER
D: Get in. COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.
C: MILTON
D: Any problem, Roger?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82.
C: ROGER
D: Just dropped by to take Colin out to lunch. COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.
C: MILTON
D: You're not taking him to Marilyn? That would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit.
C: ROGER
D: Oh, no, sir. MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.
C: MILTON
D: What do you have in there?
C: ROGER
D: Just a picnic. We've been looking forward to it, haven't we, Colin? COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.
C: MILTON
D: Okay, well, have a nice time boys. Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.
C: COLIN
D: Is she okay? In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the blanket in the back.
N: MARILYN SURPRISE!
C: COLIN
D: Oh, Jesus - She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.
C: MARILYN
D: Roger and I decided to take you out for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?
N: ROGER (PAINED) Indeed we did.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, God. If Milton sees me with you... I'll be sacked... He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back gleefully.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 83.
C: MARILYN
D: No one can sack you, Colin. Except me, of course. She pats the seat next to her.
E: Pause
C: MARILYN
D: I don't like being on my own in the back. Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.
E: CONT'D
C: MILTON
D: What the hell? He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and the car roars off.
N: MILTON (CONT'D) (SHOUTS) Colin! Get back here, you little bastard! You're fired! Do you hear me? Fired! COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.
C: MARILYN
D: Do you think he saw me? COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to make room for him.
C: MARILYN
D: Snuggle up. This is fun. She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands meshed together. ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his eyes. In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches the car speed away.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:

S: EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK. DAY.
N: COLIN and MARILYN walk barefoot in the grass of Windsor Great Park while ROGER leans on the bonnet of the parked Wolsey, holding shoes, socks, and sandals. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 84. There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to the sun.
C: MARILYN
D: This is how I ought to feel every day. COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.
C: MARILYN
D: Let's run away together. He turns ashen.
E: CONT'D
N: MARILYN (CONT'D) (LAUGHS) Just kidding. She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.
C: COLIN
D: We have today, anyway. One day to do whatever we like. We can go back to real life tomorrow.
C: MARILYN
D: Only one day?
C: COLIN
D: Well, maybe the weekend.
C: MARILYN
D: Or a week? He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his side.
C: MARILYN
D: What shall we do?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: We could go to Windsor Castle, if you like. MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.

N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 85.
S: EXT. ROGER'S CAR. WINDSOR CASTLE. DAY.
N: ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty. ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of their own.
C: ROGER
D: Detective Chief Superintendant Smith. I'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day. They'd like to look around the castle. As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Christ, is that..? He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.
C: ROGER
D: Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors, is it?
C: POLICEMAN
D: Does she know anyone here, sir? We need to write down a contact name in the book. ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.
E: After a second
C: ROGER
D: You don't know Her Majesty, by any chance?
C: MARILYN
D: We met at a movie premiere. She said my dress was pretty.
C: POLICEMAN
D: I'm not sure that quite...
N: COLIN (INTERRUPTING) My Godfather works here. He's the Royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead. The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Name?
C: COLIN
D: Clark. Colin Clark. The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86.
C: COLIN
D: My father knows everybody. A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.
E: CONT'D

S: 115A INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. CORRIDORS. DAY. 115A

T: CUT TO:
S: 115B INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. GOLDEN CORRIDOR. DAY. 115B
N: COLIN and MARILYN are led into another corridor, this one with a beautiful gold-leaf ceiling decoration. MARILYN looks up, enchanted.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. ROYAL LIBRARY. DAY.
N: The library is a series of magnificent rooms lined from floor to ceiling with books and prints. Every surface is covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a sly wit. He greets COLIN with a friendly, distracted air.
C: MORSHEAD
D: Colin, my boy! Come in, come in. Forgive the dust. He smiles at MARILYN, showing no sign whatever of recognising her.
C: MORSHEAD
D: You are pretty, my dear. I'm sure you and Colin have so much in common. MARILYN looks around in awe.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Gee, I'd love to read all these books some time.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 87.
C: MORSHEAD
D: Luckily one doesn't really have to. A lot of them just have pictures in. He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it.
C: MORSHEAD
D: These are by an artist called Holbein. MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: She's beautiful.
C: MORSHEAD
D: She was the daughter of one of the King's courtiers, nearly 400 years ago.
C: MARILYN
D: I hope I look that good when I'm
N: MORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings.
C: MORSHEAD
D: And these are all by Leonardo Da Vinci.
C: MARILYN
D: I've heard of him! Didn't he paint that lady with the funny smile? She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.
C: MORSHEAD
D: The Mona Lisa.
C: MARILYN
D: Do you have that one here too?
C: MORSHEAD
D: Alas, that one got away. He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.
C: MORSHEAD
D: Now, let's go to the Queen's apartments. She's not here at the moment, but she will be sorry to have missed you. MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Really?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 88.
C: MORSHEAD
D: Oh, yes. Why, she was only saying to me the other day, "what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth"? He shares a sly smile with COLIN. He knows exactly who Marilyn is and is enjoying every second of her company. He leads her out, with COLIN trailing in their wake.
C: MORSHEAD
D: Some of the rooms are very opulent but I think there's something you might like better than all that.

S: INT. WINDSOR CASTLE. DOLLS' ROOM. DAY.
N: OPEN on a massive dolls' house. Everything imaginable is inside - beds, chairs, baths, basins, even small rugs and chandeliers, all perfectly to scale. MARILYN kneels in front of it, gazing from room to room with childlike joy. It is so big she can lean inside and see the detail in every room. She cries out with joy.
C: MARILYN
D: Look, Colin. COLIN kneels at her side.
C: MARILYN
D: I sure never had a dolls' house like this when I was a kid. She sees a perfect doll family inside, husband, wife and two children. She points at them, her eyes shining.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: This is me, that's you, and these are our kids. She smiles wistfully and puts her hand on his arm.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Our daughter's so pretty. All little girls should be told how pretty they are. They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them. Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: We look like such a happy family, don't we?
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89. She turns to him. They are only inches away from each other. COLIN's heart lurches. MORSHEAD coughs discreetly.
C: MORSHEAD
D: You mustn't let me keep you. I'm sure you're longing to be on your way.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE. COURT YARD. DAY.
N: COLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN, SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.
C: MARILYN
D: Shall I be "her"? She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out, shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn "look". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.
C: SPECTATOR
D: Are you somebody, mate?
N: COLIN (SMILES) I'm no one. COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles, just for him. He feels like he's tumbling into the abyss, but no longer cares.

C: MARILYN
D: This isn't a school, it's a palace! COLIN smiles.
C: COLIN
D: Eton is 500 years old. It was founded by King Henry VI.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89A.
C: MARILYN
D: It's like walking through history.
C: COLIN
D: Take that room up there. They stop as COLIN points up at a window.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90.
C: COLIN
D: That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough. Where we were whipped. MARILYN looks at him in shock.
C: MARILYN
D: Whipped?
C: COLIN
D: Beaten. She looks appalled.
C: MARILYN
D: I'd never send my kids away. How long were you here?
E: pause
C: COLIN
D: Five years. But I was sent to boarding school when I was eight.
C: MARILYN
D: Why?
C: COLIN
D: That's what we do in my family. She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.
C: MARILYN
D: It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy.
C: COLIN
D: In one way, yes. But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark. She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.
C: MARILYN
D: So how are you going to do it?
C: COLIN
D: Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there.
C: MARILYN
D: Sounds pretty good to me. She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness. We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level. But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns the corner in his Eton uniform.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A. He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.
C: SCHOOLBOY
D: Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ETON COLLEGE. COURTYARD. DAY.
N: MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window. MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.
C: MARILYN
D: Work hard, boys! I don't want anyone whipping you! A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.
C: BOY
D: You can whip me anytime, Marilyn! MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN escorts her away.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THAMES RIVERBANK. DAY.
N: After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the sandy bank. The water glitters magically.
C: MARILYN
D: Hurry up, slow poke.
C: COLIN
D: But we haven't got any... He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91. He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.
C: MARILYN
D: Oh my gosh! It's freezing!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THAMES. DAY.
N: MARILYN swims in the water, humming softly to herself. COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs.
C: MARILYN
D: This is great.
C: COLIN
D: What if a boat goes past? We could be arrested.
C: MARILYN
D: Don't worry. Roger will fix it. Oh, darn it... She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.
C: COLIN
D: What's wrong?
C: MARILYN
D: I have something in my eye. He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under the water. She holds her head up to him.
C: COLIN
D: I can't see anything.
C: MARILYN
D: Get closer. She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.
C: MARILYN
D: That's the first time I've kissed anyone younger than me. There's a lot of older guys in Hollywood. She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self- conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats. Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances away, embarrassed.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 92.
C: MARILYN
D: Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing you haven't seen before. COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Oh, Colin! And you an old Etonian! He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his arms.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Let me warm you up. She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her
N: CLOSER -
C: MARILYN
D: Don't spoil it. She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.
C: MARILYN
D: I want this to be the perfect date. He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently, her expression wistful.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: I haven't had a real date since I was 13 years old. She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo of a lost childhood. He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse. As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish. The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him with a radiant smile.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: That was nice. I don't get kissed much. She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 93.
C: MARILYN
D: Okay, what do we do now? COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet cough and ROGER appears.
E: CONT'D
C: ROGER
D: Time to go home, I think, Miss Monroe. She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at each other for a second.
C: ROGER
D: Be careful not to get in too deep, son. COLIN knows he isn't talking about the river.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ROGER'S CAR. DAY.
N: MARILYN and COLIN sit in silence in the back of the car. Her exuberance has vanished and there is a distant look in her eye. COLIN wants to say something but can't think of the right words. He puts his hand on hers and she squeezes it, but then pulls away.

S: INT/EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. ROGER'S CAR. DAY.
N: A seething MILTON is waiting on the steps as ROGER parks the car. COLIN looks at him nervously. MARILYN looks at him then gets out, glancing at Milton indifferently.
C: MARILYN
D: Hi Milton. She smiles sweetly.
C: MARILYN
D: Next time I come on set, you better make sure Colin is there. He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN.
E: CONT'D
N: MARILYN (CONT'D) (TO ROGER) Take him home. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 94. She waves briefly to Colin, nothing more than a flutter of her fingers. COLIN watches her all the way up the steps until she disappears inside.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: The crew are ready, the cast stand around in full costume, OLIVIER paces the set - and there is no sign of Marilyn. OLIVIER turns to COLIN.
C: OLIVIER
D: You spent the day with her. What frame of mind was she in?
C: COLIN
D: She was fine.
N: OLIVIER (HUGE SELF-CONTROL) Well, find out what's going on. There's a good chap. Perhaps we can persuade her on this splendid day to do the work she's paying herself to do. He stalks off. COLIN sees WATTIS grinning at him.
C: COLIN
D: Don't start, Dicky.
C: WATTIS
D: You won't get any sympathy from me, dear. Frankly I wouldn't care if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow.
C: COLIN
D: She's trying her best.
C: WATTIS
D: She's Marilyn Monroe. This is her life. Pills, booze, sex, more pills. God, it must be wonderful! COLIN doesn't laugh. WATTIS looks at him sympathetically.
E: Pause

D: Marilyn's not well.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 95.
C: COLIN
D: But she was wonderful yesterday. MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his hostility in barbed politeness.
C: MILTON
D: I don't know what you did to her, kid, but she got nervous. I had to give her some pills to calm her down.
C: COLIN
D: She doesn't need pills! She just needs someone to care for her.
C: MILTON
D: Someone like you? COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.
C: COLIN
D: I told you, I'm not in love with her!
C: MILTON
D: You kissed her.
C: COLIN
D: She said that?
C: MILTON
D: Spare me the bullshit. I know everything. COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.
C: MILTON
D: You messed her up, kid. Confused her. He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.
E: CONT'D
C: MILTON
D: I've got every penny I ever made tied up in Marilyn. She owes me. If it wasn't for me she'd still be on contracts that make slave wages look good. I gave her back her freedom, and now Miller's turning her against me. That's what you get for trying to help Marilyn Monroe. He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking more in sorrow than anger.

C: COLIN
D: Roger? What's the matter?
N: ROGER (OFF) It's Marilyn. A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out of bed and opens the door. ROGER stands in the doorway
C: COLIN
D: Is she dead?
C: ROGER
D: She's asking for you. She's sick. I think she might be in a coma.

D: How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma?

D: Just bloody get dressed!

N: PAULA STRASBERG paces frantically outside Marilyn's bedroom door as ROGER, MILTON and COLIN hurry up the stairs. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 97.
C: PAULA
D: She hasn't made a sound for over an hour.
C: ROGER
D: We should break down the door.
C: COLIN
D: How many pills did she take?

S: EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. NIGHT.
N: ROGER and COLIN carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel and prop it up against the wall.

D: I'll open the door once I'm inside.

N: COLIN tumbles in through the window with a clattering thump.
C: COLIN
D: Marilyn? A shaft of moonlight reveals MARILYN lying naked across the bed, her body partly covered by the sheet. Half empty pill and champagne bottles are scattered all over her dresser; there is also an old photograph in a silver frame of her mother Gladys.
C: COLIN
D: Marilyn? For a second he fears the worst, but then suddenly she groans and sits up, looking at him blearily.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 98.
C: MARILYN
D: Oh hi, Colin.
C: COLIN
D: Are you okay? Everyone was worried about you.
C: MARILYN
D: Phooey. She pats the sheets at her side and settles down sleepily on the pillow.
C: MARILYN
D: Get in. She is instantly back asleep. COLIN fumbles his way to the door. He searches for the key on the side table and quickly finds it. He goes to unlock the door, but then pauses, looking back at Marilyn. He puts the key back and bends down to whisper at the keyhole.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: It's me. She's fine but I'm going to keep an eye on her. I'll sleep on the sofa.
N: MILTON (OFF) Come on, Colin, open up.
C: COLIN
D: I can't find the key. You can all go to bed now.
E: After a second Pause
N: PAULA (OFF) Colin, open this door! She needs me... COLIN goes back to the bed and gazes at the sleeping Marilyn, his expression suffused with a tenderness we have never seen in him before. He pulls up the sheet so that it covers her nakedness, then tentatively lies down to rest his head on the pillow.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARKSIDE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
N: COLIN wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding him.
C: MARILYN
D: Colin? What are you doing here? MARILYN sits up, the sheet clutched to her chest, her expression panicky and disoriented. COLIN hurls himself off the bed.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 99.
C: COLIN
D: I came in through the window... He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.
C: COLIN
D: Milton thought you were sick. She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed smile.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: The window? Is there a balcony, like in Romeo And Juliet? How romantic. But I'm not sick. What makes them think that? She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her bedside table.
E: Pause
C: COLIN
D: Please don't take any more pills. She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph. COLIN Who's that?
E: CONT'D cont'd
C: MARILYN
D: My mom. Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.
C: MARILYN
D: They took her to the Sanatorium when I was a kid. I grew up in other people's homes, mostly. Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture, this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Abraham Lincoln?
C: MARILYN
D: I don't know who my father is so it might as well be him. Why not? I can pick any father I want. She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.
C: MARILYN
D: Do you have a home, Colin? A real one?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Yes, I do.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 100.
C: MARILYN
D: And a mother and father who still live together?
C: COLIN
D: Yes.
C: MARILYN
D: And do they love you?
C: COLIN
D: I'm sure they do. He nods. She smiles sadly.
C: MARILYN
D: You're lucky. Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.
C: MARILYN
D: Do you love me, Colin? He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately vulnerable.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Yes. She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back gently on the pillow.
C: COLIN
D: But you and I come from different worlds. You're like some Greek Goddess to me...
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: I'm not Greek. She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his hand, looking at him in appeal.
C: MARILYN
D: I don't want to be a Goddess. I just want to be loved like an ordinary girl.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Mr. Miller loves you. She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.
C: MARILYN
D: I found his notebook. It said I'd let him down.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.
C: COLIN
D: Writers scribble all kinds of things. It doesn't mean anything. She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.
C: MARILYN
D: He wanted me to find it. It said he should never have married me. That I was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred. He's left me, Colin. Why do the people I love always leave me? She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN responds with sudden passion.
C: COLIN
D: I'll never leave you. She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.
C: MARILYN
D: All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. As soon as they realise I'm not her, they run. He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms. She sighs sleepily.
C: MARILYN
D: Boy, there's a lot of men in this business. And they all think you've got to sleep with them. She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: You're not like that. That's why I like you. COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: You should date that Wardrobe lady. She's pretty.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I don't want to. I love you, Marilyn. She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily. He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily. He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.
E: Pause
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102. And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.
C: MARILYN
D: What's the matter? Don't you want to make love?
C: COLIN
D: Maybe we should just be friends.
C: MARILYN
D: Okay. Friends. She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back. She curls against him.
C: MARILYN
D: This is nice. Like spoons. I used to do this with Johnny.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Who's Johnny?
C: MARILYN
D: Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in the old days. He was thin, like you... Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined.
C: COLIN
D: Marilyn? She mutters softly in reply.
C: COLIN
D: Do one thing for me? Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do. Show Larry you're a great actress.
E: CONT'D

N: First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath, her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz tune she is to sing in the film.
C: MARILYN
D: "I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through... I'm yours no matter what others may say or do... She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.

E: Pause

C: MARILYN
D: "Well, it's her own fault. She has no right being out at this time of night. She's 93!" MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them, can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it.
E: AS ELSIE
C: ORTON
D: Cut it there! MARILYN is as happy as we have ever seen her. She seeks out COLIN amongst the crowd and beams at him. Half the crew, including OLIVIER, notice the look. COLIN blushes self- consciously but we can feel his pride.

C: OLIVIER
D: Whatever it was you did to her, boy, keep doing it. OLIVIER grins slyly and COLIN doesn't bother to protest. The phone rings. OLIVIER picks it up.

S: INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.
N: COLIN paces nervously up and down the hall. PAULA appears. She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks with sudden ferocity.
C: PAULA
D: From the first moment all I have felt is Olivier's loathing and contempt. He thinks I'm unnecessary. Me, her drama coach, surrogate mother, nursemaid. On call 24 hours a day to help her act, dole out pills, bolster her ego, keep her sober enough to work. Me. Unnecessary. No me, no Marilyn. He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then walks on. COLIN hesitates. She looks back briefly.

E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
N: MARILYN lies in bed with MILTON possessively at her side. COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.
C: MARILYN
D: You think I can act, don't you, Colin?
C: COLIN
D: Of course I do. You were wonderful today. PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.
C: PAULA
D: Marilyn's tired now.
C: MARILYN
D: I want him to stay with me.
C: MILTON
D: What would Arthur say if he knew Colin was here? A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on them angrily.
C: COLIN
D: You heard what she said. She wants me here.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 106. MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.
C: PAULA
D: You have no idea of your position in the world, Marilyn. You are the greatest actress there's ever been. Not just actress. The greatest woman of this or any time. I love you like a daughter. COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.
C: PAULA
D: It's hard now, but believe me you will survive this and go on to better things. Your life is ahead of you. You're young, just beginning. Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave. Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone. As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: I'm so tired of feeling scared. Life is so shitty. I hate it. It hurts too much. COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.
C: COLIN
D: I'm here now. I'll look after you. She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.
C: MARILYN
D: Good old Colin. Looking after me, looking after Larry, looking after Vivien. Always putting everyone before yourself. There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she smiles and touches his face gently. He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.

D: It hurts! It hurts, Colin! She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and frightened. COLIN sees a dark red stain on the sheets.
C: MARILYN
D: The baby. I can't lose the baby. COLIN looks at her aghast.

C: COLIN
D: Marilyn, unlock the door.
N: MARILYN (OFF) Don't let anyone in.
C: COLIN
D: I won't. MILTON gives him a sharp look but he no longer cares about anything except Marilyn. There is a shuffling sound and the door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.
C: PAULA
D: Marilyn! Marilyn, my baby, what has Colin done to you?
C: COLIN
D: I haven't done anything. She's just... got a stomach ache. He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs.

D: She's not dying, for Christ's sake. The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side. He nods briskly.
C: CONNELL
D: I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient in there?
C: PAULA
D: Please save her... it's Marilyn Monroe. You can't let her die. CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp.

C: CONNELL
D: I've given Mrs. Miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped. She needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that she'll be fine. I suggest someone stays with her. PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription from his hand.

D: Was she really pregnant?

N: COLIN creeps into the room and sits on the bed. MARILYN is awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid.
C: MARILYN
D: We have to say goodbye now, Colin. Arthur's on his way back. When this film is over I'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him. I'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's. She smiles wistfully at the fantasy.
C: MARILYN
D: We have to forget this ever happened.

C: MARILYN
D: What do you want to do? Marry me?

D: Why not? You could come and live at my parents place. You'd love it. It's a castle, like in a fairy tale. We wouldn't even have to live together. You could have your own suite of rooms... He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal.
C: COLIN
D: You could quit. Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it all go.
E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: This is what I've worked for my whole life. I couldn't just give it all up.
C: COLIN
D: Why not, when it drives you crazy? Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression.
C: MARILYN
D: You think I'm crazy?
C: COLIN
D: I didn't mean that. I just meant you could be happy.
C: MARILYN
D: I am happy. I got everything I ever dreamed about. She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't want to be rescued. He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.
C: COLIN
D: Of course you're happy. You're a star. The biggest star in the world. She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.
E: Pause

D: You're right, Marilyn. We have to forget all this.

E: CONT'D
C: MARILYN
D: Well, maybe just a wink. Once in a while. He smiles, looks at her just once more, and then goes out. As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.

There is a flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess. She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him. He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111-

D: MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

D: I hope you will all forgive me. It wasn't altogether my fault. I have been ill. She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to understand herself and their expectations of her.
E: CONT'D

N: OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.
C: MARILYN
D: "..I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart.." She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring softly so that only he can hear.
E: AS ELSIE
C: SYBIL THORNDIKE
D: First love is such sweet despair, Colin. She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into the darkness at the back of the set.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the finish line. We see a montage of scenes being filmed - - HARDWICK enters as Major Domo through the main door of the oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving equipment... - WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the Grand Duke's bedroom... - WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door... The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence -
C: ORTON
D: Very quiet, studio! Going for a take. The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy clunks.
C: DENYS
D: Camera running! Speed!
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113A. ORTON
C: ACTION!
D: MARILYN looks up, in character as Elsie, her eyes glowing.
C: OLIVIER
D: "My dear..."
E: AS REGENT
C: MARILYN
D: "I've got a solemn word of warning for you."
E: AS ELSIE
C: OLIVIER
D: "What's that, my beloved?"
E: AS REGENT
C: MARILYN
D: "You know what's going to happen? I'm going to fall in love with you, because I always, always do." CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and vitality. And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut', MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles indulgently.
E: AS ELSIE
C: ORTON
D: Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a wrap! There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN leaves the stage.
S: 148A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 148A
N: MARILYN walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY.
N: The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward, calling out above the hubbub.
C: MILTON
D: If you'd all like to step this way, you'll find something I think you'll like. MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio, loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.
C: MILTON
D: A parting gift to each of you from Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on the right.
E: CONT'D
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113B. At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against the wall. There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers. Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps their present. The bin is soon overflowing. MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out. ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.
C: JACOBS
D: It's been a lot of fun, kids. See you at the Academy Awards. He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the dustbin as he goes. COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin, with thanks, Marilyn".
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 114.
S: 150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A
N: The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.
C: COLIN
D: Aren't you going to throw yours away?
C: LUCY
D: Of course not. It's from Marilyn Monroe. He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115.
C: COLIN
D: Lucy? She turns back to look at him.
E: After a second
C: COLIN
D: I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday.
E: CONT'D
C: LUCY
D: I'm washing my hair. He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She goes but then stops to look back at him.
C: LUCY
D: Did she break your heart?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: A little.
E: After a second
C: LUCY
D: Good. It needed breaking. There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.
C: LUCY
D: I might be free on Wednesday. COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's present in his hands.
E: CONT'D After a second
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY.
N: COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way.
S: INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY.
N: OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes in. OLIVIER glances at him.
C: OLIVIER
D: "You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended.
N: (MORE) MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116.
C: OLIVIER
D: These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air...
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Prospero.
N: OLIVIER (SMILES) We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep..." COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them. The sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone, what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty.
C: OLIVIER
D: She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in surprise.
E: CONT'D After a second
C: COLIN
D: You should tell her that.
C: OLIVIER
D: Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly.
C: OLIVIER
D: I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up.
E: CONT'D Pause
C: OLIVIER
D: And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117. OLIVIER (SMILES) Miller made me see things differently. (Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best. And believe me, most of the time, I really am the best. He goes to the door and pauses.
C: OLIVIER
D: You've done a good job, boy. Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.
E: CONT'D Pause
C: COLIN
D: Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance , a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent. HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then -
E: Scene 90
S: 152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A
N: The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here. BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and regulars at play. And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action. COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to his woe and his pint.
C: MARILYN
D: Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.
C: COLIN
D: Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not to stare.
C: MARILYN
D: I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A. MARILYN hands COLIN a package.
C: MARILYN
D: The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE
E: CONT'D
N: MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD
C: MARILYN
D: Don't forget me.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: As if I could.
C: MARILYN
D: Everyone else on the picture wishes they could.
C: COLIN
D: Everyone else doesn't understand. She smiles, touched.
C: MARILYN
D: Be a gentleman and walk me to my car?
S: 152B EXT. DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 152B
N: The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens the car door for MARILYN. MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles and says lightly:
C: COLIN
D: What's that for?
C: MARILYN
D: That's for being on my side; and remember, when you see me wink, that's for you. ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.
C: ROGER
D: Looking a couple of inches taller than when I first saw you. ROGER nods at COLIN He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.
E: glancing at COLIN a silent salute suggesting job well done.
C: BARRY
D: Was that really Marilyn Monroe?
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.
C: COLIN
D: No - just a good friend of mine. BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it drives into the English countryside.
T: FADE TO:
S: EXT. WARDOUR STREET. LONDON. DAY.
N: COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office. We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY.
N: COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves. A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.
C: COLIN
D: Any messages? THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.
C: SECRETARY
D: It's probably just someone having a joke. COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.
C: COLIN
D: Did she say anything?
E: After a moment
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 118.
C: SECRETARY
D: She just asked you to call. It is a joke, isn't it? COLIN stares down at the paper.
E: Pause
C: COLIN
D: Probably. Book a call as soon as you can. Los Angeles, California. Brentwood 1890.
E: Pause
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT.
N: It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of paper. The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.
C: OPERATOR
D: Your call to Los Angeles. We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits anxiously as the ringing continues.
T: CUT TO:
S: 155A EXT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY.
C: 155A
D: ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable Brentwood house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM.
C: DAY.
D: The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood hills. A white phone rings on the table. It rings continuously, insistently. It carries on ringing. No one comes. HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think Marilyn might appear, but she never does. It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.
N: MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119. MARILYN (VO) "I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart..." The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly drifts away to nothing.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT.
N: COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise has been revisiting it in his memory. He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle in resignation. His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he is looking for - it says simply MM on the can. He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends to look. The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since forgotten. We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera, looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life. After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks happily. Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet and charming. There is something so completely natural about the gesture COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for years. It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed, affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever his. She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then looks back, smiling at the camera. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120. Her face fills the screen. Beautiful, timeless - Happy. HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: THE END
