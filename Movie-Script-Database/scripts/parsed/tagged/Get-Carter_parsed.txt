S: EXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT
N: Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy satin curtains close, wiping him from view.
S: INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy. GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, is curled up beside him. SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.
C: GERALD
D: Bollock naked with his socks still on?
E: removing the cigar from his mouth
C: SID
D: They do that up North.
E: thoughtfully
C: GERALD
D: What for? Protective purposes?
N: He laughs.
C: SID
D: Ask me?
C: GERALD
D: Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
N: Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights and sweet music happen when he opens it. Clunk. The slide changes.
C: SID
D: Must be a bloody contortionist
N: Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues.
C: GERALD
D: We don't want you to go up the North, Jack.
N: Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is definitely something between them.
C: JACK
D: No.
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: Not suede boots!
E: groans
C: SID
D: Knock it off, Gerald.
C: GERALD
D: What? And get the clap?
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: You work for us, Jack. We have connections in those parts. I'd hate you to screw 'em up.
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: What's that? A python.
N: Sid laughs raucously. Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: What are you going for?
C: JACK
D: To find out what happened.
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: Some hard nuts operate up there, Jack. They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his bugle in.
C: JACK
D: Too bad.
C: GERALD
D: I smell trouble, boy.
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: SID
D: The law was satisfied.
C: JACK
D: Since when was that good enough?
N: Clunk. The slide changes.
C: GERALD
D: Think again, Jack.
C: JACK
D: I will.

N: The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.

S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT
N: Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.
S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking up. They see him and quickly drive off. Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.
S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pitch black. An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain. Carter stands over the coffin.

C: EDNA

N: She closes the door.
S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.
S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

C: CARTER
D: Was he in bad shape?
C: UNDERTAKER
D: They come worse.
S: INT. HEARSE - DAY
N: The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank. There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.
S: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the coffin. Carter sees her.
C: CARTER
D: Doreen?
N: She seems mesmerized by what's going on.
C: CARTER
D: All right, are you?
N: Doreen doesn 't answer.
C: CARTER
D: Been staying with a friend?
N: Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another screw into the coffin.
C: CARTER
D: Sorry about your father.
C: DOREEN
D: Yeah.
E: pause
C: CARTER
D: Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
C: DOREEN
D: They said he was drunk.
E: dazed
S: INT. HEARSE - DAY
N: The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men suss the scene and drive off.

C: CARTER
D: Oh, what you doing now?

C: CARTER
D: That must be interesting.
C: DOREEN
D: Yes.
N: Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly.
C: CARTER
D: What you going to do? Live with Margaret?
N: Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles in her bag for a cigarette. Carter continues, slightly indignant.
C: CARTER
D: Well, why won't you come with us to South America? My fiancee won't mind, Your dad would have wanted it.
E: pause
N: The undertaker puts the final screw in.
C: UNDERTAKER
D: Get Hughbert up, will you? We're ready now, sir.
E: to colleague to Carter
S: EXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a young barman who worked with Frank.
C: EDDIE
D: We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
C: CARTER
D: Nice of you to come.
C: EDDIE
D: No. Frank was a good bloke.
C: KEITH
D: He was that.
C: EDDIE
D: One of the best.
S: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
N: Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves slowly through the streets of the city. Sitting in front on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.
C: KEITH
D: I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
C: CARTER
D: What?
C: KEITH
D: I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time.
C: CARTER
D: Did you work with him, Keith?
C: KEITH
D: At the Half Moon.
C: EDDIE
D: It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus... ...then he goes and does a thing like that. It's a bloody funny thing.
E: not to be left out pause he shakes his head.
C: CARTER
D: Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
E: quietly
S: EXT. CREMATORIUM GATES - DAY
N: As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.
S: INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY
N: Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts through the silence. Everybody looks round.
C: CARTER
D: Is that Margaret?
E: whispering to Doreen
N: Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.
S: INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY
N: Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.
S: EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY
N: MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind of way. Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns. Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.
C: CARTER
D: Margaret.
N: Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her. I thought you weren't coming.
C: MARGARET
D: Changed me mind.
N: They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves with her. Margaret continues nervously.
C: MARGARET
D: Everyhing go off all right?
C: CARTER
D: Fine... I want to talk to you.
E: pause
C: MARGARET
D: What about?
C: CARTER
D: Doreen.
N: Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen. She's still watching them.
C: MARGARET
D: She's nothing to do with me.
E: adamantly
C: CARTER
D: What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
E: puzzled
C: MARGARET
D: No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
E: shaking her head
N: Margaret starts walking again, fast. Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.
C: CARTER
D: Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret?
E: looking her in the eye
C: MARGARET
D: Killed? I don't know anything about it.
E: nervously
N: She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her.
C: CARTER
D: Really.
C: MARGARET
D: I must go. I'm in a hurry.
C: CARTER
D: I want to talk to you later.
C: MARGARET
D: I can't.
C: CARTER
D: Tomorrow morning, then?
N: Margaret dithers.
C: MARGARET
D: Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock on the Iron Bridge.
N: Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen watches too.
S: INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY
N: Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to lick it as the steel trap closes.
S: INT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY
N: It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a real boozer. A handful of hard drinkers are already in position. Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober.
C: EDDIE
D: Absent friends. You don't think he might have done it on purpose?
E: He raises his glass and drinks, then continues thoughtfully.
C: KEITH
D: What? You mean, like, kill himself?
N: Eddie and Keith look at each other. Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the conversation.
C: KEITH
D: Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?
N: Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable.
C: KEITH
D: I mean, what for?
C: CARTER
D: That's what I was wondering.
C: KEITH
D: Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
C: CARTER
D: Why would it?
C: KEITH
D: It just would. He was always the same.
C: CARTER
D: Since when did he drink whisky?
C: KEITH
D: Don't know.
C: CARTER
D: Nobody seems to know.
N: Doreen is now crying openly.
C: EDDIE
D: Bloody good bloke. One of the best.
E: finishing off his drink
C: DOREEN
D: How would you know? Or you? Or you? None of you knew. I knew. He was me dad.
E: blurts out She suddenly jumps up and empties her glass in Eddie's face.
N: She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow. Carter puts his hand out to restrain him.
C: CARTER
D: Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that.
E: to Eddie
C: EDDIE
D: Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
E: wiping his face with a handkerchief
C: CARTER
D: Have another?
E: to Eddie
C: EDDIE
D: No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
N: Eddie stands up, cap in hand. Carter pulls out a wad of money.
C: CARTER
D: Look, look. Get your suit cleaned.
E: He peels off a note.
C: EDDIE
D: No. It's all right.
C: CARTER
D: Thanks for coming.
E: standing, pushes the note in his top pocket
C: EDDIE
D: Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
N: Eddie leaves.
C: CARTER
D: You work here, Keith?
C: KEITH
D: Yes.
N: Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith.
C: CARTER
D: Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
C: KEITH
D: Right.
C: CARTER
D: I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
E: He casts an eye around the bar.
C: KEITH
D: Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
C: CARTER
D: Where would I find him?
C: KEITH
D: Today? At the races. He always goes.
N: Carter takes out his phial of pills.
C: KEITH
D: How'd you know Albert?
C: CARTER
D: Went to school with him. He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
E: smiles
S: EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
N: The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.
S: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
N: Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the ground. He has seen Carter.
S: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
N: Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces the winner of the last race.
S: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
N: Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.
S: EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY
N: Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring ERIC PAICE. Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks. Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure. Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely before speaking.
C: CARTER
D: Grey suits you, Eric.
N: Eric swings round, startled.
C: ERIC
D: Good God!
N: Carter smiles.
C: CARTER
D: Is he?
C: ERIC
D: Jack Carter.
C: CARTER
D: Eric. Eric Paice.
E: amused
C: ERIC
D: What you doing around here then?
C: CARTER
D: Didn't you know this is my home town?
C: ERIC
D: No, I didn't know that.
C: CARTER
D: Funny, that.
N: Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.
C: ERIC
D: Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
C: CARTER
D: No. I'm visiting relatives.
C: ERIC
D: Oh, that's nice.
C: CARTER
D: It would be. If they were still living.
C: ERIC
D: Meaning what?
C: CARTER
D: A bereavement. A death in the family.
C: ERIC
D: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
C: CARTER
D: That's all right, Eric.
N: Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.
C: ERIC
D: Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
C: CARTER
D: Very... So, who you working for these days Eric?
E: pause
C: ERIC
D: Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.
E: indicating uniform
C: CARTER
D: What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
E: smiling
C: ERIC
D: Oh, you've been watching television.
C: CARTER
D: Yeah, Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
E: pause
N: Eric smiles back.
C: CARTER
D: Brumby?
N: Eric shakes his head.
C: CARTER
D: Kinnear?
N: Eric shakes his head
C: ERIC
D: What's it to you anyway?
C: CARTER
D: I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
C: ERIC
D: That's not always a healthy way to be...
C: CARTER
D: And you should know, if I remember rightly.
N: A track announcement interrupts them.
C: CARTER
D: So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
C: ERIC
D: Making a living.
C: CARTER
D: Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
E: He can't resist it any longer. He lifts the sunglasses off Eric's nose and looks into his eyes.
N: Eric stares back.
C: CARTER
D: They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
C: ERIC
D: Still got a sense of humour?
C: CARTER
D: Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
E: He moves towards the saddling ring and turns to Eric.
C: ERIC
D: Can't say I do.
N: Carter looks across at the track.
C: CARTER
D: Don't miss the start on my account.
S: EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
N: Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.
S: INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON
N: Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.
S: INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results come over the car radio.
S: INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the entrance: The Heights. He drives on and parks.
S: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake, now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building surrounded by acres of woodland. Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. One of the men notices and shouts after him.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing Carter.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA, a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice. Ray bursts in.
C: RAY
D: Carter's here.
N: Eric jumps up.
C: ERIC
D: Where?
C: RAY
D: I don't know.
C: ERIC
D: You stupid shit!
N: Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss. Kinnear watches with some amusement.
C: KINNEAR
D: You see what it's like these days, Jack. You can't get the material.
N: Carter looks at Eric.
C: CARTER
D: Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
C: KINNEAR
D: Sit down, Jack, I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
E: pause to girl
C: CARTER
D: Scotch, please.
E: to Glenda
C: KINNEAR
D: Piss off, Ray.
E: to bouncer
N: Ray closes the door behind him. Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she sits beside him.
C: KINNEAR
D: Eric told me of your bereavement.
C: CARTER
D: Yep.
C: KINNEAR
D: Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
C: CARTER
D: No? Funny that. Neither did I.
C: KINNEAR
D: If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
C: CARTER
D: Yeah.
C: KINNEAR
D: Nasty way to go.
C: CARTER
D: Yes.
N: One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle- aged, northern businessmen.
C: HARRY
D: Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
C: KINNEAR
D: Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses. Give him the bloody bottle. Now, where are we?
E: He picks up his cards.
N: Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.
C: KINNEAR
D: Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
C: HARRY
D: You're bluffing, you bastard!
E: shaken
C: KINNEAR
D: That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
C: CARTER
D: Right. If you can afford it.
C: HARRY
D: Thought you were going soon.
E: to Carter
C: CARTER
D: Soon. When you've lost your money. Won't take long.
C: HARRY
D: Clever sod, aren't you?
C: CARTER
D: Only comparatively.
C: KINNEAR
D: Harry, I don't like to push, but could you let us know how much your hand's worth?
N: Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making sure that Carter gets an eyeful.
C: GLENDA
D: You know Sid Fletcher?
C: CARTER
D: What?
C: GLENDA
D: You know Sid Fletcher?
C: CARTER
D: I work for him.
C: GLENDA
D: Do you?
C: CARTER
D: Yes, I do.
E: amused
N: Carter looks back at the table. Kinnear pushes in some money.
C: HARRY
D: What's that? A hundred?
C: KINNEAR
D: That's right, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Your hundred, and another hundred.
N: Kinnear lays more cash on the table.
C: HARRY
D: What's that?
C: KINNEAR
D: That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
C: HARRY
D: Three hundred altogether?
C: KINNEAR
D: Three hundred altogether, Harry.
N: Glenda attracts Carter's attention again.
C: GLENDA
D: I know him too.
C: CARTER
D: Who?
C: GLENDA
D: Sid Fletcher.
C: CARTER
D: Oh, do you?
E: sending her up
C: GLENDA
D: Yes.
E: dumb
C: CARTER
D: No, do you really?
N: Carter turns to the table yet again. Harry nervously puts another hundred on the table. Kinnear purses his lips.
C: KINNEAR
D: I'll follow that and go two hundred.
N: Harry looks sick.
C: KINNEAR
D: You can always see me, Harry.
N: Harry sweats and then smiles nervously.
C: HARRY
D: All right. Two hundred.
C: KINNEAR
D: Ha.
E: raises an eyebrow
N: Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket. Glenda, shifts herself on the sofa.
C: GLENDA
D: Yes. I met him last year.
C: CARTER
D: Go on.
C: GLENDA
D: Oh yes. When he came up on business.
C: CARTER
D: Really?
C: GLENDA
D: He came to see Mr Kinnear.
C: CARTER
D: No.
N: Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game.
C: HARRY
D: What's that?
E: panicking
C: KINNEAR
D: That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
N: Harry sweats some more.
C: HARRY
D: Four hundred?
C: KINNEAR
D: That's right.
C: HARRY
D: You're not seeing me?
C: KINNEAR
D: No.
N: Harry smiles nervously. He counts some money out.
C: HARRY
D: I'll see you, then.
C: KINNEAR
D: Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
N: Harry nods. Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the table. Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen high.
C: GLENDA
D: We went about together.
C: CARTER
D: Really?
C: GLENDA
D: Yes, while he was here.
C: CARTER
D: While he was here. You went about together?
C: GLENDA
D: He was here for four days.
C: CARTER
D: Was he?
C: GLENDA
D: Could you do me a favour?
C: CARTER
D: Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
C: GLENDA
D: Could you please put my glass on the table?
N: Carter smiles and does just that.
C: KINNEAR
D: Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, have I? Go on, you're pulling my leg.
N: Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter.
C: KINNEAR
D: How about that, Jack? Old Harry thought I was having him on.
C: HARRY
D: Shut up.
N: Carter gets up from the sofa.
C: KINNEAR
D: Not going, Jack?
C: CARTER
D: I have to. Things to see to.
C: KINNEAR
D: Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
C: CARTER
D: Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
E: He points at Harry.
N: Eric opens the door and follows him out.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - HALLWAY - EVENING
N: Carter moves towards the front door.
C: ERIC
D: Jack! I didn't like that.
C: CARTER
D: You should have told me who you were working for.
C: ERIC
D: Cyril didn't like it, either.
C: CARTER
D: Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
C: ERIC
D: He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
N: Carter carries on walking to the front door. He opens it.
C: CARTER
D: He's right. Tell him to save the cost of the phone call.
N: Carter leaves. Eric signals Ray to follow him.
S: EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY
N: Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it like it was a toy. The yard is beside the River Tyne. In the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge. Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner, BILLY LAWS, approaches.
C: BILLY
D: What do you want?
E: suspicious
C: CARTER
D: What happened to this car?
C: BILLY
D: What's it got to do with you?
C: CARTER
D: This is my brother's car.
C: BILLY
D: Oh ay?
C: CARTER
D: Yeah.
C: BILLY
D: Well, he drove it into the river.
C: CARTER
D: Was the steering faulty?
N: Billy shakes his head.
C: CARTER
D: What about the brakes?
C: BILLY
D: Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
C: CARTER
D: How'd it happen, then?
C: BILLY
D: He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
C: CARTER
D: Was he?
S: INT. THE HALF MOON - NIGHT
N: A big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage. A trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number. Carter comes through the door. He pushes his way through the packed drunken crowd to the bar. Keith serves him.
C: KEITH
D: What you having, Jack?
C: CARTER
D: Large Scotch.
N: Carter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle. Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around and speaks to Carter quietly.
C: KEITH
D: Heard of a man called Thorpe?
C: CARTER
D: Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
C: KEITH
D: That's what he was saying about you.
E: picking up Carter's money
N: Keith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away. Keith returns.
C: KEITH
D: Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
C: CARTER
D: That's nice. What'd you tell him?
C: KEITH
D: Nowt.
C: CARTER
D: Good lad.
N: Carter watches the singer, then finishes his drink.
C: CARTER
D: See you later.
C: KEITH
D: Where you off to?
C: CARTER
D: Las Vegas.
E: smiling
N: Carter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody cheers. The woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs her hair and pulls her to the ground. Carter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, punching and scratching. Carter smiles and leaves.
S: EXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT
N: On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley. Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. Reluctantly, she comes.
C: CARTER
D: You all right now?
E: gently
C: DOREEN
D: Yeah.
C: CARTER
D: You coming to South America?
C: DOREEN
D: No.
N: Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection.
C: CARTER
D: Where you going to live, then?
C: DOREEN
D: At me friend's house.
C: CARTER
D: Where's that?
C: DOREEN
D: Wilton Estate.
C: CARTER
D: Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
N: Doreen nods.
C: CARTER
D: Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. There. Go and get your hair done.
E: He pulls out a wad of money, and peels off some notes.
C: DOREEN
D: Thanks.
E: Can't believe it
N: He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her.
C: CARTER
D: Be good. And don't trust boys.
N: Doreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack bar with the money to show her friend.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The front door opens and Carter enters. Standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with an envelope taped to it. Carter pockets the envelope and picks up the casket.
C: EDNA
D: That was left for you this evening.
E: O.S.
N: Carter walks past her into the sitting room.
C: EDNA
D: What is it?
C: CARTER
D: My brother, Frank.
C: EDNA
D: Is he staying the night?
C: CARTER
D: Funny. Can I phone London?
E: He puts the casket on a side table.
C: EDNA
D: It'll cost you.
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anna is undressing. She's alone. Pulling the short black- silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights. She looks at herself appreciatively. The phone rings. She flops on the bed and picks up the receiver.
C: ANNA
D: Hello.
N: A voice speaks on the end of the line.
C: ANNA
D: How I miss you. Stop it, darling.
E: She stretches herself out sexily and smiles.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: It's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in a rocking chair.
C: CARTER
D: I fancy you. I wish I was touching you right now...
E: looking at Edna
N: Edna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes. Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly.
C: CARTER
D: ...making love to you. I want to stroke you and kiss you all over. Where are you?
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anna is lying full-length on the bed.
C: ANNA
D: In the bedroom.
N: Carter speaks on the other end.
C: ANNA
D: My black underwear.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Edna rocks backwards and forwards.
C: CARTER
D: The sexy, silk ones?
E: quietly
N: Anna replies. He continues softly.
C: CARTER
D: Take your bra off. No, go on.
E: pause
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The scene as before.
C: CARTER
D: Now hold them. Gently.
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from side to side, eyes closed.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scene as before.
C: CARTER
D: Slowly. Imagine it's me.
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily. CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards and Anna's head moving from side to side.
C: CARTER
D: When we're in South America, we'll make love in the sun. Roll over... and make love again... and again... For me... I fancy you...
E: V.O.
N: THE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS.
S: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna groaning on the bed.
C: GERALD
D: What's the matter? You got gut trouble or something?
N: Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver.
C: ANNA
D: No, darling. Just doing some exercises, Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got in, so I must ring off. Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow.
E: into telephone pause
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Scene as before.
C: CARTER
D: Save it till Sunday. I'll be back then.
N: Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks. The front door bell breaks the mood.
C: CARTER
D: That'll be for me.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
N: Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt.
C: KEITH
D: Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
C: CARTER
D: How many?
C: KEITH
D: Four of them.
N: Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice floats out.
C: THORPE
D: Jack?
C: CARTER
D: Good evening.
C: THORPE
D: I'd like a word with you, Jack.
C: CARTER
D: That's nice.
C: THORPE
D: Confidential, like.
C: CARTER
D: You stay in the car. I'll come and listen. ( (He leaves the darkness and walks to the car.) What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
N: Thorpe holds out his hand.
C: THORPE
D: I've been asked to give you this.
N: He hands Carter a railway ticket. Carter smiles.
C: THORPE
D: Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
C: CARTER
D: That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train?
E: pause
C: THORPE
D: I've been asked to make sure you don't.
C: CARTER
D: Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
N: One of the men inside mutters.
C: MAN
D: Let's stop pissing about.
C: THORPE
D: Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.
N: Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.
C: THORPE
D: Right lads.
N: The front passenger door starts to open. Carter grabs it and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over his head. Blood spurts everywhere. The driver panics. He accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter spots him and begins to run.
C: CARTER
D: Thorpe!
E: roars
N: Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.
S: INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT
N: The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical music to match the dancing. Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he disappears down into the gents' lavatory.
S: INT. DANCE HALL - GENTS' LAVATORY - NIGHT
N: Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door. Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe jumps up, terrified.
C: CARTER
D: Time's up, Thorpey.
N: Carter smiles.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits. Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter and Thorpe come down the street.
C: CARTER
D: Hello, Keith, Stay there, Thorpey.
E: pause
N: He knocks on Edna's door. It flies open. Edna is furious.
C: EDNA
D: What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
C: CARTER
D: I'm sorry.
E: smiles
C: EDNA
D: You don't look it.
C: CARTER
D: No. Really, I am.
C: EDNA
D: Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he?
E: She points at Thorpe.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: What's going on? Have you no thought for others?
C: CARTER
D: We're going inside.
C: EDNA
D: Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
C: CARTER
D: Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot. Everybody knew there'd be trouble when you moved in.
N: Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house.
C: EDNA
D: You keep your trap shut, Ma.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: I'll send my old man to see you!
C: EDNA
D: And wouldn't he love it!
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
N: Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams the door.
C: EDNA
D: Where do you think you're going?
N: Carter opens the door to his room.
C: CARTER
D: Why don't you go and make us all a nice cup of tea?
N: Carter shoves Thorpe into the room. Keith follows.
C: EDNA
D: And what you going to do?
C: CARTER
D: Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
C: EDNA
D: I'll call the police.
C: CARTER
D: No, you won't.
E: He knows she fancies him
N: Carter closes the door.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers.
C: CARTER
D: Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've got a secret benefactor. It's nice to know that. Isn't it, Keith? There's only one trouble, I don't know who to thank.
E: He moves into the room and opens his briefcase, which is lying on the bed. He takes out a bottle of whisky.
N: Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and collapses into a chair.
C: CARTER
D: Now, I want to know who it is, Thorpey.
N: Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues wearily.
C: CARTER
D: All right. If you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about. Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something and I happen to know what that something is. Now stand up.
E: pause
N: Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe screams.
C: CARTER
D: Who paid you to see me off?
C: THORPE
D: I can't Jack. How can I?
C: CARTER
D: Yes you can.
N: Carter applies more pressure. Thorpe screams.
C: THORPE
D: No, don't Jack, don't.
C: CARTER
D: Who sent you, Thorpey?
C: THORPE
D: Brumby!
E: desperate
N: Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go. Thorpe groans and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony.
C: CARTER
D: There you are, you see. Now you could, couldn't you? And quickly.
E: pause
N: There's a knock on the door. Carter lets in Edna, who is carrying the teatray.
C: CARTER
D: Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
C: KEITH
D: Who's Brumby?
C: CARTER
D: Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
N: Keith nods.
C: CARTER
D: Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
C: KEITH
D: Yeah.
C: CARTER
D: Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
N: Thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair.
C: CARTER
D: Where's he living these days?
C: THORPE
D: He's got a new place at Burnham.
C: CARTER
D: Address?
C: THORPE
D: On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
C: EDNA
D: Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
E: furious
C: CARTER
D: Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
C: EDNA
D: Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
N: Thorpe's plaintive voice interrupts.
C: THORPE
D: Can I go now?
C: CARTER
D: You must be joking, Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
E: to Keith
C: EDNA
D: Now just a minute...
C: CARTER
D: Ta-ra.
C: THORPE
D: Don't let on I told you, for God's sake.
N: Carter laughs and closes the door.
S: EXT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT
N: It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang over everything. There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports cars. Carter parks and gets out. Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond. There, he promptly throws up. Carter watches from behind a tree. His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out. CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.
C: BRUMBY
D: Jesus wept!
N: MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: Now, Cliff, don't get mad.
C: BRUMBY
D: I'll murder the little bitch!
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: Cliff ...
N: Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.
C: SANDRA
D: Daddy!
C: BRUMBY
D: That's right, bloody Daddy.
C: SANDRA
D: I wasn't expecting you until three o'clock.
C: BRUMBY
D: And this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee, is it?
N: Brumby pushes past her into the house.
C: BRUMBY
D: Running bloody riot over my bloody furniture, drinking my bloody booze...
N: The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers out through the side door
C: BRUMBY
D: ... spewing over my fucking goldfish.
N: He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond. Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: Cliff ...
N: Brumby throws the boy out.
C: BRUMBY
D: Shut up, Phyllis. Sandra!
E: He walks back into the house.
N: Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom.
C: BRUMBY
D: Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.
N: Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.
S: INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT
N: Carter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs.
C: CARTER
D: Good evening.
N: Mrs Brumby jumps. The front door is open.
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: Who are you?
E: standing
C: CARTER
D: I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I want to see him.
N: Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably.
C: CARTER
D: It's urgent.
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: What's it about?
C: CARTER
D: Business.
C: MRS BRUMBY
D: I know all about Cliff's business.
N: Carter moves further into the room.
C: CARTER
D: Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers sent me.
N: Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later Brumby storms into the room.
C: BRUMBY
D: What the bloody hell's all this?
N: Carter doesn't move.
C: BRUMBY
D: You know what the bloody time is! It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
E: pause
C: CARTER
D: I know.
C: BRUMBY
D: Well?
N: Carter still doesn 't move.
C: BRUMBY
D: The wife says the Fletchers sent you.
N: Carter just looks at him. Weighing him up.
C: BRUMBY
D: What's so bloody important it couldn't wait till the morning?
N: Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to him. Brumby isn't his man.
C: BRUMBY
D: Listen, I'm not in the mood for bloody silly buggers.
N: Carter stands.
C: CARTER
D: I made a mistake.
C: BRUMBY
D: What?
C: CARTER
D: I made a mistake.
C: BRUMBY
D: What about?
C: CARTER
D: Never mind.
N: Brumby looks confused.
C: BRUMBY
D: It's not business?
N: Carter moves to the door.
C: CARTER
D: See you.
N: Brumby moves between him and the door.
C: BRUMBY
D: Listen, I don't like it when some hard nut comes pushing his way in and out my house in the middle of the night.
N: Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.
C: BRUMBY
D: Bloody well tell me who sent you.
C: CARTER
D: You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
N: Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck. Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt. Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.
C: CARTER
D: Good night, Mrs Brumby.
S: EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He finds the front door unlocked.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
N: Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.
C: EDNA
D: You sod.
C: CARTER
D: They came back?
C: EDNA
D: No.
E: sarcastically
N: Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. Edna looks at her torn dress.
C: EDNA
D: Look at this. You bastard.
N: Carter puts the glass on the table.
C: EDNA
D: You don't care a stuff, do you?
N: Carter takes out his phial of pills.
C: CARTER
D: I'll buy you another.
N: Carter swallows a pill.
C: EDNA
D: What about the lad? They took him away.
N: Carter shrugs his shoulders.
C: EDNA
D: What'll they do to him?
C: CARTER
D: Don't ask me.
N: Edna rubs her wrists.
C: EDNA
D: They bloody hurt me.
C: CARTER
D: You're lucky. They kill as well.
C: EDNA
D: And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
E: mocking him
N: Carter shakes his head.
C: EDNA
D: Thorpey nearly died laughing.
C: CARTER
D: That little shit!
C: EDNA
D: What about Keith?
C: CARTER
D: What about Keith?
C: EDNA
D: What you going to do?
C: CARTER
D: Pension him off.
C: EDNA
D: You're a bastard.
C: CARTER
D: What am I supposed to do? I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
E: angry
N: Edna shakes her head.
C: CARTER
D: So shut up.
C: EDNA
D: What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
C: CARTER
D: You wouldn't.
C: EDNA
D: How'd you know I wouldn't?
C: CARTER
D: 'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
E: smiling
C: EDNA
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: CARTER
D: Think about it.
N: Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open. She is wearing purple underwear.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner, led by the drum majorette.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say?' In the bed lie Carter and Edna. The distant sound of the marching band helps them surface.
C: EDNA
D: Are you awake?
C: CARTER
D: No.
C: EDNA
D: Do you want breakfast?
C: CARTER
D: You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well?
E: pause
C: EDNA
D: Uh-huh.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: Scene as before.
C: EDNA
D: Did you sleep well?
C: CARTER
D: Yes, thank you.
N: He puts his arm around her and moves on top.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads. They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It opens.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: Scene as before.
C: CARTER
D: Are you tired?
C: EDNA
D: No. Are you tired?
C: CARTER
D: No. I'm not tired, Do you eat breakfast?
E: pause
N: Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.
C: CON
D: Put us in it, Jack.
E: O.S.
N: Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide- bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their thirties.
C: PETER
D: Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.
C: CARTER
D: I might have guessed.
C: CON
D: Sorry about this. But there you are. Orders are orders.
C: CARTER
D: And what orders would they be, Con?
N: Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun.
C: CON
D: Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
C: PETER
D: We've got to take you back to London.
C: CON
D: He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
N: Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun.
C: CON
D: We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
C: PETER
D: But they have to be diplomatic.
N: Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.
C: CARTER
D: Right. Now take me back to London.
C: CON
D: It'd be best if you got dressed first.
E: smiling
N: Carter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked.
C: CON
D: Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
C: PETER
D: The gun he means.
N: Both men are laughing.
C: CARTER
D: Out.
N: Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at Carter's cock.
C: PETER
D: If Anna could see you now.
C: CARTER
D: Out.
C: CON
D: Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know we're going to take you back - sooner or later.
C: CARTER
D: Out.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: Con is the first to emerge from the front door.
C: CON
D: Mind you don't catch cold.
N: Peter follows.
C: PETER
D: I hope she's got understanding neighbours.
N: Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.
C: CON
D: See you when you've got your drawers on.
N: The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep. Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly backs into the house.
S: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
N: Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket. The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits. Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.
C: CARTER
D: Do us a favour?
C: EDNA
D: What, and get myself beaten up again?
C: CARTER
D: No chance of that.
C: EDNA
D: Not much.
C: CARTER
D: They're friends of mine.
C: EDNA
D: And that'll make me feel better?
C: CARTER
D: I don't want to get rough, do I?
N: Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the casket.
S: INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
N: Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place holding a handgun.
C: CON
D: Hold it! Where do you think you're going?
N: Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with the shotgun.
C: CARTER
D: Strawberry Fair.
N: He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's yard.
C: CARTER
D: In. Turn right. Open that door.
E: He points the gun at the coalshed.
N: Con unbolts the door.
C: CARTER
D: And go inside.
N: Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves quickly back to Edna and the car.
C: EDNA
D: What you going to do?
C: CARTER
D: I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
N: Carter jumps into the car.
C: EDNA
D: You coming back?
C: CARTER
D: How could I stay away?
N: The car roars off.
S: EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY
N: Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see. Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and sheets on the windscreen.
S: EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY
N: The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley, following after Carter.
S: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY
N: Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he scarpers for the pavement. Carter hits the Jaguar's door at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he is out of sight. Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.
C: PETER
D: Where were you, then?
N: Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.
C: CON
D: Bollocks.
S: EXT. BACK STREET - DAY
N: Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected garden.
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY
N: Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, SHAMIR.
C: CARTER
D: Keith in?
C: SHAMIR
D: Keith.
E: shouts
N: No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.
C: CARTER
D: Which is his room?
E: O.S.
S: INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY
N: Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, still in the clothes of the night before.
C: CARTER
D: What happened to you, then?
C: KEITH
D: How'd you find me?
N: Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow.
C: CARTER
D: Did they give you a rough time?
C: KEITH
D: No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
E: He lowers his head to the pillow.
C: CARTER
D: No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
E: pause
C: KEITH
D: Get knotted.
C: CARTER
D: All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
C: KEITH
D: Oh yes? How?
N: Carter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh.
C: KEITH
D: Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it?
C: CARTER
D: I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
N: He throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles.
C: KEITH
D: Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right.
N: Carter turns to leave. Keith continues, crying and angry.
C: KEITH
D: You even screwed his wife, didn't you?
N: Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him.
C: KEITH
D: The poor bastard didn't even know if the kid was his.
N: He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain.
S: EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
N: A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.
S: EXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY
N: The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.
C: CARTER
D: How were things between you and Frank?
C: MARGARET
D: He was all right to me.
C: CARTER
D: Nothing more? Just another feller?
C: MARGARET
D: Nicer than most.
C: CARTER
D: But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
C: MARGARET
D: Yes.
C: CARTER
D: Though nicer than most?
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. I can't help the way I am.
C: CARTER
D: Why'd you see him so regular?
E: ignoring the statement
C: MARGARET
D: Once a week?
C: CARTER
D: I call that regular.
C: MARGARET
D: He was gentlemanly. I like that.
C: CARTER
D: Once a week you like a gentleman?
C: MARGARET
D: Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
E: angrily She turns and walks slowly along the bridge.
C: CARTER
D: What was bugging Frank?
C: MARGARET
D: He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
E: pause pause She stops and looks over the bridge.
N: They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face and folds them up.
C: CARTER
D: I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, remember?
E: pause
C: MARGARET
D: It's the truth.
N: Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away.
C: MARGARET
D: It is. Honestly.
C: CARTER
D: You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
E: shouting
C: MARGARET
D: I don't know nothing.
N: Carter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before.
C: CARTER
D: Listen, the only reason I came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. And I won't leave until I do. You understand?
N: Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge. It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.
C: CON
D: Hello, Jack.
N: Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back to Margaret.
C: CARTER
D: You bitch! It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it?
N: He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans out, his usual cheery self.
C: CON
D: Peter's very upset about his car. He's going to shit all over you.
C: CARTER
D: I'll catch up with you later, Margaret.
N: And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.
C: PETER
D: Come on, get in.
E: shouts above the revs
N: Con does and they race off.
S: EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
N: Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.
S: EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY
N: Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind. He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see his parked car. As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car. A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down.
C: GLENDA
D: Over here, Jack.
N: Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off. The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre. Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill.
S: INT. SUNBEAM - DAY
N: Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take his eyes off her.
C: GLENDA
D: You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
C: CARTER
D: No. I didn't know that.
C: GLENDA
D: A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
C: CARTER
D: So where are we going, Princess?
C: GLENDA
D: To the demon king's castle, of course.
C: CARTER
D: Of course. Where else?
N: The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark.
S: INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY
N: Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around each deserted floor.
C: CARTER
D: How'd you know where I'd be?
C: GLENDA
D: You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
C: CARTER
D: Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
C: GLENDA
D: Nasty.
C: CARTER
D: He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
C: GLENDA
D: Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
C: CARTER
D: And what was that?
E: smiling
C: GLENDA
D: We're there now.
N: She brakes to a split-second stop.
S: INT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY
N: It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and walls where the lights will eventually be fixed. A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting sun. He is just a silhouette. Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby.
C: BRUMBY
D: A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. Do you like it?
E: pause
C: CARTER
D: Yes.
C: BRUMBY
D: Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
E: pause pause pause pause pause pause
N: Brumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter.
C: BRUMBY
D: Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
C: CARTER
D: What name?
C: BRUMBY
D: Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it.
E: pause
C: CARTER
D: Why?
C: BRUMBY
D: I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
C: CARTER
D: Why?
C: BRUMBY
D: I don't know. That's all I was told.
N: Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back towards the entrance.
C: CARTER
D: That's not good enough.
C: BRUMBY
D: Christ, what...
C: CARTER
D: Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
E: shouting pause
C: BRUMBY
D: Jack, you're wrong.
C: CARTER
D: Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
C: BRUMBY
D: Jack...
S: EXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY
N: Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops. Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said.
S: INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and a film projector stands close to the window, which has makeshift curtains. Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all over the place. They have just finished fucking.
C: CARTER
D: Who's setting you up in this place?
E: looking around
C: GLENDA
D: Brumby.
C: CARTER
D: Is he coming here?
C: GLENDA
D: Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
N: Carter plays with her hair.
C: CARTER
D: Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
C: GLENDA
D: He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
N: Carter kisses her neck.
C: CARTER
D: What does he want that bloody great country place for?
C: GLENDA
D: Entertaining.
E: knowingly
C: CARTER
D: What kind of entertaining?
C: GLENDA
D: Now you're asking.
N: Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points.
C: CARTER
D: Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
C: GLENDA
D: Especially when I play the lead.
E: giggling
N: Carter wraps his arms about her.
C: CARTER
D: Did Kinnear say anything? After I'd left the other night?
N: Glenda sits up sharply.
C: GLENDA
D: That's why you waited for me.
C: CARTER
D: Not entirely. No.
E: kissing her on the neck
C: GLENDA
D: You sure about that?
C: CARTER
D: Sure I'm sure.
N: Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed.
C: GLENDA
D: You bastard.
N: Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'. A zoom back reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.
S: INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still running. She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off the tap.
S: INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him. The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. Glenda is there to greet them. The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine. Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen. Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film. Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed. The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in. Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift. Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves. Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize Doreen. Carter watches. Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.
S: INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.
C: CARTER
D: I want to give you an Oscar.
C: GLENDA
D: You've been watching the film.
E: laughs
C: CARTER
D: Tell me about the girl.
C: GLENDA
D: What girl?
C: CARTER
D: The young girl. Who pulled her?
C: GLENDA
D: I don't know.
C: CARTER
D: Was it Albert?
C: GLENDA
D: Shouldn't think so.
C: CARTER
D: Is it one of Kinnear's films?
C: GLENDA
D: Yeah.
C: CARTER
D: Who set it up? Eric?
C: GLENDA
D: Yeah.
C: CARTER
D: Then he must have pulled her.
C: GLENDA
D: Expect so.
C: CARTER
D: Did my brother Frank find out?
C: GLENDA
D: Your brother? What you talking about?
N: Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there.
C: CARTER
D: You're a lying bitch.
N: Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering, nearly drowned.
C: CARTER
D: Now tell me the truth.
C: GLENDA
D: The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
C: CARTER
D: And you didn't know her last name?
C: GLENDA
D: No.
C: CARTER
D: Well, it's Carter. That's my name, And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
E: pause
N: He pushes her ahead of him.
S: EXT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY
N: Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the boot.
C: CARTER
D: Get in.
N: Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car scorches away.
S: EXT. JETTY. TYNE FERRY - DAY
N: Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves down the gangway towards it.
S: INT. CAFE - DAY
N: A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The door slams open. There's Carter.
C: CARTER
D: Where's Albert?
N: The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs her by the throat.
C: CARTER
D: Where's Albert?
N: The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as he grabbed her.
C: CARTER
D: I know where I'll find him.
S: EXT. BACK STREET - DAY
N: Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.
C: GIRL
D: Eric, he's come for Albert, I don't know, On the ferry, I reckon.
E: V.O. pause pause
N: Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.
S: INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY
N: Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and doesn't see him.
C: CARTER
D: Hello, Albert.
N: Albert looks like he's going to be sick.
C: ALBERT
D: Hello, Jack, I don't know anything, Jack.
E: snivelling
C: CARTER
D: Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
C: ALBERT
D: I know. I know.
N: Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the toilets.
C: CARTER
D: Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert?
N: At first Albert doesn't understand.
C: CARTER
D: Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert?
N: This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter follows.
S: EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY
N: Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him down. Albert faces him.
C: CARTER
D: You can't get away from me, Albert.
C: ALBERT
D: I know.
N: He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.
C: ALBERT
D: For Christ's sake, give us a fag.
N: Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.
C: ALBERT
D: I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
C: CARTER
D: Did Eric Pake pull her?
C: ALBERT
D: Yes.
C: CARTER
D: How?
C: ALBERT
D: I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
C: CARTER
D: When did you find out?
C: ALBERT
D: A couple of weeks back.
C: CARTER
D: How?
C: ALBERT
D: No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
C: CARTER
D: Who?
C: ALBERT
D: Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
C: CARTER
D: And you told Brumby?
N: Albert nods.
C: CARTER
D: Who killed Frank?
N: Albert doesn 't answer.
C: CARTER
D: Do you want to be dead, Albert?
C: ALBERT
D: Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
E: pause
C: CARTER
D: What did you do? Albert?
C: ALBERT
D: Nothing. What could I do?
C: CARTER
D: Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
C: ALBERT
D: Yes. I told him.
C: CARTER
D: What did he say?
C: ALBERT
D: 'Good.'
N: Albert draws deeply on his cigarette. They drove Frank away in a car.
C: CARTER
D: Is that all there is?
N: Albert nods.
C: CARTER
D: Then that's it, Albert.
N: Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud click. It's a. knife.
C: ALBERT
D: Jack, for Christ's sake ...
N: He falls to his knees.
C: CARTER
D: You knew what I'd do.
C: ALBERT
D: Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
E: crying
N: Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.
C: CARTER
D: I know you didn't kill him. I know you didn't.
E: and again.
N: A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, twitches, and is dead.
S: INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY
N: Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.
S: EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY
N: The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging across the water.
S: INT. FERRY - DAY
N: Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and two young children take his attention. His look is tinted with regret even remorse.
S: EXT. JETTY - DAY
N: As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter standing alone. He's holding Con's handgun. Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric shouts.
C: ERIC
D: No shooters. Cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard.
C: PETER
D: Get stuffed. He's reloading.
C: CON
D: Gerald wants to see him first.
C: PETER
D: Shut up.
N: Carter is listening to all this.
C: CARTER
D: Are you coming in? Or do we piss about all day?
E: shouting
N: Eric laughs.
C: ERIC
D: You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
C: CARTER
D: Not till I'm dead, Eric.
N: Eric laughs.
C: ERIC
D: Oh, you've still got your sense of humour? Tell him how I've fixed him, Con.
C: CON
D: He's told Gerald about you and Anna.
C: ERIC
D: Didn't believe us at first, did he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.
C: PETER
D: Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked us to take you back - alive.
C: ERIC
D: He's probably talking to her right now. Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face?
N: Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit sadder? Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry. Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves himself into position, Carter is waiting.
C: CARTER
D: Stay where you are, Peter.
N: Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even raise his shooter.
C: PETER
D: Don't.
E: screaming
N: There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he hits the deck, he's dead. Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out of range.
C: ERIC
D: Carter, your car needs a wash.
N: Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done. Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car. Carter watches impassively.
S: EXT. BRUMBY'S RESTAURANT COMPLEX - DAY
N: Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise carpark.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Brumby and two architects in a site meeting. Plans are laid out on a table.
C: BRUMBY
D: I don't want them cooking in here. You can put a hatch in that wall.
S: INTERIOR DECORATOR
N: Yes, it's all a question of ... The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him.
C: BRUMBY
D: Who in Christ's name is that? It's a bloody madman.
N: He strides away to investigate.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below, Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for the concrete spiral staircase.
S: EXT. STAIRCASE - DAY
N: Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around the corner.
C: BRUMBY
D: Jack!
N: Carter slams his fist hard into his gut.
C: CARTER
D: You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
C: BRUMBY
D: I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
S: INT. BACK STREET POST OFFICE - EVENING.
N: It's a combined shop and post office. Carter is on the phone.
C: CARTER
D: The guy on the swing-bridge? OK.
E: pause
N: Carter hangs up. He takes a can of film from his pocket and slips it into a large envelope. At the counter two women are talking.
C: FIRST WOMAN
D: They don't know how it happened.
C: SECOND WOMAN
D: How far did he fall?
C: FIRST WOMAN
D: What did Betty say... Ninety floors, I think it was.
C: SECOND WOMAN
D: Really. Was he dead?
C: FIRST WOMAN
D: Oh, yes.
N: The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant. It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1.
C: SECOND WOMAN
D: Better to go quick like that.
S: EXT. SWING-BRIDGE - EVENING
N: The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made island in the middle of the river. On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside ladder. A man waits for him at the top. The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it. Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as Carter disappears down the outside ladder.
S: INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT
N: The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards. Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as everybody starts talking again. Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. The next game starts up.
S: EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT
N: Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. Carter follows them and turns up a side street.
S: EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT
N: The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her friend chat for a moment and part. Carter follows Margaret.
S: EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
N: The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding Con's handgun.
C: CARTER
D: I've come for you, Margaret.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. Different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear.
C: ERIC
D: Gerald Fletcher wants a word with you Cyril.
N: Kinnear crosses to the telephone.
C: KINNEAR
D: Hello, Gerald.
S: EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT
N: Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The hire car is parked alongside.
C: CARTER
D: It's Carter. Listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. All it takes is one call to the police.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kinnear listens.
C: KINNEAR
D: Really? So?
E: pause
S: EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT
N: Carter into phone.
C: CARTER
D: I'll do a simple deal with you. All I want is ...
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kinnear is still listening to Carter. He looks over at Eric, who's fixing a drink.
C: KINNEAR
D: I see. I think that can be arranged.
N: Kinnear continues listening.
S: INT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT
N: Carter into phone.
C: CARTER
D: ... but I don't want him there until six in the morning. OK? Right.
E: pause
N: Carter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: The noise of the wild party is heard off. Eric comes into the room.
C: ERIC
D: You want something, Cyril?
C: KINNEAR
D: Yes, Eric. A word with you.
S: EXT. DESERTED WOOD - NIGHT
N: Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes bouncing over rough ground.
S: INT. HIRE CAR - NIGHT
N: Carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on. He turns to Margaret.
C: CARTER
D: Get out.
N: Carter and Margaret get out. They appear in the beam of the headlights and move further into the wood.
S: EXT. WOOD - NIGHT
N: Carter and Margaret stop.
C: CARTER
D: Take your clothes off.
N: Margaret is confused. Take your clothes off. Margaret does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her knickers.
C: CARTER
D: Keep your pants on. Lie down.
E: pause
N: Again she obeys. He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then stuffs a gag in her mouth. He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by the gag. Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under. Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT
N: Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The party is still going on.
C: KINNEAR
D: I want you to listen very carefully. Jack Carter, You know what he looks like?
E: pause
S: INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the phone.
C: MAN
D: Yes.
N: He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He listens until the line goes dead. The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and switches off the light. Darkness.
S: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
N: Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN
N: Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's house. The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road. There's the sound of a phone being dialled.
C: CARTER
D: Police.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
N: A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around the building. A chief constable opens the front door and walks in.
S: INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
N: The police move through the house and grounds. In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on. Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret.
S: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
N: The house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances. The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In the early-morning light, they look like dolls. Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate.
S: INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN
N: Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his left. The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal loader for tankers. This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes.
S: EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN
N: Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. Carter follows. At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below. Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly above him. Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's playing cat and mouse with Eric.
C: CARTER
D: You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
E: calling out
C: ERIC
D: Sod off.
E: wheezing
N: Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the gun up. Eric stops and looks up.
C: CARTER
D: Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart.
N: Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach. Carter starts after him.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
N: Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting. In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke. Carter appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and starts running.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
N: Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and panics. He stumbles and falls over. He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland. Carter follows.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
N: On the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left. It's deserted. In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore. Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. Carter closes on him.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
N: Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine. Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable. Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on his heels. Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too exhausted to get up. Carter stands over him.
C: CARTER
D: Stand up, Eric. Stand up.
E: panting slightly
N: Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch out of his pocket.
C: CARTER
D: I bet you could use a drink, could you, Eric?
N: He throws the bottle to Eric.
C: CARTER
D: Eh? Have a drink.
C: ERIC
D: Still got your sense of humour.
N: Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a terrible state.
C: CARTER
D: Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want you to drink all of that. Do you understand? Drink up. Just like it was with my brother, Frank. Go on, son. Drink up.
N: Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and runs down his face.
C: CARTER
D: Drink up, Eric.
N: Eric begins to stagger about.
C: CARTER
D: It was you who poured it down him. Eh, Eric?
N: Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No mercy there.
C: CARTER
D: Did you all have a good laugh, eh? Did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up? The whisky is pouring all over Eric's face and suit.
N: It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing comes up.
C: CARTER
D: Drink it! Drink it! Did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top?
N: Eric is choking.
C: CARTER
D: Don't stop, Eric.
N: Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the shotgun. Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough.
C: CARTER
D: Goodbye, Eric.
N: Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on Eric's head.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
N: Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over and everything is gone. Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get rid of it.
S: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
N: Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his death. The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.
S: EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING
N: Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. He's dead.
S: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
N: Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and is soon lost as he drops out of sight.
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
