S: INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.
N: The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of Indian music - MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk. The electronic PEEP of the cash til. A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes her place second in the queue. The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.
C: MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
D: One forty-nine please.
C: MARGARET
D: How much is the milk?
C: MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
D: Forty-nine pence. Thank you. MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man wired into an ipod.
E: taking the change
S: EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.
N: MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in hand.
S: INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS, sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her head.

D: Too much. Much too much butter.
C: DENIS
D: I like butter.
C: MARGARET
D: Milk's gone up.
N: MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding it down on a table.
C: MARGARET
D: 49p a pint.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: Good grief! We'll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. Or take in paying guests! He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
E: chuckles
C: DENIS
D: Watch out. She's on the prowl. MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a distant corridor, steady on the approach.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Eat your egg. JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now sitting tapping open her egg.
E: to DENIS
C: JUNE
D: Goodness! There you are. JUNE's look of quiet concern.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. MARGARET eats her egg.
C: MARGARET
D: Here we are. But for JUNE, she is entirely alone.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
N: WHISPERING-
C: JUNE
D: I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important -
N: MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.
C: JUNE
D: Please just make it really clear. Who's on after you?
E: CONT'D
C: POLICE GUARD
D: Dixon.
N: MARGARET slips away.
S: INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.
N: MARGARET hurries through the hall.
S: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.
N: A wide cupboard- MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her, her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill. JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back, letting in the sunlight-
C: JUNE
D: Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it.
N: The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill- He reaches for a suit.
C: MARGARET
D: No no no no. The grey.
C: DENIS
D: You sure?
E: O.S
N: The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across one sleeve-
C: MARGARET
D: Yes.
N: Distant footsteps-
C: MARGARET
D: ...Definitely the grey.
E: CONT'D
N: JUNE returns, oblivious-
C: DENIS
D: Righty ho. Boss knows best.
E: O.S
N: JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted carnage on the front page.
C: DENIS
D: Don't let her take my paper away.
E: CONT'D
N: JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear.
C: JUNE
D: Sorry.
N: JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.
C: DENIS
D: Atta-girl.
N: DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway, soaping his face with shaving cream- He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-
C: DENIS
D: Damn.
E: O.S CONT'D
N: MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-
C: MARGARET
D: Blot it...Blot it..
N: She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in the corridor, looking back at her
C: JUNE
D: Sorry ?
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs and memorabilia of a former political life. MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS' ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET peers out- Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car. They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door, clearly concerned. One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing of the guard as he drives off in the BMW. SUDDENLY from behind-
C: DENIS
D: Now look what you've done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in?
N: MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -
C: DENIS
D: I'll be off then.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there.
N: Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary carrying a cardboard box.
C: SUSIE
D: Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ? How are you feeling ?
E: concerned
C: MARGARET
D: I'm fine, thank you Susie.
C: SUSIE
D: I've just been reading about the bombings.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. Frightful.
N: SUSIE's mobile goes off. She fumbles in her bag to switch it off.
C: SUSIE
D: Sorry.
C: SUSIE
D: These are the books for you to sign. I brought as many as I could find. Shall we go through your appointments?
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.
C: SUSIE
D: We said we'd go through them today.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET nods-
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, of course, dear. Today.
C: SUSIE
D: The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month.
N: The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-
C: SUSIE
D: I said no because you've got a concert that afternoon but if you'd like to..?
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: SILENCE-
C: SUSIE
D: ....It looks like a very interesting programme.
E: O.S CONT'D
N: MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted-
C: MARGARET
D: What are they playing?
N: SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles back through the diary-
C: SUSIE
D: I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein.
N: `SHALL WE DANCE' FROM `THE KING & I" SUDDENLY BREAKING THROUGH AS IF FROM ANOTHER TIME CARRYING INTO....
S: INT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.
N: An orchestra in full flight- A programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's hand reaches in and her hands slips into his.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window.
C: MARGARET
D: Silly man.
N: MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street below. He looks up, smiles,
C: MARGARET
D: He hasn't got his scarf on.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk for her benefit before passing the Postman who is shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front step, below. SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs, The Downing Street Years. MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret Thatcher. Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat, she writes the name Margaret Roberts... The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another
T: time cuts through -
S: INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
N: The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead- The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out to reveal- BEATRICE ROBERTS [early 50's] austere, crouched next to MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED ROBERTS [early/mid 50's] a cumbersome man and MURIEL ROBERTS [21 yrs]. The sound of an air-raid siren.
C: ALFRED
D: Did someone cover the butter?
N: All look at one another in a panic.
C: MARGARET
D: I'll go.
N: Suddenly MARGARET scrabbles out from under the table, all look on with horror-
C: BEATRICE
D: Leave it.
C: ALFRED
D: Margaret-
E: CALLING AFTER
S: INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
N: MARGARET scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly over the thin slice of butter left in the butter dish before sliding it into the cold cupboard underneath the counter. SUDDENLY the shop illuminates- A DISTANT EXPLOSION. MARGARET momentarily paralyzed before, running back towards the back parlour to resume her place under the table.
S: INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
N: MARGARET scrabbles underneath. ALFRED surreptitiously pats her arm.
C: ALFRED
D: Good girl.
E: CONT'D
N: She shrugs, flushing with pride.
C: ALFRED
D: Tomorrow, no matter what they do, it'll be business as usual.
E: CONT'D
N: The DRONE of the air raid dissolving away-
S: INT. SHOP, GRANTHAM. 1945. DAY.
N: A boy and girl look on as MARGARET measures flour on the shop scales.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Two of the small beef, Mr. Roberts.
E: O.S.
N: MARGARET glances up at her father serving further down the counter.
C: ALFRED
D: What is the life blood of any community? It's business....
E: O.S.
S: INT. HALL. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY
N: ALFRED on a small town hall stage behind a makeshift podium.
C: ALFRED
D: Not just big business but small businesses, like mine.
N: The SOFT press of MEN all around, MARGARET, a lone woman amongst them, peering over shoulders.
C: BEATRICE
D: Margaret!
E: passing/hushed aside
N: BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.
C: BEATRICE
D: CUPS!
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.
C: ALFRED
D: We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Sometimes we're plain bloody minded.
N: NOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea and washing up cups.
C: ALFRED
D: But we also believe in helping each other. And I don't mean by state hand-outs...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.
N: MARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the street at- THREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement. PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1 Margaret, do you want to come to the pictures? MARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and GIGGLING. PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 She can't come, she's got to study. The FLUSH of MARGARET'S skin - PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 (CONT'D) Miss Hoity Toity! The STING OF EMBARRASSMENT. THE SENSE OF THE PRETTY GIRLS WHISPERING ABOUT HER, EYES TRAVELLING OVER her disparagingly.
C: ALFRED
D: Never run with the crowd, Margaret. Go your own way.
E: V.O.
N: The SWAY of a SKIRT as they walk away.
C: ALFRED OOV
D: Open it then.
E: close to
S: INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.
N: Close on a telegram addressed to MARGARET ROBERTS, 1-3 North Parade, Grantham. MARGARET'S father ALFRED, watching.

E: looking up
N: ALFRED bear-hugs MARGARET awkwardly.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: MARGARET at her desk, the ghost of a smile.
S: INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY
C: ALFRED
D: Don't let me down Margaret.
N: The CHINK of a teacup- MARGARET looks down the corridor in expectation at BEATRICE standing at the sink working the SQUEAK of the cloth against a stubborn tea stain.
C: MARGARET
D: Mother?
E: calling out
N: BEATRICE comes down the corridor into the shop, wiping her hands on a cloth. ALFRED goes to hand BEATRICE the letter.
C: BEATRICE
D: My hands are still damp.
E: shakes head
N: BEATRICE turns and walks back to where she came from. MARGARET looks back at the letter, heart bursting, trying to contain her joy.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: MARGARET looks down, pen in hand, the words Margaret Roberts newly signed in the front cover. She tears the page out.
S: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.
N: MARGARET napping in bed. The still of the bedroom, caught in the half light of a late afternoon- A hand slides a teacup onto the bedside table - The flicker of MARGARET's eyelids- QUICKFLASH -
C: BEATRICE
D: Margaret!
E: passing/hushed aside
N: BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.
C: BEATRICE
D: CUPS!
E: CONT'D
N: PRESENT - MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake. DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of spectacles, wrapping wire around one of the arms with a pair of pliers. Other items of clothing of his are on Margaret's couch.
C: DENIS
D: They're talking about you again.
E: without taking his eyes of the job
N: The murmur of JUNE on the phone- MARGARET What time is it?
C: DENIS
D: Sun's not quite over the yard arm. Time for tea.
N: A phone rings, O.S. MARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and confronts the extraordinary head-gear.
C: MARGARET
D: What have you got on your head?
N: DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously-
C: DENIS
D: Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress?
N: MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones almost audible.
C: MARGARET
D: You look ridiculous.
N: MARGARET strains to hear-
C: DENIS
D: Bosslady no like?
N: She makes a shushing motion.
C: MARGARET
D: No, Denis, Bosslady no like.
E: as if to a bad dog
N: MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of life just audible outside-
C: JUNE
D: It's taken Carol so long to get her to agree to this. She's been so reluctant to let his things go.
E: O.S
N: DENIS sinks onto the bed, bored.
C: MARGARET
D: Feet.
E: without looking
N: He tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don't dirty the bedspread. MARGARET stands, ear pressed close to the open door-
C: JUNE
D: You can never be sure she's taking her medication...I think sometimes she hides them..
E: O.S
C: DENIS VO
D: Oh, rumbled!
N: MARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills resting in the tea cup. She considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks.
C: JUNE
D: She's definitely more distracted than usual today.
E: O.S
S: INT/EXT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
N: A shout in the street. A woman's voice.
C: CAROL OOV
D: Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car.
N: Margaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi, remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and waving her credit card at him with rising irritation.
C: CAROL OOV
D: Well then take the sticker off! I call that false advertising! I would say keep the change, but there isn't any change.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: A scotch being poured. The cap not quite going back on the whisky bottle. A frantic fumble for the remotes for the tv.
C: CAROL OOV
D: Hello June, any news? I've brought every bag I could find.
N: High shot of MARGARET sitting in a chair watching TV. As if she has been there a while. CAROL enters with suit carriers in her arms.
C: CAROL
D: Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver. Wouldn't take my card. I said don't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash. Can you believe it? I was rummaging around the bottom of my bag. He didn't get a tip.
C: MARGARET
D: I didn't know that you were dropping by today, dear.
C: CAROL
D: Yes, you said yesterday...You wanted to make a start on Dad's things. The cupboards ? Then I can help you dress.
E: Dumping her stuff all over the place
N: MARGARET, nonplussed.
C: CAROL
D: You've got Michael and-
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Jaqueline...
C: CAROL
D: Coming for dinner tonight.
C: MARGARET
D: Of course. We're having halibut.
E: turning up the TV
N: On TV, images of a bombed street,
C: CAROL
D: Oh God. Isn't it terrible?
N: MARGARET nods, both silently listening to the drone of the newscaster-
C: CAROL
D: They think it's Al Quaida -
E: CONT'D
N: The charred remains of cars, desperate people running, a rescue operation midway- MARGARET blinks, inwardly reeling from the images-
C: MARGARET
D: Denis!
E: V.O
N: Quick Flash: Denis in pyjamas, brushing his teeth in a hotel bathroom, glances at her through the open door.
C: DENIS
D: It'll be fine. Come on, get your head down, it's ten to three, for God's sake.
S: EXT. GRAND HOTEL. BRIGHTON. 1984. NIGHT.
N: Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the bomb. The injured are pulled through the rubble.
C: NEWS READER
D: At ten to three this morning an explosion extensively damaged the Grand Hotel in Brighton, scene of the Conservative Party conference.
E: V.O.
N: NEWS READER 2 (V.O.) ...Where the Prime Minister and a number of her cabinet were staying. They escaped unhurt - The WHIR of SIRENS- The BLUR of FIRE ENGINE LIGHTS- The image of a BODY being stretchered out of the rubble by FIREFIGHTERS. NEWS READER 3 (V.O.) Five people have died, many others are injured, some critically. The IRA have claimed responsibility. DENIS and MARGARET sit in their coats covering MARGARET's evening dress and DENIS pyjamas. Both looking out in silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on the glass of the car windows. MARGARET looks on with quiet, sobering despair, still numb with shock. DENIS looks at her. He grips her hand. They sit, fingers locked.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: Close on MARGARET's hand and whisky glass. Shaking.
C: MARGARET
D: We must release a statement, offering our condolences.
E: standing up
C: CAROL
D: I'm sure they've already-
C: MARGARET
D: We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists.
N: MARGARET sees JUNE and CAROL exchange looks of `oh dear...'
S: INT.BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DUSK.
N: MARGARET sits in a dressing gown at a dressing table, staring at her reflection. CAROL stands behind her, holding up several dresses.
C: CAROL
D: Now ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight?
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, below the knee I should think.
N: She watches, irritated, as CAROL reaches to move a pile of DENIS' clothes-
C: MARGARET
D: No! Don't move those. I haven't finished sorting them.
E: CONT'D
N: CAROL settles beside her on a chair.
C: CAROL
D: I hear you went out today...You mustn't go out on your own Mummy. We've talked about that.
C: MARGARET
D: There was no milk.
C: CAROL
D: Call Robert he'll get it for you if June's not up-
C: MARGARET
D: I am not for the knackers yet.
N: From behind-
C: DENIS
D: Now take it easy, Margaret.
E: O.S
N: DENIS just visible, perched on the bed, looks up from doing the crossword in the newspaper-
C: CAROL
D: No one is saying that.
C: MARGARET
D: If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to. Really Carol, please don't fuss about it. You've always been like this, fuss fuss fuss. You must find something better to do with your time. It's most unattractive in a woman. When I was your age the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother.
N: Silence- CAROL, inwardly stung quietly busying herself, forcing all emotion away. MARGARET hesitates catching DENIS' eye, with quiet warning.
C: DENIS
D: Four down, 9 letters.
N: DENIS withdraws into his crossword.
C: DENIS
D: Something b something t something n...something something somthing...Refusal to change course-
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Obstinate.
N: DENIS writes, pleased. CAROL looks up, with quiet bemusement-
C: CAROL
D: What?
N: MARGARET deflects, pointing to a necklace in CAROL's hands.
C: MARGARET
D: Pearls. I'll wear the pearls.
N: CAROL slips them onto MARGARET'S neck and fastens them.
C: MARGARET
D: There they are. My little twins. Thank you, dear.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. EVENING.
N: The murmur of conversation- CAROL tails MARGARET, steady on the approach towards the drawing room.
C: CAROL
D: It's nearly all familiar faces, William, Michael and his lovely wife-
C: MARGARET
D: Jacqueline.
N: CAROL smiles, clearly reassured-
C: CAROL
D: And then there's Peter, James R and James T and that very nice man-
N: DISTANT LAUGHTER
C: MARGARET
D: Yes-
C: CAROL
D: - we met last year.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes I remember-
C: CAROL
D: I think he's bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit. We're rather short on women - but I'm sure we'll manage-
C: MARGARET
D: I've always preferred the company of men-
N: CAROL gestures ahead, MARGARET nods, reticent, yet forcing herself on, she hesitates at the door, her hand trembling on the handle.
C: CAROL
D: Ma?
S: INT. CORRIDOR.DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
N: Close up of a shoe being rubbed on a calf. A young hand hesitating on a door handle.
S: INT. SITTING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
N: A 1950's drinks party- A bank of stuffy GREY SUITED MEN pontificating and their WIVES lost in a separate polite conversation-
C: GREY SUITED MAN
D: Ah, Miss Roberts. Hoping to be chosen as our candidate for parliament.
N: A young MARGARET [24yrs] stylish in a suit, straight from work, stands clutching her handbag, oddly out of place amidst the neat 50's chintz. A bank of sporting prints collage a wall. A bespectacled YOUNG DENIS THATCHER (30's) glances up from his drink, taking her in.
S: INT.DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.EVENING.
N: The MURMUR of dinner party conversation-
C: MARGARET
D: Well I don't like coalitions, never have...
N: MARGARET's POV of her fingers absently grazing a confusing array of cutlery laid out in place setting in front of her. Her confused face.
C: DENIS VO
D: Start on the outside...
S: INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
N: DENIS whispers.
C: DENIS VO
D: ...and work your way in.
N: A long table packed with silverware. She looks back at her ornate and rather hideous starter, a tiny wobbling savoury confection in aspic.
C: PORTLY HOST
D: ...Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words.
C: GREY SUITED MAN
D: They'll be nationalizing the bloody air next.
C: MALE GUEST
D: Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's government property!
C: PORTLY HOST
D: So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts?
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of Grantham.
C: PORTLY HOST
D: And a grocer as well!
C: MARGARET
D: Yes.
N: Ears prick up around the table. The Host is lost for something to say.
C: HOSTESS
D: And did you help, err, in the...shop?
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, yes. It was a family business.
C: GREY SUITED MAN
D: A very good starting point for the political life, I'm sure.
C: MARGARET
D: That and a degree from Oxford.
N: The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to smile. MARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork, working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres.
S: INT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING.
N: MARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers.
C: MARGARET
D: (hushed aside to
C: WAITER)
D: Whisky.
N: The MURMUR of conversation all around-
S: INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
N: Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her theme.
C: MARGARET
D: What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do, they must just get up and do. And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and DO something about it, change things.
N: The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from someone.
C: PORTLY HOST
D: With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham-
C: MARGARET
D: Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too.
C: MALE GUEST
D: Really?
N: A general sense of quiet incredulity.
C: MARGARET
D: I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income. Just like the man or woman on the street, when I am short one week, I have to make economies the next.
C: GREY SUITED MAN
D: Nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility.
C: MARGARET
D: A man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping.
C: MALE GUEST
D: I'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need. They see industry being nationalized, the unions on the up, the pound on the slide...whoever can sort that lot out - he's my man.
C: MARGARET
D: Or woman?
N: Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and hostess exchange looks. He signals `Get them out of here'. The men rise.
C: HOSTESS
D: Ladies shall we ?
C: PORTLY HOST
D: Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.
N: The ladies scurry to the sitting room. Margaret is the last to leave.
S: INT. SITTING ROOM. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.
N: As Margaret closes the door to the dining room -
C: PORTLY HOST
D: Well. That's told us!
E: O.S.
N: The men laugh raucously. She turns to the ladies who are regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with suspicion.
S: INT.DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
N: EVENING. The aftermath of the muted dinner party- MARGARET at the helm, a small whisky just visible nestled next to her wine glass. She is flushed and nicely mellow surrounded by mainly MALE GUESTS-
C: MICHAEL
D: So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you'd been Prime Minister?
N: MARGARET looks at him, her flicker of bemusement. ...slowly registering across the faces of her FRIENDS and COLLEAGUES including CAROL.
C: MARGARET
D: Where?
C: CAROL
D: The bombings, mummy. Today?
N: MARGARET still lost
C: CAROL
D: We were just talking about them?
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET deflects, reaching for her glass, it trembles unsteady in her grasp.
C: MARGARET
D: No, uhm, yes - we have always lived alongside evil. But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion.
C: MALE GUEST
D: So, would you -
C: MARGARET
D: Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age. Unimaginable!
N: Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening party-
C: PETER
D: The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.
N: Laughter-
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
N: NIGHT. MARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away as another couple approach.
C: MARGARET
D: You don't mind if I sit down...
N: Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's hand.
C: FEMALE GUEST
D: I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself.
N: MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering-
C: MARGARET
D: It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone.
N: The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside her, waiting to depart.
C: FEMALE GUEST
D: Well anyway, I...thank you.
C: MARGARET
D: Good night to you.
N: MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of Carol saying final farewells.
C: CAROL
D: Great to see you, thank you very much for coming.
E: O.S.
C: MALE GUEST
D: Oh, thank you. It was lovely, absolutely lovely. And I'm so pleased to see your mother looking so well.
E: O.S.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT.NIGHT.
N: A mirror lined dressing room- CAROL helps MARGARET with her shoes.
C: CAROL
D: OK...hold on to me...that's right.
N: MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls
C: MARGARET
D: Can you do the clasp, I can't quite -
N: CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes. Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls-
C: MARGARET
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
N: CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to MARGARET, staring back at their reflections.
C: CAROL
D: You've got an eyelash.
N: CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger, holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile-
C: CAROL
D: Make a wish.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET, closes her eyes until- MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles.
C: CAROL
D: I spoke to Doctor Michael today-
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET glances away, deflecting.
C: CAROL
D: He is very good and very expensive-
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET ignores her-
C: CAROL
D: ...I know you're not due to see him for another month but I've spoken to him and he can fit you in tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
N: SILENCE-
C: CAROL
D: Just for a check up. Ma please-
E: CONT'D silence
C: MARGARET
D: What does Mark think about it?
C: CAROL
D: Mark?
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. Tell him to come up. I want to talk to him about it.
N: CAROL, hesitates, with concern-
C: CAROL
D: Mark's with Sarah and the children.
N: MARGARET nods, heading through into the bathroom.
C: MARGARET
D: Well tell him to come up and see me after he's kissed them good night, would you Carol darling?
S: INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.
N: MARGARET, sitting on her bed, glances expectantly towards the door. Carol sits down beside her.
C: CAROL
D: He's not here Mummy.
N: MARGARET hesitates, CAROL using all her might, not to crumble under MARGARET's cool gaze-
C: CAROL
D: Mark lives in South Africa...
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET inwardly flinches.
C: CAROL
D: ...you are not Prime Minister anymore and Dad is...Dad is dead-
E: CONT'D
N: Silence-
C: MARGARET
D: You look exhausted, dear. You really must try to get some sleep. Taxis'll be few and far between at this hour...
C: CAROL
D: Righty-ho. Night night Ma. Sleep well.
C: MARGARET
D: Good night, dear.
N: The slam of a door. MARGARET sits, alone.
S: INT. SADLERS WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.
N: MARGARET'S POV of Denis turning to her in the theatre. He smiles. MARGARET's FINGERS absently grazing over the programme, in time with the music- SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal a sugar mouse. Margaret's fingers reach for it, but it's teasingly withdrawn. Finally, she takes its. She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with happiness-
S: INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.
N: MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association. Winning candidate Mr Dodds had better watch out, this bright young woman is on his tail.
N: DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He slides them down in front of her.
C: DENIS
D: Eat!
N: MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.
C: MARGARET
D: Disaster.
C: DENIS
D: Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...
N: DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.
C: DENIS
D: You shaved thousands off their majority. You did splendidly.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Not splendidly enough.
C: DENIS
D: Ah I see. Self pity.
N: MARGARET eyes him, mid chip-
C: DENIS
D: No one is saying you don't need a safe seat. You deserve a safe seat. But it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: What game?
N: She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.
C: DENIS
D: You are a grocer's daughter-
C: MARGARET
D: -And proud of being-
E: fiercely
N: He grabs her hand, silencing her.
C: DENIS
D: - in their eyes. A single grocer's daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman-
N: For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise.
C: DENIS
D: You'd get to parliament, and I'd get to be the happiest man in- in wherever they select you. Margaret, will you marry me?
E: CONT'D SILENCE
N: She is genuinely stunned.
C: DENIS
D: Well ?
E: CONT'D
N: She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head and smile.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. Yes!
N: He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-
C: DENIS
D: What ?
C: MARGARET
D: I love you so much but...I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter.
C: DENIS
D: We'll get a help for that.
E: trying to retain the moment
N: He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a little.
C: MARGARET
D: No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup.
N: He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first time.
C: MARGARET
D: I mean it Denis, say you understand.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: That's why I want to marry you, my dear.
N: She kisses him. A CHINK of a TEACUP- They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing- A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the tea cups, and generally tidying.
C: DENIS
D: Now eat.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET smiles her joy at him as `SHALL WE DANCE' swells. And now she's in his arms as they dance, swirling through the election debris, eyes only for each other.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
N: NIGHT. MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them momentarily catching her eye until- A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read. MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD out. Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make the DVD player work until, suddenly... Super 8 footage - 1959 Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea. Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.
C: MARGARET
D: There they are, my little twins. Mark...
N: DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her work.
C: DENIS
D: Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody hell... Look at `em, little imps. You never really got golf, did you?
N: DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown, watching the footage. She sips her whisky.
C: MARGARET
D: You look happy.
C: DENIS
D: Yes, I do, don't I? You're drinking too much.
N: MARGARET ignores him.
C: DENIS
D: Whatcha doing?
E: CONT'D
N: DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search-
C: DENIS
D: Not like you. Looking back.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET SUDDENLY presses rewind on the remote, clutched in her hand.
C: DENIS
D: Don't want to dig around too deep, M. Don't know what you might find.
E: CONT'D
N: The rapid rewind of Denis swinging his golf club.
C: DENIS
D: You can rewind it, but you can't change it.
E: CONT'D
N: She freezes the image of him turning to camera, laughing.
C: MARGARET
D: They grow up so fast.
N: Margaret turns with something to say, but Denis doesn't seem to be there anymore.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.NIGHT.
N: Now on the screen, Mark on a swing. MARGARET'S face softens.
C: MARGARET
D: Mark.
N: He turns and rushes towards the camera, whooshing past it. Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room, running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping. MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out and down the corridor of Chester Square, seeing the Mark and Carol disappear round a corner.
S: INT. HALLWAY. HOUSE. FARNBOROUGH. KENT. 1959. DAWN.
N: The view beyond-
C: SPEAKER VO
D: Mr Eric Deakins, Labour... 13,437...
N: The CRUNCH of gravel as CAROL and MARK race across the drive towards a blue ford car, covered with Tory blue streamers and a VOTE FOR THATCHER poster scrawled with the words Victory.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.
N: NIGHT. MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them momentarily catching her eye until- A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read. MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD out. Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make the DVD player work until, suddenly...

C: DENIS
D: Yes, I do, don't I? You're drinking too much.
N: MARGARET ignores him.
C: DENIS
D: Whatcha doing?
E: CONT'D
N: DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search- MARGARET fingers brush dark panelled walls, making her way along endless corridors. Gothic arches, venerable busts, wood panelling and stone. MARGARET's pov as she stays to the side of the impressive corridor. She passes men in suits and groups. Others come towards her and notice her. Her POV as she pushes open a first door `TEA ROOM' - a circle of men turn round in chorus as if something with three heads has appeared. POV of a second opening door marked MEMBERS. A row of urinals. Two headless bodies come towards the camera, scrambling to zip up their flies. POV of the promise of sanctuary. LADY MEMBERS. The door opens onto a cupboard sized space. An ironing board. A sea of men's Oxford shoes from ground level. A pair of woman's shoes appear amongst them. They go on tip toe. From above we see Margaret's hat amongst the sea of mens heads and shoulders. Margaret is carried along in the sea of MALE MP's OXFORD SHOES. AIREY NEAVE [Extremely dapper, friendly 43] approaches MARGARET.
C: AIREY NEAVE
D: Mrs Thatcher ! Airey Neave. Welcome to the madhouse. Follow me.
N: The doors swing open-
S: INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER. 1974. DAY
N: MARGARET, now SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION, on the front bench, wearing a neat blue suit and a hat, a phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late 50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the bench. MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking their order papers in her face. The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is almost lost in the bedlam.
C: SPEAKER
D: The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education.
C: MARGARET
D: The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!
N: Cries of `Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.
C: MARGARET
D: Because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy. Teachers cannot teach when there is no heating, no lighting in their classrooms. And I ask the honourable gentleman, whose fault is that?
E: CONT'D
C: SHADOW MINISTER
D: Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down!
N: The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats, laughing... falsely of course. But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her, on the government benches, who are also sniggering in agreement.
C: MARGARET
D: If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself!
N: Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug: smiling, pointing a finger at her.
C: SHADOW MINISTER
D: Why has this Conservative government failed? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs?
N: It brings the OPPOSITION benches to their feet, shouting, applauding, stamping...
S: EXT. WESTMINSTER STREET. 1974. DAY
N: MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street for a Cabinet Meeting. All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their filthy, putrid contents onto the street.
C: SHADOW MINISTER VO
D: Minister, the breakdown of essential public services - transport, electricity, sanitation is not the fault of the trades unions but of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve!
N: The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects that as she picks her way through.
S: INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1974. NIGHT.
N: The ranks of BESPECTACLED GREY-SUITED MINISTERS at the Cabinet table, including GEOFFREY HOWE.
C: HEATH
D: So these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise.
N: EDWARD HEATH is in mid-flow.
C: HEATH
D: The miners are asking for a 35% increase in wages. Obviously we can't go anywhere near that. The unions are not our enemies and never have been. We want - and have always wanted - the broadest consensus...
E: CONT'D
N: The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE MINISTERS.
C: HEATH
D: I'm sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for the moment that will further inflame the current situation.
E: CONT'D
N: MINISTER 1 Hear hear, Prime Minister. MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.
C: HEATH
D: - the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors. Yes, Education Secretary.
E: Finally acknowledging Margaret
C: MARGARET
D: Yes...
N: All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in her voice.
C: MARGARET
D: Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation.
E: CONT'D
N: SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT. A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'.
C: HEATH
D: Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute.
N: A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness. MARGARET holds the small torch.
C: HEATH
D: Thank you, Margaret.
E: CONT'D
N: A snigger, then the lights flicker back on.
C: HEATH
D: Your thoughts are duly noted.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head, `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look as she's caught by a memory.
C: ALFRED
D: We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers.
E: O.S.
S: INT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT.
N: The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on stage.
C: ALFRED
D: He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us.
N: The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst, YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow.
C: ALFRED
D: We Conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential, especially the young. There's no good in pretending we're all equal, we're not all the same, never have been, never will be. We should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have, for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN
N: ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays.
C: VOICE ON THE RADIO
D: It's 1974 and you'd think it was WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a mess. Heath should resign now and make way for someone who's not afraid to tackle the unions.
N: CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through.
C: CAROL
D: I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky.
C: MARGARET
D: Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward.
C: MARGARET
D: One must be brave if one is to take the wheel-
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL
D: Right-o.
C: MARGARET
D: Move over... Move to your right a little bit...
C: CAROL
D: But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road?
C: MARGARET
D: Carol!
C: CAROL
D: Well he's in the way!
C: MARGARET
D: To the right. Move to the right! A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone CYCLIST-
C: MARGARET
D: So sorry! Terribly sorry! MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic.
E: CONT'D
C: CAROL
D: Hey, look at me, driving! CAROL's squeals of delight, let loose on the open road. The tyres screech on the corner.
S: INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN.
N: Laughter - VOICES on the approach-
C: CAROL
D: Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I really feel I've got a handle on it now.
N: CAROL and MARGARET entering kitchen, still giddy from their adventure.
C: CAROL
D: You should have seen us, Pa.
E: CONT'D
N: DENIS in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting to make breakfast -
C: MARGARET
D: Have you been trying to make breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis!
N: DENIS scrapes down the toast, eggs boiling in the pan.
C: DENIS
D: I can boil a bloody egg.
C: CAROL
D: Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere. All over the place -
C: MARGARET
D: I've decided. I'm going to run. MARGARET smiles, a growing resolution gripping her.
E: sudden/cutting in
C: DENIS
D: What for?
C: MARGARET
D: I'm going to run for Leader of the Party. CAROL'S utter disappointment on seeing she has lost MARGARET already.
C: CAROL
D: Silly me!
N: CAROL storms out of the kitchen.
C: DENIS
D: Good luck!
E: calling after
C: CAROL
D: All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change!
E: O.S.
C: MARGARET
D: What's she on about?
C: DENIS
D: It's her driving test this morning!
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, right. Of course.
C: A BEAT. DENIS
D: Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister?
C: MARGARET
D: What I'm saying is that someone must force the point, say the unsayable. None of these men have the guts. MARGARET sees the burnt toast and energetically starts clearing up and putting more bread under the grill.
E: with false patience
C: DENIS
D: The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT. He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs from the pan.
C: MARGARET
D: But he's weak, and he's weakened the party. One must know when to go. You're shaking. She reaches out.
E: glancing at him
C: DENIS
D: I can do it! DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying.
C: SILENCE. MARGARET
D: Goodness me! What is the matter with everyone this morning? A beat. He looks utterly fragile.
C: DENIS
D: I've told you what the matter is. The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest.
C: MARGARET
D: And do you need a rest?
N: It's almost challenging. He doesn't answer and she doesn't notice.
C: MARGARET
D: We both know that it's highly unlikely that I would ever be elected leader, I'll never be elected leader. But I will run. I will run. Just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which the Conservative Party must stand. There's so much to do. She smiles.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: You're insufferable, Margaret, do you know that?
E: sotto voce
C: MARGARET
D: Denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that. And it is my duty -
C: DENIS
D: Don't call it duty. It's ambition which has got you this far. Ambition. And the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to hell! The SLAM of the door, DENIS gone-
E: interrupts
C: DENIS
D: Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
E: O.S. CONT'D
S: INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT
N: MARGARET and DENIS sit on the sofa.
C: MARGARET
D: Where did you go?
C: DENIS
D: South Africa.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes.
S: INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN
N: MARGARET eats breakfast alone, engrossed in the newspaper.
C: DENIS
D: How many days passed before you realized I was gone? Probably had to ask the cleaning woman where I was.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT
N: MARGARET grips her whiskey, shaking her head.
C: MARGARET
D: When did I lose track of everyone?
C: DENIS
D: Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT.
T: Cutting in -
C: INTERVIEWER
D: Mrs Thatcher I understand you recently visited the United States of America.
E: O.S.
N: MARGARET'S attention is caught by an old interview, playing on the TV. She leans forward. On screen, she sits in a neat hat, leaning forward eagerly.
C: INTERVIEWER
D: What was it you took away from that visit which may be of value here in Great Britain?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. STUDIO. LONDON. 1975. NIGHT
N: MARGARET perched on a chair, smiling at the TV INTERVIEWER -
C: MARGARET
D: Oh that's rather easy to answer, actually. They are unafraid of success.
S: INT. REECE'S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY
N: MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor. She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to NEAVE's bluff. She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife from the shires. And she wears a hat.
C: MARGARET ON TELEVISION
D: We in Great Britain and in Europe are formed mainly by our history. They on the other hand are formed by their philosophy. Not by what has been, but by what can be. Oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes. Oh yes!
N: MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment. REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little unsettling until-
C: REECE
D: Well er...For a start, that hat has got to go. And the pearls. In fact I think all hats may have to go. You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we've already got her vote. You've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it more-
C: AIREY NEAVE
D: Important.
C: REECE
D: Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority.
C: AIREY NEAVE
D: Methinks the Lady doth screech too much
C: REECE
D: People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader. MARGARET stares at him.
C: MARGARET
D: It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of them. Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.
C: REECE
D: If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.
C: NEAVE
D: You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
C: REECE
D: Absolutely.
C: MARGARET
D: Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party. NEAVE moves in intently-
C: NEAVE
D: Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself. MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical.
C: REECE
D: Leave us to do the rest.
C: A BEAT MARGARET
D: Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable. MARGARET smiles at them.
S: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM. NATIONAL THEATRE. LONDON. 1975. DAY
N: MARGARET stands humming, a THEATRICAL COACH presses her hand to MARGARET'S stomach.
C: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
D: And...bring it down. MARGARET hums lower, tries to project her voice.
C: MARGARET
D: Maaaaaaaaaaaa.
C: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
D: Good, I think we can loose the handbag, Mrs Thatcher...Hands down the sides...Because this isn't really about the voice, it's about belief...A nice deep breath. REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the performance. DENIS, though present, is having a crafty fag by the window.
C: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
D: If you're calling Mr Thatcher, how would you do that? MARGARET looks over at him.
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Denis. He doesn't react.

D: Denis.
E: a little more authority
C: THEATRICAL VOICE COACH
D: That's right, one more time, deep breath - She puts on her new, lower voice.
C: MARGARET
D: Denis. And DENIS reacts immediately, like a guilty thing surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly towards her.
C: DENIS
D: Yes MT!
S: EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY.
N: MARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a white cap on her head.
C: MARGARET
D: You are the backbone of our nation! Small firms like Loveday's Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to meet you ladies.
N: General merriment as MARGARET, now inside an ice-cream van, has a go at dispensing an ice cream from the machine.
C: MARGARET
D: I'll just have a small one, because I'm watching my figure. That's for you young man!
E: CONT'D handing the cone out

S: EXT. FACTORY. LONDON. 1975. DAY
N: MARGARET is standing on an impromptu stage outside a factory. She has a hard hat on her head.
C: MARGARET
D: The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them. It stops them from working. It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees. I say enough. It's time to get up. It's time to go to work. It's time to put the Great back into Great Britain!
S: INT. HAIR SALON. 1975. DAY
N: The bouffant is now apparent. REECE AND NEAVE watch in awe.
S: INT. BACKSTAGE. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY
N: A darkened backstage. MARGARET, clutching her speech, goes over her lines. A FEMALE AIDE sprays her hair. She looks up, starts to move towards the light. AIREY NEAVE is suddenly next to her.
C: NEAVE
D: Give `em hell! He looks her up and down, with a smile.
C: NEAVE
D: You look magnificent. Next stop Prime Minister.
E: CONT'D

C: ANNOUNCER
D: The leader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher! MARGARET pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle to the sound of GROWING APPLAUSE.
S: INT. MAIN HALL. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY
N: BRITAIN NEEDS THE CONSERVATIVES bannered overhead and hung with Union Jacks. MARGARET a swathe of blue, as she passes through her GREY SUITED CABINET. From behind she stands, arms outstretched, accepting the applause, a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands before a sea of CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES holding up letter cards WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE! Wedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a kind of rapture. The blessed Margaret ! DENIS just visible with REECE, HOWE, PYM, HESELTINE and several other GREY SUITED MINISTERS of her cabinet, seated close behind now jumping to their feet, with obvious relief and delight - RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE, FLASH BULBS POPPING MARGARET smiles, glorious, catching DENIS' eye. He is brimming with pride. AIREY NEAVE beams at his protegee.
S: INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

C: NEAVE
D: Good night Margaret. My money's on the filly to win!
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight.
N: He laughs and drives towards the exit of the car park. As MARGARET closes the boot and opens the door to get in the car suddenly there's a MASSIVE EXPLOSION, the sound magnified by being in the cavernous underground. For a few seconds we don't know what's happened. Through the smoke we see MARGARET running up the ramp towards us.
C: MARGARET
D: No. No, no! Airey!
E: CONT'D
N: Her POV of the fireball of Neave's car. As Margaret looks in horror at the scene. Her shattered face.

N: MARGARET on the podium.
C: MARGARET
D: Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help. That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much. And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win!
N: The black streak of MARGARET'S car, a blur of colour, faces, waving flags - TV footage of polling night. Swingometers, pollsters, impressionistic snatches of reported speech. More footage of PEOPLE coming out of polling stations. Jubilant crowds applauding.. MARGARET, silhouetted in her iconic stance, arms aloft...
S: INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.
N: MARGARET peering out of the window, hands sunk in the lap, a flash of the Royal blue fabric of her skirt, clenched in fingers.

C: DENIS
D: This is it, steady the buffs old girl.
N: He clasps her hand for a moment as MARGARET smiles at him. The door swings open-
S: EXT. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.
N: The CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side-
C: MARGARET
D: I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi: Where there is discord may we bring harmony... Where there is error may we bring truth... Where there is doubt may we bring faith... Where there is despair may we bring hope..
N: The CAMERA rises up, high above MARGARET until she is just a blue dot, on the dark tarmac, a lone woman standing facing the circle of cameras and microphones. The door of Number 10 looms ahead.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.
N: The cheers go over .. The CABINET gathering for a group shot-
C: MARGARET
D: Shoulders back, tummies in!
N: Laughter. Michael Heseltine, standing behind MARGARET, reaches out to smooth a stray lock of her hair.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. Thank you, Michael.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET seated at the heart of her entire CABINET, as if she is royalty. The FLASH of the CAMERA - the image frozen.
S: INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
N: The same image, framed on a side table beside MARGARET. The distant hum of a hoover.
C: MARGARET
D: I'm perfectly healthy. There's no need for any of this.
N: Denis appears, his hand inside his shoe, polishing it vigorously.
C: DENIS
D: Just let them look under the bonnet, MT. Check everything is hunky dory.
N: MARGARET hesitates. She sits in silence until-
C: MARGARET
D: Really it's becoming quite tiresome.
C: DENIS
D: What is?
C: MARGARET
D: You. I was on my own for twenty four years before I met you and I can manage perfectly well without you now. So will you please go away and stop bothering me.
E: beat
S: INT. CONSULTING ROOM. HARLEY STREET. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY
N: A distinguished consulting room- MARGARET sits silent, as an EMINENT DOCTOR checks her blood pressure. The beep of the machine, steady and monotonous until-
C: DOCTOR
D: Just look straight at me, straight ahead, that's it.
N: The DOCTOR scribbles some notes, considering-
C: DOCTOR
D: Are you noticing night sweats?
E: CONT'D

D: No.
C: DOCTOR
D: Sleep?
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, I sleep. Four, five hours a night.
C: DOCTOR
D: So you wake early?
C: MARGARET
D: And I stay up late. I always have. She looks at him as if he really should know this about her. The DOCTOR notes this down.
C: DOCTOR
D: We just want to keep abreast of it.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. Of course.
C: DOCTOR
D: Grief is a very natural state.
C: MARGARET
D: My husband has been gone for years. Cancer.
C: DOCTOR
D: Carol says you've decided to let his things go. Probably a good thing.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam. Perfectly good stuff. People can use these things.
C: DOCTOR
D: Still it must be a bit disorientating. You are bound to be feeling.
C: MARGARET
D: What? What am I `bound to be feeling'? The DOCTOR looks up from his note taking, hearing the quiet challenge in MARGARET's voice.
C: MARGARET
D: People don't `think' any more. They `feel'. `How are you feeling?' `Oh I don't feel comfortable with that' `Oh, I'm so sorry but we, the group were feeling...' D'you know, one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings than thoughts and ideas. Now thoughts and ideas. That interests me. Ask me what I am thinking- The DOCTOR hesitates, letting MARGARET settle until-
E: CONT'D beat beat
C: DOCTOR
D: What are you thinking, Margaret? MARGARET looks at the DOCTOR, quietly struggling with a fury, threatening to unleash-
C: MARGARET
D: Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Watch your words, for they become actions. Watch your actions, for they become habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think, we become. My father always said that. And I think I am fine. But I do so appreciate your kind concern. The sudden and persistent buzz of an intercom-
E: beat beat
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, do please answer that.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET holds his gaze, with quiet unwavering steel unsettling the DOCTOR a little.
C: MARGARET
D: It might be someone who needs you. The DOCTOR reluctantly answers his intercom-

N: JUNE heads up the stairs, MARGARET following behind.
C: JUNE
D: I'll give Carol a quick ring, let her know we're back, then I'll put your electric blanket on.
N: MARGARET nods. Looking through the bannisters, her eyes fall on- A golf ball running along the floor. MARGARET considers, looks up-
C: DENNIS OOV
D: Steady, steady, steady! Damn. Fore!
N: The ball bounces down the wooden stairs.
S: INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DUSK.
N: MARGARET opens the fridge. A cold plated lunch resting on a shelf.
C: DENIS
D: What about that medicine man, eh? Ah. Cold supper. Standards are slipping Margaret. MARGARET ignores DENIS taking out the plate unwrapping the cellophane off it and placing it on a table, already laid ready for her to eat.
C: DENIS
D: Well you really gave it to that quack didn't you, darling ? Just like the old days! Hallucinations my eye! DENIS picks up a piece of cucumber from her plate. She absently smacks at his hand.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: How dare he? DENIS smiles.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: But then you give us all the run around, don't you? MARGARET looks at him, silently infuriated.

C: DENIS
D: I know you can hear me, sweetheart, so there's no use pretending you can't. MARGARET turns, ignoring him.
C: MARGARET
D: Enough. Denis, enough!
C: DENIS
D: Dismissed!
E: saluting
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
N: MARGARET sits reading DENIS' spy novel.
C: DENIS
D: She does it in the end. Kills him- MARGARET slams the book closed.
C: DENIS
D: I don't know why you're being so scratchy. MARGARET's eyes dart to the clock.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: It's not as if you've got anyone else to talk to.
E: CONT'D
N: Shaking her head, MARGARET tries to block him out.

D: When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride -
E: V.O.
C: DENIS
D: You know, it's a marvel to me that you can still quote huge chunks of Kipling but try remembering the name of that woman who's just made you that godawful cold collation... No? Come on... you can do it... month of the year... one syllable... rhymes with moon
C: MARGARET
D: June. MARGARET turns to DENIS, a quiet appalling victory.
E: sudden/like a lightbulb
C: DENIS
D: June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there in the end. "When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride, He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside, but the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail. For the female of the species is more deadly than the male..." As he continues, MARGARET reaches for the remote, turns the television on. She moves onto the radio. Then the stereo. She moves on, talking to herself- A gradual growing cacophony of sound-
S: INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
N: MARGARET flicks on mixers, radios, toasters-
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.
N: The noise almost unbearable now- MARGARET turns on a hi-fi, the TV now on-
C: MARGARET
D: If I can't hear you then I can't see you. And if I can't see you then you are not here. MARGARET closes her eyes.
C: MARGARET
D: And if you are not here, I am not going mad. I will not...I will not go mad. She opens them and suddenly freezes on seeing an image of herself, bewildered and leaving Harley Street, caught on the TV-
E: CONT'D
C: BBC VOICEOVER
D: Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her doctor today. Although rarely seen in public, Lady Thatcher, the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century, remains a controversial figure. MARGARET turns up the volume to full, trying to hear over the cacophony of noise the changing images on the TV illuminating her pale face.
C: JUNE
D: Margaret-
N: MARGARET barely sees her, eyes riveted to the TV.
C: BBC VOICE OVER
D: Almost lovingly dubbed by the Soviets The Iron Lady, she's also credited, with her friend Ronald Reagan, with a decisive role in the ending of the Cold War. Her supporters claim she transformed the British economy and reversed the country's post-war decline. Her detractors blame her savage public spending cuts and sweeping privatization of - JUNE moves like a dervish through the house, muting the television and turning off the last of the appliances- A gradual silence descends until- MARGARET takes in the image of herself on the mute screen, standing bewildered on the steps of Harley Street.

E: almost to self
S: INT. BATHROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

C: DENIS
D: Am I out of the doghouse yet?
E: O.S.
N: Then a pair of glasses. More gently, MARGARET'S hand reaches into the cupboard and takes the glasses in her hand.
S: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT.
N: MARGARET lies in bed, book in her lap, DENIS beside her reading the paper. She closes the book and pulls off her reading glasses.

D: They're unveiling that portrait of me at Number 10 next month. The invitation's on the mantelpiece. So there'll be Churchill, Lloyd George and me. Just the three of us.
C: SILENCE- MARGARET
D: I said I didn't want any big fuss but they insisted..
E: CONT'D
C: SILENCE-
D: Lovely little article in The Telegraph... The Woman Who Changed the Face of History.. SILENCE-
N: Voices from the past intrude -
C: FOOT VO
D: Less than two years ago, the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis and talked about bringing faith, hope and harmony to this country. MARGARET suddenly reaches out a hand, her hand shaking-
C: MARGARET
D: Denis? She turns in bed. Sudden panic, DENIS is gone-
N: A HECKLING CHAMBER RISING THROUGH-
S: INT. CHAMBERS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY.
N: A HECKLING chamber as MARGARET sits, facing LABOUR OUTRAGE, the labour leader, FOOT, grips his paper, mid speech-
C: FOOT
D: Can the Right Honourable Lady deny, that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934-
N: MARGARET bides her time on the front bench, waiting her turn, surrounded by her CABINET MINISTERS including HOWE, PYM and HESELTINE-
C: FOOT
D: The biggest fall in total output in steel and coal production in one year since 1931. And the biggest collapse in industrial production since 1921.
E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET remains seemingly calm and serene, and yet one hand quietly grips the bench, her wedding ring tapping against the wood nervously.
C: FOOT
D: Can she also accept that her free market economics designed to create a growing middle class ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant!
E: CONT'D

S: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1980. EVENING.
N: CLOSE UP on a button - The STEADY IN and OUT of a needle pulling taut on a thread. MARGARET stands, swathed in a glittering long dinner dress, a SEAMSTRESS stitching a stray button on the front of the bodice on her dress. Geoffrey Howe stands nearby in a dinner jacket.
C: HESELTINE
D: May we have a word, Prime Minister?
N: A bank of MINISTERS, including HESELTINE, PYM, PRIOR, HOWE and GILMOUR, gather before her.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, but in order to arrive at the palace on time, Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that door in 15 minutes. As you can see -
C: HESELTINE
D: I know you're running late Margaret, but we have to address this situation in light of tomorrow's blistering press coverage. Blistering! The knives are out. Your draft budget's been leaked, Geoffrey, they are baying for our blood!
C: HOWE
D: Michael we can't possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty.
N: The SCRATCH of PRIOR's hand on unkempt hair-
C: HESELTINE
D: No one is saying we have to buckle.
C: PRIOR
D: But is this really the time to make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced?
C: HESTLETINE
D: We need a plan of action, Margaret.
C: PYM
D: Absolutely. A strategy.
C: GILMOUR
D: We must be armed.
C: PRIOR
D: Agreed.
N: MARGARET stiffens, the needle momentarily hovering mid stitch as MARGARET shifts a little- The SEAMSTRESS resumes sewing-
C: PRIOR
D: There's a perception, Margaret rightly or wrongly, that we are now completely out of touch with the country.
E: CONT'D
N: The patronizing tone inflames her.
C: MARGARET
D: Really. How much is a pack of Lurpak?
E: beat
C: PYM
D: Lurpak?
C: MARGARET
D: Butter, Francis. Forty two pence. Anchor butter is forty pence. Flora margarine, still the cheapest, is thirty eight pence. I can assure you I am not out of touch.
E: silence
N: Another MINISTER - GILMOUR - whispers the words: "Grocer's Daughter" - as a put down. The men smirk. MARGARET has caught the moment. A sudden flash of the pretty girls in the Grantham Street long ago, laughing at her.
C: MARGARET
D: What - did you say?
E: CONT'D
N: GILMOUR makes a gesture.
C: GILMOUR
D: Nothing. Nothing, Prime Minister.
N: MARGARET is furious.
C: MARGARET
D: Don't try to hide you opinions. Goodness me, I'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them - instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. Well?
N: MOMENTARILY SILENT- MARGARET's eyes travel around the room in waiting-
C: PYM
D: Well, people can't pay their mortgages.
C: GILMOUR
D: The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees.
C: PYM
D: Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes. It's terribly shameful.
C: GILMOUR
D: The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace -
C: HESELTINE
D: - if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election-
C: PYM
D: Quite right.
C: MARGARET
D: Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?
N: They make noises - to the effect that nothing could be further from the truth. But MARGARET has their measure.
C: MARGARET
D: Gentlemen, if we don't cut spending we will be bankrupt. Yes the medicine is harsh but the patient requires it in order to live. Shall we withhold the medicine? No! We are not wrong. We did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: MARGARET
D: The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy and we will do just that! Barring a failure of nerve.
E: CONT'D
N: The SNAP OF COTTON - MARGARET looks at them in a cold fury...
C: MARGARET
D: Anything else?
E: CONT'D
N: SILENCE- MARGARET nods to the seamstress, dismissing her-

E: CONT'D
N: MARGARET straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away.
C: HOWE
D: You can't close down a discussion because it's not what you wish to hear.
C: MARGARET
D: I don't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. But what kind of leader am I if I don't try to get my own way - to do what I know to be right.
C: HOWE
D: Yes. But Margaret, one must be careful of testing one's colleagues' loyalty too far.
N: MARGARET glances up watching the MINISTERS disappearing, in whispered conversation, like conspirators. (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Rioting in Brixton, burning cars, huge civil unrest -

E: turning round shaking a cocktail
C: MARGARET
D: You're dead, Denis.
C: DENIS
D: Ah. Well, if I'm dead... who are you talking to? Shall we dance ?
N: He takes Margaret in his arms. The music changes to `Shall we Dance' from `The King and I' as DENIS takes a confused MARGARET in his arms and begins an expansive waltz round the room. The room turns. YOUNG DENIS dancing with the YOUNG MARGARET. Now its OLD DENIS dancing with OLD MARGARET again. DENIS loses his footing, and MARGARET lurches towards the desk where her eyes fall on figurines of Falklands soldiers. She stares hard.
C: NEWS READER
D: The Falkland islands, the British Colony in the South Atlantic, has fallen. Argentina claims its marines went ashore this morning as a spearhead to capture key targets, including the capital, Port Stanley.

C: MARGARET
D: Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta - which is a fascist gang - has invaded our sovereign territory. This cannot be tolerated. May I make plain my negotiating position. I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs. The Falkland islands belong to Britain, and I want them back. Gentlemen, I need you to tell me today if that is possible.
C: ADMIRAL LEACH
D: Possible... just, Prime Minister. We can have a Task Force ready to sail in forty-eight hours.
N: MARGARET is visibly stunned.

D: Why were the islands left without any naval protection?
C: JOHN NOTT
D: In the last round of Defence cuts we judged the risk of invasion to be small.
C: MARGARET
D: Did we?
C: JOHN NOTT
D: And if you remember, Prime Minister, you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum.

D: So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They're thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically... insignificant, if you'll excuse me -
C: MARGARET
D: Just like Hawaii, I imagine.
C: GENERAL HAIG
D: I'm sorry?
C: MARGARET
D: 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all.
C: GENERAL HAIG
D: But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war....
C: MARGARET
D: With all due respect sir, I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day.

INTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) the naval fleet sails towards the Falklands. A map of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands. Model boats sit on the water, flags sit on the islands. Argentinian flags. MARGARET stares at the map. A whispered message to one of the ATTACHES. He moves a model boat on the map a few inches, leading a fleet of smaller model boats. NAVAL ATTACHE 1 The Argentinian ship the General Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course 273 degrees toward the Argentinian mainland. We are tracking it with our submarine HMS Conqueror. He points to a model submarine at some distance from the Argentinian boats.
C: MARGARET
D: Is this ship a threat?
C: ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE
D: Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday they launched- then aborted- an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again.
C: FRANCIS PYM
D: The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands. Can it really be regarded as a threat ?
C: ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE
D: She's been changing course continually. There's a strong possibility that they're attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group.
E: MORE
C: ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE
D: I advise that we engage them: hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others. Send them all back to port.
E: CONT'D

D: It'll play badly internationally. We'll be seen as aggressors.

N: She looks to LEACH.

D: If there is to be an escalation, it's better that we start it.

D: And I put it to the Honourable Member opposite that this is not a day for him to carp, find fault, demand inquiries- they will happen I can assure him of that for we have nothing to hide- no, this is a day to put difference aside, hold one's head high and take pride in being British.

C: MARGARET
D: There it is again! Why not?
N: MINISTER 1 Because - MINISTER 2 Because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair.
C: MARGARET
D: Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up, we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community!
E: and who don't feel guilty about it
N: SILENCE.

D: And I see the same thing, the same cowardice in our fight within the European Union, to retain British sovereignty of Britain, the integrity of the pound! Some of you want to make concessions.

D: This is ridiculous. There are two "T's" in "committee"!
N: She presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the offending word.

S: INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT
N: MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror.
C: DENIS
D: The greatest Prime Minister since Churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies!
E: O.S.
C: MARGARET VO
D: All those years of taking the tough decisions, does any of it matter now?
C: DENIS
D: It's all been turned to mush!
C: MARGARET
D: What?
N: DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.
C: DENIS
D: By these fools! These lily-livered pinkos!
C: MARGARET
D: These inept placators.
C: DENIS
D: Very good! These vacillators.
C: MARGARET
D: Vacillators! Poll takers.
C: DENIS
D: Popularity seekers.
C: MARGARET
D: So busy taking the pulse of the public!
C: DENIS
D: Weak -
C: MARGARET
D: These...weak...weak...weak...wea.. .weak...Men!
E: pulling down a rack of Denis's black oxford shoes onto the floor
N: DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are several bin liners already filled with clothes.
C: MARGARET
D: Don't they know if you take the tough decisions, yes people will hate you today but they'll thank you for generations.
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish!
N: MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last big chest of drawers.
C: MARGARET V/O
D: All I wanted was to make a difference in the world.
E: seizing shirts and jerseys and putting them on the floor
C: DENIS
D: And you did, love, you did.
N: She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark and Carol."
C: MARGARET V/O
D: All I wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy - happier than I was certainly. And I wanted you to be happy of course. Were you happy, Denis? Tell me the truth.
N: There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the room. Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags. As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis - His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera. Laughing on the beach in Cornwall. At the door of Number 10, smiling at her. Sharing her bed. MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it on the top of the case.
C: MARGARET
D: Denis? Denis?
N: And there he is by her side.
C: MARGARET V/O
D: Here's your bag. You're all packed, sorted.
N: She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.
C: MARGARET
D: Denis wait...Where are your shoes? You can't go without shoes! Not yet.
E: seeing he is walking away in his socks
N: DENIS straightens his hat.
C: DENIS
D: Steady.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes...Steady...
C: DENIS
D: Steady the buffs -
C: MARGARET
D: Steady...Steady the buffs...
N: DENIS heading out.
C: MARGARET
D: 154d NO...Not yet...Denis. Wait...I 154d said I don't want you to go yet. The endless corridor, MARGARET calling after DENIS-
E: CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: Denis...Please...No...Not...Don't. ..NO...I don't...I don't want to be on my own. DENIS turns back for a moment -
E: CONT'D
C: DENIS
D: You're going to be fine on your own, love. You always have been. MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the very far end of the house and appears to disappear into the white light-
E: beat
C: MARGARET
D: Denis!!
E: calling out
S: INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN
N: From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by bulging black bin bags.
C: CAROL OOV
D: Mummy- CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.
C: CAROL
D: My God, Mum. Are you alright? Mummy you should have called for help, silly old sausage. Have you not even been in your bed properly? You've done all this?
E: opening the curtains
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, all sorted. Finished. MARGARET looks around her.
C: CAROL
D: Yes well don't worry about all this. June and I will crack on with it.
C: MARGARET
D: I was just going to get dressed.
C: CAROL
D: ...Shall I call someone, see if anyone can come over and do your hair? MARGARET looks at her warmly.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh. No, you do it.
N: CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased.
S: INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
N: MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol's bustle in the downstairs hallway.
C: CAROL OOV
D: Right, I'm off June.
C: JUNE
D: OK. `Bye. She stands, picking up the cup. From behind-
C: JUNE
D: Oh let me do that, Margaret. MARGARET's turns for a moment- It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.
E: O.S CONT'D
C: MARGARET
D: No, dear, I'll do it.
C: JUNE
D: Carol said you might go to the House of Lords today?
C: MARGARET
D: No no. I'm not going anywhere.
N: The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup- MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup. The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea stain, puncturing the silence. The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from the street outside. MARGARET sets the cup aside, turns and walks out of the room, and out of sight. THE END
