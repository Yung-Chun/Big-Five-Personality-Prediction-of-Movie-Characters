M: FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--
M: MARK (V.O.)
M: Did you know there are more people with
M: genius IQ's living in China than there
M: are people of any kind living in the
M: United States?
M: ERICA (V.O. )
M: That can't be true.
M: MARK (V.O.)
M: it is true.
M: ERICA (V.O.)
M: What would account for that?
M: MARK (V.0.)
M: Well first of all, a lot of people live
M: in China. But here's my question:
T: FADE IN
S: INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT
N: MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself. ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested. The scene is stark and simple.
C: MARK
D: How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?
C: ERICA
D: I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
C: MARK
D: I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here.
C: ERICA
D: You got 1600?
C: MARK
D: You can sing in an a Capella group.
C: BRICA
D: Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?
C: MARK
D: Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.
C: ERICA
D: Or you get into a final club.
C: MARK
D: Or you get into a final club, exactly.
C: ERICA
D: I like guys who row crew.
N: MARK (BEAT) Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.
C: ERICA
D: Have you ever tried?
C: MARK
D: I'm trying now.
C: ERICA
D: To row crew?
C: MARK
D: To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy?
C: ERICA
D: Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about.
C: MARK
D: But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
C: ERICA
D: No.
C: MARK
D: Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one.
C: ERICA
D: I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.
C: MARK
D: The Phoenix is good.
C: ERICA
D: This is a new topic?
C: MARK
D: It's the same topic.
C: ERICA
D: We're still talking about the finals clubs?
C: MARK
D: Would you rather talk about something else?
C: ERICA
D: It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.
C: MARK
D: We can change the subject.
C: ERICA.
D: There are more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of--
E: can't get over it
C: MARK
D: It's about exclusivity.
C: T'RICA
D: .....what is?
C: MARK
D: The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
C: ERICA
D: Which one?
C: MARK
D: The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.
C: ERICA
D: I actually meant which Roosevelt.
C: MARK
D: Theodore.
C: ERICA
D: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?
N: MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says...
C: MARK
D: Hm.
C: ERICA
D: What?
C: MARK
D: why would you ask me that?
C: ERICA
D: I was just asking.
C: MARK
D: They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that.
C: ERICA
D: He made $300,000 in a summer?
C: MARK
D: He likes meteorology.
C: ERICA
D: You said it was oil futures.
C: MARK
D: If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance,
N: ERICA (BEAT) I've lost my place again.
C: MARK
D: You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.
C: ERICA
D: The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.
N: S.
C: MARK
D: I just think you asked--the placement of where you asked the question--
C: ERICA
D: I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
C: MARK
D: Erica--
C: ERICA
D: You're obsessed with the finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication. You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just do it.
C: MARK
D: Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
C: ERICA
D: Yes there is.
C: MARK
D: Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code.
C: ERICA
D: I didn't mean to be cryptic.
C: MARK
D: I'm saving I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
C: ERICA
D: Why?
C: MARK
D: Because they're exclusive.
N: (BEAT) And fun and they lead to a better life.
C: ERICA
D: You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?
C: MARK
D: He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do.
C: ERICA
D: Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.
C: MARK
D: I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet.
N: ERICA (SMILES) You would do that for me?
C: MARK
D: You're my girlfriend.
C: ERICA
D: okay, well I want to be straight forward and tell you that I'm not anymore.
N: MARK (BEAT) What do you mean?
C: ERICA
D: I'm not your girlfriend anymore,
C: MARK
D: Is this a joke?
C: ERICA
D: No, I'm sorry, it's not.
C: MARK
D: You're breaking up with me?
C: ERICA
D: You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
C: MARK
D: Take it easy.
C: ERICA
D: What was it supposed to mean?
C: MARK
D: It was--Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.
N: ERICA (PAUSE) I want to really try not to lose it now. (MORE)
C: ERICA
D: The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine. He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from--England?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: I'm from Westchester.
C: ERICA
D: I'm going back to my dorm.
C: MAFT
D: Wait, wait, thisi reel?
C: ERICA
D: Yes.
C: MARK
D: I apologize, okay? Siddown.
C: ERICA
D: I'm going back to my dorm, I have to study.
N: MARK ERICA---
C: ERICA
D: Yeah.
C: MARK
D: I'm sorry and I mean it..
C: ERICA
D: I appreciate that but--
C: MARK
D: Come on.
C: ERICA
D: ---I have to study.
C: MARK
D: You don't have to study. Let's just talk.
C: ERICA
D: I can't..
C: MARK
D: Why?
C: ERICA
D: Because it's exhausting. Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster.
N: S.
C: MARK
D: All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to--I wasn't making a comment on your parents--I was saying you go to B.U.
C: ERICA
D: I have to go study.
C: MARK
D: You don't have to study.
C: ERICA
D: How do you know I don't have to study?!
C: MARK
D: Because you go to B.U.! ERICA stares at him...
N: MARK (CONT'D) (BEAT) Do you want to get some food?
C: ERICA
D: I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.
C: MARK
D: And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat.
C: ERICA
D: I think we should just be friends.
C: MARK
D: I don't need friends.
C: ERICA OF
D: I was being polite, I had no intention being friends with you.
C: MARK
D: You're really leaving. ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly..
N: ERICA (CLOSE) Listen, You're going to be successful and rich. But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole. And with that stinger, ERICA walks off and we stay on MARK as the pulsing intro to Paul Young's "Love of the Common People" CRASHES IN----
C: ERICA
D: And you're never getting into a final club. Along with the MUSIC, we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has just been lit.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - NIGHT
N: As MARK continues on, he passes a group of people heading in the opposite direction for a party. As MARK's steady and determined stride continues, he'll. pass by all kinds of (seemingly) happy, well-adjusted, socially adept people. The vocals from the Paul Young song come in-- PAUL YOUNG LIVING ON FREE FOOD TICKETS WATER IN THE MILK FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF WHERE THE RAIN CAME THROUGH WHAT CAN YOU DO?

N: A bedroom that's part of a three-bedroom suite. The MUSIC CONTINUES as MARK walks in, flicks his lap-top on without looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop. PAUL YOUNG 'CAUSE SHE'S LIVING IN THE LOVE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE SMILES FROM THE HEART OF A FAMILY MAN DADDY'S GONNA BUY YOU A DREAM TO CLING TO MAMA'S GONNA LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH AS SHE CAN
C: AND SHE CAN
D: Then a moment or two later, a glass with ice gets set down next to the lap-top. Then a carton of orange juice followed by a bottle of vodka. MARK's fingers dance easily on the keyboard---like a Juilliard pianist warming up. In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange juice over ice, the website he's just called up gets loaded onto the screen. Zuckonit.com This is the only place he's comfortable.

N: Fresh ice gets dropped in the glass and a new drink poured. "Love of the Common People" continues. TITLE: 9:48 PM in back of MARK, sitting on the bed and hitting a bong, is BILLY. OLSEN.
C: MARK
D: The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea. MARK has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled "Kirkland Facebook". He clicks and opens it. A menu of photos appear. He blogs again.
E: V.O.
C: MARK
D: I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night? The Kirkland Facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous f acebook-pics. Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls' faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter. .

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FINAL CLUB - NIGHT
N: We'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the Paul Young song tying them together, as we show---mostly MOS--- preparations under way for the hottest party on campus tonight. We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS. Our guy walks past P. DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his incredibly high-end equipment. Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs, opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk. 12, A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is holding back three dozen STUDENTS. The students are mostly women and the women are all dressed to catch a man. Over all this, we HEAR MARK CONTINUINGâ
C: MARK
D: Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he's on to something.
E: V.0.
N: TITLE: 10:17 PM
C: MARK
D: year it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com. The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in. Let the hacking begin.

Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along.

And while it may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated, but comfortable now with his own power. His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates, one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know. On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also a. â¢ mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the recor..

N: The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for Abercrombie and Fitch. They know that the others aren't in their class and even though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.
C: CAMERON

D: So let's look at a sample problem: Suppose we're given a computer with a 16- bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes. A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed over to MARK. While that's happening--
C: PROFESSOR
D: The system uses one-level page tables, which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system, who knows? The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc. MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole". He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with contempt.
E: CONT'D

What's important is that this couldn't be less like the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Some potted palm trees have brought in along with a steel drum set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl and assorted cookies is nearby. EDUA.RDO, in baggy cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt buttoned up to the top, is standing with a few similarly dressed friends, including DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES, in the sparsely populated room. On the other side of the room are a few girls--all Asian. One of the girls is wearing a bikini over her clothes. A television monitor has been set up with a. DVD running of Niagara Falls.
C: EDUARDO
D: It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls. It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.
C: DUSTIN
D: I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
C: EDUARDO
D: I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, they're smart, they're not Jewish and they can't dance.

D: It wasn't because I put up pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.
C: EDUARDO
D: Yeah.
C: MARK
D: It was because I put up pictures of girls that people knew. So if people Want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't I build a website that offers that? An online community of friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around. All from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online.

Or put a different way, not invite their friends to join. In a world where social structure is very important, that was sexy.

C: EDUARDO
D: Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. Uhh, he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.
C: GAGE
D: "These guys" meaning my clients.
C: EDUARDO
D: Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they- --that your clients, probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash did what he wanted it to do. MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as everything is being said within a few feet of the peop" being talked about.

C: SPEAKER
D: And it was a clear day, And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm. And he brought that up there and said, "Look, it's going to happen without us. We've got to do it now." And so I said..."Okay." He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS.
C: SPEAKER
D: Now the startingâ¢of this industry was very humble indeed. The kit computer on the cover-of that magazine-- We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind MARK and EDUARDO, MARK is too into the speech to notice but the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO's face.

Then back to the girls-- EDUARDO (WHISPERING) Very nice to meet you. JENNY (WHISPERING) Facebook me when you get home. Maybe we can all go out for a drink later. EDUARDO (WHISPERING) Certainly.

C: MARK
D: The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not,
N: YOU KNOW---
C: EDUARDO
D: Do they have grounds?
C: MARK
D: Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one.
C: EDUARDO
D: Why didn't you show me the letter?

C: ERICA
D: It didn't stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published. The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch.
N: (BEAT) Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, published my bra size and then rated women-based on their hotness. Why don't you say it to me now, why don't say it to my face?

I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers--the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.

Pizza boxes, Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools they're going for. As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him.
C: MARK
D: Andrew.
E: snapping his fingers
C: ANDREW
D: Not now.
C: MARK
D: Good boy. MARK gets to the door and opens it. He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON. They all look at each other for a moment---
C: SEAN
D: Mark?
C: MARK
D: Sean?
C: SEAN
D: Do you live here?
C: MARK
D: Yeah. Do you?
C: SEAN
D: We were right across the street, we saw the chimney come--
C: MARK
D: Yeah.
C: SEAN
D: Is anybody hurt?
C: MARK
D: No. You live across the street.
C: SHARON
D: I'm Sharon.
C: SEAN
D: This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney--
C: MARK
D: Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.
C: SEAN

C: MARK
D: Here you go. A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it.
E: OS
C: MARK
D: Sharon. Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was coming and so it smashes into the fireplace.
E: OS CONT'D
C: SHARON
D: Oh God. I'm so sorry. And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the broken glass from the beer bottle.
C: DUSTIN
D: You know, ironically, we're paying an extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a working fireplace.
C: SEAN
D: This house is great. The team is great. It's exactly what it should be.
N: (TO ANDREW) I'm Sean Parker. MARK comes out of the kitchen--

The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of this story than that's fine. The three SEXY GIRLS take us into
S: INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS
N: It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance floor packed"with sweating 20- somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non- stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting. 120, A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to bend over and pour a drink for you, And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing behind him and leaning against the couch. MARK and SEAN have to speak the music.
C: MARK
D: I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you.
C: SEAN
D: That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I was crashing there for a little. bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place and I'm homeless.
C: NARK
D: Yeah?
N: (BEAT) You can crash at our. place for a few days if you want.
C: SEAN
D: That's sol..id man, thanks,
N: BEAUTIFUL WOMAN #1 I'm going to the ladies' room;
C: SEAN
D: You got it.
N: BEAUTIFUL WOMAN #2 I'll go with you. The two girls exit--
C: MARK
D: Your date looks so familiar to me,
C: SEAN
D: She looks familiar to a lot of people.
C: MARK
D: What do you mean?
N: ].21.
C: SEAN
D: Look at any Victoria's Secret catalogue from the last six months.
N: . MARK (PAUSE) You're kidding.
C: SEAN
D: No man. I'll tell you something, you know how I founded Napster?
C: MARK
D: I know everything there is to know about you Sean.
C: SEAN
D: Fuck Wikipedia, Mark, no you don't.
N: (BEAT) I was going out with this girl in high school. And it was great. I thought it was great, but the whole time--almost the .whole time we were together., like five months--she was giving blow. jobs to the co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I found out and I was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him. So I had this dream that I would make a billion dollar company.. Not a million dollar company--any hack can do that---a billion dollar company. And I would have business cards printed up that said, "I'm CEO.. .Bitch. " (BEAT) It's our time. We run the universe. Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model. I want to know where the fuck Eduardo is.
C: MARK
D: He has an internship.
C: SEAN
D: An internship?
C: MARK
D: In New York.
C: SEAN
D: The company's here. A billion dollar company is here. And what confuses me is that in New York, Eduardo introduced himself as the business head of Facebook. I've been at the front of two of the biggest things in the history of the internet and I can tell you that nothing, nothing is more important to a start-up than the energy and ambition of its founders.
N: (MORE)

D: You have to live and breathe the project every minute of every day and-night. Do you live and breathe Facebook?
E: CONT-D
C: MARK
D: Yes.

N: MARK (PAUSE) It'd be great if you stayed at the house with us.
C: SEAN
D: I think I should. The girls come back--
N: WOMAN #1 You guys figure out a new way to get porn on your computer? WOMAN #2 You know most of it's bad but some of it's pretty good. MARK and SEAN aren't paying attention...

D: What's your goal for the summer?
C: MARK
D: We want: to . be in a hundred schools.
C: -SEAN
D: okay. Okay good. I'll tell you what. Gesture of good faith. While you're getting yourself into a hundred schools, I'm gonna put you on two continents.

S: EXT. THE THAMES -- DAY
N: we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of Henley, England--founded in 1179. And after a moment of placid quiet--
C: ---BOOSHI
D: Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta. The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of Harvard. We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n blazers and brightly colored floral ties. But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural. straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they've ever faced. And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the Dutch. The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late. Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans.
N: We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next to him is their mother, who can barely watch. Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and there's still no daylight between them. We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin to stream down his arm. 25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy-- even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'ï¿½ is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed-- the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position. The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig, and pull, and pull, and pull, and---
C: POP!
D: --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over. CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up. The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop. The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses to look away. From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AWARD CEREMONY - DAY
N: CAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches. They're on a stand in the Steward's Enclosure, a sprawling and glamorous tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests. After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he approaches the stand. This conversation is done without microphones or anything as modern as that.
C: AIDE
D: His Royal Highness, Prince Albert. Sir, may I present Mr. Cameron Winklevoss and Mr. Tyler. Winklevoss of Harvard University.
C: PRINCE ALBERT
D: Brilliant race. Never seen a race that close. Less than one second, the steward tells me.
N: TYLER (BEAT) Yes, Your Highness.
C: PRINCE ALBERT
D: My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premiere rowers of his day. I've been coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen a race that close. Have you? Have you seen a race that close? CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now so he lets his brother do the talking.
N: TYLER (BEAT) No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two.
C: PRINCE ALBERT
D: Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a second though in your case. Well as they say, I suppose it just came down to who wanted it more.
N: CAMERON (SNAPPING) Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we DIDN'T--- TYLER (EASY) Cam. There's an awkward silence for a moment...
C: PRINCE ALBERT
D: Will I have the pleasure of watching you both row again in Beijing?
C: TYLER
D: If we make the team, sir, yes. Thank you.

The three of them have tried to find an unpopulated spot. TYLER and DIVYA have glasses of beer and are standing but CAMERON's sitting at a table with a laptop open and watching film of the end of the race. Hitting reverse on the computer and watching, over and over again, the bow of the Dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at just the right moment.

D: Good to meet you.
C: KENWRIGHT
D: I just had the most extraordinary phone chat with my daughter. She told me that she and her friends are all talking about the race, which ended just, a half-hour ago, via their computers. A new website called Facebook. Do you have this in America? Eve.ryon= is frozen...
N: DIVYA (PAUSE) Your daughter doesn't go to school in the U.S.?
C: KENWRIGHT
D: No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French Literature, though I wasn't aware there was such a thing.
N: TYLER (PAUSE) They have Facebook at Cambridge?

D: Turn it off.
E: CONT'D
N: (PAUSE) Turn it off, Cam. Look at me. CAMERON turns to his brother...
C: TYLER
D: I don't mind that we got beat by the Dutch by less than a second. That was a fair race, that was a good race and they had the better boat today and they'll see us again. What I mind is that we got beat by Mark Zuckerberg...by less than a second.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) We tried the Ad Board, we tried the president of the University and we tried talking to him ourselves. Now I'm asking you. For the one-hundreth time. Let's take the considerable-resources at our disposal and sue him in a federal. court. CAMERON looks at his brother...then turns back to the computer. He watches the Dutch boat pull ahead at the last moment. TYLER and DIVYA are just about to give up when CAMERON swings back and says--

C: MARY
D: You froze the account.
C: EDUARDO
D: I had to get your attention, mark.
C: MARK
D: Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have easily destroyed everything I've been working on?
C: EDUARDO
D: We've been working on.
C: MARK
D: Without money, the company can't function. What EDUARDO can't see behind his back is that JENNY has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter.
C: MARK
D: If the servers are down for even a day, our reputation is damaged irreversibly,. Users are fickle. Friendster has proven that fact. And JENNY's now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks the basket over with her foot.
E: CONT'D
N: EDUARDO LOOK-- 140,

C: MARK
D: That was the act'of a child, not a businessman. And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend, You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check? And I was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in front of a girl. I'm not going back to that life,
N: EDUARDO (SHOUTING) Yeah!

D: The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously.
