M: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
M: July 27, 2006
S: EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY
N: A tall, handsome man in a dark suit emerges from a Lincoln Towncar and enters a small, basement R&B/Jazz club.
S: INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY
N: He approaches a booth, says something in the din to the men there, then calmly shoots them and exits. AMERICAN GANGSTER
S: EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY (NOVEMBER)
N: Bumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man, elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg - stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor - like a benign king. Legend: Harlem A younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas - Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from below.
S: INT/EXT. STREET / DISCOUNT EMPORIUM - DAY (NOVEMBER)
N: Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in 1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers:
C: BUMPY O/S
D: This is the problem. This is what's wrong with America.
N: The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.
C: BUMPY O/S
D: It's gotten so big you can't find your way.
N: People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.
C: BUMPY
D: The corner grocery's a supermarket. Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this place.
E: MORE CONT
C: BUMPY
D: Where's the pride of ownership here? Where's the personal service? Does anybody work here?
E: CONT'D
N: Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display window full of Japanese stereo componentry.
C: BUMPY
D: What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting Americans out of work?
N: He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.
C: BUMPY
D: What am I supposed to do with a place like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to ask for, the assistant manager? This is the problem. This is the way it is now: You can't find the heart of anything to stick the knife.
E: pause
N: Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in. They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.
C: FRANK
D: What is it?
N: Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
C: FRANK
D: Somebody call an ambulance!
N: But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of. Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -
C: BUMPY
D: Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge.
S: EXT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family, friends, celebrities, politicians. Cops on horseback move through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian mobsters like Albert Tosca. (CONT)
C: REPORTER
D: - whose passing has brought together a who's who of mourners on this chilly afternoon. The Governor has come down. The mayor of New York - its Chief of Police and Commissioner - sports and entertainment luminaries -
N: A white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a camera - including the Feds - before going inside.
S: INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here: a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem gangster, Robin Hood and killer.
C: REPORTER ON TV
D: He was a Great Man, according to the eulogies. A giving man. A man of the people. No one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson: Gangster.
N: Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures: Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.
C: TOSCA
D: White wine, please.
N: A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down next to Frank.
C: BANKER
D: How you doing, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: All right.
C: BANKER
D: What a loss. How are you otherwise? Things okay financially?
E: Frank nods CONT
N: Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.
C: BANKER
D: Bumpy set something up for you?
N: Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.
C: TANGO
D: Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while you're at it.
N: Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango - who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.
C: CHARLIE
D: I know you're hurting, Frank. So am I.
N: Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope man.
C: CHARLIE
D: You going to be all right?
C: FRANK
D: Yeah.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he made me promise, anything ever happened to him, I'd make sure you didn't go without.
C: FRANK
D: I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people here owed Bumpy money when he died. A lot of money. If they think I'm going to forget to collect, they're wrong.
C: CHARLIE
D: That's the spirit. Go get them.
N: On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."
S: A7 INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT A7
N: A figure, his back to us, walks slowly toward a blackboard like a man to the gallows.
C: RICHIE V.O.
D: I live in fear of hearing my name called.
C: PROFESSOR
D: Mr. Roberts, Give us U.S. vs. Meade -
C: RICHIE V.O.
D: Of walking up there, turning around, knowing every one of them knows more than I do -
C: PROFESSOR
D: Subject, issues, what the determination was and what it means to us today.
N: Richie Roberts turns and faces his classmates, all of them a decade or more younger than him.
S: EXT. MOTEL - NEW JERSEY - DAY
N: Harlem's jagged teeth skyline juts across the river at the other end of the George Washington Bridge. On this side - a sledgehammer gripped in Richie's fist, on the move, suddenly fills the frame.
C: RICHIE
D: You know the Number 1 fear of most people isn't dying; it's public speaking. They get physically ill. They throw up.
C: RIVERA
D: And that's what you want to do for a living.
C: RICHIE
D: I don't like being like that. I want to beat it.
N: Armed with the sledgehammer, Richie and his partner - Javy Rivera - come past a seedy motel office where a TV shows another report about Bumpy Johnson. Legend: New Jersey A motel clerk looks up, glimpses the sledgehammer - (CONT)
C: CLERK
D: Hey -
N: Rivera flashes a New Jersey detective's shield without breaking stride. Takes a subpoena out of another pocket.
C: RIVERA
D: Who's going to do this?
C: RICHIE
D: He knows me, he'll take it from me. I've known him since high school.
C: RIVERA
D: Just throw it in, he doesn't take it. That's good service.
N: They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks. The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to close the door -
C: RIVERA
D: Throw it -
N: As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.
C: RIVERA
D: Down -
N: Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings past his head shattering the door -
S: INT/EXT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in. The wise guy - Campizi - hurries for the bathroom, slams the door. This one's hollow and the detectives more easily break through it - Campizi tries to climb out the bathroom window. Richie grabs him, throws him into the shower stall, taking the plastic curtain down with them, smearing it with blood as Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off.
S: INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING - DAY
N: A male paramedic attends to Campizi's bloodied face while a female paramedic cleans Richie's bloodied hand. (CONT)
C: CAMPIZI
D: I swear to God, Richie, I didn't know it was you. I would never slam a door on your hand. Knowingly.
C: RICHIE
D: You bit my fuckin hand -
N: Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand - which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The paramedics manage to pull him away.
C: CAMPIZI
D: What can we do, Richie? You don't want to do this. For old times sake, what can we do? Who do you want? Who can I give you? You want Big Sal's bookie? You want his accountant? I'll give him to you.
N: Richie regards him a moment. A policy ring's accountant wouldn't be bad. He glances back to his paramedic dabbing at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. She smiles back.
S: INT. NY POLICE HQ - ENTRANCE/STAIRS - DAY
N: Four men in long black leather coats stride toward like they own the city. It's impossible to tell if they're cops or gangsters. Legend: New York City
S: INT. NEW YORK POLICE ANNEX - PROPERTY ROOM - DAY
N: One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo - scribbles a signature and badge number different from the one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting evidence needed in court. He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts. Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie unwrapped with dangling tags. The clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase.
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Trupo's car - a Shelby Mustang - roars up. He climbs out, crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three SIU Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling grocery bags.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. The other cops pull from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter, boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale, and yellow baggies. Hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence" tape on the clear plastic bags. Dump the heroin into twenty yellow baggies. A half-kilo of lactose is poured into each of the now-empty property room bags.
C: TRUPO
D: Now just enough for the reagent test.
N: He removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags, the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase.
S: INT. NY COURTROOM - DAY
N: The suitcase and "heroin," and some weapons and money, have been arranged on an evidence table with the care of a Macy's display window. Trupo - the officer in charge of the case - watches the jury files in -
S: EXT. UNDER EXPRESSWAY - DAY
N: A Lincoln Continental pulls up. Trupo climbs out of his Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in back where an Italian wise guy - Rossi - sits. Trupo unzips the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic.
C: ROSSI V/O
D: This is the French Connection dope. The same dope Popeye Doyle and Sonny Grasso took from us.
N: 16 OMIT 16 OMIT
S: INT. ITALIAN BAR - NY - DAY
N: Frank comes into an empty bar, chairs up on tables. A middle-aged man mopping up glances up at him as he crosses to a back room.
C: ROSSI V/O
D: They seize it, arrest everybody, whack it up and sell it back to us. Our dope. They been living off it for years, these New York cops.
S: INT. ITALIAN BAR - BACK ROOM - NY - DAY
N: Several ounces of the dope sits in foreground on a table.
C: ROSSI
D: They basically control the market with it. What the fuck has happened to the world, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: Fuckin crooks.
N: Rossi, who looks more like a middle-aged accountant than the Italian dope supplier he is, makes two espressos.
C: ROSSI
D: Sad about Bumpy.
N: Behind Frank, a TV airs a report by Walter Cronkite on the heroin problem among GIs in Vietnam.
C: ROSSI
D: Things are never going to be the same in Harlem. The girls, the clubs, the music - walk down the street, nobody bothers you because Bumpy's making sure of it. How bad is it there now?
E: hands Frank one of the espressos
T: 18pt FLASHCUTS TO HARLEM 18pt
N: Guys barge into a room, steal money from a crap game at gunpoint - Cops push guys against a bar, empty their pockets - A dealer shoots another dealer in an alley - 18pt BACK TO THE HOTEL ROOM 18pt
C: FRANK
D: It's chaos. Every gorilla for himself.
N: (CONT) 18pt CONTINUED: 18pt
C: ROSSI
D: Who can live like that? There has to be order. That would never happen with Italians. More important than any one man's life - is order.
S: EXT. HARLEM - DAY
N: A street sign on a corner: 116th and 8th Avenue.
S: INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY
N: As is his custom, Frank eats breakfast alone. A middle- aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate and refills his coffee.
C: FRANK
D: Thank you, Charlene. Last one.
C: CHARLENE
D: It's all right with me, Frank, you can stay all day if you want, but I wouldn't. It's nice outside.
C: FRANK
D: Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk. Just cause you said so.
N: She smiles and leaves. Frank pours some sugar in his coffee. Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes.
S: INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: Frank leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building.
S: INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Corner apartment above the street. A girl sits smoking at a work table covered with drug-cutting apparatus. Another - Frank's cutter and sometimes-girlfriend, Red Top - sets a couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen.
C: RED TOP
D: On the house for our men in uniform.
N: SERVICEMAN 1 Why, thank you, sugar, that's very kind.
C: RED TOP
D: Thank Frank.
N: (CONT) Frank nods, you're welcome before the man can thank him. The servicemen start cooking up the dope.
C: FRANK
D: How's Nate? You seen him?
N: SERVICEMAN 1 All the time. Nate is everywhere. He's good. Got himself a club now.
C: FRANK
D: Where, Saigon?
N: SERVICEMAN 1 Bangkok. SERVICEMAN 2 I don't think he's ever coming home. Regarding the dope as the servicemen shoot it up -
C: FRANK
D: You're gonna have to boot it a couple times. Cops keep cutting it, selling it, cutting it -
N: SERVICEMAN 1 I don't want to say anything cause the price is right - but the shit in Nam is way, way, way, way, way - He begins to nod out before he can finish the sentence. 23 OMIT 23 OMIT
S: EXT. SOCIAL CLUB - NEWARK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Across the river, Richie, Rivera and Campizi sit in the car parked across from a closed social club. A man carrying a grocery bag comes out and Campizi ducks lower in the seat.
C: CAMPIZI
D: That's him.
N: Newsboy Moriarty's mob accountant puts the grocery bag in the trunk of a car, climbs in behind the wheel.
S: EXT. NEWARK - SCRAP METAL YARD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: From the parked car they observe the accountant putting another bag in his trunk.
S: EXT. STREET - NEWARK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: He comes out of another place with another bag. To Campizi -
C: RICHIE
D: All right. Get lost. Get out.
N: Campizi slinks out of the car. Richie and Rivera follow after Newsboy Moriarty's accountant's car.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: They tail the car into a lot, park and watch the accountant leave his car and get into another car that's parked there.
C: RIVERA
D: We gonna stay with him or the car?
N: Whatever they do, they'll have to decide quick.
C: RICHIE
D: Let's see who comes for the car.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NEWARK - NIGHT
N: All the other cars are gone. Rivera climbs into Richie's with coffee and a Coke in a bag, hands him the can.
C: RIVERA
D: Think he made us?
N: Richie doesn't know. Glances at his watch. Cranes in his seat to look behind them.
C: RICHIE
D: You called for the warrant? Where are they?
C: RIVERA
D: I just called. I called and walked back here and ten seconds has gone by.
N: Richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street lamps buzz, grows impatient. Indicating the other car:
C: RICHIE
D: We saw him with the slips, Javy.
C: RIVERA
D: You saw policy slips? You saw grocery bags. You don't know what's in them.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Yes, I do, and so do you, don't give me that bullshit -
C: RIVERA
D: What's the rush? Half an hour the warrant'll be here -
C: RICHIE
D: I got night school.
C: RIVERA
D: Guess you're going to miss it. You know, what you were saying before - about throwing up in front of people - money will take that feeling away.
E: Rivera sips at his coffee; then:
C: RICHIE
D: Not when it's less.
C: RIVERA
D: Less than what.
C: RICHIE
D: Than what I make now.
C: RIVERA
D: No lawyer on earth makes less than a cop.
C: RICHIE
D: They do in the Prosecutor's Office. Three thousand less.
C: RIVERA
D: You're fuckin kidding me.
N: Richie isn't kidding. Rivera stares at him like he's crazy. Richie checks his watch. He's waited long enough.
C: RICHIE
D: Fuck this -
C: RIVERA
D: Richie -
N: Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountant's car, Rivera following. Richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as he comes around back to search it - (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Check inside.
N: Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely -
C: RICHIE
D: Javy ...
N: Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside. Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes -
S: EXT. PARKING LOT / RICHIE'S CAR - LATER - NIGHT
N: Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out at the car with the money in it. Eventually -
C: RICHIE
D: This isn't a couple of bucks.
C: RIVERA
D: It's the same thing. In principle.
C: RICHIE
D: We're talking about principle?
C: RIVERA
D: Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing: He'll turn in cops who take money. We'll be pariahs.
C: RICHIE
D: We're fucked either way.
C: RIVERA
D: Not if we keep it. Only if we don't. Then we're fucked, you're right. But not if we keep it.
C: RICHIE
D: Yes, we are.
E: more to himself
C: RIVERA
D: Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, Give us your money? Cops kill cops they can't trust. We can't turn it in.
N: They regard each other again in silence ...
S: INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT
N: As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback, Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly:
C: TOBACK
D: How much.
C: RICHIE
D: Nine hundred and eighty thousand.
C: TOBACK
D: What happened to the rest?
N: It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place - who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly:
C: TOBACK
D: What're you doing counting this in front of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin mind? Take it into a room. Now.
N: Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked.
S: INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN
N: As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him - knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off.
S: INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY
N: Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.
C: TANGO
D: Didn't you see the jar, Frank? I think you walked right past it.
N: Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats. Tango sits.
C: TANGO
D: The money jar. On the corner. What I got to do, put a sign on it?
N: Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango. (CONT)
C: TANGO
D: Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more, Frank. Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem no more. I'm the landlord now and the lease is twenty-percent.
N: Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look that says that won't be happening.
C: TANGO
D: Then don't sell dope, Frank. Get a fuckin job. You need a job? You can be my driver, drive me around, open my door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, Massa Johnson, sir.
N: Right now Tango is dead. No doubt about it. On the surface, though, Frank remains cool.
C: FRANK
D: Twenty percent?
C: TANGO
D: Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload, every girl, every ounce. In the jar.
C: FRANK
D: Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business. There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way. Not even Bumpy took twenty percent.
E: reaches for his breakfast check
C: TANGO
D: Bumpy's fuckin dead.
N: Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango.
C: FRANK
D: There. That's twenty-percent.
N: As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ...
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot, put it on the stove.
S: INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT
N: A pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian suppliers and, if he were to, Tango.
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED
N: Richie has moved to a small desk cluttered with law textbooks. He cracks one open to study for the New Jersey Bar exam as he eats the soup out of the pot he heated it in. Above him on the wall is a framed photograph of Joe Louis standing over a sprawled-on-the-mat Billy Conn.
S: EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - INTERCUT
N: A bleak day. Seagulls fighting over scraps on the sand as others hover overhead, flapping and cawing. Alone near the water, Frank tosses a stick for the German shepherd he inherited.
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT
N: Richie opens a small wooden box in his bleak apartment, revealing an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers and clips. As he rolls a joint -
C: BUMPY V/O
D: A leader is like a shepherd -
S: EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - CONTINUED
N: The sounds of the gulls and surf and roller coaster begin to fade as Frank throws the stick again.
C: BUMPY V/O
D: Sends the fast nimble sheep out front, and the others follow as the shepherd walks quietly behind -
N: The dog retrieves the stick, but this time - somehow - it's to Bumpy's hand he returns it. Frank listens attentively.
C: BUMPY
D: He's got the stick - the cane - and he'll use if he has to.
E: MORE CONT
C: BUMPY
D: But most of the time he doesn't have to. He moves the whole herd - quietly.
E: CONT'D
N: Bumpy smiles and tosses the stick.
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT
N: The smoke from the joint rises to the ceiling as Richie studies.
S: EXT. CONEY ISLAND - BEACH - DAY - CONTINUED
N: The dog trots back to Bumpy and Frank with the stick.
S: EXT. BOARDWALK - CONEY ISLAND - LATER
N: Hot dog stand. Bumpy hands a hot dog to Frank, holds out another to the shepherd. To camera:
C: BUMPY
D: What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, the middlemen, buying direct, putting Americans out of work ... This is the way it is now, Frank.
N: Frank nods. The vender hands him a napkin. The shepherd is still with him, but Bumpy is gone, and the gulls and the people on the roller coaster squeal as Frank comes out of his meditative trance with an idea. CLOSE-UP: (DOCTOR'S OFFICE) A needle pierces the crook of Frank's arm. Slight grimace. A cotton ball is pushed onto the puncture. Malaria shot. CLOSE-UP: (PHOTOGRAPHY SHOP) A strobe lights up Frank's face: a passport photo. CLOSE-UP: (POST OFFICE) The photo and a duplicate are stapled to a passport application.
S: INT. CHEMICAL BANK - SAFETY-DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY
N: Keys turn the locks of a safety-deposit box. The lid lifts revealing decks of cash. Frank takes it all out, slips one slender packet into Bumpy's banker's jacket pocket.
C: FRANK
D: Get yourself a new suit.
S: INT. CHEMICAL BANK - VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Under portraits of bank Vice Presidents before him, the man types out a Chemical Bank check for Frank for $400,000. 47 - 48 OMIT 47 - 48 OMIT
S: EXT. PARK - NEWARK - DAY - SAME TIME
N: The sound of the plane growls and fades overhead as Richie's ex-wife keeps an eye on their son playing on a grassy area.
C: RICHIE
D: I'm sorry.
C: LAURIE
D: I don't know, Richie.
C: RICHIE
D: It couldn't be avoided. Next weekend I'll be able to take him.
N: She regards him with a weary look, but he's looking over at one of the other - better-looking - moms in the park.
C: LAURIE
D: I'm moving.
N: He looks back, not sure he heard right.
C: RICHIE
D: What? Where?
C: LAURIE
D: To the St. Regis, what do you care. My sister's.
E: pause
C: RICHIE
D: Your sister's. In Vegas?
N: He glances away to a sound: shattering glass. Some teen- agers breaking bottles on the ground.
C: RICHIE
D: You can't move to Vegas. Not with Michael anyway.
C: LAURIE
D: What am I supposed to do with him? Leave him with you? There's a picture.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Hey, you want to shut up over there?
E: to the vandals
N: The teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's hard with the constant noise.
C: RICHIE
D: No court will allow it for one thing. I won't allow it.
C: LAURIE
D: You?
C: RICHIE
D: When am I supposed to see my son?
C: LAURIE
D: Last weekend!
N: Their son glances over at them. Richie looks over at the teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie.
C: RICHIE
D: Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las Vegas.
C: LAURIE
D: Oh, like this is a good environment. Around your friends. There are less creeps in Vegas.
C: RICHIE
D: What's he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that? What are you thinking?
C: LAURIE
D: I'm thinking - Richie - of him!
C: RICHIE
D: Goddamn it -
N: The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you gonna do, old man, it's four against one.
C: RICHIE
D: I told you nice to shut the fuck up. Now I'm gonna kill you.
N: He pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the others. All instinctively try to cover their heads. (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Pick up the fuckin glass!
N: As they dive to their knees to do what they're told, Laurie walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at his father with his gun out.
S: EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT
N: Frank sits in the back of a motor samlor. Bicycles dart around it like flies. 51 - 52 OMIT 51 - 52 OMIT
S: INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT
N: The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place. Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase. His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder. The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself -
C: NATE
D: Frank - ?
N: Frank half-lifts his glass to wave, and Nate beams.
S: INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT
N: Frank has guests at his table now: his cousin Nate the Sergeant, and two young Asian wise guys. They talk about him in Thai (subtitled):
C: THAI
D: He say how much he wants?
C: NATE
D: He said "a lot." What that means, I don't know. Four or five keys?
N: (CONT) The Thais regard Frank a moment, size him up.
C: THAI
D: He's your cousin.
C: NATE
D: My cousin-in-law. My ex-wife's cousin.
C: THAI
D: Ask him how much he wants.
C: NATE
D: How much you gonna want, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: A hundred kilos.
N: Nate blinks like there's something in his eye ...
S: EXT. BANGKOK - STREET VENDER - DAY
N: Steam and neon. Frank and Nate at a crowded stand.
C: NATE
D: No one I know can get that much. It'd have to be pieced together from several suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100- percent pure.
C: FRANK
D: That's not what I want.
C: NATE
D: I know that. But that means dealing with the Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon or Saigon - if they'll deal with you -
C: FRANK
D: No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source.
N: Nate stares at him ... then laughs. Frank doesn't.
C: NATE
D: You're gonna go get it.
C: FRANK
D: Why not.
C: NATE
D: You're gonna go into the fuckin jungle -
N: (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: I've lived in jungles all my -
E: life
C: NATE
D: No. This is the jungle. Tigers. Vietcong. The fuckin snakes alone will kill you.
S: AA56 INT. NEW JERSEY BOARD OF BAR EXAMINERS - DAY AA56
N: A room of student-type desks and no character. Richie, and fifty others, have been here for hours taking the exam less than half of them will pass.
S: A56 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY A56
N: A motley bunch of Thai thugs and black American soldiers with automatic weapons ride mules through the dense jungle with Nate and Frank, who - armed with a pistol, a rifle and ammo bandolier like Pancho Villa - is enjoying himself. From his POV, the jungle canopy suddenly opens up on a poppy field the size of Manhattan. Frank stares down at it.
S: B56 EXT. JUNGLE RISE / OPIUM FARM - DAY B56
N: On the ground now with their small private army, Nate speaks with one of the Thais, then translates for Frank.
C: NATE
D: He says this whole area's controlled by the Kuomintang - Chiang Kai-Shek's defeated army.
N: Some of whom they can see down below on the opium farm - Chinese soldiers with outdated weapons. Frank tips his head to Nate at some other figures below -
C: FRANK
D: They ain't Chinese.
N: A handful of better-armed American sentries at the perimeter of the farm. CIA. Frank, Nate and the others hang back as one of the Thais steps ahead to speak to the guerillas.
S: C56 EXT. OPIUM FARM - LATER C56
N: The processing center for the entire region. The Thai translator is with Frank to negotiate with a vanquished Chinese general. Other Americans and Thais guard them while the Chinese with their CIA advisors guard them.
S: D56 INT. BAMBOO DWELLING - LATER - DAY D56
N: The Chinese general examines Frank's papers - passport, visa, bank receipts - and lots of cash - then studies Frank.
C: GENERAL
D: How would you get it into the States?
C: FRANK
D: What do you care?
C: GENERAL
D: Who do you work for in there?
C: FRANK
D: What do you care?
C: GENERAL
D: Who are you really?
C: FRANK
D: It says right there. Frank Lucas.
C: GENERAL
D: I mean, who you represent?
C: FRANK
D: Me.
N: The man doesn't believe it, but lets it go.
C: GENERAL
D: You think you're going to take a hundred kilos of heroin into the US and you don't work for anyone? Someone is going to allow that?
N: Frank shrugs. The general regards one of his men. In Chinese, subtitled:
C: GENERAL
D: I don't believe a word of this.
N: The general regards the cash and paperwork again for a moment. And, to Frank:
C: GENERAL
D: After this first purchase, if you're not killed by Marseilles importers - or their people in the States - then what?
N: (CONT) D56 CONTINUED: D56
C: FRANK
D: Then there'd be more. On a regular basis. Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time.
N: The man regards Frank for a long moment. Glances back to the cash and paperwork again. Finally -
C: GENERAL
D: Of course not.
S: E56 EXT. JUNGLE ARMY LZ - VIETNAM - DAY E56
N: Torrential monsoon rains. Dripping camouflage. Nate and Frank climb down from the Huey. Frank no longer wears the bandolier. Now a press card dangles from his neck.
S: F56 INT/EXT. TENT / JUNGLE ARMY LZ - LATER - DAY F56
N: Stripes on the uniform of a black colonel with Nate under a canopy. Outside, in the distance, in the rain, Frank hangs out with some other black servicemen.
C: COLONEL
D: Where's it now?
C: NATE
D: Bangkok. I can bring it here or anywhere in between.
C: COLONEL
D: A hundred kilos. I never seen that much dope in one place.
E: Nate nods
C: NATE
D: It's bigger than an Amana refrigerator- freezer.
S: G56 INT/EXT. JUNGLE ARMY LZ - LATER - DAY G56
N: Nate and Frank watch the colonel emerge from the tent and cross through the rain on duck-boards to another tent to speak with a white officer, a 2-star general.
C: NATE
D: Fifty grand. In advance. That'll cover them, the pilots and the guys on the other end.
C: FRANK
D: Give them a hundred.
N: (CONT) G56 CONTINUED: G56
C: NATE
D: Fifty, to cover them all.
C: FRANK
D: A hundred. And it's all I got left. So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.
E: embraces Nate and whispers
N: He holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if things don't go right, then takes it.
C: NATE
D: I'll let you know when it's in the air.
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NEWARK - DAWN
N: The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the nurse as Richie answers it -
C: RIVERA V/O
D: Richie? Richie, I'm in trouble. This fuckin guy "made" me - I don't know how but he did. He went for his gun. I had to do it, I swear to God. Now they're going to kill me.
N: Richie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and manages to disentangle himself from the woman.
C: RICHIE
D: Who.
C: RIVERA V/O
D: There's a hundred people out there heard the shots. You gotta help me. You gotta do something.
C: RICHIE
D: Is he dead?
C: RIVERA V/O
D: He's dead. I'm dead. They're gonna kill me.
C: RICHIE
D: Where are you? Javy, where are you?
N: (CONT)
C: RIVERA V/O
D: That's the problem.
S: A57 INT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - EARLY MORNING A57
N: Richie on his police radio, which cuts in and out -
C: DISPATCHER
D: There are no cars in that area, Detective Roberts.
C: RICHIE
D: Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I need back-up.
C: DISPATCHER
D: I missed that - you're breaking up -
C: RICHIE
D: I said, put the fucking call out again -
C: DISPATCHER
D: I just did. No one responded. I'll try again, but -
C: RICHIE
D: Fuck you, too.
N: He slams the mic down.
S: EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects - the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark 30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument. He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive heat. It's riot weather.
S: INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: Drugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera, despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared. Richie on the phone -
C: RICHIE
D: Sergeant, I'm not asking, I'm fuckin telling you: Get some patrolmen over here now.
N: (CONT) Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him. Richie throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him.
C: PARAMEDIC
D: You got no back-up? Why is that?
N: The only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair.
C: RICHIE
D: Bandage his head.
C: PARAMEDIC
D: Detective ... he's dead.
C: RICHIE
D: I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting. And open his eyes.
S: EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.
C: RICHIE
D: Step back, injured man coming out. Let them do their job and he'll be all right. Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir. Please.
N: The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away -
S: A60 EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING A60
N: They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief.
C: RIVERA
D: Thank you -
N: The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car.
C: RICHIE
D: You robbed him, didn't you.
N: (CONT) A60 CONTINUED: A60
C: RIVERA
D: What? What are you talking about?
N: Richie rips Rivera's jacket pockets. Money spills out.
C: RICHIE
D: This. Where'd this come from?
C: RIVERA
D: What. That's my money. I've never taken dirty money in my life.
C: RICHIE
D: You lying piece of shit -
C: RIVERA
D: Maybe the occasional gratuity. Like anybody else. You're going to tell me that's wrong?
C: RICHIE
D: Yeah.
C: RIVERA
D: No, it isn't. It's part of the salary for getting shot at. For that, certain courtesies are shown. In gratitude -
N: Richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him. Rivera is embarrassed, almost crying, pleading -
C: RIVERA
D: A discount on a TV, a Doughboy in the backyard, a new dress for your girlfriend maybe once a year. I'm talking about not living in fucking poverty. You want to call that wrong, call it wrong.
C: RICHIE
D: It's wrong.
C: RIVERA
D: Then goddamn it, pay me fifty grand a year, you son of a bitch. Pay me what I deserve for getting shot at. No? Fine. Next time four guys come into your place with sawed-off shotguns, you take care of it.
C: RICHIE
D: You robbed him, and then you shot him, and I helped you get out of there. How many more you shot?
E: CONT
N: A60 CONTINUED: A60 Rivera suddenly tries to get tough -
C: RIVERA
D: You know what, Richie? Fuck you, you make that kind of accusation against your own kind. And you know why.
N: He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a line of puncture scabs and scars.
C: RICHIE
D: You're a disgrace.
C: RIVERA
D: I'm a leper. Because I listened to you and turned in a million fucking dollars. You know who'll work with me after that? Same as you. No one.
N: Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key.
C: RICHIE
D: Don't look down there. Look here. You ever fuckin threaten me again, I'll kill you.
E: at Richie's eyes
N: Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts through the skin, drawing blood. 60 - 69 OMIT 60 - 69 OMIT
S: EXT. ARMY BASE, NEW JERSEY - DUSK
N: Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows, stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black, armed with M-16's. Silence again, before:
C: ARMY CAPTAIN
D: Open the trunk.
N: Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut.
S: INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
N: The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing. (CONT) The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction - except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next. And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe, and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%.
S: A72 INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAWN A72
N: The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds instantly. The young man looks at Frank.
C: CHEMIST
D: Typically what I see is 25 to 45 percent pure. I've never seen anything like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants, no dilutents. It's a hundred percent. May I?
N: The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up, but Frank gives him some to take home instead.
C: FRANK
D: Take it with you. I don't want to have to call the coroner.
N: The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last piece of advice -
C: CHEMIST
D: Store it in a cool, dark place.
S: EXT. GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA - DUSK
N: A clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was probably once worked by sharecroppers. An elderly woman framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes. Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a major league arm. Legend: Greensboro, North Carolina A glow spills out from a detached shed where a short man in his early 30's works on a stock car. (CONT) A greasy phone on the workbench rings and another disreputable-looking man, thumbing through a magazine, answers.
C: JIMMY
D: Yeah ... for you.
C: TEDDY
D: Who is it?
N: Jimmy doesn't know, sets it down. Teddy comes over wiping his hands on a rag, takes the phone.
C: TEDDY
D: Yeah.
C: FRANK V/O
D: Teddy.
C: TEDDY
D: Who's this?
C: FRANK V/O
D: Frank.
C: TEDDY
D: Frank who?
C: FRANK V/0
D: Frank your brother.
S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: Divorced couples in custody battles wait with their attorneys in a packed courthouse. An lawyer carrying papers clipped with a $10 bill, comes past Richie, who's sitting with his lawyer, a woman he's probably slept with.
C: SHEILA
D: I'm not talking about your proclivities, Richie. Those I only know too well. I'm talking about being a cop.
C: RICHIE
D: About taking money? I don't care about money. I don't do that.
C: SHEILA
D: Because it'll come out. You're going to have to sit down with shrinks and social workers, her lawyers, the judge, lots of questions.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: What's going on there?
N: The judge's assistant rearranging the pre-trial cases in order of the amount of gratuity clipped to each - $5, $10, $20 bills.
C: SHEILA
D: Scheduling.
C: RICHIE
D: No, the money.
C: SHEILA
D: Scheduling. What about your friends from the neighborhood? You still hang out with them?
C: RICHIE
D: I play softball on Sundays with some guys.
C: SHEILA
D: Wise guys. That's going to look good.
C: RICHIE
D: I grew up with them, big deal.
C: SHEILA
D: What about Anthony Zaca?
C: RICHIE
D: What about him?
C: SHEILA
D: Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said. If they're not true, tell me.
C: RICHIE
D: Yeah, Tony's one of them.
C: SHEILA
D: Is he also your son's godfather?
N: Richie nods. Sheila glances over to where Richie's ex-wife sits with her own lawyer across the room.
C: SHEILA
D: Do you really care about this? Or do you just not want her to win - ever. How often do you see your son as it is?
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Not enough. But she wants to make it never.
C: SHEILA
D: Yeah, all right. Give me a twenty. Well, I'm not going to sit here all day.
E: Richie doesn't reach for his wallet
N: She takes a twenty from her purse and carries it up to the judge's assistant clipped to their paperwork.
C: BAILIFF
D: All rise -
S: EXT. HOUSE - TEANECK, NEW JERSEY - DAY
N: Frank and the dog in the back yard of a suburban house. His neighbors - those he can see - are white. He hears a sound - cars arriving - and crosses toward the house where a sold "For Sale" sign leans against a half-built kennel. Out front, a caravan of cars and pickup trucks - North Carolina plates - loaded with boxes and suitcases - has just arrived. Exhausted from the drive but excited to be here, the travelers climb out: Frank's five brothers, their wives and kids, and their mother. Teddy thinks it's the right place. The others aren't as sure. The house is too nice. There's a new Lincoln Towncar parked outside the garage. They'll probably be shot for trespassing. The front door opens and Frank comes out, trailed by his dog. He first gathers his mother in an embrace, then each of his startled brothers.
S: INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE - LATER - DAY
N: The house is alive with the noise of family and scent of home-cooked food as the extended Lucas clan - there's more than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table passing the platters around. Frank, at the head of the table, clearly loves having them all here.
C: TURNER
D: He got an arm on him. Major League arm, ain't that right.
N: Everyone agrees as Turner's son - Frank's nephew - the 18- year-old boy seen pitching in the North Carolina back yard - tries to shrug. (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: You show me after supper.
C: TURNER
D: You can't catch him. He'll take your head off. We're talking 95-mile-an-hour. You know how fast that is? You see the ball leave his hand, and that's the last you see it before it knocks you down.
C: FRANK
D: Is that right.
E: smiling; happy
S: INT. FRANK'S TEANECK HOUSE - LATER - DAY
N: The wonderful noise continues downstairs as Frank leads his mother on a tour of the upstairs. The place is a showroom of traditional Americana.
C: FRANK
D: This is your room.
N: Mrs. Lucas is in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its furnishings. It's unlike anything she's used ever seen - not Graceland exactly - but not far off. Her eyes settle on an old vanity dotted with French perfume bottles.
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: How did you ...
C: FRANK
D: I had it made. From memory.
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: You were five when they took it away. How could you remember it?
C: FRANK
D: I remember.
N: She's stunned. Touches the reproduction of the vanity her son last saw more than thirty years ago.
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: It's perfect. It's all perfect. I'm so proud of you.
E: looks at the room she looks at him
S: EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAY
N: The Statue of Liberty against the New York skyline.
C: FRANK V/O
D: The man I worked for ran one of the biggest companies in New York City for almost fifty years.
S: EXT. HARLEM - DAY
N: As Frank leads his brothers down the sidewalk, the Towncar that was parked at the Teaneck house, driven by Frank's body- guard, Doc, follows alongside at the same pace they walk.
C: FRANK
D: I was with him every day for fifteen of them, looking after him, taking care of things, protecting him, learning from him.
N: The brothers can't help but notice the storekeepers who wave to Frank, the women who smile, the men who step out of his path like there's a red carpet under his polished shoes.
C: FRANK
D: Bumpy was rich, but never white man rich. Why? Because he didn't own the company. He thought he did. He didn't. He only managed it. Someone else owned it. So they owned him.
S: INT/EXT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HARLEM - DAY
N: Frank leads his brothers up the stairs and down the hall.
C: FRANK
D: Nobody owns me. Because I own my company.
N: INTERCUT: Feminine hands stamp small packets of blue cellophane with the words `Blue Magic' -
C: FRANK
D: And my company sells a product that's better than the competition's at a price that's lower.
N: Frank stops outside an apartment door.
C: TEDDY
D: What are we selling, Frank?
N: (CONT) Frank pushes the door open, revealing -
S: INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
N: Five naked women at work tables, their faces veiled by surgical masks, cutting heroin with lactose and quinine in a precise mixture of controlled purity. The Lucas brothers stare as the supervisor of the activity - clothed, with red hair - comes over.
C: REDTOP
D: Hi, Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Honey, these are my brothers.
S: EXT. HARLEM - LATER - DAY
N: Tango strolls down the street like he's the Godfather of Harlem, girl on his arm, bodyguard at his side.
S: INT. DINER - SAME TIME
N: As his brothers eat lunch, Frank - who can see Tango outside - uncaps a glass sugar container.
C: FRANK
D: What matters in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never forgetting where you came from.
N: For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all sugar from the container onto his plate.
C: FRANK
D: You are what you are and that's one of two things. You're nothing ... or you're something. Understand what I'm saying?
N: The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass container. Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up.
C: FRANK
D: I'll be right back.
S: EXT/INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER
N: He comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward Tango, who's buying fruit. Greets him cheerfully -
C: FRANK
D: Hey, Tango, what's up. I was just thinking about you.
E: MORE CONT
C: FRANK
D: I was looking at the jar and you know what? I didn't see nothing in it.
E: CONT'D
C: TANGO
D: The fuck you want, Frank -
N: Before the last word is out of Tango's mouth, Frank's got a gun pressed against his forehead. Silence. Everyone backs away - the bodyguard, too. Tango's girl pulls her arm from his and takes off. Eventually -
C: TANGO
D: What're you going to do, boy? Shoot me in broad daylight? In front of everyone?
N: It's as if life on the street has stopped. No one moves; everyone is looking at Frank; maybe that's what he wants. As Tango laughs at the thought -
C: FRANK
D: Yeah, that's right.
N: Frank pulls the trigger and the big man falls back like someone hit with a board. Frank stands over him and empties the gun in his chest, the shots echoing down the street. Then it's quiet again. Everyone's still looking him, but Frank doesn't run. Instead, he calmly reaches into Tango's suit pocket, takes out a money clip thick with cash, drops it in the "jar" and sets it next to the body.
C: FRANK
D: For the cops. Should be enough.
N: Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place. Tries to remember where he was in his lecture as he tucks the napkin back in his shirt collar.
C: FRANK
D: That basically's the whole picture right there.
S: INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
N: A cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Did you know his girlfriend? Good- looking girl. One of his informants.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Beth.
N: The medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer containing her body. Richie stares at it.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Should've seen their place. Like animals lived there.
C: RICHIE
D: I have seen it.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Chose a good night, huh? Grand Central Station in here.
E: to the examiner
C: MEDICAL EXAMINER
D: It's been like this. I'm lucky I get home before midnight; lots of careless- ness.
N: Richie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half- empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ...
C: REPORTER V/O
D: Heroin addiction is no longer exclusive to big city neighborhoods; it's epidemic -
T: TIME CUT. A TELEVISION:
N: The reports shows lawmakers on Capitol Hill juxtaposed against images of inner-cities, junkies, homicide victims and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia.
C: REPORTER ON TV
D: Since 1965, law enforcement has watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has exploded, reaching into cities as a whole - our suburbs and towns - our schools.
S: INT. POLICE GYM - DAY
N: The TV is in a small police gym where Richie lifts weights, very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops come in, only to leave again when they see him. (CONT)
C: REPORTER ON TV
D: Someone is finally saying: enough. Federal authorities have announced their intention to establish special narcotics bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Newark and other major cities -
N: Toback comes in, watches Richie, alone, working out.
C: RICHIE V/O
D: It's a dog and pony show.
C: TOBACK V/O
D: It's not being advertised as one.
S: INT. POLICE GYM - LATER - DAY
N: Richie's changing into his street clothes.
C: RICHIE
D: But it's federal. I'd have to answer to who? FBI?
C: TOBACK
D: Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else. No FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much temptation for the feeble-minded.
N: Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him -
C: TOBACK
D: Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective.
C: RICHIE
D: You know why I don't have it.
C: TOBACK
D: Doesn't matter.
C: RICHIE
D: No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.
N: (CONT)
C: TOBACK
D: It's fucked up. You're right. Maybe this's an opportunity away from all that.
N: They regard each other. Eventually -
C: RICHIE
D: I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk.
C: TOBACK
D: Done.
S: EXT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: An old building that was once an Episcopal church.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: The place has been long abandoned. The city maintenance worker who let Richie in watches him move through the debris- strewn church.
S: INT. PENTHOUSE - NEW YORK - DAY
N: A real estate broker watches Frank consider the high- ceilinged spaciousness of a grand, unfurnished 50's modern Upper East Side penthouse -

S: INT. MAIN FLOOR - NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - DAY

S: INT. PENTHOUSE - NEW YORK - DAY
N: Frank distractedly opens and closes a 12' high curtain in one of the rooms - (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: No loan, no contingencies. Cash sale.
S: EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
N: Wet streets and neon. Well-dressed crowd behind a velvet rope outside the club. The Apollo in the background: James Brown on the marquee.
S: INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
N: A still-powerful older man in a nice suit rises from his chair to wild applause. From the stage -
C: SINGER
D: Mr. Joe Louis, ladies and gentlemen.
N: Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, and sits back down as the band starts up again. At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young woman at the table.
C: FRANK
D: Who's the beauty queen?
C: CHARLIE
D: She is a beauty queen. No kidding. Miss Puerto Rico. Her glance crosses Frank's briefly but is yanked to the entrance of the club when Frank's brothers come in with their wives and girlfriends. Teddy's in a parrot green suit, gold chains, hat, acting like he owns the place.
S: INT. BACK ROOM - SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER
N: Frank hustles Teddy into an empty back room.
C: FRANK
D: What is this?
N: He turns Teddy so he's facing a mirror.
C: TEDDY
D: What. These are clothes. This is a very nice -
E: suit
N: (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: I'm wearing clothes. These are clothes. Those - - are a costume. With a sign on it that says Arrest me. You look like fuckin Jackie Fox.
E: Teddy's in the mirror
C: TEDDY
D: What's wrong with Jackie. I like Jackie.
C: FRANK
D: You like Jackie? You want to be Superfly? Go work for him, end up in a cell with him.
N: Teddy pulls himself from Frank's grasp. Smooths his shirt, adjusts his hat. Frank tries to explain to him:
C: FRANK
D: The guy making all the noise in the room is the weak one. That's not who you want to be.
C: TEDDY
D: He wants to talk to you by the way. I told him I'd tell you.
N: Frank stares at his brother's reflection in the mirror.
C: FRANK
D: You and Jackie were talking about me?
C: TEDDY
D: Not about you. We were talking. He said he wanted to talk to you about something.
N: Frank clearly wants nothing to do with Jackie Fox.
C: FRANK
D: I'm taking you shopping tomorrow.
C: TEDDY
D: I went shopping today.
C: FRANK
D: You go shopping every day. Like a girl.
S: EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT
N: A creme Bentley pulls up and out pour Jackie Fox and his entourage. (CONT) He's got an armful of New York Times Magazines -with him on the cover, flaunting Gangster Chic. He starts handing them out to the crowd on his way into the club.
S: INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
N: Joe Louis has come over to speak to Frank at his table.
C: JOE LOUIS
D: It's a tax thing. It's a mistake my lawyers will straighten out, but for the time being it's a headache -
C: FRANK
D: How much you owe?
C: JOE LOUIS
D: It's nothing, like - fifty grand.
N: Frank isn't sure if it's an honor or a curse to have a celebrity like Joe Louis asking to borrow money, but nods.
C: FRANK
D: Sure. Don't worry about it.
C: JOE LOUIS
D: Thank you. I'll pay you back soon as -
C: FRANK
D: Joe. It's a gift. Not a loan. You don't owe me nothing.
N: Jackie glides into the club with his magazines and entourage. Frank watches him make the rounds, lingering at Miss Puerto Rico's table and holding her hand longer than he should with his girlfriend on his arm. Frank glances to Teddy wearily, then to Doc, alone at the next table like a sentry. Frank doesn't have to say he's ready to leave. Doc knows the look. Gets up.
S: INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - LATER - NIGHT
N: Frank comes into the coat check area where Doc waits with his overcoat. As Frank slips into it, Miss Puerto Rico - returning from the ladies room - comes through.
C: ANA
D: Hi. I'm Ana.
C: FRANK
D: I'm Frank.
N: (CONT)
C: ANA
D: You're Frank and this is your place. Why's it called Small's? Why don't you call it Frank's?
E: he doesn't say whether it is or not
C: FRANK
D: Because I don't have to.
N: He smiles, and it's hard to tell which is more enchanted with the other.
S: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NEWARK - SAME TIME - NIGHT
N: A club across the river. Not nearly as nice as Small's - much louder - but like Small's, almost all black. Richie shares a booth with a black undercover detective.
C: RICHIE
D: I'm reluctant to bring anyone in I don't personally know.
C: SPEARMAN
D: You know me, and I vouch for them.
N: Richie nods, Yeah, he knows that, but remains unconvinced.
C: SPEARMAN
D: Richie, we work together. You want me, you got to take them, too.
C: RICHIE
D: Where are they? Spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor.
C: SPEARMAN
D: That's Jones. With the skinny white woman.
N: Richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with his skinny white date.
C: SPEARMAN
D: That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one.
N: Richie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman. Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops. (CONT)
C: SPEARMAN
D: Both are good with wires. Have good informants. They're honest. And they're fearless. They'll do anything. They're insane, Richie, like you.
S: INT. FRANK'S CAR - MOVING - NEW YORK - DAY
N: Frank sits in back alone. Peers ahead through the windshield. His face relaxes as he sees -
S: EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
N: Ana waiting on a corner, dressed nice, handbag. The Towncar pulls to the curb.
C: FRANK
D: I got it.
N: Frank gets out before Doc can, and escorts Ana to the car.
C: FRANK
D: I hope you weren't waiting long. A woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait for anything.
N: He opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman, slides in after her.
S: EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY
N: Outside the house, Doc sits in the car reading a newspaper.
S: INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY
N: Ana considers some family photographs on a mantle.
C: ANA
D: This is your father?
N: Frank shakes his head no. It's a picture of Bumpy.
C: FRANK
D: You really don't know who that is? It's Martin Luther King.
E: she doesn't
C: ANA
D: It is not.
C: FRANK
D: You're right. He was as important as Dr. King, though.
E: CONT
C: ANA
D: What'd he do?
C: FRANK
D: A lot of things. He had a lot of friends. He served New York and it served him.
C: ANA
D: What was he to you?
N: Frank has to think. Bumpy was more than his employer.
C: FRANK
D: Teacher.
C: ANA
D: What'd he teach you?
C: FRANK
D: How to take my time ... how if you're going to do something, do it with care ... do it with love.
N: And it's working here. It's seductive.
C: ANA
D: Anything else?
T: FLASHCUTS -
N: Sudden bursts of violence - guys beat up - others shot - one being poured with gasoline as Bumpy looks on calmly - BACK TO FRANK'S LIVING ROOM The same calm, benign face in the photograph. Frank nods.
C: FRANK
D: How be a gentleman.
C: ANA
D: That's what you are?
N: Ana smiles like she knows better. Any second now, like every other guy she's ever met, she's sure he'll try to take her upstairs.
C: FRANK
D: I got five different apartments in the city I could've taken you to. I brought you here instead -
N: (CONT) Ana glances to the stairs which Frank's mother is coming down.
C: FRANK
D: To meet my mother.
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: Is this her? Oh, she's beautiful, Frank. Look at her. She's an angel come down from heaven.
N: Mrs. Lucas embraces Ana like family. 105 OMIT 105 OMIT
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: A single, half-empty packet of heroin, the same one from the morgue, in distinctive blue cellophane, tacked to a bulletin board. Richie, perched on a desk in front of it.
C: RICHIE
D: Our mandate is to make major arrests. No street guys - we want the suppliers - the distributors.
N: Spearman, Jones and Abruzzo sit in the back, looking like delinquent students. Of everyone in the open ground-floor that's been only slightly renovated - and there are about fifteen of them - they're the most disreputable-looking.
C: RICHIE
D: Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. No grass under a thousand pounds. Less than that, someone else can waste their time.
N: Jones nudges Abruzzo to pay attention. Abruzzo elbows him back. Richie just waits like a teacher for their attention.
C: RICHIE
D: We'll be handling big shipments, big money, big temptation. Yeah.
E: Jones raises his hand
C: JONES
D: There's a story about you. About turning in some money. A lot of money. Is it true?
N: Jones isn't the only one here curious to know. Simply: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: It's not true.
S: INT/EXT. CAR / STREET - NEWARK - DAY
N: Abruzzo, looking like a junkie, dirty jeans, wool cap, approaches a dealer on the corner. The perspective shifts to Richie, Spearman and Jones in a car, watching as Abruzzo chats briefly with the dealer before the exchange takes place: $10 for a blue-cellophane packet.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - DAY
N: Richie and the others watch Jones tests the heroin.
C: JONES
D: Stuff's ten percent pure. Strong enough to smoke for all those suburban white kids afraid of needles.
N: The other detectives are exchange a glance. None has ever heard of anything on the street that pure.
C: RICHIE
D: You paid ten bucks for it?
C: JONES
D: And it's all that's out there.
C: RICHIE
D: Now, how is that possible? Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much? Richie glances to a Table of Organization: Surveillance photos haphazardly thumb-tacked to a bulletin board - known dope men in the hierarchies of their individual crime families - almost all of them Italian.
N: WOMB TO TOMB SEQUENCE: An R & B song begins and continues over - CLOSE-UPS: A poppy bulb being pierced, the white liquid oozing, changing into filthy liquids in wooden bowls, and finally a gray paste ...
S: INT. BANK VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CHEMICAL BANK - DAY
N: Frank sits with the bank Vice President who wires a transfer to:
S: INT. BANGKOK BANK - DAY
N: Where Nate sits with the same Thai bank president as before who converts the transfer to cash.
S: INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - BANGKOK - DAY
N: Nate slides cash across a table to a couple of Chinese gangsters.
S: EXT. JUNGLE ARMY BASE - VIETNAM - DAY
N: A tent: Nate hands more cash - the military brass's cut - to the 2-star general from before. An airstrip: Slicing propellers. Wounded soldiers on stretchers, helped onto a transport plane. Nearby, four large crates - Japanese TVs - under cargo netting. The pilot stuffs more cash in a pouch and salutes Nate. TV IMAGE: General Westmoreland returns a salute (archive).
S: EXT. ARMY BASE - NORTH CAROLINA - DUSK
N: The same plane on the tarmac here, taxiing. A pile of discarded TV boxes outside a supply warehouse. At the perimeter of the base, black servicemen transfer heavy taped-up duffel bags from an Army Jeep to a station wagon, hoisting those that won't fit inside onto a roof rack. Two Lucas brothers tie them down with twine.
S: INT/EXT. CAR / HIGHWAY - NEAR WASHINGTON DC - DUSK
N: The station wagon heading north on a rain-slicked highway, the canvas tarpaulin on top flapping. In the distance, the spire of the Washington monument glows.
S: EXT. DISCOUNT DRUGSTORE - HARLEM - DAY
N: A black woman pushes a shopping cart containing a baby, Pampers, and cases of milk sugar across a parking lot.
S: INT. RED TOP'S APARTMENT - HARLEM - DAY
N: Empty milk sugar boxes. Redtop and her five table workers - clothed now, the surgical masks dangling from their necks - wiping down table surfaces, scales and apparatus. Tens of thousands of blue-cellophane packets of heroin neatly cover two of the folding tables.
S: EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY
N: August. Hot. Kids wrench open a fire hydrant and with an empty soda can direct the water into a fountain. The water sprays down onto the windshield of a beat-up Chevy coming slowly through, revealing when it clears, Frank behind the wheel. He parks. Glances at his watch.
S: INT. NYPD 23RD PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: Clock on the wall of a locker area: 3:58. Shift change. Cops in t-shirts. Fans blowing the humid air around.
S: INT/EXT. NYPD 23RD PRECINCT GARAGE - DAY
N: Blue and whites arriving and leaving, shirts coming off as the cops alight.
S: INT. BUS - MOVING ON 116TH STREET - DAY
N: The driver checks his watch: 3:59. Turns his almost-empty bus up 8th Avenue.
S: INT/EXT. FRANK'S PARKED CHEVY - HARLEM - DAY
N: Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4 o'clock. Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy and watches 116th Street transform: It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls. Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts, tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware. Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably filthy rooms, plunged into veins - AND THE REVERSE: 10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered to the Lucas brothers, to: LESTER at his metal door shop. EUGENE at his dry cleaners. TURNER at his tire service shop. EARL at his electrical shop. (CONT) TEDDY at his body shop.
S: INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Piles of cash. The brothers try counting it all, but it's just too much. It's actually tiring.
C: TEDDY
D: We're going to be here all night if we count every bill.
N: TIME CUT: A money-counting machine flips through the bills, its counter flying. The brothers rubberband it all in $100,000 decks. Jot down the numbers. Put the money in newly-assembled file boxes. Tape them shut.
S: INT. CHEMICAL BANK - SAFETY-DEPOSIT ROOM - DAY
N: Alone in the room, Frank transfers stacks of $100's from the file boxes into several open safety-deposit boxes.
S: INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The penthouse is now richly decorated. The R & B music playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system. It's a kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President.
C: BANKER
D: You got a stockbroker, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: I deal with enough crooks as it is.
N: The banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of one of his business cards.
C: BANKER
D: This one couldn't be more honest. Ask around. He's got a lot of clients in the business. You can't leave all your money in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.
N: The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is beginning to make him uncomfortable.
C: CHARLIE
D: Frank. This is Mike Sibota.
N: Sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels. (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: Mr. Sibota. What can I get you?
C: SIBOTA
D: A left-hander from what Charlie tells me. Your nephew?
N: Frank points to his nephew, Stevie, across the room.
C: FRANK
D: It's been his dream all his life to play for the Yankees - and he's good enough.
C: SIBOTA
D: So I hear. You have him come see me. We'll give him a try-out.
N: As the scout hands his card to Frank, we whip over to where Teddy, his driver Jimmy Racine and their girlfriends, coked up, are laughing as a black cop, flashing his detective's shield, pretends to frisk Jimmy.
C: DETECTIVE
D: What's this? Oh, that's it, I'm taking you in.
E: taking a .45 from Jimmy's pocket
C: JIMMY
D: You can't take me in for that, I got a license for that, motherfucker.
E: joking
C: DETECTIVE
D: This then - But first -
E: gives the gun back the pile of coke on the coffee table
N: The cop sucks up a line before pretending to cuff Jimmy.
C: DETECTIVE
D: All right, now I'm arresting you.
N: Everybody laughs. Teddy peels $100's from a money clip.
C: TEDDY
D: Let him go. This is for you.
C: DETECTIVE
D: What is that, a bribe? Oh, now you're all under arrest.
E: CONT
N: The cop pretends to arrest them all, but what he doesn't pretend is the hand he puts on Jimmy's girlfriend's breast as he frisks her.
C: JIMMY
D: What is that?
N: It was quick but Jimmy saw it, even though his girlfriend didn't react. The cop, oblivious, is cuffing Teddy now.
C: DETECTIVE
D: I'm taking you all in.
C: JIMMY
D: I said, what the fuck was that?
C: DETECTIVE
D: What was what?
N: The room explodes with a boom and the detective crumples to the floor, clutching at his leg, blood running through his fingers onto the carpet. Frank stares.
C: JIMMY
D: Oh, he's all right. I just shot him in the leg. You got a health plan, what are you complaining about. He's fine. Here - Five hundred all right? Six? Look, he's feeling better all the time.
E: peels off some money
N: Suddenly, Frank grabs Jimmy and throws him against the wall.
S: INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: As Ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt and soda water, Frank sits with his five brothers in the debris-strewn aftermath of the party. Silence before:
C: FRANK
D: I can't have this kind of stupidity.
C: TEDDY
D: It was an accident. He feels terrible about it.
C: FRANK
D: He doesn't feel shit, coked up all the time. Get rid of him.
N: (CONT)
C: TEDDY
D: Frank. He's your cousin. What's he gonna do? Go back home? I'll talk to him. I'll straighten him out.
N: Frank looks at Teddy in his tinted Jackie Fox-like goggle glasses - like he's going to straighten anybody out.
C: FRANK
D: Gimme those glasses.
C: TEDDY
D: What? Why?
N: Frank pulls them from Teddy's face and crushes them.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie sifts through the morning mail at his desk. Stops on an envelope from the New Jersey Bar Association. As he works up the nerve to open it, Spearman, Jones and Abruzzo organize the Italian wise guys' photos on the T.O.
C: JONES
D: Ice Pick Paul goes here -
C: ABRUZZO
D: No, he's under Benny Two-Socks -
C: JONES
D: No, you're thinking of Benny the Bishop. Benny Two-Socks is Tosca's deadbeat son- in-law.
C: SPEARMAN
D: Jonesy's right.
N: Richie comes over, studies the Table of Organization a moment, then begins untacking the photos from the top down -
C: JONES
D: What're you doing? We just -
C: RICHIE
D: For a cop the uppermost thing is the arrest. For a prosecutor, the arrest is nothing without the evidence to convict. We don't have any real evidence on anyone on this board, so they're coming down. We're starting over from the street.
N: (CONT)
C: ABRUZZO
D: What are you, a prosecutor all of a sudden?
N: Richie tacks his exam results onto the T.O. He passed.
S: EXT. STREET - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie and the Amigos observe a buy from a parked car, the blue cellophane changing hands. Ignoring the buyer as he walks away, they keep watching the seller.
S: EXT. GAS STATION / CAR WASH - NEWARK - DAY
N: The seller is observed coming out of a mechanics garage. Richie ignores him as he walks away, watching instead the garage. Eventually, a mechanic wiping his hands on a rag steps out, and Richie raises a camera. The image of the mechanic - a supplier - freezes -
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: A slightly-blurred photo of the mechanic goes up on a new, almost bare Table of Organization.
S: EXT. GAS STATION / CAR WASH - NEWARK - DAY
N: Atop of a telephone pole, Abruzzo, dripping with lineman equipment, works to attach a `slave' to the lines -
S: INT. STOREFRONT APARTMENT - DAY
N: Bare room. Richie, Jones and Spearman eating take-out food as tape recorder reels turn.
C: PHONE VOICE
D: Those snow tires you give me last time come in yet? I'm going to want some more of them, gimme one and a half more of them.
N: The detectives laugh.
S: INT. PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Toback has Richie sign a voucher for $20,000 cash.
C: TOBACK
D: This is more than a year's salary, Richie. If it disappears, I won't be able to get it for you again.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: It'll never be out of my sight.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Jones tapes a tape recorder the size of a pack of cigarettes to Richie's bare chest.
S: INT. GAS STATION GARAGE - DAY
N: Undercover in a wise guy's cashmere sweater and slacks, Richie watches the mechanic count the $10,000 he's given him.
C: RICHIE
D: It's got to be `Blue Magic.'
C: MECHANIC
D: Yeah, yeah, it's `Blue.' You can pick it up here tomorrow. Where's the rest of the money?
C: RICHIE
D: That's half. I'll give you the other half tomorrow when you give -
C: MECHANIC
D: No, no, no, I don't do that. Go fuck yourself.
N: Richie rather reluctantly hands over the rest of the 20K.
S: INT/EXT. SPEARMAN'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - DAY
N: Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington Bridge - and glances over concerned to Richie, who is changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt.
C: SPEARMAN
D: He's going into New York. Are we?
C: RICHIE
D: What are they going to do, arrest us?
C: SPEARMAN
D: They could. New York cops. They can do worse than that.
C: RICHIE
D: We're not losing that money. Go.
N: (CONT) As Spearman follows the truck, the George Washington Bridge, linking Jersey to Manhattan, looms in the windshield ...
S: EXT. EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY
N: The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on. Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck. Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.
C: RICHIE
D: Get out.
C: TAXI DRIVER
D: What?
C: RICHIE
D: Get the fuck out of the car!
N: The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in. He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic, screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding - The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple car-lengths ahead - in sight.
S: EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY
N: Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride. (CONT) From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair - the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant. Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol. Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they come past Richie -
C: RICHIE
D: That's my money.
N: SIU DET 1 The fuck are you. What money? Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID.
C: RICHIE
D: The bills are sequenced and registered with the Essex County Prosecutors Office. All begin with CF3500. Take a look.
N: One of them checks some of the bills and sees he's right. SIU DET. 2 Goddamn it, I thought we had a score. I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft sitting in my driveway.
C: RICHIE
D: Honest mistake. Just give it back to me.
N: SIU DET. 1 This time. Three of the four cops laugh. It's an affable gang of thieves. The one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others start off. He examines Richie's New Jersey ID.
C: TRUPO
D: When's the last time I was in Jersey? Let me think. Never. What're you doing coming over here without letting anybody know? You don't know you can get hurt doing that?
E: MORE CONT
C: TRUPO
D: You got your money. Now, never, ever, come into the city again unannounced. You come in to see a fuckin Broadway show you call ahead first to see if it's okay with me.
E: CONT'D Trupo smiles; Richie smiles
N: Trupo pats him on the back and leaves with the others.
C: TOBACK V.O.
D: What do we hate most? Isn't it the transgressions of others we fear we're capable of ourselves?
N: 147 - 148 OMIT 147 - 148 OMIT
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - LATER - NIGHT
N: It's very late. Richie and Toback are alone. Eventually -
C: TOBACK
D: Richie - cops are like -
C: RICHIE
D: Yeah, I know, like everyone else. Some of them will steal no matter what. There can be a camera on them they'll do it. Some'll never do it. The rest are capable of either, depending how their department leans ... Only theirs isn't leaning, it's fallen over. The patrol cars don't even stop in Harlem, just roll down the window so the dealers can throw the money in. I saw drops made on precinct steps.
C: TOBACK
D: What were you doing there?
C: RICHIE
D: It's where this dope is coming from. Blue Magic. Out of New York. What am I supposed to do, ignore it?
C: TOBACK
D: The cab driver's filed aggravated assault and grand theft charges -
C: RICHIE
D: He wouldn't stop. Motherfucker almost ran me over.
N: (CONT)
C: TOBACK
D: - which he may reconsider depending on the amount the State of New Jersey offers to settle -
C: RICHIE
D: I told him I was a cop. I showed him my identification.

D: You stole his cab and broke his arm.
C: RICHIE
D: I was chasing your 20 thousand dollars.
C: TOBACK
D: I don't want to hear about you going into New York anymore.
C: RICHIE
D: Then my investigation's over.
C: TOBACK
D: You're not listening to me. I said: I don't want to hear about it ... You do whatever you have to do, go wherever you have to go to find out who's bringing this shit into the country ... Just don't tell me. Get some sleep. A150 - 152 OMIT A150 - 152 OMIT
E: turns to leave
S: AA153 INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING AA153
N: Richie - in robe and underwear - opens the door to find a woman in the hall holding a briefcase.
C: VIDA
D: Mr. Roberts? I'm here for our appointment.
N: He has no idea who the black woman is. An old girlfriend he's forgotten maybe. Behind him, Vida can see a stewardess buttoning up her uniform by a little travel case on wheels. The apartment itself, she can also see, is a mess.
C: VIDA
D: From Child Social Services?
N: A153 - 155 OMIT A153 - 155 OMIT
S: EXT/INT. TONY ZACA'S BACKYARD & POOL HOUSE - DAY
N: Barbecue after their Sunday softball game. Richie and his O.C. friends - wise guys - still in their brown and orange Weequahie jerseys, drinking beer, cooking hamburgers.
C: TONY
D: When you asked me to be your son's godfather, I took it very seriously.
C: RICHIE
D: I know.
N: Richie and Tony Zaca relax in the den-like pool house.
C: TONY
D: I said yes, I'd take on this responsibility, take care of your son, God forbid something happened to you -
C: RICHIE
D: Tony, the things she's telling Child Social Services make me look very bad: Out all night. Lowlife informants hanging around. Women -
C: TONY
D: Old friends like me.
N: Richie feels horrible doing this. Silence. Then:
C: TONY
D: It's all right. I understand. They ask me, I'll tell them what you want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.
C: RICHIE
D: Thank you.
N: Tony nods, You're welcome. Can tell there's something else on Richie's mind.
C: TONY
D: What.
C: RICHIE
D: You don't have to talk about it, you don't want. What do you hear about Blue Magic? Anything?
C: TONY
D: A lot of sorrow and misery from guys being put out of business. That's all.
E: CONT
C: RICHIE
D: Nothing about who's bringing it in?
C: TONY
D: Guys down south is all I heard.
C: RICHIE
D: Down south, Florida? Cubans? What.
C: TONY
D: I don't know. All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're upsetting the natural order of things.
N: Among the framed family photos around them, is a picture of Tony's uncle, Albert Tosca.
S: EXT. LIVINGSTON, NEW JERSEY - DAY
N: A Napoleonic statue of the same man on horseback in a fountain outside a castle-like mansion. Next to it "ride" three others on marble horses - a woman and two children.
C: TOSCA
D: Pull -
N: A clay pigeon sails out across the manicured garden. A shotgun blast shatters it. The man with the gun - Albert Tosca - hands another to Frank. As Frank sets to shoot, Ana can seen behind them, with Tosca's wife in the opulent house, looking uncomfortable.
C: MRS. TOSCA
D: The whole place was imported brick by brick from Gloucestershire.
C: ANA
D: It's very nice.
N: Mrs. Tosca nods. Ana nods. A strained silence thicker than the tapestries settles over them until -
C: FRANK
D: Pull -
N: The shotgun booms -
S: INT. TOSCA'S MANSION - LATER - DAY
N: As servants stand by, Tosca and his wife and their only guests - Frank and Ana - finished with lunch, get up from the table in the formal Formal dining room. (CONT) As Mrs. Tosca leads Ana off to give her a tour of the house, the men head off the other way.
C: TOSCA
D: She's a lovely girl. You should marry her.
C: FRANK
D: Too many things to look after right now to think about that.
C: TOSCA
D: Frank. That's a mistake. If I may say. Don't take her for granted, girl like that.
N: They enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books.
C: TOSCA
D: You interested in history, Frank? The events that have brought us to where we are today? You know who was? Bumpy.
C: FRANK
D: Bumpy was interested in a lot of things.
C: TOSCA
D: I always wonder if people know when history's being made. And what they're doing at the time. This, for instance, could be a historic moment, and you're sipping a glass of ice water.
N: Droplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here.
C: TOSCA
D: Bumpy and I did a lot of business together, as you know. Whatever he needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my best to provide it. He came to me, I didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying to make. You know why?
C: FRANK
D: He didn't have what you needed. You had what he needed. We've always had to come to you.
C: TOSCA
D: Yes. Until now.
N: Tosca studies Frank, who is a study in inscrutability. (CONT)
C: TOSCA
D: Monopolies are illegal in this country, Frank, because no one can compete with a monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers do that, half of them would go out of business tomorrow.
C: FRANK
D: I'm just trying to make a living.
C: TOSCA
D: Which is your right. Because this is America. But not at the unreasonable expense of others. That's un-American. You know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn't represent its true cost of production. It's controlled. Set.
E: he studies Frank
C: FRANK
D: I set a price I think is fair.
C: TOSCA
D: It's very unfair, in fact. Your customers are happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? You're not thinking of them.
C: FRANK
D: I'm thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me.
E: very calmly
C: TOSCA
D: All right. I can see you're getting excited. Don't get excited. That's not why I invited you to my home. To get excited.
N: Frank doesn't look excited at all. He's the picture of calm. Tosca smiles benignly and gets up.
C: TOSCA
D: Here, I got something for you.
S: INT. TOSCA'S SMOKING ROOM - LATER - DAY
N: Tosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of Cuban cigars.
C: TOSCA
D: Now what if - I'm just thinking out loud - you sold some of your inventory wholesale and I helped with the distribution.
E: CONT
C: FRANK
D: I don't need it. I already got everything from 110th Street to Yankee Stadium, river to river.
C: TOSCA
D: Which is a little mom and pop store compared to what I'm talking about. I could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A., Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace of mind. You know what I mean by that.
N: Frank does. It's a backhanded threat. Tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine
C: TOSCA
D: Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance man. Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil rights, they don't know. They're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it. But I can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding. That's what I mean by peace of mind.
N: Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad.
C: FRANK
D: You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd consider 50. And I can get you as much as you want. Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him.
C: TOSCA
D: You see, I was right. This is a historic moment. You're going to be bigger than Bumpy himself.
N: He hands Frank one of the cigars, expertly prepared.
C: TOSCA
D: Can't smoke it here, unfortunately. Grace doesn't like it. Take it with you.
S: INT/EXT. TOSCA'S MANSION - LATER - DAY
N: Doc waits by the car as Frank and Ana walk toward him. The Toscas wave goodbye from the front step of the mansion. Frank slips the cigar into his top pocket as they climb in.
C: ANA
D: Why would you trust these people, the way they look at you?
C: FRANK
D: They look at me like it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.
C: ANA
D: They looked at us like we're the help.
C: FRANK
D: No. They're working for me now.
E: kisses her cheek
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much. Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of octopus yet to have a head. Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). The rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up. They've hit a wall they can't get past.
S: INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - DUSK
N: Another TV here: Howard Cosell, ringside at the Garden as the first early fans arrive, pointing out that the fight, because of the political stand Ali's taken, is less about boxers than war versus anti-war. Frank chooses a linen jacket from his extensive color- coordinated racks of Phil Cromfeld suits as Ana, in her lingerie, puts on make-up at a vanity. He comes up behind her and sets down a small jewelry box.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - SAME TIME
N: The TV in the background as Richie puts a camera with a long lens in a sports bag and reaches for his coat - (CONT) 164 OMIT 164 OMIT
S: INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUED
N: Ana's reflection in the vanity mirror as Frank slips the engagement ring on her finger. She wipes at a tear, then gets up and hugs him.
C: ANA
D: Yes.
N: She kisses him. Admires the ring. And -
C: ANA
D: I bought you something, too.
N: She crosses past the TV, takes a garment bag down from her side of the closet, lays it on the bed next to Frank's suit jacket. She takes hold of the zipper but doesn't immediately pull it, hoping perhaps to create some dramatic tension.
C: FRANK
D: What is it?
N: She unzips the bag like she's unveiling great art. But instead of seeing what's inside, we're allowed only Frank's reaction: his smile of anticipation slowly changing to chagrin.
S: INT/EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: Richie observes celebrities and gangsters arriving in limousines - Sammy Davis Jr. and his wife, Joe Louis and his, Tosca and some of his guys - then enters the arena as another limo pulls up. Ana climbs out.
C: ANA
D: Come on. You look great. You want to miss the fight? Come on.
E: no one else emerges
N: Finally, a patent leather shoe pokes out, sets down on the curb. Then its mate beside it. The shoes step away from the limo and -
S: INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
N: Pre-fight. Richie, blended in with the a group of press photographers, regards the organized crime figures ringside. He takes a few pictures with the long lens camera as - (CONT) The owner of the gleaming patent leather shoes is shown to his second row ringside seat just behind the sports writers, and we move up the full-length chinchilla coat to Frank's uneasy expression - Richie's camera roams the faces of the prime ticket holders ringside: organized crime figures, celebrities, politicians, women with plunging necklines and platinum hair -
C: JOE LOUIS
D: Excuse me -
N: Richie can't believe it's Joe Louis brushing past him -
C: RICHIE
D: Mr. Louis -
N: Joe looks back as Richie approaches him -
C: RICHIE
D: I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you, sir, you were a hero to me growing up. I still push elevator buttons eight times for the rounds you beat Billy Conn in. For luck.
N: Louis acknowledges Richie only slightly more than not at all. Turns away to join his friends. Richie watches after him, stung by Louis's disregard. He snaps a picture of an Italian wise guy he doesn't recognize ... sifts the camera's view past Frank in the chinchilla coat ... then returns to him, watches as Tosca and his guys sit down behind Frank. Richie can't hear - but can see - their good-natured exchange -
C: TOSCA
D: Hey, Frank, you keep that hat on, I'm gonna miss the fight -
N: The odd thing to Richie is, Chinchilla's seat is better than all the Italians'. Detective Trupo notices this, too. Richie focuses on the Chincilla's date, a stunning girl, a beauty queen, then shifts back to her boyfriend who's now shaking the proffered hands of other Italians, then Don King. Joe Louis himself - who barely acknowledged Richie's existence - comes over and playfully exchanges "punches" with the man in the chinchilla coat. A sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except for the spot on the ring. Ali and Frazier are coming down the steps through the crush of fans and reporters, preceded by soldiers carrying flags - (CONT) Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring - Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and snaps the shutter -
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie tacks the photograph of the man in the chinchilla coat to his Table of Organization - low and off to the side by other pieces of the puzzle that don't fit, other new faces with no names. Spearman holds a scrap of paper -
C: RICHIE
D: That's is the plate number on the limo. Check with the company, who rented it.
C: SPEARMAN
D: He's a supplier at most. Or just a pimp. We'd've heard of him otherwise.
C: RICHIE
D: No, he's bigger than that. His seats were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's. Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand.
N: They look from Tosca's high position on the board to Frank's low one, and a wedding march played in traditional fashion on organ begins and carries over:
S: INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY
N: From above, a sea of ladies' hats, all coral and pink. Below, Frank stands at the altar, waiting for his bride.
C: RICHIE V/O
D: His name is Frank Lucas ...
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Toback sifts through documents Richie has gathered: limousine company records, Frank's thin arrest record, mug shots of him years younger, the photograph from the fights and some more from subsequent surveillances.
C: RICHIE
D: Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina. Couple of arrests years ago. Gambling, robbery, unlicensed firearm.
E: MORE CONT

S: INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - CONTINUED - DAY
N: Frank's mother tearfully watches her son slip a ring onto Ana's finger next to the fat engagement diamond - before Ana, in turn, puts a gold band on Frank's. The minister pronounces them husband and wife, the veil is lifted, and they kiss to great applause -
S: EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY
N: As a photographer takes the official photograph of the wedding party on the steps of the church -
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - CONTINUED
N: Lou Toback looks from a surveillance photo of the wedding party in his hands, to Richie's Table of Organization: The Lucas brothers and cousins - in the streets of New York and New Jersey, arranged in some imagined hierarchy.
C: TOBACK
D: Not your typical day in the life of a dope man, Richie.
C: RICHIE
D: Neither was Bumpy Johnson's and he owned Harlem.
N: (CONT)
C: TOBACK
D: You think Frank Lucas took over for Bumpy Johnson? His driver? That's a little far-fetched.
C: RICHIE
D: Is it? Everything he does, he does like Bumpy.
C: TOBACK
D: Bumpy never wore a chinchilla coat in his life.
C: RICHIE
D: We haven't seen that again. That apparently has been retired to the closet.
S: EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY
N: Frank and Charlie look on as Ana throws the bouquet.
C: CHARLIE
D: She's the most beautiful bride I ever saw, Frank.
C: FRANK
D: I wish Bumpy could've met her. I wish she could've met him.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - CONTINUED
N: Looking at the Lucas Table of Organization -
C: TOBACK
D: What do you got on him you can use in court? Because this isn't it. You try this without informants and powder, no one's going to jail.
C: RICHIE
D: Won't get any informants. Not inside. It's like a Sicilian family. Like he's structured his own family the same way to protect himself.
S: EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - CONTINUED
N: Exactly like one, like a scene from The Godfather as Frank dances with Ana before the reception guests.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - CONTINUED
C: RICHIE
D: Being with Bumpy long as he was, he would have been around Italians a lot. Enough to learn that much.
S: EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - CONTINUED
N: Rice rains down on the bride and groom as they climb into the back of the Towncar. Doc comes around to the driver's side, gets in and slowly pushes through the crush of guests waving and throwing kisses.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - CONTINUED
C: RICHIE
D: But it's not even Frank Lucas I want. I want to know who he's working for: Which Italians are bringing the heroin in.
S: INT/EXT. TOWNCAR / NEW YORK - TWILIGHT
N: Flanked front and rear by Frank's security, the marriage car moves along a rain-slick street. The newlyweds cuddle in back. Another car pulls up alongside - Trupo's Shelby - and Doc's right hand instinctively comes off the steering wheel to settle on his holstered gun. Trupo smiles and shakes his head, no.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER - TWILIGHT
N: The Lincoln and security cars and Trupo's Shelby parked.
C: FRANK
D: Stay in the car
E: to Ana
N: As Frank and Doc climb out, Frank motions to his other security men to remain calm, he'll handle this.
C: TRUPO
D: Hello, Frank.
N: If Frank is surprised Trupo knows his name, he doesn't show it, or anything else except an air of professional courtesy.
C: FRANK
D: Detective.
N: Trupo looks in at Ana in the back seat, smiles at her. She turns her head away and closes the door. Trupo leads Frank away for a private conversation - (CONT)
C: TRUPO
D: You sure you done the right thing? She's a beautiful girl - there's no question - but she's got an attitude on -
E: her
C: FRANK
D: Listen to me. Before you say another word - about her - or me - remember that you're saying it on the most important fuckin day of my life.
C: TRUPO
D: Man walks around in a fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and he never even bought me a cup of coffee? Something wrong there.
C: FRANK
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
C: TRUPO
D: You pay your bills, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: You want to keep talking, talk to my lawyer, here's his card. You call him, because we're done here -
C: TRUPO
D: Do you pay your bills, I asked you.
C: FRANK
D: If you're not getting your share, it's not my fault, go ask the chief of police.
C: TRUPO
D: What's my share? You don't even know me. Maybe I'm special.
C: FRANK
D: No, you're all the fuckin same.
C: TRUPO
D: What does that say? Special - Investigations - Unit. See that word there? "Special." Ten grand, first of each month, delivered here.
E: shows his shield Frank ignores him he takes out a restaurant business card CONT
N: Frank ignores the card, stares at Trupo like he's a fool.
C: FRANK
D: Detective ... There are some things you don't do. This is one of them. Not on a man's wedding day.
N: Frank's resolve throws Trupo off his rhythm. He manages:
C: TRUPO
D: Have a nice honeymoon.
S: INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
N: Frank doesn't carry Ana across the threshold. He strides in leaving her at the front door, throws a match in the gas fireplace, comes back from the bedroom a moment later with the $50,000 chinchilla coat and throws it on the flames.

D: Fuck you, I'm not telling you. She comes past the TV and into the kitchen past a table covered with dope paraphernalia.
C: JIMMY
D: Where is my fuckin dope? You and your girlfriends take it again? I'll fuckin kill you.
N: She yanks open a drawer, grabs a knife and slashes it at him. He grabs a gun and she runs for the stairs -

C: SPEARMAN V/O PHONE
D: Richie. Newark just picked up one of the celebrities on our Wall of Fame: Teddy's driver. For attempted murder.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - NIGHT
N: Richie's had Jimmy Racine brought over. Sits with him as the Three Amigos watch from the shadows. Just coming off his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement.
C: RICHIE
D: Because it's an attempted homicide, that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably. Might turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self Defense even. She had a knife. Depends on how I want to deal with you. You see where this is going.
N: Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.
C: JIMMY
D: The fuck is this place?
C: RICHIE
D: Let's say you beat it somehow. What do you think Cousin Frank'll think of that? He knows you had to sit here listening to something like this. And then you beat an attempted murder? Is he stupid? He'll assume you talked.
N: Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him. (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: You fucked up, Jimmy. But nobody knows. Frank doesn't know. Yet. Do you want him to read about it in the paper? Or do you want to walk out of here - no bail, no trial - just walk out, now.
S: EXT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAWN
N: Jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the building into the chilly morning air.
C: RICHIE V/O
D: Jimmy? Look at me -
N: Jimmy looks over his shoulder as if Richie just called to him from it, which he didn't. There's no one in sight -
C: RICHIE V/O
D: Any time I want to change my mind? I don't like the quality of your work? I can find a witness saw you shoot your girlfriend. It just took me a while. I even know what he'll look like. He'll look just like you.

N: Richie keeps Teddy's car in view ahead. Glances in his mirror at the cars following him. His detectives.
S: EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT - LATER - DAY
N: The detectives' cars parked behind a warehouse. Richie peers into binoculars at: Teddy's car parked by Frank's outside another warehouse loading dock. Frank gets out, discusses something with his brother, comes past Jimmy to some men in bloody white coats. He talks to them, returns to his car, takes a valise from the trunk. He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's direction. Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -
S: EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY
N: Like Bumpy used to do every Thanksgiving, Frank and his brothers, from the back of the truck, hand out hundreds of freshly-butchered turkeys to the poor.

S: A215 INT/EXT. TRUPO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME - DAY A215
N: A doorbell summons Trupo. He comes through his entry. Opens the front door. Finds no one there - except a large live turkey on the doorstep. He stares at it nonplussed, then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang ...
S: B215 INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY B215

N: Jimmy comes out, tries to take a chair not too far from Frank who's watching his nephew toss pop-up flies for the younger kids to catch.
C: FRANK
D: Stevie. Come over here. I heard you didn't show up.
E: the nephew comes over MORE CONT
C: FRANK
D: You're too busy to meet with Billy Martin? After I set it up?
E: CONT'D
N: Stevie shifts around, not wanting to make Frank mad ...
C: STEVIE
D: I don't want to play pro ball, I decided.
C: FRANK
D: What're you talking about? This is your dream since you were their age - Maybe I can set it up again.
E: the younger kids
N: Stevie just stands there, uncomfortable. Finally -
C: STEVIE
D: It's not what I want. I want to do what you do, Uncle Frank. I want to be you.
N: Frank stares at him unhappily. Teddy comes over but Frank barely notices.
C: TEDDY
D: We got a problem.
S: INT. TEDDY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Jimmy Racine behind the wheel. Frank and Teddy in back, speaking quietly.
C: TEDDY
D: He's been cutting it so much it's down to two, three percent pure.
C: FRANK
D: You tested it. You're sure.
N: Teddy nods. Frank notices Jimmy looking at them in the rear view mirror.
C: FRANK
D: The fuck you looking at?
S: EXT. JACKIE FOX'S CLUB - NEW YORK - DUSK
N: The car pulls up in front of a building in the clothing district. Jimmy stays while Teddy and Frank go inside.
S: INT. JACKIE FOX'S CLUB - DUSK
N: Jackie's club looks like a set from a blaxploitation film. Frank and Teddy, led by a bodyguard, come past some turkey carcasses and other remnants of Thanksgiving to where Jackie and a couple friends cavort with some naked girls.
C: JACKIE
D: Frank. Welcome.
C: FRANK
D: We need to talk.
C: JACKIE
D: Great. Girls, get out.
N: The girls gather their things and leave. Frank wipes at a modern leather chair with his handkerchief, throws it away, sits. Jackie lays out a couple lines, offers Frank a rolled up hundred dollar straw. Frank shakes his head, no thanks.
C: JACKIE
D: You talked to Charlie. You want to hear more about my Black Coalition. Let me explain it to you -
N: But first, let me suck up a line of coke -
C: FRANK
D: That's not why I'm here. Everybody's happy, Jackie. Charlie, Baz, the cops, the Italians, everybody. Everybody except you.
E: Jackie glances up from the powder. No?
C: JACKIE
D: I'm happy.
C: FRANK
D: Then I don't understand. Why do you have to take something that's perfectly good the way it is, and wreck it?
N: Jackie doesn't seem to understand.
C: FRANK
D: Brand names mean something, Jackie. Consumers rely on them to know what they're getting. They know the company isn't going to try to fool them with an inferior product. They buy a Ford, they know they're gonna get a Ford.
E: MORE CONT
C: FRANK
D: Not a fuckin Datsun. Blue Magic is a brand name; as much a brand name as Pepsi. I own it. I stand behind it. I guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of General Foods.
E: CONT'D his look says, right?
C: JACKIE
D: What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: What you're doing, as far as I'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement.
N: That. That's what this is about. Jackie nods, but -
C: JACKIE
D: With all due respect, Frank, if I buy something, I can do whatever I want with it.
C: FRANK
D: That's not true. That's where you're wrong.
C: JACKIE
D: If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn it.
C: FRANK
D: Jackie, you don't need to. You don't need to make more money than you can with Blue the way it is. No one does. At a certain point it's just greed.
C: JACKIE
D: What do you want, Frank? You want me to call it something else?
C: FRANK
D: I have to insist. You call it Blue Magic, that's misrepresentation.
C: JACKIE
D: Fine. I'll call it Red Magic, even though it doesn't sound as good.
C: FRANK
D: That's all I'm saying. Wrap it in red cellophane and -
E: CONT
C: JACKIE
D: Pink Magic. Black Magic -
C: FRANK
D: Whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it and call it Blue Dogshit if you want, just don't let me catch you doing this again.
N: Jackie regards Frank for a long moment ...
C: JACKIE
D: Catch me? Insist? Infringement? I don't like these words as much as please - thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie. These are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation.
N: Jackie waits to hear a kinder word but Frank doesn't offer one. Jackie nods, Fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.
S: INT. JACKIE'S CLUB - DUSK

D: You don't go over there any more.
N: Teddy doesn't like it, but nods. Suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights.
C: FRANK
D: It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do? Give us a ticket?
N: But Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over.
S: EXT. GARMENT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: As Trupo and his partner climb out of their car and approach Teddy's -
C: TEDDY
D: Frank? Some of it's in the trunk.
N: Frank regards him with utter disbelief. Teddy shies as if he expects to get hit. The SIU detectives arrive.
C: TRUPO
D: Hello, Frank.
C: FRANK
D: Detective. How's it going? You have a nice Thanksgiving?
C: TRUPO
D: I did not, as a matter of fact. Get out of the car.
N: The Lucases climb out.
C: FRANK
D: Where's the Shelby?
C: TRUPO
D: The Shelby's gone, Frank.
N: Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. Frank and Teddy exchange a glance as it opens. Silence. Then -
C: TRUPO
D: Want to come over here a minute, Frank?
N: Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light. Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then -
C: TRUPO
D: Now what are we gonna do about this?
C: FRANK
D: We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over.
C: TRUPO
D: I got a better idea.
N: Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank - (CONT)
C: TRUPO
D: Or would you rather I took it all and threw you and your brother in the fuckin river?
C: FRANK
D: I don't know, would you rather it's your fuckin house blows up next time?
N: They hold each others' stare for a long moment.
C: TRUPO
D: I loved that car.
C: FRANK
D: I know.
N: Trupo closes the trunk and walks away with his cut of the heroin, calling to his partner -
C: TRUPO
D: Let's go.
N: As the SIU cops walk to their car, the perspective shifts, through binoculars: Richie watching.
S: A224 INT. TEDDY'S CAR / STREET - LATER - NIGHT A224
N: From outside the driver's side, Teddy's head, inside the car, suddenly smashes against the window, cracking it. His groan is interrupted by Frank's muffled voice -

D: Don't you ever put me in a car with dope in it.
S: INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Richie comes in, opens the fridge and stares in, his mind elsewhere. A ringing phone pulls him out of it.
C: RICHIE
D: Yeah. Tony. How's it going?
S: INT/EXT. TONY ZACA'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Tony's wife and daughters can be seen in the suburban backyard. Here in the kitchen Tony and Richie watch kernels of popcorn bounce off the inside walls of the first Amana microwave oven. It's noisier than modern ones.
C: RICHIE
D: The fuck is a `micro' wave?
E: CONT
C: TONY
D: It's a scientific force like atomic energy. It rearranges the molecules.
C: RICHIE
D: Of what.
C: TONY
D: Of anything. Of popcorn. You don't want to put your head in there.
N: Tony rakes out the plain, `pre-microwaveable' popcorn, using his hand. Gives some to Richie. Half of it's burnt.
C: TONY
D: I can get you one of these. Just like this, brand new. I'll have it delivered.
C: RICHIE
D: No, thanks. I don't want one.
N: Tony hands Richie some snapshots: The Zaca family on the slopes of a resort, and in and outside a beautiful snow- dotted cabin.
C: RICHIE
D: This is nice, where's this?
C: TONY
D: Aspen. Just got back. Had a great time.
C: RICHIE
D: I'd like to ski Aspen some day.
C: TONY
D: Know who we met? Burt Reynolds. I'm not kidding. Lot of people from Hollywood go up there now, buying up everything.
C: RICHIE
D: This is your place?
C: TONY
D: Are you kidding? You know what it's worth? Ski-in-ski-out, five bedrooms, sauna, everything. We were guests. No ... No, that's your place.
E: pause
N: Everything seems to stop. Richie becomes aware of the sounds around them, the girls splashing around outside ... (CONT)
C: TONY
D: Isn't there something we can do - about leaving the big guy alone? You know who I mean.
N: What Richie knows is that no matter what he does or says at this point he's got a problem.
C: RICHIE
D: If I don't report what you just said to me, you know I could be in a lot of trouble. If I do, then it's you.
C: TONY
D: I'm hoping you won't do that.
N: Richie considers the room itself, measuring the odds of microphones and a recorder being in it somewhere.
C: TONY
D: I'm not taping it. How do you know? Because we're friends and I'm telling you. This is a real offer.
C: RICHIE
D: From who, your uncle? Why would you do this? Why would you risk our friendship?
E: Tony doesn't say
C: TONY
D: Because I care what happens to you.
C: RICHIE
D: You shouldn't have done it.
C: TONY
D: I had to. I had no choice. Neither do you. Leave Frank Lucas alone.
C: RICHIE
D: He's not important enough for you to do this.
C: TONY
D: Yes, he is.
N: Richie stares at Tony, then puts the pictures in his hand.
C: RICHIE
D: Tell Marie I'm sorry I had to leave. You can tell her why.

N: Alone in the empty building, he stares at the T.O.: The higher echelon Italians like Tosca; lower echelon Harlem guys like Charlie Williams and Frank Lucas. He gets up then, untacks Frank's photograph from its lowly position and moves it to a place no black has ever occupied - to the top of the pyramid - above the mafia. 227 - 230 OMIT 227 - 230 OMIT

C: RICHIE
D: INS, FBI, IRS - I can't get anything out of them. Nothing on his travel, his bank accounts, property holdings - nothing.
C: TOBACK
D: That's because they all think you're on the take and you think they are.
C: RICHIE
D: They don't want this to stop. It employs too many people. Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards. The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs. Toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is that complete.
C: SPEARMAN
D: Richie. Excuse me.
N: Spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to talk to him.

D: No. I don't. Not when it's my life.
C: FBI AGENT
D: If you want, we can assign someone to you.
C: RICHIE
D: Who? FBI? You're going to protect me?
N: Richie almost laughs at the thought, looks to Toback. In fact, none of this is funny.
S: C231 EXT. STREET - NEWARK - NIGHT C231
N: Walking toward his apartment down its dark street, bag of groceries in arm, Richie becomes aware someone is following him. He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head.
C: MAN
D: Don't shoot! For God's sake.
N: Richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead.
C: RICHIE
D: Talk.

D: Are you Richard Roberts? I got a subpoena.
S: INT. COURTROOM - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie and Laurie sit with their respective lawyers, waiting for the judge to appear. He leans over -
C: RICHIE
D: Laurie. I'm sorry I couldn't give you the kind of life you wanted. I'm sorry it was never enough. But don't punish me for being honest. Don't take my son away.
N: She stares at him in disbelief. Then responds in a louder voice than his - (CONT)
C: LAURIE
D: What are you saying? That because you were "honest" and didn't take money like every other cop, I left you?
N: The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care.
C: LAURIE
D: You don't take money for one reason: to buy being dishonest about everything else. And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss. I'd rather you took it and been honest with me. Or don't take it, I don't care. But don't then go cheat on me. Don't cheat on your kid by never being around. Don't go out and get laid by your snitches and secretaries and strippers. I can tell just by looking, she's one of them.
E: more people look over
N: His lawyer. Which is true. Everyone's watching them now.
C: LAURIE
D: You think you're going to heaven because your "honest." You're not. You're going to the same hell as the crooked cops you can't stand.
C: BAILIFF
D: All rise - INT. COURTROOM - LATER - DAY
N: The same judge who sends a collection plate around sits before Richie and Laurie and their attorneys.
C: SHEILA
D: Your honor, a lot has been said here today about how unsavory Mr. Roberts' environment is for a child. How dangerous it is. I'm sorry, but this is our world. This is where we live and we tell him, Protect us. We give him that responsibility, and then say, Oh, but we don't trust you to raise a child. We don't think you're fit for that.
C: RICHIE
D: I'm not.
N: (CONT) Silence. Sheila looks at him, but he's looking at Laurie, and speaks to her like they're alone in the room:
C: RICHIE
D: You're right. This is no place for him. Around me. Take him. The further away the better. For him.

C: ANA
D: We can still go out.
C: FRANK
D: Where? With who? Everyone I know is under surveillance. I can't even be with my family at Christmas anymore.
N: He gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at Christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover cops, at Trupo's car, still parked outside.
C: ANA
D: Why don't you just pay who you have to pay?
C: FRANK
D: I do pay them, I pay them all. Cops, accountants, lawyers, who don't I pay? Everybody. I pay them a fortune, it doesn't matter. It doesn't satisfy them. The more you pay, the more they expect.

N: Richie gives nothing away even as it stuns him that Trupo would speak to him this blatantly.

C: TOSCA
D: You want to know who it was? I can tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival. Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself. Or someone you forgot to pay off. Or slighted without realizing it. Or someone you put out of business by being too successful. Success has a lot of enemies. Your success is who took a shot at you. How you gonna kill it?

D: Opium plants are hearty enough to outlive any war. They'll still be here long after the troops are gone. But what are you going to do for transportation when the last US plane goes home?
C: FRANK
D: I'll figure something out. You'll see me again. The General seems fond of Frank, and not only because of all the money on the table.
C: GENERAL
D: It's not in my best interest to say this, Frank ... but quitting while you're ahead is not the same as quitting.
C: FRANK
D: That's what my wife thinks.
C: GENERAL
D: But you don't think she's right.
N: Frank doesn't say.
S: EXT. OPIUM FARM - DAY
N: Mules are loaded up with burlap bags containing 3,000 kilos of heroin.
S: A270 EXT. OPIUM FARM / JUNGLE - DAY A270
N: The mule train approaches the jungle that surrounds the opium farm. Nate's Thai thugs, left behind in sniper positions in the trees, stand ready to open fire if they have to as Frank, Nate, the soldiers and mules pass below.
S: B270 EXT. JUNGLE - LATER - DAY B270
N: They seem to have made it, winding back down through the jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire. Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down.
C: FRANK
D: Give them half!
N: Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the noise.
C: FRANK
D: Cut half of them loose! The mules!
N: Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais and Americans lying dead on the ground.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Teddy makes out with a girl in the back seat of his car. The pay phone just outside on the corner rings, and he gets out, steps past Jimmy, answers it -
S: INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - BANGKOK - INTERCUT - DAY
N: A Thai singer attempts Otis Redding on the little stage. Frank, at a table here, with a drink and a phone.

C: TEDDY
D: Short Term Lot 3. This the Mustang were talking about ... Camero? ... What's the plate number? Yeah, I got it ... I got it, Frank ... KA 760.
E: writes on a napkin sighs; reads from the napkin:

N: Jimmy's come over to share his news with the detectives. But Richie isn't pleased with it - or with Jimmy.

C: JIMMY
D: I'm just telling you what I heard -

N: Jimmy shies back a step in case Abruzzo takes a swing.

C: JONES
D: And this isn't a Jersey plate. Or New York. Not with just two letters. It's three and three, not two and three -

N: The plane, with that tail number, descends through clouds.

N: Quiet sounds of suburban domesticity - chirping birds, a distant lawn mower -

N: The kitchen. Frank's mother shows Ana some old photographs of Frank as a boy as they sip coffee. There's a tap on the glass French door. The women look up and see Trupo just outside it, and other police moving past. He waves. 279 OMIT 279 OMIT

C: RICHIE
D: Captain, I'm Richard Roberts, Director of the Essex County Narcotics Bureau.
S: INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED
N: Front door. Trupo sort of waves a search warrant at Julie as invites himself in. The NY cops follow, fan out. Trupo and his detectives head upstairs -
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - LATER
N: The plane has been brought into a hangar where it's being taken apart like a car stripped by thieves. Inside the cabin, seats are removed and inspected, carpeting pulled up, panels unscrewed, lavatories dismantled.
S: INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED
N: Downstairs - Ana and Frank's mother, guarded, can hear Trupo and his detectives, upstairs, ransacking a bedroom. Upstairs - the SIU detectives pull open drawers, throw clothes from the closets. Trupo picks up an invitation to a United Nations ball, tosses it down again. Finds a safety- deposit box key in a sock drawer, puts it in his pocket.
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - CONTINUED
N: The engines and landing gear are disassembled, the tires opened up and searched. A nozzle plunges into a toilet and pumps out the contents into barrels detectives fish through with gloved hands -
S: INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - LATER - DAY
N: Ana is taken upstairs, brought before the SIU detectives who wait for the NYPD cops to leave the room. The place has been torn apart.
C: TRUPO
D: Your husband's illustrious career is over. The Feds are going to come in and take it all. Everything. But not before I get my gratuity. Where's the money?
C: ANA
D: There was some on that dresser, but it's gone now so I guess you -
E: took it
C: TRUPO
D: The money! The getaway money Frank and every other gangster keeps in his house!
E: CONT
C: ANA
D: If you leave now, there's a chance Frank might not kill you -
N: Trupo slaps her hard across the face -
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - LATER
N: Richie, off by himself, watches with a growing sense of panic as the mechanics, detectives and customs agents begin removing the metal skin from the plane. Coffins are being off-loaded.
S: INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - LATER
N: Downstairs, Mama Lucas puts washcloth on Ana's swollen cheek. They can hear the search continuing upstairs: things being ripped from the walls, the walls themselves splintered apart with sledgehammers, glass breaking. To Mama Lucas -
C: ANA
D: I'm sorry.
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - LATER
N: They've looked everywhere and found nothing. The plane, in fact, hardly resembles a plane anymore - no panel left that hasn't been removed, no cavity not probed - except - Richie's glance settles on the military caskets as they're loaded onto a truck, armed soldiers standing guard -
S: INT/EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY
N: Frank's bedroom has been destroyed. Trupo, standing at a window glances out at the sound of a barking of a dog to see Frank's German shepherd down in its kennel.
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - CONTINUED
N: Richie gets up slowly and approaches the coffins as -

N: Richie stands over the nearest coffin -
C: RICHIE
D: Open it.
N: (CONT) The army captain regards the detective for a long moment.
C: RICHIE
D: The warrant permits me to search the plane and its cargo.
N: The captain doesn't comply. Richie moves to open the coffin himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately comes into firing position, aimed at him.
C: ARMY CAPTAIN
D: But you don't have my permission.
N: Richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're waiting for is their commander's order to fire.
C: RICHIE
D: I don't need it.
S: EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED
N: Trupo regards the shepherd snarling at him from behind the kennel fence. Comes around back. Pushes at the frame. It moves a little, like it's levered -
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - CONTINUED
N: With the rifles still pointed at him, Richie kneels down, pulls the latches of the coffins, half expecting to hear an accompanying barrage of gunfire. He lifts the lid. Sees a long black body bag inside -
S: EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED
N: Trupo comes around to the front of the kennel again with his gun out and aims it at the dog. As he fires -
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGAR - CONTINUED

N: The dead dog slides against the fencing as Trupo overturns the kennel to reveal Frank's stash of cash.
S: INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY
N: Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then:
C: US ATTORNEY
D: That was a military transport plane. If there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved. Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.
N: Richie's in serious trouble and knows it. As does Toback.
C: US ATTORNEY
D: That's how these events are being interpreted by General Easton in that call to me. That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy.
C: RICHIE
D: There are drugs on that plane -
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Shut the fuck up.
N: Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors.
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane? That's what you've accomplished Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly.
C: RICHIE
D: I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.
C: US ATTORNEY
D: And that target is?
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: Frank Lucas.
N: No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly.
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Who? Who's Frank Lucas? Who's he work for? Which family?
E: no one seems to know
C: RICHIE
D: He's not Italian. He's black.
N: Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes?
C: RICHIE
D: I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States.
N: Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to his defense -
C: TOBACK
D: Richie has a lot of experience -
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Does he. And how many arrests has he made in his so-called investigation?
C: RICHIE
D: I was promised when I took this job, it was about real arrests.
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Does that mean `none?'
C: RICHIE
D: I have cases against most of Frank's organization. Not him -
N: (CONT)
C: US ATTORNEY
D: Frank's organization -
E: more to the others

N: Frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room. Nods to Doc to say, Get the car, I'll be out in a minute. Goes over to his mother.
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: Sit down.
N: He sits. She studies him in a way she hasn't since he was little. Eventually -
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: If you'd have been a preacher, your brothers would be preachers. If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. Do you know that? They all came here because of you. You called and they came running. They look up to you. They expect you to always know what's best. But even they know you don't shoot cops. Even I know that. Ana knows it. You seem to be the only one who doesn't.
E: he doesn't say pause
C: FRANK
D: Is that where I'm going?
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie to me. Don't lie to me. Don't do that, too.
N: She's not pleading, she's telling. Silence. Then - (CONT) C303 CONTINUED: C303
C: MRS. LUCAS
D: Do you really want to make things so bad for your family they'll leave you? Because they will. She will - I know I will.
E: points upstairs
N: Frank has some trouble looking at her. But then gets up. Walks toward the front door to leave. Hesitates near it a long moment. Then turns and walks upstairs. Trupo will live, at least for now, because of her.
S: D303 INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT D303
N: Down in the basement, the body bags are lifted from the wooden coffins. Set down on tables. The bags unzipped and the bodies removed. A rack of clean uniforms is brought in. The morticians begin dressing the corpses and applying make-up on the dry gray skin. New white military caskets are trundled in. Gold handles lifted. The bodies, clothed and painted now, are deposited on the silk linings. The lids of the coffins come down and cellophane bags containing folded flags are taped on top. 303 - 309 OMIT 303 - 309 OMIT

S: INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
N: Two black privates on janitorial duty come into the room where the original plain wooden coffins have been discarded. They remove the lids, then the finely-crafted false bottoms, revealing in 4-inch cavities of each, tightly-packed bricks of Double UO Globe heroin. As they take them out, a gospel choir begins and continues over:
S: EXT. ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING
N: A laundry truck idles. Stevie, the Lucas nephew who could have played for Yankees, jumps down, helps the two privates toss several laundry bags into the back of the truck.
S: A313 EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING A313
N: A minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which includes Frank, his mother, and Ana -
S: EXT. PERIMETER OF THE ARMY BASE - MORNING
N: The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base, drives past a stand of trees. As it passes, Richie, parked by his detectives' cars, recognizes the young driver - who's wearing the same Yankee baseball cap in his T.O. photo. As Richie and his detectives climb into their cars, two Lucas cars fold in behind the laundry truck. The detectives follow at a distance - A314 OMIT A314 OMIT
S: INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING

S: A315 EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - MORNING A315
N: Frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and Ana and put them in a car with a driver. He climbs into Doc's alone. His mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends to go kill Trupo after all. As Doc's car leaves, so does another. 315 - 318 OMIT 315 - 318 OMIT

N: Red Top's van makes a turn. As Abruzzo's makes the same turn behind it, the infamous Stephen Crane Projects rise up in his windshield. His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he sees Jones's car slow. Teddy's car approaches from another direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the foreboding towers. The gospel music ends.
S: A323 EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING A323

C: RICHIE
D: It'll be here.
S: INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: A paper-cutter blade slices a sheet of blue cellophane. The girls at the tables, with the expertise of Cuban cigar makers, wrap pieces of the cellophane like tobacco leaves around precisely-measured 1/4-ounce drifts of Black Magic.
S: A330 EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING A330
N: Frank's car winds up the road of the cemetery. The surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks.
S: EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: Several black and white and undercover cars approach, sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars and hands Richie the search warrant.
S: EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING
N: The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench. The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers.
S: INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY
N: Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut. Debris-strewn, graffiti-covered.
S: A333 EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUED - DAY A333
N: Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance.
S: INT. STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY
N: Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go. Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the
T: sound fades.
S: INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
N: Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door. They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks up to the guys with the guns.

D: Get the fuck out of here.
N: (CONT)

D: What the fuck is that? I got business with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him.
N: As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets. Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -
S: INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - CONTINUOUS
N: The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy, panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back - crawling across the floor like an infantrymen - Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door -
S: INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
N: As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls echoing in the stairwell. He starts down, taking the stairs five at a time, chases Teddy down two flights - Teddy yanks open a door, runs down a corridor, bangs into an apartment. Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is goes out onto an exterior balcony - Richie continues along the interior corridor, running parallel to Teddy on the balcony, who trips over some debris and garbage, looking over his shoulder for Richie - Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off, but the door to the balcony is nailed shut. So are the windows. Richie looks around, grabs a small portable television and, just as Teddy runs past, hurls it through a window at him, hitting him in the head. He falls hard, dazed. Richie hurries through the broken window. Teddy comes to and fights back, until Richie breaks his femur with his bare hands. Teddy howls in excruciating pain -

Glances to a lone figure walking toward him over a rise. Richie. Richie arrives at the grave. Regards the monument to Ellsworth Johnson, and Frank sitting calmly regarding him. Richie glances around the peaceful surroundings ...

S: A342 INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - DAY A342
N: Richie cuts the tags off a new, inexpensive suit. Slips the jacket on, which seemed somehow to fit a little better at the store. Cuts the tags off a tie.
S: B342 INT. COURTHOUSE MENS ROOM - DAY B342
N: Someone throwing up in a stall. The toilet flushes, the door opens and Richie steps up to a sink, regards his face in the mirror. Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under any kind - his skin is a shade of death. He splashes water on it and tries to gather himself.
S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: At the prosecutors table, Richie steals glances at the battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table. (CONT) The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas, in a tailored suit, escorted in without cuffs by an amiable- looking federal marshal. As Frank moves through the gallery, Richie sees it's full of the gangster's friends, many of them celebrities, who smile and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived. Richie has evidence tables covered with cash, weapons, stocks, bonds, property deeds, pictures of Frank's holdings, heroin in blue cellophane. Frank has celebrities, community leaders, Joe Louis himself who will testify to Frank's benevolent character. The Champ hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and Richie wonders if he should just give up now. Richie sees it in slow motion: the hands reaching out to Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old mother giving him a hug. He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table. Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask, Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can you see how insignificant you are? Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team.

C: FRANK
D: Here he is, let me talk to him alone.
E: CONT
N: The attorneys get up and leave. Richie takes their place. Frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile from the courtroom. Richie offers nothing.
C: FRANK
D: I just heard something. I said it couldn't be true. You didn't really turn in a million dollars you found in the trunk of a car, did you?
N: Richie doesn't say. Frank searches his face for some clue to where on earth he's from.
C: FRANK
D: Want me to tell you what happened to it? It ended up in cops' pockets.
C: RICHIE
D: Maybe.
C: FRANK
D: Maybe? No. It did. All you did was give it to them for nothing in return. Not nothing: You got their contempt.
N: Frank studies him.
C: FRANK
D: Why'd you do that? What're you trying to prove, you're better than them? You're not better than them. You are them.

D: You did it because it was right. That's all. Why's that hard to say? The question is would you do it again? That was a long time ago. It'd be very easy to find out. Tell me you want to find out, tell me the address, and a car will be there, the trunk loaded.
N: Richie knows Frank isn't kidding ...
C: RICHIE
D: No, thanks.
N: Frank suddenly explodes - (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: Who the fuck are you to say no to that? You think that impresses me?
N: Guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the outburst is through. Richie remains serene. Eventually -
C: FRANK
D: Let me ask you something. You think by putting me in jail, you're going to stop even one junkie from dying? Because you won't. If it isn't me, it'll be someone else. With me or without me, nothing's going to change.
C: RICHIE
D: Then that's the way it is.
C: FRANK
D: You have any sort of case? Or just that idiot drives for my brother. Is he your case? Because if it's just him and the powder, it's not enough.
C: RICHIE
D: Then you got nothing to worry about.
N: But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him.
C: FRANK
D: My brothers won't talk to you. My cousins. None of my family. No one but that mother fucking driver.
C: RICHIE
D: I got more than that. I got a line of people wanting to testify that stretches out the door and around the block.
C: FRANK
D: Bullshit.
C: RICHIE
D: Is it? Tony the Bug. Benny Two-Socks. Carmine Camanetti.
C: FRANK
D: Who the fuck are they? I don't know them and they don't know me.
N: (CONT)
C: RICHIE
D: They sell dope for the Mazzano crime family. Which you all but put out of business.
C: FRANK
D: This is who you're going to put on the stand? Guys who don't know me? Who got nothing to do with me?
C: RICHIE
D: They have everything to do with you. And the only thing they hate more than you is what you represent.
C: FRANK
D: I don't represent nothing.
C: RICHIE
D: You don't? Black businessman like you? Of course you do. But once you're gone, things can return to normal.
C: FRANK
D: Look at me. You looking? Can you tell by looking it would mean nothing to me if tomorrow you turned up dead?
C: RICHIE
D: Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.
N: Frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life. He wants to work something out with Richie obviously, but he can't figure out how. Frank studies him.
C: FRANK
D: What can we do?
C: RICHIE
D: You know what you have to do.
N: Frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can do it.
C: FRANK
D: I could give you cops, but that's not who you want, is it. You want organized crime names.
C: RICHIE
D: I'll take them, too. I want them all.
N: (CONT) Frank isn't sure he heard right.
C: FRANK
D: You'll take them, too? You'd go after cops? Are you serious? You'd do that? Lock up your own kind?
C: RICHIE
D: They're not. Not the ones in business with you. They're not my kind any more than the Italians are yours.
N: They regard one another in silence. Richie can tell Frank sees daylight.
C: FRANK
D: What can you promise me?
C: RICHIE
D: I can promise you if you lie to me about one name, you'll never get out of prison. Lie about one dollar in one offshore account, you'll never get out. You can live rich in jail the rest of your life, or poor outside it, that's what I can promise.
N: Frank is silent for several moments. Finally -
C: FRANK
D: You know, I don't care if the feds take all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore accounts. They can take it all, I don't care - use it to build battleships, paint bridges, whatever the fuck they want. Fight another war. But those other motherfuckers - the cops - put my money in their pockets. Millions.
C: RICHIE
D: I believe it.
N: Frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...
C: RICHIE
D: I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years. Everyone you sold to. Every cop you ever paid off. Every one who ever stole from you. Every one you remember.
N: (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: Oh, I remember them all. That's not the problem.
C: RICHIE
D: What is?
C: FRANK
D: The jail's aren't big enough.
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL / STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY
N: Surveillance photographs of cops seen earlier taking envelopes of money on 116th Street and other drops go up on a new, elaborate Table of Organization - of cops.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie dismantles the Lucas Table of Organization here, taking down the photographs. As it collapses -
S: INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - CONTINUED
N: Frank puts up photographs of detectives - 347 QUICK CUTS of the same detectives, in handcuffs, led through police stations past other cops watching with dread like maybe they're next - A surveillance photograph of the four Princes of the City striding down a sidewalk goes up on the cell wall - 348 FLASHCUT as three of the four SIU cops are led away in cuffs from a golf course - A surveillance photograph of Trupo in a black hand -
C: FRANK
D: You go up here. Your "special."
N: As Frank tapes the picture of Trupo at the top of the pyramid of corruption -
S: INT/EXT. TRUPO'S GARAGE - MORNING
N: Trupo, coffee in hand, comes into his garage from his kitchen. Opens the garage door and sees two squad cars parked outside ... A TV: A report on the indictments handed down by the Manhattan DA's office against 53 NYPD and SIU detectives -
S: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY (YEARS LATER)
N: Frank gathers his few personal belongings and puts them in a box. Stands with the box and waits for the cell door to open. The Table of Organization and files are gone. Legend: Frank Lucas was convicted of Conspiracy to Distribute Narcotics and sentenced to 70 years. He served 15 of them. Legend: Federal authorities confiscated over 250 million dollars from him in real estate, equities and cash in US and foreign banks.
S: INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAY
N: Richie, too, is packing, putting personal items into boxes. Legend: The day after he convicted Frank Lucas and 30 of his Country Boy relatives, Richard Roberts borrowed $400 from his credit union to help pay for a 3-day vacation to the Bahamas. Richie, carrying the box, switches off the lights and closes the door behind him on his way out. Legend: Six months later, he quit the Prosecutors Office to become a defense attorney. His first client was Frank Lucas.
S: EXT. PRISON - DAY (1990)
N: Frank steps out into sunlight, free but owning nothing but the cardboard box in his arms. Looks out across the parking lot to see if anyone has come to pick him up. Sees Richie by his car, hand raised above his head like a flag.
S: EXT. 116TH STREET, HARLEM - DAY
N: The two of them stand outside Richie's car on the same corner Frank shot Tango. Frank looks up at the street signs that used to say 116th Street and 8th Avenue. Now they say 116th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
C: FRANK
D: Frederick Douglass Boulevard? What was wrong with just plain 8th Avenue?
N: He considers the street itself. It too has changed. The corner groceries, as Bumpy prophesied, really are gone now. (CONT)
C: FRANK
D: I used to sit here with Ana in my old car. She hated it. Now I don't even have a car. Or her.
N: Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit stand any more.
C: FRANK
D: Just do what?
C: RICHIE
D: What?
C: FRANK
D: The fuck is that? Just do what?
N: It's a Nike store with huge paintings of Michael Jordan and the admonition "Just Do It."
C: RICHIE
D: Sneakers. Expensive ones.
C: FRANK
D: Who the fuck would buy those?
N: A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past. Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at the discount emporium.
C: RICHIE
D: Your brothers know you're out?
C: FRANK
D: I haven't talked to them in years. It's better that way. For them. I don't know where they are. Went back to Greensboro when they got out, I guess.
N: Richie nods. Frank looks back at the new storefronts.
C: FRANK
D: What am I going to do now, be a janitor? What do I know how to do? How am I going to live?
C: RICHIE
D: I told you I wouldn't let you starve.
C: FRANK
D: You told me but you can barely take care of yourself.
E: MORE CONT
C: FRANK
D: You know, one phone call, Richie, I could be back in business.
E: CONT'D glances to a pay phone on the corner
N: The look Richie gives him calmly assures Frank if he did that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.
C: FRANK
D: I won't. I'm just saying I could.
N: He buttons the cuffs of the fake Members Only windbreaker Richie bought him off the street.
C: FRANK
D: Thanks for the clothes.
C: RICHIE
D: You're welcome.
N: Frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy pants, bandanas tied around their heads.
C: FRANK
D: Uh-oh. Look out. Here come the gangsters.
N: Frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. The gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on Frank's face, thinks better of it. The others stop. GANGSTA 2 What. The first one is still staring at Frank, but finally has the good sense to let it go. GANGSTA 1 Nothing. They move on. Frank glances to Richie.
C: FRANK
D: Every idiot gets to be young once.
N: Frank zips up his Members Only jacket, props up the collar and points himself in the other direction.
C: FRANK
N: Let's get out of here.
