N: On a black screen, the words (without capital letters in front of the words) : columbia pictures presents and then : a film by barbet schroeder BATHROOM - INTERIOR We don't know if it's day or night. We see a little girl, aged around eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She moves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl are smiling. More credits, still without capital letters. The camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl. The two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks. The two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror. The first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl.
T: FADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN
N: The title of the film appears on the black screen. The camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of the screen :
S: BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
N: This building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it yet. Credits resume on the screen. The camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls. The camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building. As the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one male, one female. They are the voices of Allison «Allie» Jones and her fiancé Sam Rawson. SAM (voice over) So how many kids do we want ? ALLISON (voice over) I dunno. What's the statistical norm ? SAM (voice over) You and your statistics. Allison laughs SAM (voice over) One point two. ALLISON (voice over) Okay, then I want two point two.
T: Fade to :
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is holding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old. Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair. Behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last voice over sentence.
C: ALLISON
D: And I want them to look like you.
C: SAM
D: Poor kids.
N: End of credits.
C: SAM
D: So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring.
C: ALLISON
D: Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?
N: She moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor.
C: SAM
D: As opposed to a fake one ?
C: ALLISON
D: You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people.
C: SAM
D: That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a steam room in the wild. Horseback.
N: Allison goes back into Sam's arms.
C: ALLISON
D: Naked skydiving ?
C: SAM
D: Naked skydiving !
C: ALLISON
D: It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know. I've not been in New York long enough to know very many people.
C: SAM
D: Except me.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, you're invited.
N: They laugh.
C: ALLISON
D: And my friend Graham upstairs.
C: SAM
D: It won't be long before you know half the people in New York. People like you, you know... but I found you first.
C: ALLISON
D: You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
N: They start kissing very tenderly. Fade to two seconds of black screen. And then we see Sam and Allison asleep in the bed. They are naked but covered with the sheet. The phone rings. Allison wakes up and picks up the phone handset.
C: ALLISON
D: Hello ?... Hold on a second.
N: She bends down to take the telephone set.
C: ALLISON
D: Sam, it's your ex-wife. She gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the phone.
C: SAM
D: What ?
C: ALLISON
D: It's Lisa.
N: Sam puts the receiver to his ear. We hear vaguely Lisa's voice, but not precisely enough to understand the words.
C: SAM
D: Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now.
N: He puts the handset back on the telephone set, which Allison had put on the bed.
C: SAM
D: I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.
C: ALLISON
D: It's where you live. She's entitled.
N: The phone rings again. Allison moves up to pick up the phone.
C: SAM
D: Don't... don't answer it.
N: The phone keeps on ringing. Then the answering machine starts with «Hi, it's Allison Jones...» but the rest of the message is covered by Sam and Allison's conversation.
C: SAM
D: Why does she do this ?
C: ALLISON
D: Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that. We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison is walking naked in the hall. LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Hello, Sam. Oh, damn... Would you pick up the phone, please ? Hello ?... Please, don't do this to me. SAM (voice over) Lisa... LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Sam, I've been sitting here since you left this afternoon... Allison is standing up in the dark, not moving. We hear Sam's voice, partly from the bedroom, and partly from the answering machine, which gives the voice a sort of echo effect. SAM (voice over) Yeah... Lisa... Can we talk about this tomorrow ? LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE You can't come over here and sleep with me, and then... Close-up on Allison's face in the dark. She looks very shocked by what she hears. SAM (voice over and yelling) Allie, Allie, I don't know how you shut that thing off. LISA'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE You said you were going to call. Allison shuts the machine off.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close-up on Sam's face. He picks up the phone and puts the handset to his ear. We hear Lisa's voice saying : «Hello, Sam»
C: SAM
D: Huh-huh...
S: ALLISON'S APPARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison grabs a night-robe and presses it on her naked body. SAM (voice over) Okay ... goodbye.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Sam is seated on the bed. He puts the phone back on the set.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: ALLISON
D: I take it back. She's not entitled.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close-up on the ancient-looking ventilation system in the bedroom. The air vent is protected by a very decorative wrought iron grill, as can be found in old New-York buildings. SAM (voice over) I didn't go over there intending to sleep with her, Allie. I swear to God. ALLISON (voice over) Oh, well, I fell a lot better knowing you can talk now.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close-up on the same air vent in Graham's apartment. We can hear the conversation going on in Allison's bedroom, with a slight echo effect in the sound, which makes some words incomprehensible, but still well enough to get the general idea of the conversation. SAM (voice over from the air vent) She's very depressed, OK ? It's the anniversary of our divorce. She heard we were getting married. She has been drinking. Slowly the camera moves from the air vent to Graham's bed. Graham Knox is about thirty years old, and we shall learn later that he is gay. He is lying in his bed, perhaps naked, but we see only his chest, the rest of his body being covered by the sheets. He was apparently awaken by the voices in the ventilation system and is half-raised on his elbow and listening to the conversation. ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) I don't want to hear this ! SAM (voice over from the air vent) I feel bad for her. I'm moving on feeling guilty. It won't happen again. ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) (a few words incomprehensible) I am supposed to trust you now ? Graham is listening with a worried look on his face. Fade out to two second of black screen, during which we keep on hearing the conversation through the ventilation system, but without understanding the words. And then : ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -
S: INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison rings the bell of Graham's apartment. It says 1203 on the door.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: A corridor with a lot of books on shelves going all the way up to the ceiling. Graham walks along the corridor, zipping his pants. He is bare-chested.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's 4 a.m. !
N: ALLISON (voice over through the door) It's me, Graham. Graham opens the door. Allison is just wearing a night-robe, and her face is full of tears.
C: GRAHAM
D: Allie ?
C: ALLISON
D: I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be alone tonight... so I came up here.
N: ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -
S: INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham takes Allison by the hand and brings her inside his apartment.
C: ALLISON
D: Thanks.
N: Graham closes the door behind Allison.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: A nice room with pictures on the wall. Allison is sleeping in a large bed. Through the shutter-less window, we can see the other buildings. Graham, dressed in a black T-shirt and kaki short pants, enters the room and sits on the bed. He takes Allison's leg through the bedcover. Allison stands up with a start.
C: GRAHAM
D: Allie, I let you sleep.
C: ALLISON
D: What time is it ?
C: GRAHAM
D: About ten.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, my God
N: Allison jumps from the bed in a hurry.
C: ALLISON
D: I've got a meeting. It's really important.
N: Graham, still seated on the bed, watches her leave the room.
S: NEW YORK - A BUSY STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
N: Allison walks quite rapidly on the sidewalk. She comes to a shop and looks through the window. She combs her hair with her hand.
S: A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY
N: A nice restaurant in New-York. Paintings on the walls. Soft music. A waitress is talking on the phone. Allison enters the restaurant and crosses the room to a table, where a man, who was sitting alone, stands up when she comes to him. The man is Mitchell Myerson, Allison's appointment.
C: ALLISON
D: Hi !
C: MITCHELL
D: Hi !
C: ALLISON
D: I'm sorry, I'm a little late. They shake hands.
C: MITCHELL
D: No, no, it's worth the wait.
C: ALLISON
D: Thank you.
N: They sit down. The man takes his glass.
C: ALLISON
D: So...
N: A little later. They have finished their meal. Allison has put her laptop computer on the table and is typing on the keyboard. On the screen of the computer, we see models of woman's dresses changing color and appearance each time Allison presses a key.
C: ALLISON
D: You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has.
C: MITCHELL
D: Who do I get to run it ?
C: ALLISON
D: I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the quote.
C: MITCHELL
D: Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen.
C: ALLISON
D: Best for last.
N: She gives him a printed paper.
C: ALLISON
D: I think you'll find that's reasonable... as a ballpark.
C: MITCHELL
D: Here's where I was thinking of playing.
N: He takes a pen out of his pocket and start writing on the document Allison gave him. Then he hands back the document to her. She reads it and seems surprised.
C: MITCHELL
D: It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one.
C: ALLISON
D: No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so.
C: MITCHELL
D: Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you say you are.
N: He points to what he wrote on the document Allison is still holding.
C: MITCHELL
D: But that is the only way to prove it.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I could go for something...
N: The waiter puts the bill in a small tray on the table.
C: MITCHELL
D: No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about it...
N: Allison takes the bill from the tray, and tears the tab off the bill.
C: ALLISON
D: I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.
C: MITCHELL
D: I look forward to it.
N: They shake hands.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY
N: The front door opens and Allison gets in and closes the door. She drops her keys and her handbag on a shelf near the door. She goes to the answering machine, and presses a key.
C: THE ANSWERING MACHINE
D: No messages.
N: The machine beeps.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison starts tearing the sheets off the bed. Her movements are very nervous. And, eventually, she drops on the sheet-less mattress and starts crying.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - LAUNDRY ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: We hear the first words of Graham's sentence on the previous image of Allison crying on her bed. Allison and Graham are working on their respective laundry on a table. We see washing machines working in the background.
C: GRAHAM
D: What is this ? A song cue ? «You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You.»
C: ALLISON
D: It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying those books like «Cooking for One». It's just too depressing.
C: GRAHAM
D: There are worse things than being on your own, you know.
C: ALLISON
D: Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.
C: GRAHAM
D: Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a career... or a guy to interfere with it.
C: ALLISON
D: You'll find someone again.
C: GRAHAM
D: Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I don't.
C: ALLISON
D: I know that. I can do it on my own.
C: GRAHAM
D: Absolutely.
C: ALLISON
D: I'll just get a room-mate.
C: GRAHAM
D: You could always call him, Allie.
C: ALLISON
D: Not if I have a room-mate.
N: COMPUTER SCREEN An Apple Computer Screen (certainly Mac OS 7 or even Mac OS 6, since the film was made in 1991/1992). The window is titled «Comlink Fax TM». On the window itself we can read :
C: ATZ OK ENTER YOUR AD NOW
D: SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SHARE APARTMENT IN W70S NON-SMOKER PROFESSIONAL PREFERRED
N: When we first see the computer screen, only «SWF SEEKS FEMALE TO SH» is written. We hear the clicks of the computer keys as the rest of the ad is written. The computer screen fades into a newspaper clip after «PROFESSIONAL PREF» is written. NEWSPAPER CLIP We see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted with a felt-pen red rectangle. It says : SWF seeks female to share apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker professional preferred. 555-9814 Around this ad are other ads, all about apartment renting or sharing. ALLISON (voice over) The managers couldn't really know you want to live there.
S: ALLISON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
N: The previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded newspaper with a red felt-pen lying on the newspaper. The camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone. Around her, we see other desks with people working.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
N: A young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and white bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the kitchen. She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a table. Behind Allison, a nice white stove. The butch girl is carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand. In the credits, the butch girl is called «Mannish Applicant»
C: THE BUTCH GIRL
D: Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get in here. Are you proper with tools ? ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: A young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves around the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye. Allison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the departing applicant with an amused eye. Later in the same room. Another applicant is walking around the room. She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking. While she is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera flashlight across the room.
C: TALKATIVE APPLICANT
D: I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have the sense that I survived something. All my therapists think so.
N: She goes out the room in the hall. Allison is shaking her head behind her back.
C: TALKATIVE APPLICANT
D: Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning, anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault.
N: While the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing something on a pad she is holding in her left hand. Underneath the pad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight coming from.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: A nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch. A young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet... too perfect !
C: PERFECT APPLICANT
D: I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please give me a call.
N: Allison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera. Later. Close-up on the pile of application forms. On the top of the pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her picture stapled in the left top corner of the form. Allison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files. She has the file of the last woman in her hand. She stands up and walks to the kitchen.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last applicant, whose form is still in her hand. Then she sees Sam's picture on the fridge door. She puts the form on the top of the fridge. Close-up of Sam's picture. Allison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing again. SAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ? Allison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. She sits down on the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture. She crumples the picture into a small tight ball. We see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking in the hall. Allison is still crying. The woman knocks on the kitchen wall. Allison stands up with a start.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh !... Hi !
N: We get a full view of the unknown visitor. It's Hedra Carlson. She is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair. She is carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest. She looks very sweet and nice.
C: HEDRA
D: Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison Jones ?
C: ALLISON
D: Yes... I'm Allie.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning.
N: She looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been crying.
C: HEDRA
D: Are you sure you're okay ?
C: ALLISON
D: You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow ?
N: Hedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the kitchen.
C: HEDRA
D: Why don't you just... sit down.
C: ALLISON
D: No, I'm fine.
C: HEDRA
D: I'll make you some tea.
C: ALLISON
D: I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all. Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise.
C: ALLISON
D: It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...
N: She comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink.
C: ALLISON
D: I use a wrench.
N: She squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag on the floor. Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her wrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls. Hedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink. The girls are both all wet.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Close-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers near the open window. HEDRA (voice over) If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli. Hedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa. Hedra is wearing a red T-shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from Allison.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, yes...
N: Allison looks at the papers.
C: ALLISON
D: Hedra... that's unusual.
C: HEDRA
D: I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling you.
C: ALLISON
D: Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.
C: HEDRA
D: Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to now, right ?
N: While Allison is reading the documents Hedra gave her, Hedra feels the clothes hanging by the window.
C: HEDRA
D: They're dry. She picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket to Allison
C: HEDRA
D: Here.
C: ALLISON
D: Thanks.
N: Sam's crumpled picture falls on the floor from a fold in the jacket. Hedra picks it up
C: ALLISON
D: Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh !...
N: She sits down on the sofa next to Allison.
C: HEDRA
D: Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being bound again, and then have things change. It would just be awkward.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that my faucets will work. When can you move in ?
C: HEDRA
D: No, really ?
N: She looks very moved by what Allison just said. She takes Allison's hand.
C: ALLISON
D: Congratulations.
C: HEDRA
D: Thank you.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison and Hedra are walking along a corridor in the basement. Allison is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and beige pants. Hedra is wearing a red dress with white small dots. Allison is carrying two suitcases and Hedra a very large box. They all must be empty, the way the girls are carrying them.
C: ALLISON
D: I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...
C: HEDRA
D: A friend ?
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door...
C: HEDRA
D: Yeah.
C: ALLISON
D: No problem.
C: HEDRA
D: I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good for you.
N: They've come to a row of stocking rooms, all protected by partition and doors covered with chicken wire. They look like cages, and that's exactly what the tenants call them. The two girls drop their parcels on the floor. Allison takes a key out of her pocket to open the padlock of her own private «cage».
C: ALLISON
D: Anyway.
C: HEDRA
D: Wow !
N: Hedra crosses the corridor. On the opposite side from the row of «cages», a door that says : «Incinerator Room» and stuck on it, a sign that says «Use prohibited by law». By this door, a pile of junks, probably left by a tenant. Hedra picks up an old rusty metal lamp.
C: HEDRA
D: Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh.
N: A few moments later. Allison has resumed her tour of the basement, walking along the corridors. Hedra is carrying the metal lamp she found. They pass by the Laundry Room, where we've seen Allison earlier chatting with Graham. Inside, a lady is working with her laundry on a table.
C: ALLISON
D: Laundry room.
N: Another corridor.
C: ALLISON
D: I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay in the day, but, still, lock yourself in.
N: Hedra looks at a key she is holding.
C: HEDRA
D: This one ?
C: ALLISON
D: No, that's mail key.
N: They've come to the elevator. An old machinery, enclosed in a chicken wire cage, is working with a loud noise. Allison presses the switch of the elevator
C: HEDRA
D: This is creepy.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old.
N: The elevator door slides into the wall, and the two girls get in the cabin. Allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin, but it does not want to slide back into closed position.
C: ALLISON
D: Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver.
N: She takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin. With it, she works on the door lock, and succeeds in moving it. While she rolls the inner telescopic door shut, she discovers that another tenant has come into the cabin behind their back. He doesn't look very friendly, with his bow-tie and his small mustache. He is holding a newspaper.
C: ALLISON
D: Excuse me.
N: When the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides automatically into shut position.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY
N: The elevator is moving up.
C: THE TENANT
D: Which floor ?
C: ALLISON
D: Eleven
N: The tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door.
C: HEDRA
D: Fourteen, please.
N: The tenant presses another button. Hedra plays with her keys and smiles to Allison.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison and Hedra move a table out of the room. The table is covered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a desk. When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they upset everything that is on the table down on the floor. They scream and laugh.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working perfectly.
C: ALLISON
D: Okay.
N: Hedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath the sink. She stands up with an oval metal dish.
C: HEDRA
D: Look what I found.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Hedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in the kitchen. It shines so well that she can look at herself in it as if it was a mirror. Close up on the dish. Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face coming to join her.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY
N: Hedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check.
N: Sitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has found in the basement. An electric fan is working next to her. Hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie, it's Sam.
N: Allison shakes her head «No».
S: NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
N: Nice weather. Busy street, with shops and people. Allison and Hedra are walking, eating ice cream cones. Allison is very elegantly dressed. Hedra is more simply dressed and is still wearing her old black hat.
C: HEDRA
D: Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's just so New York.
C: ALLISON
D: I think you look very comfortable.
C: HEDRA
D: Yeah, I never know what looks good.
S: NEW YORK - A CLOTHES SHOP - INTERIOR DAY
N: Hedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red jacket.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh !... I think that looks nice
C: HEDRA
D: Yes ?
C: ALLISON
D: But I found this.
N: She gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out of our view.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh !
C: ALLISON
D: I think you'd look great with that.
C: HEDRA
D: Okay
N: Hedra takes the dress and looks at it.
S: NEW YORK - A SHOE SHOP - INTERIOR DAY
N: We see only Allison's feet and legs. She is sitting on a chair trying on some high-heel shoes. We see Hedra's feet coming toward her. She is also wearing high-heel shoes.
C: HEDRA
D: Hey ! What do you think ?
C: ALLISON
D: I think you should take them.
N: Allison takes off the shoes she was trying on.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh God, you like them ?
N: We now see both girls' faces. Hedra is taking off the shoes she was wearing.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I think they go great with that dress.
C: HEDRA
D: You take them
N: She gives her shoes to Allison.

N: A full view of Allison's building in the New-York night. Actually, it's not full night yet, because there is still some dark blue light in the sky.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: The room is all dark, lit only by the street light coming from the window. Allison walks into the room with a lampshade in her hand. She puts the lampshade on the lamp by the bed. Then she switches the lamp on. Apparently it is the lamp Hedra found in the basement, cleaned and painted. Allison looks at the books on the night-table. She then moves across the room, puts her handbag on the bed, and takes a medicine bottle from a small table. She puts it back and takes a perfume bottle. She takes the plug off and sniffs the bottle. With the plug, she puts a bit of perfume on her neck. She puts the plug back on the bottle and the bottle back on the table. She then takes a pair of earring from the table. She holds them on her ears and looks at the effect in a mirror. In the mirror, we see Hedra entering the room behind Allison. Allison turns quickly around. Hedra is wearing a light night-robe and her hair is wet
C: ALLISON
D: God! I didn't know you were home. I was...
N: Lying on the bed, there are a shoebox with a rubber band around it, a key on a keyring, and a piece of paper. Apparently, Allison has not noticed them. Quickly, Hedra throw the bath-towel, she is holding, on those items, for Allison not to notice them.
C: ALLISON
D: I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been here two weeks and I'm already in your room. I was just about to go through your drawers !

D: That smells nice on you.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try that.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh God, no. anything you want... you want.
N: She takes her night-robe off. Allison seems embarrassed to see her naked. She turns her eyes away from her.
C: HEDRA
D: Go ahead. Share and share alike.
C: ALLISON
D: Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child. Do you have... a big family ?
N: Hedra puts her nightdress on.
C: HEDRA
D: Hu-uh... There's just me.
N: She sits on her bed.
C: HEDRA
D: I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was stillborn.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, that's so sad.
C: HEDRA

C: HEDRA
D: Allie ! God !
N: She stands up to have a better look at the lampshade.
C: HEDRA
D: It's beautiful. Thank you. What do I owe you ?
N: She walks toward the little table.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like that.
N: Hedra picks up the earrings from the table, and gives them to Allison
C: ALLISON
D: Oh no no...
C: HEDRA
D: Shhh !...
N: She puts the earrings on Allison's ears.
C: HEDRA
D: They look beautiful on you.
C: ALLISON
D: But I can't take these.

N: Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by the bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub. The phone rings. Hedra rushes out of the bathroom. She is wearing a orange T-shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers.
C: ANSWERING MACHINE
D: Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank you.

While listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the telephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts the box back on the table SAM'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE Allie, are you there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen. Please, please call me back. This is torture for me. I know you need me as much as I need you. I love you. I'll do anything for you for us to get back together, just call me. A click, meaning the end of the call. Hedra presses a button on the answering machine, to erase Sam's message. We hear some yapping coming from the bathroom. Hedra turns her head toward the bathroom.

N: While rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it. She hears the front door opening and turns her head around. She says «Shhh !» to the puppy, and whispers some other incomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub. Close-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring. The paper is a bill from a shop called «Pet Express», in New-York. It was paid in cash, and the date is 8/16. It reads :

N: Allison enters the apartment. She is wearing a silver-colored raincoat.
C: ALLISON
D: Yoo-hoo !
N: She closes the front door. Through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub. She takes a towel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub. Allison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag on the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine. A beep and then :
C: ANSWERING MACHINE
D: No messages.
N: Behind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the puppy wrapped in the towel. Allison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her tracks. She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact.
C: HEDRA
D: I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back to-morrow.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I hope they meant it.
N: Hedra sits down on the floor.
C: HEDRA
D: Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I was little.

C: SAM
D: Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't one of them.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it.
C: SAM

T: Fade-out.
N: Later. Allison is asleep, lying on her side. She is still wearing her night-gown. Her hand is moving on the sheet, and apparently does not find what it was looking for, because Allison suddenly sits up on the bed. We see Sam sleeping and lying on his back, half-covered by the sheet. Allison looks at him and sighs. We hear some strange noises. Allison gets up and off the bed. We see her naked feet walking past the puppy's basket. Allison opens the door. The puppy leaves his basket and follows her.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison crosses the hall, followed by the puppy. She stops, bends down and picks it up. She walks slowly to Hedra's door, which is partly opened. We hear Hedra moaning. In the mirror on the closet door, we see Hedra lying on her stomach on her bed, half-covered by the sheet. She is masturbating. She turns around to lie on her back.

N: Allison jumps into her bed and lies down. We can hear the puppy yapping behind the door. Allison hears the door opening. She puts her head on the pillow, closes her eyes and pretends she is asleep. Hedra walks slowly across the room towards the bed. She is wearing her night gown. We see Allison's shoulder moving slowly up and down, just as she was really asleep. Hedra remains a few seconds looking at Allison, then starts walking back towards the door. Close-up shot on Allison's face. Her eyes are closed, but, when she hears the door closing, she opens them again.

S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
N: Sam and Hedra are eating breakfast seated on either side of the small kitchen table. The puppy is eating something off the floor. SAM (finishing the sentence he was saying in voice over while Allison was opening the door) Well, isn't this a thoroughly uninteresting conversation. He looks up at Allison entering the room
C: SAM
D: Hey !
C: HEDRA
D: Hi !
C: ALLISON
D: We going ?
N: She walks to the sink, and picks up an orange. Sam gives her a kiss on the cheek. She turns her head and doesn't respond to the kiss. Hedra comes toward them with a plate in her hand. She gives the plate to Allison.
C: HEDRA
D: Scrambled or fried ?
N: Allison doesn't take the plate and shows her the orange. She seems quite upset. ALLISON (whispering) This is fine. She gets out of the kitchen. Sam turns his head towards Hedra and then follows Allison. Hedra walks a couple of steps towards the open door and listen to the conversation going on in the living room SAM (voice over) Allie, sweetheart, this isn't all that urgent.

D: Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a car...
C: ALLISON

N: Sam gives her a very tender kiss, which she gives him back. Reverse angle shot on Hedra looking very angry. She goes back into the kitchen and puts her plate down. She then walks into the living room, looking very casual.
C: HEDRA
D: You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.
N: She gives a light tap on Sam's back when she walks behind him. She takes a food plate off Allison's desk, and starts walking away towards the kitchen with the plate.
C: ALLISON
D: You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough already.
C: HEDRA
D: Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.
N: She enters the kitchen to put the plate down. She then comes back into the living room.

C: ALLISON
D: Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think we'll be eating out.
C: HEDRA
D: Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck. We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face.

S: AN EMPTY APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY
N: A large room in a typical old New-York apartment. Large windows going almost to the ceiling. Through the windows we see roofs with water tanks on them. The room is empty, save for a ladder and a few tools. The real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand. Sam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the room.

S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison stops in front of the window. The window is open and the broken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in the morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap wide enough for a puppy dog to go through. ALLISON (screaming and crying) He's dead ! Buddy's dead ! Sam climbs on the balcony. Close up on the gap in the balustrade.
C: HEDRA
D: What ?
N: Hedra seems genuinely surprised. She still has the earphones of her Walkman around her neck. ALLISON (crying) You left the window open. How could you do that ?
C: HEDRA
D: But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it this morning.
N: Sam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade.
C: SAM
D: I thought I did.
C: HEDRA
D: It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault.
N: She starts crying. Allison rushes out the room.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie !
N: SAM (voice over) Allie ! Sam runs out of the room after Allison.

S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra is sitting on the floor in the dark, leaning on the wall. She is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her. Hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy, we understand she is putting the puppy's stuff away. Sam comes out of Allison's room and, walking in the hall in front of the kitchen open door, stops and looks at her.
C: SAM
D: Thanks, that pill helped.
C: HEDRA
D: Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ?
C: SAM
D: Well, she wants me to.
C: HEDRA
D: If I'd just let you finish your work this morning...

They almost kiss on the mouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her room, where she stays. He closes the door behind him, and she holds his hand on the doorknob. Then she moves her hand away and the door closes. We hear her sobbing behind the closed door.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and black panty hoses. The phone rings. Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still closed, feels around on the night table to find the phone. She eventually picks it up.

S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: She enters her bedroom, carrying the hangers. She throws one of them on the bed, and goes, with the two other ones, back into the dressing room. She picks up a hanger with a light brown jacket, and compares it with the one on the hanger she brought from the closet in the hall. They are exactly the same. Then she picks up a red dress, and compares it with the one she brought from the closet in the hall. They're both the same. She looks a bit worried by what she just discovered.
S: FONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY
N: Close-up on an Apple Computer screen, showing dress models. The file is called «Fontana Fashions». MITCHELL (voice over) You were terrific... We see Mitchell, very smartly dressed, with a white Roman-collar shirt and a black jacket. He is holding a glass of Champagne.

N: A large section of the main hall of Fontana Fashions Office has been transformed into a reception room. Dresses are hanging on racks. On a round table with a white tablecloth, many half-empty glasses of Champagne, two silver bucket with Champagne bottles in them, plates of «petit fours», and a lot of flowers.

C: ALLISON
D: All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff, but it does come in handy. Close-up on the computer screen. The «Fontana Fashions» file is on. We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on the model. It says «Are you sure you want to quit ?» and below two choices, «Cancel» or «OK». Allison chooses «OK». «Fontana Fashions» file disappears, replaced by another window that says «Search by vendor», and in the bottom of the window, «Enter Vendor Name:», with an empty box underneath.
N: MITCHELL (voice over) Huh-huh. Back to Allison typing. Mitchell's head is just behind hers.
C: ALLISON
D: Okay. Enter the vendor's name.

C: MITCHELL
D: Not till I give her the word.
N: Allison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.
C: MITCHELL
D: So far.
N: He walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table.
C: ALLISON
D: But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues.
N: Using a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out of its bucket.
C: MITCHELL
D: I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself.
N: He throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison with the bottle of Champagne. He puts the bottom of the bottle on Allison's bare shoulders. She shivers.
C: MITCHELL
D: Top her ?
C: ALLISON
D: What are you doing ?
N: He puts his other hand on her shoulder. Then he puts the bottle on the table, and starts massaging her shoulders.
C: MITCHELL
D: That's just that you're so tight.
C: ALLISON
D: Mitch, please, don't. That's enough.
N: He grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms.
C: ALLISON
D: Mitch...
C: MITCHELL
D: Hey, look...
N: He kisses her neck.
C: MITCHELL
D: I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good girl. We have nothing to prove any more.
N: He keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress to reach her breast. Allison seems to be on the verge of tears.
C: MITCHELL
D: This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady.
C: ALLISON
D: Let me turn around, okay ?
N: She has a strange smile on her lips.
C: MITCHELL
D: That's better. That's better.
N: He stands up.
C: MITCHELL
D: Just a second... A second...
N: While she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts unzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his white trunks. Allison, still seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of his crotch. He takes her head to guide it toward his private parts. Allison looks up at him and then, with both fists and all her might, she hits him very hard between his legs. He screams. She jumps from her seat and runs out of the room. He falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands.
C: MITCHELL
D: Fucking bitch !

N: Close-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass of wine. HEDRA (voice over) Here. Take this. We see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison. She then replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water.
C: ALLISON
D: I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating.
N: HEDRA (voice over) You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't care how nice they seem. You always fall for that.
C: ALLISON
D: But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary.
N: We see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece. She is wearing an orange T-shirt and a red skirt.
C: HEDRA
D: No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this.
N: She kneels on the floor in front of Allison.
C: ALLISON
D: He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to eventually.
N: Hedra laughs.
C: HEDRA
D: What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking about getting even.
C: ALLISON
D: You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square one.
C: HEDRA
D: Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?
C: ALLISON
D: What can I do ?
C: HEDRA
D: Oh, Allie...
N: She opens Allison's purse and takes her address-book.
C: HEDRA
D: Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died.
N: She walks to the telephone table in the hall, flipping the pages of the address-book.
C: HEDRA
D: Especially when it was his fault.
N: Since the bedroom door is wide open, we can see Hedra in the hall. She picks up the phone and starts dialing.

D: Who are you talking ? Hedra shushes Allison with her finger.
C: HEDRA
D: Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you.
N: She puts the phone down, and starts laughing.
C: HEDRA
D: Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now.
C: ALLISON
D: Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.

She looks up in the mirror at someone descending the stairs from the upper level of the shop. She makes the swivel chair turn around to have a better look at the staircase. Close-up on Hedra going down the stair. Her hairdo is so much like Allison's one that she almost looks like a twin sister of Allison. Back to Allison's thunderstruck face.

D: YOU FORGIVE ME, MAYBE I TOO. I NEVER WILL, IF WHAT I'VE
C: HAS RUINED EVERYTHING.
D: I'LL CALL YOU IN A FEW DAYS,IF I
C: DON'T HEAR FROM YOU. I LOVE YOU, ALLIE SAM
D: DAY YOU GAVE ME I'M
N: Allison reads the letter very attentively. Suddenly she hears some noise coming from the bathroom and turns her head towards the noise.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY
N: The bathroom door is opening slowly
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison puts the letter back in the envelope, the envelope back into the box. She then puts everything back into the box, closes the box and puts it back on the shelf.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison comes out of her bedroom, picks up her handbag and starts unlocking the safety chains and locks on the front door, while, through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra, wearing a long white shirt, taking care of her hair in front of the mirror.
C: HEDRA
D: Do you want me to fix you something before I go ?
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, no, thanks. I'm just going up and visit Graham.
C: HEDRA
D: Okay.
C: ALLISON
D: Okay.
C: HEDRA
D: I love myself like this.
C: ALLISON
D: Have fun.
N: Allison opens the door and goes out.
C: HEDRA
D: Yeah.
N: Allison closes the door behind her.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Close up on the mirror. We see Hedra still fixing her hair
C: HEDRA
D: I love myself like this.
N: ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -
S: INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison rings the doorbell of Graham's apartment. Getting no answer she knocks on the door. Getting no answer again, she walks away from the door.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison is going down the stairs. She opens a service door, and, hidden by this door, watches Hedra waiting for the elevator. Allison rushes back to the staircase. High-angle shot of the whole staircase, with Allison running down.
S: NEW YORK - THE STREET OUTSIDE ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
N: This is the street outside Allison's building, probably seen from the entrance of the building, or very near it. Hedra, coming from behind the camera, crosses the sidewalk, towards the street.
C: HEDRA
D: Taxi !
N: She raises her hand to stop a taxi cab. Allison, also coming from behind the camera, hides behind the corner of a wall to watch Hedra.
C: HEDRA
D: Hey !
N: A yellow cab stops and Hedra climbs in it. As soon as the cab is gone, Allison rushes from her hiding spot and runs to the street, with her hand raised.
C: ALLISON
D: Taxi !
S: YELLOW CAB - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: We are inside Allison's cab. In front of us, through the windshield, we see the back of Hedra's cab driving in the heavy traffic of New York. ALLISON (voice over) Don't lose her. Reverse angle shot on Allison seated in the back of the cab. Allison bends slightly to speak to the driver.
C: ALLISON
D: It's very important. She has something of mine.
S: NEW-YORK - A QUIET STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
N: Compared to Allison's neighborhood, this is a very quiet district. Almost no one in the streets. No shops. Hedra's cab has just stopped in front of a grim building with a fire escape. Hedra walks out just as Allison's cab stops at the corner of the street. Allison walks out of her cab. Both cabs drive away, and Allison starts following Hedra from a distance. Medium shot of Allison following Hedra. Hedra reaches her destination, another grim building, and goes down a stairway, starting from the street and going down to the basement of the building. A strong man with a ponytail and glasses is guarding the entrance. But he lets Allison go down the steps. Other people follow Allison.
S: BASEMENT NIGHT CLUB - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison goes down the last steps to the basement, which actually is a sort of night club. We hear some religious-sounding music with drum rhythms. The place is quite dark, but flashes of light enable us to see that all the customers are very smartly dressed, men wearing elegant suits and neckties, and women wearing elegant dresses. They seem to be watching some sort of a show. A young woman, wearing a black sleeveless dress and long black leather gloves, notices Allison and comes towards her.
C: THE WOMAN
D: Do you want to play ?
C: ALLISON
D: No, thanks.
N: Allison walks away, followed by the young woman. She passes near a cage, inside which we see a middle-aged man. The man gets his hand through the bars of the cage, and strokes Allison's cheek. Allison jumps, rubs her cheek and moves away from the cage. Behind Allison's back, we see the young woman, who was following her, coming to the cage and speaking to the man inside. From where she is, Allison can see what's going on at the bar, without actually be seen by the people seated on high stools along the bar. Reverse angle shot on the bar itself, and more precisely, on Hedra, seated on a stool, with a man, seated on another stool, stroking her cheek.
C: HEDRA
D: Come on, Jim.
N: The bartender, a bald bare-chested young man, turns toward Hedra.
C: THE BARTENDER
D: Allie !
N: Hearing her name, Allison starts and looks at the bartender THE BARTENDER (voice over) Hey, Allie ! Regular or diet ? Hedra turns towards the bartender.
C: HEDRA
D: Diet.
N: A flash of light enable us to have a better view of Hedra's companion, the man she called «Jim». He looks a bit like Sam.
C: JIM
D: Something's different.
N: Hedra smiles.
C: HEDRA
D: Yes.
C: JIM
D: Yes.
N: Allison is staring at the couple HEDRA (voice over) Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend. Jim laughs.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: We hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the previous sequence.
C: GRAHAM
D: Jesus, Allie, what is it ?
N: Graham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the apartment, but stays near the open front door.
C: ALLISON
D: God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me what to do.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra opens the front door and enters the apartment.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie ?
N: She closes the door and locks it.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm home.
N: She drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the hall. The camera moves into the living room.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Through the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the kitchen to go into the living room.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie ?
N: She seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very well. Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the kitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But, being a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl containing various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and breaks into pieces.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie ?
N: Hedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the debris.
C: HEDRA
D: God...
N: The bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as the one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam and Allison's conversation. Hedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear a faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where this faint voice comes from. First, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying, then it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham in his apartment. ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a shoebox in her room. Hedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and she moves closer to it. ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at birth. It was in an accident when she was nine. Hedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to have a better understanding of the words.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham and Allison are sitting on a couch. Graham has a glass in his hand, and Allison a cup.
C: ALLISON
D: And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. Graham gets up from the couch.
C: GRAHAM
D: Get rid of her.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the air vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and Graham. GRAHAM (voice over from the air vent) Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you have to get her out of the place. We hear steps. Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly stands up.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham is pouring something we don't see in a glass.
C: ALLISON
D: You're right. I'll tell her tonight.
N: Allison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand.
C: ALLISON
D: I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she obviously needs help.
C: GRAHAM
D: She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close-up on the front door. The door slowly opens and a hand covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door. We hear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison. ALLISON (voice over) It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the only one she has. Someone like her parent.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Back to Graham and Allison.
C: GRAHAM
D: Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the police, okay ?
N: Allison laughs.
C: ALLISON
D: That was very impressive.
C: GRAHAM
D: I can be butch when I have to. I got it from my mother. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: The room is very dark and only lit by the street lights through the window. A shadow moving in the dark. We hear the conversation coming from the living room. GRAHAM (voice over) Look, if you worry about her, I've got a friend who's a shrink. Maybe he can help her. The shadow moves away from the dark corner where she was hiding : it is Hedra, who starts walking cautiously in the room. ALLISON (voice over) Oh God ! Maybe after I talk to her, she just leaves. GRAHAM (voice over) Do you want to sleep here tonight ? ALLISON (voice over) Oh, don't tempt me. No, I just needed to talk it out.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison and Graham are both standing in the middle of the room.
C: ALLISON
D: Thanks.
N: She walks to a table to pick up her purse.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Sensing that Allison is going to leave, Hedra walks back into a dark corner to hide herself. ALLISON (voice over) She's not going to chase me out of my own place. GRAHAM (voice over) When's Sam coming back ?
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham is carrying his cat in his arms.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, tomorrow.
N: Allison picks up her purse and they start walking towards the front door.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: They walk along the corridor, Graham still with his cat in his arms.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's good.
C: ALLISON
D: Yeah.
C: GRAHAM
D: Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting our hair down... Those old air vents between our apartments carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing.
N: They've stopped walking.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh... What do you hear ?
N: He does not answer but he makes a face and then laughs, which is a good answer to Allison's question. She puts her head down in her hand, feeling a bit embarrassed.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry.
C: GRAHAM
D: Big deal. I am sorry. I should've mentioned it sooner.
C: ALLISON
D: I'm so sorry.
C: GRAHAM
D: You're sure you want to go down there ?
C: ALLISON
D: Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.
N: She starts walking again towards the front door. Graham follows her. Allison opens the door.
C: ALLISON
D: Thank you for the tea. I'll see you tomorrow.
C: GRAHAM
D: Okay.
N: Allison goes out and Graham closes the door behind her, and then locks it.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: High angle shot of the staircase. Allison is walking down the stairs.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: The apartment is all dark. The front door opens and Allison walks in, and closes the door behind her.
C: ALLISON
D: Hedy ? She puts her keys on the shelf by the door.
C: ALLISON
D: Hedy ?
N: She walks around the hall, looking in all the rooms.
C: ALLISON
D: Hedy ?
N: We hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head. Close up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly. At that very moment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's apartment. But actually, we are in :
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: The door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise. We hear Graham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room. GRAHAM (voice over) This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought. No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone. The camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living- room, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street lights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone.
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No, I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or paranoid, whatever. I don't know...
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close-up on the air-vent. We see Allison's hands sticking pieces of large adhesive tape on the air-vent. We hear the faint voice of Graham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the words. Larger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces of tape on the air-vent.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham is still talking on the phone.
C: GRAHAM
D: I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better than I can. Right, okay.
N: We hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head towards the noise. Quick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room door. It looks empty and quiet. Back to Graham on the phone.
C: GRAHAM
D: Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this.
N: He puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head again in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets up. He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle voice.
C: GRAHAM
D: Carmen...
N: He gets out of the room into the corridor.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat. He suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him. He turns his head. We see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front door. Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be mistaken for Allison.
C: GRAHAM
D: Allie !
N: She doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand.
C: HEDRA
D: Goodnight.
N: She has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that something is queer about the girl's attitude.
C: GRAHAM
D: Hedy ? She turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on the floor.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm sorry...
C: GRAHAM
D: Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We just want to get you some help.
N: Hedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar.
C: HEDRA
D: No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong.
N: Graham is walking slowly towards her.
C: GRAHAM
D: Okay, take it easy.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm sorry, I didn't do anything.
C: GRAHAM
D: No problem.
N: Hedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both hands. She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he doubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder. Graham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the head, leaving him unconscious on the floor.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and holding the telephone set with her other hand. We hear a beep.
C: ALLISON
D: Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen. I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I really, really would not get into this on the answering machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: The front door opens, and Hedra comes in. ALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone) I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front hall.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, thank you.
N: She puts the phone down.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall ALLISON (voice over) Hedy ? Hedra enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison is standing near the window, apparently not knowing exactly what to do next.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra is sitting naked under the shower. She is playing with a jewel ring and humming softly some musical tune. We hear several knocks on the door. Hedra doesn't react at all. ALLISON (voice over) Hedy ? Hedra answers without moving her head.
C: HEDRA
D: What ?
N: Apparently, Hedra has not spoken loud enough above the noise of the shower, because Allison knocks again on the door. ALLISON (voice over) Hedy, are you all right ?
C: HEDRA
D: I can't hear you.
N: She has spoken with a very soft voice, and apparently Allison hasn't heard her, because she opens the door, and walks slowly towards the shower
C: ALLISON
D: It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some tea ? Camomile.
N: Hedra turns slowly her head towards Allison and smiles.
C: HEDRA
D: Yeah... that'd be great.
N: She turns the shower off, and stands up. She picks up a towel. Allison turns her head, apparently feeling embarrassed to see her naked. Close up on the basin, full of water, and where Hedra's clothes are soaking. The water is red with what looks like blood. HEDRA (voice over) I'm not feeling really well. Hedra, wrapped in a large bath towel, has noticed that Allison has been looking at the blood in the basin.
C: HEDRA
D: Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.
N: She walks slowly across the bathroom. When she passes near the basin, she notices that a small part of her clothes are not inside the basin, and she moves it back inside.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Still wrapped into the bath towel, Hedra walks slowly out of the bathroom, followed by Allison.
C: ALLISON
D: Are you crampy ? Sometimes tea helps. Something warm. We could talk.
N: Hedra has reached her room's door, and she turns around.
C: HEDRA
D: About what ?
N: Hedra walks into her room followed by Allison.
C: ALLISON
D: About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves...
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra has not switched the light on in the room. The room is just lit by the street light coming through the window.
C: ALLISON
D: ...It's just crazy keeping two places like this.
N: Hedra sits on the bed. She is wearing a night shirt and a large sweater over the night shirt. (NOTE - This could be considered as a continuity goof. Apparently, Hedra has been able to change from the bath towel to the night shirt and sweater in less than a second !)
C: HEDRA
D: Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement so you could make sure you can trust him again.
C: ALLISON
D: Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but it is.
N: Hedra cracks her knuckles.
C: HEDRA
D: Huh-huh... It's me, isn't it ? I'll change, Allie. I can change.
C: ALLISON
D: No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate. It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us to start our lives together.
C: HEDRA
D: Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause... I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !
N: Suddenly, she has a very menacing face. Allison, still standing up, looks down at her with a very hard stare. Hedra, seeing that stare, calms down and laughs.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
N: The phone rings, but Allison, who is still looking down at Hedra with her very hard stare, doesn't move. Hedra turns her head in the direction of the phone.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie ?
N: Hedra now has a very sweet look on her face. She gets up and out of the room.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra picks up the phone from the little table in the hall.
C: HEDRA
D: Hello ?
N: Allison enters the room from Hedra's bedroom.
C: ALLISON
D: Is it Sam ?
N: We hear a male voice over the phone. We quickly understand it's Hedra's father. HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, is that you ? Talk to me, or your mother. Honey, we miss you. We want you to come home. HEDRA (with a deep menacing voice) Don't call here again. HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come. Hedra puts the telephone down. She doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than she actually is. She has a little nervous laugh.
C: HEDRA
D: Obscene phone call. New York !
N: The phone rings again. Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on the table. Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to
T: cut off the communication.
C: HEDRA
D: Find someone else, jerk !
N: Allison walks to the telephone table.
C: ALLISON
D: I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight.
C: HEDRA
D: Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's busy.
N: Hedra hugs Allison.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm sorry, Allie.
N: She moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual.
C: HEDRA
D: It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I just... I don't want you making a mistake.
C: ALLISON
D: I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in touch.
C: HEDRA
D: Sure.
N: Allison walks away to her room. Hedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without putting the receiver back on its hook. We hear several short beeps coming from the telephone. With one nervous movement, Hedra tears the cord off the wall socket. Then she walks slowly into her room.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: A little later. Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a notebook. She is humming a song. Her other hand is resting on the telephone set on the bed. The phone rings. Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring more than once. HEDRA (whispering) Hello ? SAM (voice over on the phone) Allie ?
C: HEDRA
D: No, it's Hedy.
S: HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Sam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie. He is talking on the telephone. HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Where are you ? Where are you ?
C: SAM
D: Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ?
N: HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Yeah...
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Hedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table.
C: HEDRA
D: It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ?
N: SAM (voice over on the phone) No, tell her to surprise me.
S: HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay.
C: SAM
D: Okay.
N: HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay, I'll tell her.
C: SAM
D: Goodnight, honey.
S: ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
C: HEDRA
D: Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well.
N: She slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it.
S: HOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels shoes. The heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman walking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel. No one else is in the streets at this time of the night. The woman is wearing a grey raincoat. The woman enters the hotel.
S: HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Sam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and apparently naked underneath. The door opens slowly. The woman in the grey raincoat enters the room. We have already guessed she is Hedra. She closes the door and puts the key on the night table. She remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam, then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off. She is completely naked under the raincoat. She slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam. Sam moans in his sleep. He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him on the chest. SAM (sleepy voice) Allie, Allie... what are you doing ? Hedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him. When she gets between his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she is performing oral sex on him. Sam moans with pleasure.
C: SAM
D: Oh... Oh... Jesus !... Oh... Gee...
N: Suddenly, Sam realizes that something may be wrong. He gives an anxious look at Hedra.
C: SAM
D: Allie ?
N: Hedra raises her head from Sam's private parts.
C: HEDRA
D: No, not Allie.
N: She resumes what she was doing. Sam would like to push her away, but he is so close to his climax that he can't do it. He has his orgasm, with Hedra not moving away from between his legs. She only raises her head when she is sure it is over. She gives him a light kiss on the pubis and smiles. Then she moves up in the bed, her head finally resting near Sam's one. Sam is breathing very hard. Hedra strokes him on the chest, and kisses his cheek. Then she gets up and off the bed, and puts her raincoat back on. She picks up a half-full glass on a table and drinks from it, what looks like beer. Then she eats something from a plate on the same table. Sam breathes normally again and moves slowly on the bed. He lies on his side, facing away from Hedra.
C: HEDRA
D: Hey !
N: With the glass still in her hand, she walks to the bed
C: HEDRA
D: Hey, sleepy guy.
N: She puts the glass on the night table, and kneels on the bed. She start stroking Sam's shoulder.
C: HEDRA
D: I knew it.
C: SAM
D: Knew what ?
C: HEDRA
D: I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be faithful. And now she'll know.
N: While talking, she keeps on stroking his face. Sam doesn't react to her caress.
C: SAM
D: She'll know what ?
N: He switches on the light on the night-table. He then turn around to face her.
C: SAM
D: That you came up here and pretended to be her ? My God, what is this hair ? What is this supposed to mean ? You're in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume! For Christ- sake !
N: He jumps out of the bed, and starts putting his clothes on. Hedra remains seated on the bed, drinking her glass.
C: HEDRA
D: You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care. Well, I think she should know that.
C: SAM
D: You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you ?
C: HEDRA
D: Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship.
N: She puts her glass on the night table, and gathers her shoes to put them back on her feet.
C: SAM
D: She can't... she can't stand you, for Christ-sake !
C: HEDRA
D: That's not true.
C: SAM
D: Oh, bullshit !
C: HEDRA
D: Huh-huh.
N: She shakes her head «no».
C: SAM
D: You're too needy. You're always cleaning. You're constantly in her face.
C: HEDRA
D: She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost raped her ?
C: SAM
D: What ?
C: HEDRA
D: Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or screwing someone.
C: SAM
D: She never said a word to me about that.
N: After his pants, Sam has put his shirt back on. Hedra gets up from the bed where she was still sitting.
C: HEDRA
D: That's right, she told me.
N: She sits back on the bed.
C: HEDRA
D: So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're best friends.
C: SAM
D: You're nuts, you know that ? Yes... I think you're out of your skull, that's right.
C: HEDRA
D: Yeah, well, sticks and stones...

C: HEDRA
D: Sam !
N: He pushes her away from him.
C: SAM
D: Don't touch me ! She sits back on the bed.
C: HEDRA
D: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something. And I won't say a word, okay ?
C: SAM
D: Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because I'm going to tell her myself.
N: He walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone. She throws one of her shoes towards him. The shoe hits the wall just above his head. HEDRA (yelling) No ! He rushes towards her, ready to hit her.
C: SAM
D: Fucking bitch !
N: But, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face with her other shoe. The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left eye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his brain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his back on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious. With her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek. HEDRA (softly) Hey !... Hey !

The same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam and Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone. He is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what he's saying. But, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on the receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice :

Allison moves her hand as far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair.

A data chart titled «Production line», and underneath «Fontana Fashions Production Line». Underneath, four columns of numbers labelled «Order», «Sam», «Scheduled» and «Completed». All the numbers in these columns are erasing themselves. And then appears the window with «LOST!» in red letters. MITCHELL (voice over) On mine, too ! Then another rectangular window appears on the screen. On the left of the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking out of it.

We see the bottom of the desk chair and Allison's legs, around which there is still some duct tape. Hedra is kneeling on the floor near the desk. She has a telephone cord in her hand. HEDRA (voice over) Should I just plug this in the phone jack ? ALLISON (voice over) Huh-huh. Hedra gets up and looks at what Allison is doing with the computer.

She gets out of the suitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage.

The outer door closes automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again He looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted. Then he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather unwelcoming face. The elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first. ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT -
S: INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Through the windows, we can see that night has come. Mitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her suitcase behind her. Hedra goes directly to Graham's apartment. Mitchell first goes in the opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra.
C: MITCHELL
D: Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at home ?
N: Hedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the keyhole. Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind her.

N: She bends down to pick up the suitcase.
C: MITCHELL
D: Oh, sorry.
N: Mitchell bends down to help her. He picks up the suitcase and looks at it.
C: MITCHELL
D: This is hers. You do know her.
N: We hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment. Hedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but Mitchell catches her and throws her aside. More muffled screams coming from the apartment. Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and closes the door shut behind him. Hedra rushes to the door, but too late.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Mitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down. Allison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape, looking like a human salami. She is gagged by another piece of tape. When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming through her gag. MITCHELL (voice over) What the fuck is going on here ? He kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth.
C: ALLISON
D: Be careful, she's crazy.
N: Hedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell.
C: HEDRA
D: Get off of her.
N: Mitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around.
C: MITCHELL
D: What ?
N: Hedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in front of her.
C: HEDRA
D: You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off her !
C: MITCHELL
D: Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay. He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders level. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the room. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight. She remains motionless on the floor.
N: Allison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position on the carpet, doesn't see everything. Mitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie Allison.
C: ALLISON
D: Where is she ?
C: MITCHELL
D: Don't worry about her, I took care of her.
N: Hedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the head with a statuette. He falls down on the floor. Hedra rushes to him and picks up the gun from his belt. She takes a cushion from the back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and presses the barrel of the gun on the cushion. Allison screams.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Graham is lying in the empty bathtub, with his cat sleeping on his right shoulder. There are a few traces of blood on the side of the bathtub. We hear the muffled sound of a gun shot. Then a scream from Allison and another gunshot. The camera moves closer to Graham's face. He has a large bloody bump on his forehead. There is a slight move of his head, then a slight blink of his eyelids.
S: GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Close up on Hedra's hands taking some pills out of a medicine bottle.
C: HEDRA
D: I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...
N: The camera moves up to Hedra's face.
C: HEDRA
D: I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there isn't one.
N: Hedra turns her head towards Allison sitting at the desk in front of the computer. The camera moves away to a larger shot, and we see that the gun is stuck in the hollow of Hedra's left elbow.
C: HEDRA
D: You don't want to say anything special to anyone ?
N: Allison shakes her head «no».
C: HEDRA

Back to Hedra pointing her gun to Allison. She takes Allison's hand and presses it on the screen of the computer.
C: HEDRA
D: Now they'll know it was you.
C: ALLISON
D: No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was never that scared. Well... not like that.
C: HEDRA
D: Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care.
N: She brings a glass of water to Allison, who takes it.
C: HEDRA
D: Did you know that identical twins are never really identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left me. Just like you.
N: She puts the barrel of the gun on Allison's temple, and she opens her left hand in front of Allison's face.
C: HEDRA
D: Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way.
C: ALLISON
D: Okay.
N: Close up on Hedra's hand full of blue pills. She pours them into Allison's left hand. Allison's other hand still holds the glass of water. Without warning, Allison suddenly smashes the glass on Hedra's face. Then the two girls start fighting for the gun. Allison slams Hedra's hand on a mirror hanging on the wall. The glass of the mirror breaks into small pieces, but Hedra doesn't drop the gun. The two girls keep on fighting on the floor, knocking various object around them. Close up of Allison's hand holding Hedra's hand with the gun, and smashing it through the window. The pane breaks into small pieces, and Hedra drops the gun on the balcony. Hedra moves away from Allison. Close up of Allison's hand picking up a piece of glass lying near the gun on the balcony. Allison slashes Hedra's chest with the broken piece of glass.

C: HEDRA
D: I'll kill you !

S: INTERIOR NIGHT
N: Allison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by the door. She screams. Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close the door shut.
C: ALLISON
D: Graham, stay inside !
N: GRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment) All right. Allison runs away towards the elevator. Hedra, still lying on the floor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots. Allison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder. Hedra shoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of the hall. Hedra gets up to run after Allison. Close up on the elevator. Allison is already inside the cabin and closes the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY
C: HEDRA
D: No... No... No...
N: Allison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the inner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard. Hedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor. Allison closes the inner door shut. Close up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor.
C: HEDRA
D: No... No... No...
N: Hedra watches the outer door closing slowly. Allison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger several times. But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge in the chamber of the gun. Hedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator. Allison tries to prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in getting into the cabin. She closes the inner door, and the outer door closes itself automatically. Hedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin. Then she bangs her head very hard against the wall. Allison pulls Hedra away from her. Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls on the floor. Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes her away from her. The two girls start fighting in the cabin. They fall on the floor, Hedra on top of Allison. Hedra tries to strangle Allison. Close up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's hands. Short reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to Allison's face. Close up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking gently with the movement of the elevator. Allison's hand tries to catch it and doesn't succeed. Back on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's strangulation. Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand trying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating face. Close up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the screwdriver, then back to her face. The face slowly relaxes as Allison falls into unconsciousness. Her arm, which was extended to catch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin. Hedra watches Allison's face intently. Then, when she realizes that Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the cheek. She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then she puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY
N: The outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical bars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back on the floor of the cabin. Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls Allison by the legs out of the elevator. HEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison) Huh... Huh... She pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement. She reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks it shut. She suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the floor. She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's face in it. She pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the wall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to prevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase. Then she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed. We supposed it is the emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the elevator.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Hedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts them inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning.

N: She runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to the elevator. She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then tries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't succeed. HEDRA (yelling) Allie ? She goes back along the corridor the way she came from. Near the place where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked «Storage», and opens it
C: HEDRA
D: Hey, here you are.
N: But this is just a closet full of various junk. Hedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around. She takes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking menacingly along the corridor.
C: HEDRA
D: Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come on... Allie !...
N: She bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall. Close up on a rat scuttling away from the noise. Close up on Allie hidden in a big metal box, near the ceiling of the basement. This metal box is obviously a part of the ventilation system. HEDRA (voice over) Come on ! The rat is running along a large horizontal pipe towards Allison, who seems frightened by it. High angle shot of Hedra seen from Allison's hiding place. HEDRA (screaming) Come out now ! Close up on Allison's face, frightened by the rat.

C: HEDRA
D: I'm scared ! Where are you ? The rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down from the pipe where it was standing.
N: The rat falls on Hedra's shoulder. She screams. Allison hides back into the ventilation metal box not to be seen by Hedra. Hedra throws the rat on the floor. The rat runs away. Hedra looks up at the place where the rat fell from. Close up at Allison's hiding place. The metal box seems empty. HEDRA (voice over) Allie...
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: Hedra comes back into the incinerator room. Just above the open door of the incinerator, there is a big ventilation metal box, similar to the one Allison is hiding in. Hedra bangs the box with her hook. She must think that Allison is crawling inside the ventilation system.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY
N: Allison is peeking from behind a corner of the corridor. Reverse angle shot showing what Allison sees. We - and she - see the incinerator room with Hedra banging her hook on the ventilation system.

N: Hedra is walking backward, away from the incinerator. She hears a strange noise and turns around.
S: ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY
N: We see the open door of a cage slightly moving with a squeaking noise. Hedra walks toward the cage.
C: HEDRA
D: Why are you hiding from me ?
N: Close up on a big wooden closet with two doors. A piece of green fabric is sticking out between the two closed doors. Hedra bangs her hook on the closet.
C: HEDRA
D: You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is sticking out of it. She opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the closet, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror and breaks it.
N: Hedra backs up one step from the closet. And suddenly, Allison, who was hiding in the pipework on the ceiling, falls down upside down, hanging from her legs hooked in the pipework. She stabs Hedra in the back with the elevator screwdriver. Hedra screams, and tries to take the screwdriver off her back. Allison drops on the floor. Hedra tries to hit her with the hook, but Allison grabs her arm. With her other free hand, Allison pulls the screwdriver out of Hedra's back, then immediately sticks it again in another place on Hedra's back.
C: HEDRA
D: Allie...
N: Hedra slowly falls on the floor, where she remains motionless. Allison looks down at her, trying to catch her breath back. She kneels down to close Hedra's eyelids. BLACK SCREEN ALLISON (voice over) I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.
S: ALLISON'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
N: This is Allison's new place. Actually it is the apartment Allison visited with Sam, just before the puppy's death. Some furniture from the old apartment, and a lot of unopened boxes on the floor. It looks like if Allison just moved in. Very large windows overlooking New-York. Allison is standing near one of the windows, with her back toward us. ALLISON (voice over) Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to start letting go. He's right. Close up on Hedra's collection of photographs, lying near the shoebox where she used to stock them. In the forefront, the black and white picture of Hedra and her twin sister holding a dog between them. ALLISON (voice over) Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain her that her sister's death wasn't her fault. We see Allison's hands taking the pictures one by one. ALLISON (voice over) But she never forgave herself for surviving. The last picture she takes is the black and white picture of the twins with the dog. She puts all the pictures back in the shoebox, with the twins and dog picture on the top. ALLISON (voice over) So every day, I try to forgive Hedy for Sam. Allison puts the lid back on the shoebox. ALLISON (voice over) Then I try to do what she couldn't... Forgive myself. The camera moves slowly away from the shoebox to a last photograph hidden underneath some wrapping plastic material. ALLISON (voice over) I know what can happen to someone who doesn't. Close up on the picture. It looks like the picture of the face of one woman. But actually, the picture is a mixture of two pictures. The left half-side of the picture shows Allison's face, when the right half-side shows Hedra's face. CREDITS The credit are rolling up on the picture of Hedra / Allison for about 25 seconds, then fade-out to black screen, where the end of the credits are rolling up.
