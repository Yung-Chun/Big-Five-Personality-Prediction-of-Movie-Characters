S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
N: A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower. SUPERIMPOSE: "1983" A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked at the curb -- then turns back toward the house.
C: SONNY
D: Daddy! I don't want you to go!
E: calls back to house
N: MASON STORM emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family man. Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway.
C: FELICIA
D: Your father has work to do, Sonny ... but he'll be home soon. And we'll all watch it together.
E: calls to Sonny

C: SONNY

C: STORM
D: Knock knock.
C: SONNY
D: Who's there?
C: STORM
D: Old lady.
C: SONNY
D: Old lady who?
C: STORM
D: I didn't know you could yodel.
N: Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly -- just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him and sets him down.
C: FELICIA
D: Take my advice: Don't give up your day job.
E: to Storm
N: TITLES BEGIN.
S: INT. STORM'S CAR - MOVING - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD NIGHT

E: V.O. by the way
N: TITLES END.
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL PIER - NIGHT
N: The limousine slowly moves up beside a stand-alone shack near the edge of the wharf. The shack is an open shelter with a broad overhang, and various kinds of equipment stored inside it. A single bulb illuminates it. The limo comes to rest, engine off, no apparent activity in or out of the vehicle. STORM'S CAR pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow.
S: INT. STORM'S CAR - NIGHT
N: He switches OFF the RADIO, twists a telephoto night lens onto a specially silenced 8mm surveillance film camera; he primes a portable sound deck in the case he's been carrying. A quick check of the .45 in his shoulder holster, then he exits the car. ON STORM Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using cover.
S: EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
N: Stacks of huge shipping crates and Sea-Land containers from a long wall along the cluttered dock. The towering hulks of several ships loom close by. Storm finds a slot between bulk containers: a good surveillance point.
C: STORM
D: Let's go, boys. I'm missing the Oscars.
N: He is less than forty yards away, looking lengthwise down the car from its rear. A beat, as Storm picks up the sound before we do. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 5. STORM'S POV - STATION WAGON A paneled, expensive model approaches. The wagon pulls up, a short distance from the limo. A man gets out from the wagon. A beat later, the driver exits the limo. Both are armed. They check out the area, in all directions. SHACK One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches up, SMASHES the single LIGHT BULB. The spot goes dark. WITH STORM Seeing the doors open on both cars. A mature man, CALABRESE, and his stocky confederate, VITALE, step from the limo. TWO other MEN -- one wearing a stylish hat, the other bareheaded -- step from the wagon. They cross to the shadowed, shack area.
C: STORM
D: I know you, Calabrese. But who are these mystery guests?
E: O.S. to himself, softly
N: The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the position of Calabrese and Vitale. STORM Starts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones. WHARF - CONSPIRATORS There is NOISE from various wharf MACHINERY on adjacent piers, but the high-tech listening equipment still brings in the sound with acceptable clarity.
C: CALABRESE
D: -- Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one.
C: SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
D: You'll be well compensated, Calabrese. Money now -- and a lot more when I get into that office. You can take that to the bank.
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 6. THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS Despite the shadows, it's plain the Man With The Hat is in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. Calabrese, by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.
C: CALABRESE
D: Slowly ... slowly. Always with caution.
C: SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
D: I'm up to here with caution! That fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa sprouts -- he ain't gonna die of natural causes.
C: CALABRESE
D: All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day.
C: SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
D: Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him, it better be in the obituaries.
N: ON STORM He squints over the camera, straining to see with the naked eve Frustration ANGLE - CALABRESE AND VITALE Glancing to each other. They're tough guys, but in some hard-to-define way, the two Shadow Men are tougher.
C: BAREHEADED SHADOW MAN
D: Enough bullshit. Can you do the job or not? If you can't -
C: VITALE
D: We'll do it.
N: STORM Knowing he's on to something super hot.
C: STORM
D: Who are you? Get out of those shadows --
E: to himself, soft but intense
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 7. It's driving him crazy that he can't make out the Shadow Men's faces. He peers around the wharf, looking for some better vantage point. SHACK - CONSPIRATORS keep talking. ANGLE - STORM Darting closer, using the row of bulk containers for cover. He takes up a new position, nearer the shack re-aims the camera. LOOKOUT #1 (MIKEY) hears something -- peers directly at the spot where Storm is hiding. STORM ducks quickly back out of sight. As he does this, his earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone off Storm's head. He cannot hear what the conspirators say next -- but the audience can. CONSPIRATORS
C: SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
D: The job is a light plane ... a Lear P61. We want it to take off -- we don't want it to land.
N: Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward the line of containers. SHADOW MAN WITH HAT steps forward into the light. His face comes clearly into view. Well dressed, magnetic, Bobby Kennedy-ish -- he is L.A. Assemblyman VERNON TRENT. TRENT (SHADOW MAN WITH HAT) (to Calabrese, with menace) You told us this dock was clean -- Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 8. STORM'S HIDING PLACE - MIKEY steps around one container (out of view of the other men) to the exact spot where Storm was. But Storm isn't there. Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere: Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to the ground. Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his fingers. Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the big guy's hand.
C: STORM
D: A quarter's a quarter.
E: re: the fairy
N: WHARF - SHACK Calabrese and Vitale are getting uneasy.
C: CALABRESE
D: Mikey! Quit playing with yourself back there. Mikey --
E: no response
N: Guns come out. Calabrese and Vitale start this way -- STORM bolts back up the wharf, toward his car. CALABRESE AND VITALE hurry up to their fallen comrade. They see Storm 50 yards back up the pier, fleeing. Vitale takes off after him at a dead run. At that instant: TRENT moves INTO FRAME beside Calabrese. The Bareheaded Shadow Man with him is Police Captain DAN HOLLAND (in civilian business suit) -- 21 years on the force, hard as nails. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 9. CONSPIRATORS' POV They see Vitale pull up, on foot, as Storm's CAR ROARS OFF into the darkness. Vitale seems close enough to pick out the license number. BACK TO TRENT As his face moves into the light. Merciless, implacable.
C: TRENT
D: Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don't want him to get an hour older.
E: to Calabrese
C: CALABRESE
D: He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.
N: CALABRESE'S LIMO speeds up beside the conspirators. Calabrese gets in, the limo whips off down the wharf to pick up Vitale and take off after Storm. TRENT AND HOLLAND stand watching -- grim, furious.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT
N: A burly plainclothesman, MAX DUNNE, waves his phone receiver at Karl, Storm's partner, who's still at the desk where we last saw him. A TV across the room tuned to the ACADEMY AWARDS.

C: KARL

S: EXT. MINI-MALL - NIGHT
N: A crummy mini-mall around Torrance. Storm exits the phone booth -- crosses toward a liquor store, which is still open this late at night.
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
N: Storm enters. A grimy, high-crime booze store. Not exactly the place to find Mumm's '36.
C: STORM
D: How ya doing? Got any champagne?

C: COUNTER MAN

N: Storm crosses to the cooler.
C: COUNTER MAN
D: Who needs the goddam movies? I get it all in here every night. Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.
E: indicates his view from behind counter
N: Storm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny. Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly: He notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror. Something approaching from outside.
C: STORM
D: You got a phone back there?
E: to Counter Man

C: COUNTER MAN
D: Why ?
C: STORM
D: Punch nine-one-one.
E: orders him
N: The Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass. Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries a long-barreled shotgun.
C: COUNTER MAN
D: Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off two weeks ago!
C: SHOTGUN PUNK
D: Shut up.
N: He gestures to the register.
C: COUNTER MAN
D: Take it, man. Take my life's savings.
N: He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks) shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls --
C: COUNTER MAN
D: Where is a cop when you goddam need one? I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch --
E: to Punks, threatening
N: Shotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and bloody onto the floor!
C: SHOTGUN PUNK
D: Now you got half a mind, old man.
N: Punk #2 scoops up the money. The three Punks saunter up and surround Storm. Storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face.
C: SHOTGUN PUNK
D: What are you grinning at, pindejo?
C: STORM
D: We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left.
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 13. The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL -- BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm. The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra. Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife. Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth. The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.
C: STORM
D: I know what you're thinking. I have this big shotgun and all you have is that little icepick. Mine's bigger than yours. It's not fair.
E: to Punk, calmly
N: Storm sets the gun down. Punk #3 is still frozen.
C: STORM
D: Still not fair?
N: Storm gets down on his knees.
C: STORM
D: Don't wait for the blindfold, maricon.
N: PUNK #3 (clutching the ice pick tightly) Chinga tu madre! The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning speed at Storm's face. Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming his forearm into the rear knee joint. The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 14. We see the leg held in Storm's arms begin to twist ... and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP. SIRENS are heard approaching outside.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
N: Black and whites pack the parking lot. Police ambulances make ready to haul off the three Punks. T he Counter Man, bandaged on a gurney, is wheeled out by paramedics. One medic catches Storm's eye -- flashes a gesture indicating the Counter Man will be okay. Storm finishes with two other DETECTIVES, obviously buddies, as they complete their on-site notes. The champagne bottle rests on the hood of their car. DETECTIVE #1 You were armed, Storm -- why didn't you just use your gun?
C: STORM
D: I just got these new glazer bullets. You know they're almost a buck a pop now?
N: He grabs the champagne, takes off for his car.
S: INT. STORM'S CAR - TRAVELING - NIGHT
N: Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good" PLAYS in the TAPE DECK. Storm listens for a few beats, as if letting the horn cool him out after the liquor store action. Then he ejects the tape decisively -- reaches into his camera case, pulls out the surveillance tape from tonight. He punches this tape into the deck. Storm listens. The part where the Shadow Man with the hat (Trent) says, "You'll be well compensated. Money now -- and more when I get into that office. You can take that to the bank." Storm CRANKS UP the VOLUME.

N: Still listening. Can't place the voice. Punches " eject," the tape pops half-out. Into the driveway, Storm activates the garage door remote.
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Storm's car stops, headlights go out. The garage door closes. Storm gets out, carrying his camera case, champagne and the big stuffed toy. He takes a couple of steps toward the door to the house, then stops, remembering - He leans back into the car, yanks the surveillance tape from the deck. Hands full, he tucks the tape into a inside pocket of his Versace vest.
S: INT. STORM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: It's late; just a courtesy lamp left on for Storm. He pulls the tapes and recorder from his case, stashes the case out of sight. He grabs a couple of champagne glasses --

N: tiptoes toward the bedroom. Felicia appears at the top of the stairs, wearing panties and a teddy top. She smiles seeing the big toy, shooshes Storm -- ANGLE FROM SONNY'S ROOM Storm stops outside his boy's room, looking in. Felicia tiptoes up beside him. Sonny sprawls loose-limbed on the bed in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas.

N: Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way, Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light. Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding her legs apart --
C: FELICIA
D: Door's open.
E: in mid-kiss
N: Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it -- without looking -- at the door. ANGLE FROM HALLWAY - BEDROOM DOOR The pillow strikes it, starting it swinging closed. Storm and Felicia's forms, on the bed, are eclipsed. Sound from the "CARSON SHOW" DROPS DOWN -

D: What?
E: frightened
N: Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in. Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door. There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know what has happened, then: STORM'S POV We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown open at the shoulder. SWITCH TO: ASSASSIN'S PARTNER'S POV We see Storm hit badly at close range. He takes it in the right center mass. It looks like his right arm is torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room. Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long -- as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST. The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's wrist and flip him violently. There is a LOUD CRACK and scream as he lands on his head and neck, and then -- from the side, point-blank --another ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST -- Storm is blown into the air and back onto the bed from which he came.

Under the glare of a mini-cam lamp, a female TV reporter tries to get Trent to talk.
C: TRENT
D: knew Storm from when I was City Attorney ... and he was a young homicide detective - We worked on... cases ... together I'm sorry ... sorry --
E: emotional choking back tears can't go on
N: Trent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away, in the direction of where O'Malley is. Holland goes the opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 23.
C: TV REPORTER
D: That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent, deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, .
E: V.O. etc.
N: Medics wheel Felicia's body past, one bloody forearm visible beneath the sheet.
C: TRENT
D: What makes people do this? Will you tell me? Will someone please tell me?!!
E: in tears, agony
N: O'Malley watches Trent pass, weeping, escorted out by police and aides. Across the crowd O'Malley spots Captain Holland, who apparently is the man he's searching for.
C: O'MALLEY
D: Holland! Captain Holland!
E: calls
N: In the general hubbub, Holland doesn't hear -- conferring with some other officers. ANGLE PAST HOLLAND - EMERGENCY ROOM THROUGH the glass partition, we see doctors and nurses going about their examination of Storm's body. O'MALLEY pushes his way toward Holland. Two uniformed cops in the crush along the way. O'Malley comes up beside Holland.
C: HOLLAND
D: They always said Storm was superhuman. Now we know why he was always jacked up on coke!
E: BAREHEADED SHADOW
N: O'Malley grabs Holland, slams him against the glass wall.
C: O'MALLEY
D: Let me tell you something, you piss- ant. That man in there was the cleanest I ever knew -- with more honor and guts than this whole department put together. If I ever hear you say fuck all like that again, I'll lose my shield to put you where you belong.
E: whisper, full of menace
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 24. O'Malley releases Holland, backs off, calming himself. The men stare at each other.
C: HOLLAND
D: What the hell's I.A. doing up at this hour?
E: hostile
C: O'MALLEY
D: Taking over the show.
C: HOLLAND
D: This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.
N: O'Malley tugs out a letter on official stationery.
C: O'MALLEY
D: We got two cops down, with money and drugs all over the place. This is straight from the commissioner.
N: Holland is clearly upset by this, but knows he can't argue with a letter from the commissioner. Reluctantly he yields. He turns his gaze back to the stretcher in the ER. Now he and O'Malley are just two officers, sharing a loss.
C: HOLLAND
D: You and Storm were tight, O'Malley. I'm sorry.
C: O'MALLEY
D: He was the most unstoppable sonofabitch I ever knew.
C: HOLLAND
D: Well.
N: He got stopped tonight. Holland breaks his stare at Storm's body and drags away, signaling his own cops to vacate. They exit. No farewells between Holland and O'Malley. O'Malley waits silently, watching Holland and his men clear the corridor and disappear. DOCTOR emerges from the emergency room.

D: I've got a live cop, is what I've got.
S: INT. E.R. TRAUMA ROOM
N: O'Malley stares at Storm's body, stunned. The Doctor stands beside him -- at the side of the room, away from the medics.
C: E.R. DOCTOR
D: The paramedics called it wrong, so did my people at first. Look... it happens. The man had no vital signs. With all the blood and excitement, I almost missed it myself. But we have a pulse now. Your man is alive, Lieutenant.
N: O'Malley's eyes flash from Storm (over whom the medics are now working) to the corridor outside, at the end of which he can see several straggling cops and news people. His mind is racing -- He spots something on a stainless steel medical table: Storm's blood-soaked vest, apparently tossed there when the medics stripped Storm to work on him. O'Malley picks the vest up. He studies it - INSERT - VEST The surveillance tape Storm stashed is still there! O'MALLEY slips the cassette into his pocket. O'Malley makes a decision. Turns intensely toward the Doctor.

C: ANDY
D: Besides ... you've got so much to live for.

S: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT
N: An accident case being hurried in from an ambulance. Paramedics, E.R. personnel and patients fill the scene. A bespectacled doctor in a white coat casually emerges from the crush and continues on into a hallway.

N: Several nurses chat and drink coffee at a clerical station. Ford comes up - nameplate, stethoscope, looking the part perfectly. We see him exchange a greeting, ask a question. One of the nurses hands him a clipboard with some papers on it. As the killer scans the clipboard -RUSS, the security man, approaches. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 35. Ford averts his face subtly, continuing to study the list. Russ passes, with a greeting for the nurses -- and a (slightly unsure) nod for the killer. The killer nods back.

E: dashes up
N: PHHT! PHHT! Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead.
S: INT. CLOSE ON STORM
N: Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight. Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative ... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall. COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then: ANDY backs through the double doors at the other end of the hall, trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full view of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly -- Ford hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready. Andy carefully heads that way -- the two corpses visible ahead and the killer poised to waste her. But she's concentrating on the overloaded tray, traveling closer ... closer ... until -- she turns off into the medicine room. Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight. AT ELEVATORS Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to grasp the wall and push himself along.

She backs off in horror. Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone -- finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone. STORM'S ELEVATOR The doors open -- revealing a dark, deserted seventh floor still under construction. He registers the opposing elevator rising his way -- jabbing again at the control panel ... exposed there ... doors wide open. Wild stabs. Any button will do -- just close the goddam door! DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close. Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's got. The gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away! He can't reach it! He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble strength. The doors open and -- Andy crashes into him!

He can barely absorb it: nature, sunshine, life. Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable. He remembers: the nurse ... Andy. A TV is on at the foot of the bed.

The cane slips and he falls flat on his face. Too weak to break the fall. LOW ANGLE - STORM We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up. He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three, four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat again. ANOTHER LOW ANGLE Storm's face on the floor. EXTREME CLOSEUP Fury, frustration, despair -- ANDY grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake, his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode. He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad. Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins to "help" feed Storm.

This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy.

He unravels a package with Oriental characters handwritten on the outside. In one section: what looks like an old wax Baggie full of Chinese herbs. In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny, fat. Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it. It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package has greatly diminished. PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking out of him. He is now frozen deep in meditation. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue. MONTAGE WITH SCORE.

When it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance.

N: From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty clips and a box of Glazer ammo. Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action, hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of sadness crosses Storm's face.

Through the mouth opening of his ski mask, we see he is smiling a sick smile -- and sensually stroking his Bowie knife. ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his smile. Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal and lunges with his knife. Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with his right hand. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 69.

They raise their automatic weapons, but before they can fire -- STORM hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers! Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS! Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase. Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ...

Andy can't shoot and Storm can't drive and shoot at the same time, so he does what is logical for him -- he keeps the pedal to the metal and chases them. BULLETS from the two men OBLITERATE the Jeep's WINDSHIELD. BUCKSHOT RIDDLES the VEHICLE everywhere. Andy is on the floor of the Jeep. Storm is periodically ducking. He is bleeding we don't know from what or how bad -- and then blam! -- masked man #1's body is airborne. This makes #2 think... and run very fast.

He looks terrific, like a young colt -- free and fearless -- his shiny hair flying as lie runs down a soccer ball in the pell-mell action of an eighth-grade game. The feel of this SLOW MOTION portrait is diametrically opposite to the corruption and duplicity in the world of the movie so far.

MESSAGE DESK AND ALCOVE Storm drops away from Andy, about ten feet from the desk, slips subtly toward an alcove. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 87. Andy crosses to the desk -- we see her speak to the Clerk and the Clerk hands her the message slip. She scans it hastily, excited by what she reads -- moves quickly back to Storm.
C: ANDY
D: Sonny got away! He's with O'Malley! O'Malley's gat the tape -- they're heading for Union Station.
N: Storm:. ecstatic. He grabs Andy, ready to exit. Suddenly, he freezes -- STORM'S POV He spots Ford! STORM his eyes flash across the lobby. He spots: JONES STORM shields Andy. Plainclothesman #1 steps out, whipping out his badge. Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge in front of his face and uses him as a human battering ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental office and out into the street in front of the hotel! Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream. Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy.
S: EXT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Storm dumps his "battering ram body" and he and Andy sprint toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel, where numerous cars are coining and going. VALET AREA The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume. He is presently handing keys to a large "good old boy" -- boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too- large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and -- Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 88. AVENUE OF THE STARS Instantly the Gullwing is in flight -- SCREECHING away from the hotel entrance, across the median and the decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars. But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping. As the two cop cars crash into each other -- FORD AND JONES on foot, catch up to the scene. Too late.
C: FORD
D: Get the goddam cars!
N: They run off. A crowd of theatergoers stare in bewilderment at the scene of chaos.

N: 0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12. The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except for a few travelers and stragglers. Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on top of a battered suitcase. O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny on a bench.

D: Let me see the tickets. Did you get us one of those sleeping cars? What time is he getting here anyway?
C: O'MALLEY
D: Soon...
N: Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they approach --
C: NOLAN
D: Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see. Taking a trip somewhere?
E: calling out approaching
N: O'Malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under Sonny's Jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he calmly starts to rise.

N: O'Malley and the men come to face-off point, staring at each other.
C: NOLAN
D: Enough of this fucking around. We want the tape.
N: CLUNK! O.S. we hear a CLATTERING ECHO. Sonny has picked up his jacket. The tape has fallen onto the marble floor!
C: O'MALLEY
D: Sonny -- run!
N: Sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing toward the rear doorway heading for the street. Nolan and Turner start to run after him. O'Malley throws a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength. Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --

N: Sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens of cars, but he has stopped -- looking back fearfully, worried about O'Malley. O'Malley bursts from the exit.

E: shouts
N: In front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver replacing a flat. O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny past the cab, when suddenly: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 91. He is SHOT in the back by Nolan! His lurching bulk crashes into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. The tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose, onto the ground near O'Malley. Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car. The cab driver flees for his life. O'Malley spins back, draws and tries to fire at the oncoming Nolan and Turner -- but he is SHOT TWICE in the stomach. Turner kicks O'Malley in the hand, sending the gun flying off under the cab!
C: NOLAN
D: Get the kid! He's under the cars!
N: Nolan and Turner sprint off after Sonny. Sonny rolls from under one to another. Nolan and Turner try to trap him, peering under the cars -- but Sonny is too agile and cat-like. Turner crouches down, spots Sonny.

But still he staggers toward Nolan, raising the tire iron. Nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. O'Malley staggers another step. Sonny has crawled out from under the car; he sees this.

E: to Nolan, dying
N: Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. Nolan races after him. Between the maze of parked cars. Sonny, dodging, in between the endless rows. Meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally wounded O'Malley. Suddenly, O.S. we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The crowd reacts as the Gullwing blasts into the lot, ROARING straight toward Nolan and the terrorized Sonny. Finally, unable to get any closer, Storm leaps out of the Gullwing, onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of one vehicle after another, closing in on Nolan and Sonny. Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley. ON SONNY unaware of Storm -- trying to escape from his pursuer. NOLAN cursing and unable to gain ground on the fleet-footed -- now actually raising his gun. Suddenly: STORM from the roof of the next-to-last car roof in a line of parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle- setting what looks like a new world record in the long jump -- surprising Nolan from the rear! Slamming the cop to the ground in instant death. Cracking his neck. SONNY stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't seen in seven years. STORM relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They hold each other with all their strength.

C: HOLLAND
D: Fuck his picture! Get off your asses -- Start earning your money!
E: waves them to get out of here
N: Holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair, stalks angrily toward a rear door. The others glower as Holland pounds off into the rear of the house. Dunne slings a cue ball the length of the table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot. The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a futile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly: STORM Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland just left by. He is dripping from the rain and has a .45 pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don't wake the baby." DUNNE, FORD AND JONES don't know whether to shit or go blind.
C: STORM
D: How's the action, boys? Mind if I play?
N: Glances from the men toward the couch at the rear of the room, on which rest their jackets and shoulder holsters. Storm: totally aware of every aspect of the situation.
C: STORM
D: I know what you guys are thinking. You're thinking I couldn't play with this gun in my hand. Right?
N: Pause as the men stand in extreme anticipation. Then: Storm holsters his gun. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 96.
C: STORM
D: Well? Somebody hand me a cue.
N: There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of disbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down. Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head. He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end. Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table. Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection. With the other hand he raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat via the windpipe!
C: STORM
D: That's for my wife. Fuck you and die.
N: Dunne falls to his knees and just stares. Storm does a flying kick to his chin, breaking his neck. The room now finished, he turns and exits. INDOOR POOL Holland pours himself a nervous drink. He paces, tracking Trent who's doing a gentle breaststroke.
C: TRENT
D: I want Dunne and the others here. That goddamn Storm is nuts enough to come after me --

S: INT. BATHROOM - HOLLAND
N: as he lifts the toilet seat to pee, he finds a handwritten note on the seat. Shocked, he nervously looks around. Seeing nothing, he picks up the note and reads it. INSERT - NOTE Anticipation of death is worse than death itself. HOLLAND A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence. As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits. TRACKING Holland as he moves toward the sporting room and his support team. He enters the area of carnage and the smug confidence on his face starts to change to a slight worry. He then starts carefully making his way back to the indoor pool to inform Trent. INDOOR POOL Holland enters the area and finds no one. Now the look on his face is one of fear and confusion.
C: HOLLAND
D: Sonofabitch.
N: But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering. CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice:
C: STORM
D: How does it feel to know you're about to die?
E: O.S.
N: Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his .45 pointed at Holland.
C: STORM
D: I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 98. Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again. As he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland. WALL BEHIND HOLLAND A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's head. They are both out of ammo. STORM'S POV Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the AIR. But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker away from him. They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING. Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide and seek with a childhood friend.
C: STORM
D: Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?
N: Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet seat, and then proceeds into --
S: INT. MASTER BEDROOM
C: STORM
D: Let's see ... where could that bad boy be?
E: loud enough for Trent to hear
N: From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or what. He approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody. MASTER CLOSET Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 99. One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section. Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye. STORM AND TRENT Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head. Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth.
C: STORM
D: You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you --
E: pause
N: Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now. Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance. Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire. Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison.

S: EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY
N: We are not sure where we are yet. In the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional Scottish garb. In the front, several paces ahead of the neatly marching lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER. Behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by mounted police. FULL SHOT Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy and Sonny are standing near at sober attention. The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET begins playing "Taps." The coffin is slowly lowered. FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with subtitles including each speaker's name to make every word and identity clear. We see: The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon.
