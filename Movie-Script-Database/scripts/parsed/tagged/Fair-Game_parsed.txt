D: Actually. I work in Georgetown for Brewster Jennings. We're a small firm of Venture Capitalists.
E: Deadpan
C: JOE
D: That must be interesting work.
C: VALERIE
D: It pays the rent.
S: INT. BASEMENT, LANGLEY. DAY.
N: Valerie leads Joe into a windowless room. MIKE. Five or six analysts. Agents from CIA and State Department.
C: VALERIE
D: This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is Mike, the Deputy Chief of CPD. I'll leave you guys to it.
E: They shake
N: Businesslike, Valerie leaves. Joe sits. Silence.
C: MIKE
D: Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about Yellowcake?
N: Joe looks around the room. Clears his throat.
C: JOE
D: I believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But I'm not a scientist.
C: MIKE
D: What about Niger?
C: JOE
D: The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the former foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines.
C: MIKE
D: The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore..
E: He fixes Joe MORE
N: MIKE (cont'd) I don't have to tell you how serious this allegation is.
C: JOE WILSON
D: No Sir, you don't.
N: He leans forward.
C: MIKE
D: This is a request from the Vice President. Can you help us?
N: ESTABLISHING: A LONE DC-8 FLIES ACROSS A CORAL PINK SKY. A DC-8 judders in low over hills surrounding Niamey airport. INSIDE --Joe, two days growth, blinks out the window. Below, a rusty burned out DC-8 which didn't make it.
S: EXT. TAXI, NIGERIEN ROAD. DAY
N: Joe, in the back of a hot, rickety Renault, rattling along the highway into town. Low earthen dwellings. Camel trains.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM, NAIMEY. DAY
N: A tiny, hot cell. A sign on the bathroom door. "RED HOT SHOVER". Turns the ceiling fan on. Loud grinding.
S: INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
N: Joe lathers up his face to shave. He turns on the tap. No water. He looks at himself in the mirror.
C: MINISTER
D: Bien revenue a Niger M. Wilson.
E: O.S
S: EXT. OUTSIDE DUSTY BODEGA. DAY.
N: Joe, unshaven, shakes hands with a 60 year old Nigerien.
C: JOE
D: Par la grace D'Allah. Comment allez vous, M. Bonzala ?
N: INSIDE - We subtitle the mixture of French dialect and Hausa.
C: MINISTER
D: Last time we met I was Minister, you Ambassador. Now, thanks to Allah, we are free men. You're growing a beard, no?
C: JOE
D: So it would seem.
C: MINISTER
D: So tell me. How can Niger help its old friend, America?
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE. DAY.
N: Several analysts sit around a table, including the LEAD ANALYST, PAUL. Two of them are the guys who were bad-mouthing Valerie. Another is JOE TURNER, a dough-faced offical from WINPAC (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control).
C: TURNER
D: "In summer 2001 Iraq sought to purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4 aluminum tubes manufactured in China. The high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium. In August 2001 J. Turner.." That's me.. "flew to Vienna, to meet with IAEA scientists. Mr. Turner produced this report, aspects of which represents the CIA's present position." I'm happy to take questions.
E: Reads
C: ANALYST
D: The INR concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use, and the DOE agreed they exactly matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets.
C: PAUL
D: Where are the tubes?
C: TURNER
D: WINPAC has them. We've examined them. This is my point. None of you guys has even seen the tubes.
C: VALERIE
D: I've seen them.
N: Everyone looks at her.
C: TURNER
D: And when was that?
N: Valerie looks up. Slightly surprised by his tone.
C: VALERIE
D: When I seized them last year in Jordan. When I headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC.
N: A couple of the analysts try not to smile.
C: TURNER
D: So I take it you're not a nuclear expert. These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by German scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.
N: Valerie turns to her notes from her reading.
C: VALERIE
D: You're right. I'm no nuclear expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at Virginia U atomic facility is. He also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of his design.
C: PAUL
D: And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe's design. In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that they're made of aluminium.
C: VALERIE
D: A metal that hasn't been used in gas centrifuges since 1952.
N: The chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie. Still Turner doesn't give up.
C: TURNER
D: I went to Vienna. Canada. I've worked on this for months. They're centrifuges. Fact.
C: PAUL
D: So basically, they're your tubes and if we don't let you win you're going home.
C: TURNER
D: That's pathetic.
C: VALERIE
D: Joe. No one is saying you're wrong here. But if you're right, it's huge. So we ask the question. Right? We have to ask the question.
S: EXT. DESERT ROAD. DAY.
N: Joe rides shotgun, in a 4X4, driven deep into the Sahara.
C: JOE V/O
D: Niger has two Uranium mines in the Sahara desert. One's flooded. The other's run by COGEMA, a French subsidiary, jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans.
N: A collossal earthworks defacing the flat, hot moonscape. Joe is escorted around the mines by a small team.
C: JOE
D: 500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the nation's annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge paper trail.
S: INT. HOTEL. DAY.
N: Joe sits on his bed, under the noisy fan, making notes.
C: JOE
D: Any documentation would by law have to be signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the mines... But say it was an off the books deal..
E: V.O.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE VILLAGE. DAY.
N: The long road back from the mines the previous day, Joe's Land Rover pulls over. Everyone comes out to see them.
C: JOE
D: How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium?
E: V.O. MORE
N: JOE (V.O.) (cont'd) You're talking fifty semi tractor trucks on one road through villages where nothing passed for months except maybe one bush taxi. It would be the biggest event for months. To say they forgot, it's like kids forgetting Christmas. ESTABLISHING-- JOE AND VALERIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT. INSIDE -- Joe sits at the dining room table, debriefed by two CIA agents, over Chinese take out.
C: JOE
D: The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by millions of dollars of U.S Aid, which continues to this day. It just doesn't make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline. For that reason, and the others I've given, it's my opinion that the sale couldn't happen.
T: CUT TO:
N: Joe shows them out. Shuts the door. Valerie appears.
C: JOE
D: What happens next?
C: VALERIE
D: They write a report. Give it to the analysts. It'll be re-written, then kicked upstairs where it'll be thrown in with whoever else's report they got-
N: Joe snorts derisively.
C: JOE
D: You guys are hysterical. I can't believe you're actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions.
C: VALERIE
D: You can't compile Intelligence from a single source? That's not Intelligence. That's an opinion.
C: JOE
D: I can save the CIA some air fare here. There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened.
C: VALERIE
D: Say who?
C: JOE
D: Says me.
C: VALERIE
D: What if you're wrong? One guy says it's true. It's not true. Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true. It's intelligence. It's slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and balances.
C: JOE
D: What am I, a check or a balance?
C: VALERIE
D: Probably neither. You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They count on that. That's why they don't pay you.
C: JOE
D: I'm not feeling that 007 right now.
N: She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him sexily.
C: VALERIE
D: I can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help.
C: JOE
D: Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex.
C: VALERIE
D: I'll see what I can do.
N: They start making out.
T: CUT TO:
N: TELEVISION FOOTAGE OF A PRESS CONFERENCE.
C: JOURNALIST
D: Mr. President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that?
S: INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE. DAY
N: VALERIE leans over an analyst's desk as together they study photographs of a Syrian man in his sixties on the analysts screen.. The TV is on in the corner of the computer screen..
C: PRESIDENT ON TV
D: The idea of focusing on one person indicates people don't understand the scope of the mission. Terror is bigger than one person. So I just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you...
N: Valerie looks up and stops. ACROSS THE FLOOR SCOOTER LIBBY, his assistant and TWO AIDES, walk past. Heads turn.
C: VALERIE
D: Why is the OVP here?
S: INT. MIKE'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: The Deputy director hears a knock. It's Valerie.
C: VALERIE
D: Mike. The Vice President's men are here.
C: MIKE
D: What the fuck?
S: INT. BRIEFING ROOM. DAY.
N: No windows. A lone analyst sits sweating bullets. LIBBY, spectacles on, thick folder open on his knee..
C: LIBBY
D: My name is I. Lewis Libby. I'm the Chief of Staff to The Vice President. You are?
C: ANALYST
D: Dave. I'm an analyst. In non- proliferation.
C: LIBBY
D: What can you tell the Vice President about aluminium tubes?
S: INT. CIA MESS HALL, 2ND FLOOR, LANGLEY. DAY
N: Valerie and Mike queue up in the mess with JIM PAVITT, 52 the Deputy Director of the CIA.
C: PAVITT
D: Relax Mike. The Veep's just dotting the i's.
C: MIKE
D: Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon.
C: PAVITT
D: Look. Cheney doesn't trust us. This shit with Dick goes back thirty years. It'll blow over. Where are we on Iraq?
E: He turns to Valerie
C: VALERIE
D: Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is outdated. We don't have a single operative or asset in the country.
C: PAVITT
D: What about geo-satellite imaging?
C: VALERIE
D: With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call.
C: PAVITT
D: So talk to the defectors.
C: VALERIE
D: The defectors are unreliable. Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. It's a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear.
C: PAVITT
D: So we're blind.
C: VALERIE
D: We need sources we can rely on. We need to get in close.
C: PAVITT
D: How close?
C: VALERIE
D: Inside.
C: BILL
D: Jim. Val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program.
N: Pavitt looks at her.
C: PAVITT
D: How?
T: CUT TO:
N: Rows and rows of stationary. Shelves filled pads, pens. Pencils. Photocopy paper. Shelves twenty feet high.
S: INT. PAPER SUPPLIES AND STATIONERY SHOP. DAY
N: Valerie selects a pad and a pencil and approaches the counter where a lugubrious woman in a pink Sari is doing Su Doku. Valerie pays for her notebook and steps out into ---
S: EXT. BUSY STREET. CAIRO, EGYPT. DAY
N: The streets throng with traffic. Somalian taxi drivers. Central Africans ferrying exotic produce. Egyptians smoking apple tobacco. Colors. Bustle. A different world. Valerie, head shrouded in a scarf, puts the notebook in her bag and pushes her way along the crowded street, buzzing with scooters and pedestrians. She steps through an archway into --
S: EXT. SULTANATE COURTYARD, CAIRO UNIVERSITY. DAY
N: An ancient cloister filled with an excited clamor. Fresh faced students pile into a lecture theater. She follows.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: The warping of the extra dimension is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive object eg: a black hole.
E: V.O.
S: INT. WOOD PANELLED LECTURE HALL. CAIRO UNIVERSITY. DAY
N: Wrapt Silence. Valerie sits at the back. She opens her new notebook and listens. ON STAGE -- An old Middle-Eastern professor is giving a lecture with the help of an over-head projector. Giant shadow hands deftly trace algebraic formulae onto projector.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: Red-shifting, generates a large ratio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger.
N: Valerie watches.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: It's an honor to meet you at last Dr. Harper.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. CLOISTERS OF CAIRO UNIVERSITY. DAY
N: The prof walks with Valerie talking excitedly.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: I was unable to attend your String- Gravity seminar at MIT but I read a transcript. Truly groundbreaking work.
C: VALERIE
D: Thank you.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: The Faculty have just moved me, so you must excuse the mess.
N: He shows Valerie up a stone staircase and through a door.
S: INT. BOOKLINED STUDY. CAIRO UNIVERSITY. DAY
N: Books everywhere. Lots still in boxes.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: My old rooms were on the other side of the courtyard. They were smaller but I got the morning sunlight. Will you settle for Peppermint tea. It's fresh.
C: VALERIE
D: Thank you.
N: The professor hands Valerie a cup of mint tea and sits.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: Tell me Dr. Harper, did you read my latest paper on quarks. I cite your 1995 essay more than once. I would be very intrigued to know what you made of my findings..
N: She sits forward.
C: VALERIE
D: Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for 48 hours.
N: The professor blinks. Taken aback.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: I don't understand. Who are you?
C: VALERIE
D: I'm sorry for misleading you. But I'm here to ask you the same question. Because you are not Professor Aziz.
E: He stops
N: He stands there. Thrown.
C: VALERIE
D: I'm sorry to surprise you like this Sir. Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari. You were born in Basra.
N: The old man looks perplexed. Even a little amused. He sits.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: Well. This is indeed a strange morning. Madam, there seems to have been a mistake. My name is Said Uhmah Aziz. I am a theoretical physicist. I model space. I've never been to Basra. I'm a teacher. I'd like to be of assistance. But I'm afraid I can't help you.
C: VALERIE
D: So you're not Doctor Fallari.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: Madam. I've never even heard of this man.
C: VALERIE
D: You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: This is absurd.
C: VALERIE
D: You weren't tortured. Broken. You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing.
C: PROFESSOR AZIZ
D: No.
C: VALERIE
D: Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard. He never saw them again.
N: He stares at the floor.
C: VALERIE
D: That didn't happen. They never existed.
N: He remains motionless. Valerie watches him closely.
C: VALERIE
D: I need names. Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it.
N: He looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes
C: VALERIE
D: I know Tarif. I know what happened.
N: He walks over to the window. SLOWLY he takes off his jacket. His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her. He's been mutilated and burned all up his back. Slowly he turns. Deep scars. Burns.
C: PROFESSOR
D: You know nothing.
S: EXT. CAIRO STREET. DUSK.
N: Sunset. Traders are packing up. Valerie hurries into --
S: INT. SAFE HOUSE. CAIRO. DUSK.
N: ..up some rickety stairs and unlocks a graffiti covered door. Inside she takes out the notepad, her heart beating fast. On the page, A LIST OF NAMES. She pulls a ruggedized laptop from under the bed and pushes the plug into a bare wires socket. It fizzes. She starts to type the names into the computer.

N: ESTABLISHING. RAINY LANGLEY. DAY.
S: INT. CHIEF OF CPD'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: MIKE at his desk. His secretary pops her head round the door.
C: SECRETARY
D: They're back.
S: INT. BRIEFING ROOM. DAY.
N: An analyst sits opposite Scooter Libby. He's so nervous he can barely open his eyes. ANALYST 1 The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet. They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long. Now you could argue that that's to disguise them, you could saw them in half. That's sixty thousand tubes. (Mimes sawing) I mean whew. Saddam's gonna get the mother of all blisters.. Laughs. Libby stares, unsmiling. Keeps sawing. Wishing to God he'd never started. OUTSIDE. The door opens and the analyst, white as a sheet, comes out. A couple of colleagues are waiting outside. ANALYST 2 How was it? ANALYST 1 Don't make jokes. ANALYST 1 drifts his way back to his desk. ANALYST 2 swallows, and disappears into the `interrogation' room.
S: INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
N: PAUL, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall. ANALYST 2 is there, throwing up in the sink. ANALYST 2 He thinks I don't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it.
C: PAUL
D: OK. I'll handle this.
T: CUT TO:
N: Scooter listens patiently to PAUL, the chief analyst.
C: PAUL
D: And so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the IAEA which I believe is numbered in the report.. Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. They can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. And maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says "so, tell me about gas centrifuges". That's literally the only time you should listen to these guys. If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water. We've been over this data with you now five, six times. And... We don't really know how you want us to play this..
E: Stops. Changes tack
N: Libby listens. He nods. Waits.
C: LIBBY
D: Let me level with you here Paul. I don't know what these tubes are for. From everything you're saying, there could be something to this, but very likely not, right?
C: PAUL
D: Exactly.
C: LIBBY
D: May I ask a question? When you say we don't really know how to play this, what do you mean?
C: PAUL
D: I'm just saying I don't know how to say it any other way than that-
E: Stops. Turns white
C: LIBBY
D: Except you didn't say `I' you said `we'. So you and the others have discussed how to "play" these briefings. Why does the CIA feel the need to play these briefings?
C: PAUL
D: No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn't mean what I just said.
C: LIBBY
D: Which part. The last part. Or other things too.
C: PAUL
D: I'm a getting a little confused-
C: LIBBY
D: You want me to come back?
C: PAUL
D: No. GOD no.
N: The temperature drops five degrees.
C: LIBBY
D: You don't know why I'm here do you? In 1991 the United States invaded Iraq, and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered Saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile material. And not a single person at the CIA, from the DCI down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed. So now, one decade on, are you telling me that you're 100% sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons?
C: PAUL
D: I..Sir..OK. With intelligence, nothing's 100 percent.
C: LIBBY
D: So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine percent sure? Ninety eight?
C: PAUL
D: You can't put an exact figure. You can't be that precise.
C: LIBBY
D: But if you had to say, could you say you're ninety seven percent sure? Is there a three percent chance you've got this wrong? Or four? Or five? Still pretty good odds. You like those odds Paul? You willing to put your name to that. Are you ready to make that call?
C: PAUL
D: I don't make the call, Sir-.
C: LIBBY
D: Yes you do Paul. Each time you interpret a piece of data. Each time you choose a "maybe" over a "perhaps" you make a call. A decision. And right now you're making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision and out there's a real world where millions of people depend upon you being right. But what if there's a one percent chance you're wrong. Can you say for sure you'll take that chance and state, as a fact, that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear weapons programme?
E: Fixing him
N: The analyst sits frozen.
C: LIBBY
D: Do you know what one percent of the population of this country is? It's three million, two hundred and forty thousand souls.
C: PAUL
D: Sir. We're not machines. We.. It.. We look at the evidence, we game it out. Not everyone agrees all the time. It's a process.
C: LIBBY
D: It's a process.
C: PAUL
D: Yes.
C: LIBBY
D: And not everyone agrees.
C: PAUL
D: Exactly.
C: LIBBY
D: Who doesn't agree?
N: SFX: A VOLLEY OF GUNFIRE. FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER. AND ANOTHER.
S: EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETARY. DAY
N: Full military funeral, in the rain. A hundred mourners from Langley. Some uniformed. A coffin draped in the flag
T: CUT TO:
N: A hymn is sung. In the bleechers, the analyst from the meeting earlier, pauses in the break between verses and squints through the rain at the bank of seats across the grave. OVER THERE is THE LANGLEY TOP BRASS. JIM PAVITT. Next to him, GEORGE TENET, DCI. Next to him...... of all people.... JOE TURNER, (the analyst from WINPAC).
C: ANALYST
D: What the fuck is Joe Turner doing next to the DCI?
N: ANALYST 2 Didn't you hear? Friday the DCI took him to the White House. He briefed the President on Aluminum tubes.
C: ANALYST
D: You're fucking kidding me.
N: Turner is over there, singing the hymn, rubbing shoulders with the good and the great. AT THE BACK -- Valerie stands with a number of other agents, MIKE and BILL, her Chief. A lone bugler and marine drummer beat out a last post. A widow weeps.
C: BILL
D: Its a dead end.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: Valerie walks with the Chief and other senior agents away from the graveside.
C: BILL
D: So we've got a list of names. The Mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day. Their houses are bugged. Their friends are followed.
C: TACTICAL COMMANDER
D: Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city.
C: BILL
D: You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to react unpredictably.
C: TACTICAL COMMANDER
D: What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets?
C: VALERIE
D: No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all.
C: TACTICAL COMMANDER
D: How? You can't use the inspectors. You can't use tac. The wall's too high Val. What are you going to do. Train a mouse?

C: VALERIE
D: I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes.
N: Joe, still half-asleep, catches up.
C: JOE
D: Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow-
C: VALERIE
D: I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it.
C: JOE
D: Right. Its on the post-it.
C: VALERIE
D: I didn't want to wake you. Are you OK?
E: Senses something
C: JOE
D: We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go.
E: Stops. Laughs He bangs the door
C: VALERIE
D: I'm going to Cleveland.
N: He stops. Thunder-robbed.
C: VALERIE
D: I'll be home tonight. It's on the Post-It.
E: Then
N: She kisses him. They look at one another.
C: JOE
D: Have a nice day.
N: She shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin.

N: A busy ER. A female doctor shakes hands with grateful parents. She bends down to talk to a boy, cast on his arm. VALERIE watches from a distance.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME, MORELAND HILLS, CLEVELAND. DAY
N: A car park. The female doctor gets out of her car, with grocery bags, and goes toward her house. ACROSS THE STREET -- VALERIE watches from a parked rental.

C: VALERIE
D: How long is it since you saw your brother?
C: SAWSAN
D: 1989. I attended a medical convention over there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference. Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It's difficult.
C: VALERIE
D: Would you like to go back and see him?
N: SAWSAN holds her gaze.
C: SAWSAN
D: You want me to become a spy.
C: VALERIE
D: We need to ask Sa'ad some questions. Do you think he would answer them?
C: SAWSAN
D: I'm a doctor. I work hard. I'm also a mother. I have a small girl and I'm all she has.
C: VALERIE
D: We can help your brother. Right now he is extremely valuable to us.
C: SAWSAN
D: And to Saddam. The Mukbarat watch him night and day.
C: VALERIE
D: He could come here Sawsan. He's an expert physicist. He'd have a job, his children, his family would be safe. You, your daughter could see him whever you want. Sawsan. Can you help us?
C: SAWSAN
D: I won't do anything to help you. I don't know you. I would only do this for Sa'ad.

He carries one into THE BEDROOM and hands it to Sawsan, who sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional Abaya. There are two other agents there, with Valerie. One of them is holding a notebook.. AGENT 1 The pages of this notebook are fast burning. You write on them like normal, but if you need to destroy them in an emergency.. He whips out a zippo. Sets fire to one. It's gone in a flash. AGENT 1 You have two of these in your luggage. Now this is the only pen we want you to use.. The other agent shows her a pen. AGENT 2 The ink in this pen is visible for 10 seconds. Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be read.

N: APPLAUSE. Joe sits on stage with three academic types. In the hundred seater auditorium, just a couple dozen or so students.
C: PROFESSOR
D: Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, "If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope." Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero.
C: JOE
D: That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room.
N: Laughter.
S: INT. CORRIDOR. CPD. LANGLEY. DAY
N: Valerie walks with MIKE and ALI, briefing him.
C: VALERIE
D: Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone.
N: BACK TO: THE AUDITORIUM. A nervous history major stands.
C: STUDENT
D: Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security?
C: JOE
D: I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster.

The end of a long day. SLOWLY THE SHOT DECAYS IN A TIME DISSOLVE to NIGHT -- THREE MONTHS LATER -- In the full force of an air-raid. Many of the same buildings are gone. The whole world shakes and trembles as a PAVEWAY GE101 laser guided bomb streaks in and impacts.. Dust. Shrapnel. Cars on fire. A vision of utter hell. A FIGURE -- DARTS BETWEEN BURNING CARS, clutching a bag of food, amid the firestorm. He disappears into our building. Our eye leaves the street - back inside: Sa'ad bursts in as - Another missile lands nearby. The building shakes. The picture of Sawsan shifts. Dust falls like fine rain over the small kitchen. Sa'ad unpacks food on the rickety table. Under it, his wife, children cower. He passes down bread. Cheese. The baby is crying. There is a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. On the other side are two men.

D: Thank you for coming here today. I wanted to convey my outrage to you in person. In all my experience, nothing has disgusted me like this business.
E: MORE
N: PAVITT (cont'd) I know it's not easy for you, but I want you to know how much the agency appreciates your silence in the light of this matter. We know how damaging this has been to you. We can't afford for this knife fight to go on any longer.
C: VALERIE
D: I get death threats every day. People threatening to kill my husband. Hurt my children. I went to the agency and I requested security to protect my family. It was declined. Because quote "My circumstances fall outside budget protocols." If this is a knife fight, right now, Sir - we're fighting it alone.
N: Pavitt starts to chuckle.
C: PAVITT
D: Joe Wilson versus the White House. Well, all I can say is Good Luck. But as a friend, I feel I should tell you that those men..
N: He points down the hill at the White House.
C: PAVITT
D: Those few men in that building over there, that small white house, are the most powerful men in the history of the world. How much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take on Joe Wilson?
N: He looks at her.
C: PAVITT
D: Joe's out there on his own Valerie. But I know we can trust you. Speak to your husband.

C: VALERIE
D: It's the White House Joe. You seriously think you can pick a fight with the White House and win. They'll bury us.
C: JOE WILSON
D: They'll bury us if we don't. How loud can you shout Val? Say we get in an argument you think you're right, and I think your wrong. You start making your point with all your might, and I start shouting back, except I'm the White House, and I can a shout a million times louder. Does that make me right? They lied Val. That's the truth.
C: VALERIE
D: By the time they're finished here you won't know what that is.

C: REPORTER ON TV
D: Today Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, in charge of the enquiry into the leaking of the identity of a covert agent announced that he is convening a Grand Jury to investigate the affair. Among the blizzard of subpoenas issued are ones for the Vice President's chief of Staff Scooter Libby, and special advisor to the President Karl Rove. Both men are under suspicion of having leaked the agent's name to reporters in order to damage former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal and combative critic of the administration. It is believed that the President himself has been questioned under oath by the FBI.

C: VALERIE
D: Hey.
N: Joe carries a heavy brown manilla envelope. From it he removes a thick wad of paper and drops it on the bench.
C: VALERIE
D: What's that?
C: JOE WILSON
D: That is the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. On page thirty six it says "the former ambassador's wife offered up his name" and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame which says quote "my husband has good relations with both the prime minister and the former Minister of Mines, both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity." I've spent a whole year denying just this.

D: Joe wait-
C: JOE WILSON
D: Telling everyone who'll listen, on TV. In the press. My wife did not send me on a junket.
C: VALERIE

C: JOE WILSON
D: You sent an email. The SSCI found the email.
C: VALERIE JOE WILSON
D: I write hundreds of emails. Why didn't you tell me? At no time in the past twelve months you never thought-
C: VALERIE
D: I didn't make the decision. I was asked to write a recommendation. What am I supposed to do. Not say my husband knows about this.

C: VALERIE
D: So what do you want me to do Joe? Go to the papers like you did? Write a piece in the New York Times? You know I'd have to submit it to the Agency, and they'll-
C: JOE WILSON
D: The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this the same Agency which won't give you protection for your children? Is this the same CIA that's erased your pension? Where's your loyalty Val? To your husband or the CIA?
E: Interrupting
C: VALERIE
D: It's to MY FAMILY. I put my family first. ALWAYS. Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article?
E: Shouts louder
N: People are looking over. The children notice. JOE is stung into silence.
C: VALERIE
D: I'm taking different routes to and from school. I'm looking in empty rooms..under the beds every time I come home. A home we're going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover. What has all this achieved? What changed Joe? Who won?
C: JOE WILSON
D: Maybe you're right. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. Is that what your dad taught you Valerie? That what Colonel Sam Plame said?
E: nods MORE
N: JOE WILSON (cont'd) A good American doesn't rock the boat. A good American looks the other way. They are both terribly wounded. He looks at her, levelly.
C: JOE
D: Did you send me to Niger? "His business is struggling. He's on the slide. I'll throw him a bone." Was that it Val? You pull some strings for me? You help your old man out?

N: CNN NEWS FOOTAGE
C: ANCHORMAN
D: The Senate Intelligence Committee published information that showed Joe Wilson had lied about how he came to be sent to Niger. He denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever, but a memo Plame wrote on February 12, 2002 proves otherwise.
N: MSNBC NEWS FOOTAGE
C: ANCHORMAN
D: The Senate Intelligence Committee let some air ­ a lot of air - out of Joe Wilson's overly inflated ego when it issued its first report on prewar intelligence. While the committee heaped most of its criticism on the Central Intelligence Agency for getting almost everything wrong about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction it pointedly rebuked the former ambassador and his infamous mission to Niger.
S: EXT. HOUSE. DAY.
N: Morning. Joe, in a suit, comes out of his house. A gaggle of reporter is waiting, they follow Joe as he crosses into the street towards his car. Shutters and flashbulbs firing.
C: REPORTER
D: Mr Wilson, do you still maintain the Vice President's office sent you Niger and not your wife?
N: REPORTER 2 Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday? A boondoggle?
C: JOE WILSON
D: My wife did not send me. I didn't receive payment. It was not a holiday. It was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war. But the fact is no one wanted facts.
C: REPORTER
D: Are you against our troops Mr Wilson?
C: REPORTER
D: Mr. Wilson is it true you donated money to the Kerry campaign?
C: REPORTER
D: People are saying your wife does not actually work for the CIA.
C: REPORTER
D: Is it true she was just a secretary at Langley?

S: INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
N: Valerie is alone. In bed. Watching TV. FOX NEWS. Rogers.
C: GUEST
D: The question still remains, who is Valerie Plame? Was she really simply a glorified typist?
C: ROGERS
D: Well, I think it's really all about the money. We're talking about a third-rate CIA agent who had a government salary, and she had sent her husband to Niger, and he had come back and didn't give the report to the CIA, but he turned it over in an op-ed to The New York Times. So she was already in the hot seat with the CIA, and so now she's all about the money. Plus it's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Joe puts a sheet on the couch. He looks around for something to use as a pillow.

N: FLASH---- Valerie, kneeling, blindfold, in stress position. BACK TO:
C: VALERIE
D: We were bound, hooded and thrown in separate cells. They beat us. Deprived us of sleep. All you had to do was give up the name of one of the others. Just one name. For a glass of water. A sandwich. To avoid another punch.
N: FLASH -- A CAR BATTERY IS CONNECTED.. SZZZZZZ!
C: VALERIE
D: Another hour in a stress position.
N: FLASH -- VALERIE bursts out from under the water. Gasps in a draft of air.
C: VALERIE
D: They push you until they find it. Til they find the point at which you break. Because they have to know. You have to know. And one by one, everybody broke. Except me. I never broke. I've been in situations, places where I was afraid. Where if you made a mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment.. But I never made a mistake. And that made me feel special. I thought: I'm Different. Bullet- proof. You can't break me. I don't have a breaking point. I was wrong.

Wasn't `til I retired after 42 years in the Air Force, I realised we never had a home. Germany, Singapore, Australia, England. Heck I can remember the day you were born in a freezing cold airbase outside Anchorage Alaska. You must have been to twenty schools. Twenty different chances to introduce yourself. Be someone new.

Maybe tougher than I, or your mother, or anyone knows.

D: ...of safeguarding classified information. I'm grateful for this opportunity to set the record straight. I served the United States loyally and to the best of my ability as a covert operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency. I worked on behalf of the national security of our country, on behalf of the people of the United States until my name and true affiliation were exposed in the national media on July 14th, 2003, after a leak by administration officials. Today I can tell this committee even more.
E: MORE
N: REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE (cont'd) In the run-up to the war with Iraq I worked in the Counter Proliferation Division of the CIA, still as a covert officer whose affiliation with the CIA was classified. I raced to discover solid intelligence for senior policy makers on Iraq 's presumed weapons of mass destruction program. While I helped to manage and run secret worldwide operations against this WMD target from CIA headquarters in Washington , I also traveled to foreign countries on secret missions to find vital intelligence. I loved my career because I love my country. BLACKOUT On March 6th 2007 Scooter Libby was found guilty of perjury, obstruction of justice and making false statements to the FBI, concerning the leaking of Valerie Plame's identity. He was handed the maximum sentence: two and a half years in prison, and a $250,000 fine. On July 2nd 2007. The President used his executive authority to commute the court's sentence. Joe and Valerie left Washington and found a new home in Santa Fe. They live there today, with their children.
T: FADE OUT..
