Vicki flicks them off. The men burst into hysterics and peal out of the lot. She gets in her Jeep and leaves, tearing by the bus stop. Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black silhouettes against the darkening sky. Walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a young girl striking a seductive pose.

N: Walter walks over to the window. WALTER (cont'd) One hundred and twenty feet.
C: CARLOS
D: What?

D: Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
C: CARLOS
D: No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
N: The two men laugh, but the laughter quickly fades. CARLOS (cont'd) But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
C: WALTER
D: You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
E: heated

N: hey reach the next level and Walter watches the girl walk away with her friends. Suddenly, the girl looks back. Their eyes lock -- briefly. She W turns the corner. WALTER (V.O.) (cont'd) She gave me a look. If she hadn't given me that look... Walter pauses, then follows. The girl separates from her friends and goes down an aisle. Walter follows her. She goes down another aisle. He follows. In the middle of the aisle, the girl bends down, looking at titles. From the end of the aisle, Walter pretends to be looking for a book as he edges closer to her. He's now a few feet away. The girl pulls out a book and opens it. Walter gazes at the nape of her neck.
C: SALESMAN
D: Can I help you find something?
E: O.S.
N: Walter turns, startled. Behind the salesman, Walter sees a security guard exit the rest room area.
C: WALTER
D: No, I'm --
N: He turns, the girl is gone. He bolts the other way, through the aisles, down the elevator, through the mall as fast as possible. The faces are a blur, sound becomes distorted. Then we hear --

C: WALTER
D: I don't know!
N: Walter is agitated. Rosen calmly writes. WALTER (cont'd) I can't believe I took such a risk. (looks at Rosen) Will you stop writing in that fucking pad! Rosen stops and looks at Walter. WALTER (cont'd) You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
C: ROSEN
D: Is this the first one?
C: WALTER
D: Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
C: ROSEN
D: I want you to calm down.
N: With effort Walter settles down. ROSEN (cont'd) You followed a girl. One girl. Perhaps you wanted to see what it felt like after so many years. Maybe unconsciously you were testing yourself. You followed her and nothing happened. And here you are talking about it with me. This is positive. There is a pause. Walter looks down, unconvinced. Rosen checks the time. ROSEN (cont'd) Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
C: WALTER
D: I want to talk about it now.
C: ROSEN
D: We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
C: WALTER
D: Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
C: OSEN
D: Go home, Walter.
E: gently
C: WALTER

E: pause

N: She gets herself a beer from the fridge.
C: WALTER
D: I don't need a plant.
C: VICKI
D: Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
N: Walter seems at a loss. Vicki takes a swig from her beer. VICKI (cont'd) Here's the deal. Give it a little water. Go easy on the direct sunlight. And notice it every once in a while. They love it when you look at them, or touch their leaves. Can you handle that? Walter looks unconvinced.
C: WALTER
D: Thank you.
C: VICKI

C: ROSEN
D: Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
C: WALTER
D: This is garbage!
C: ROSEN
D: I'm only asking questions.
C: WALTER
D: Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair.

C: WALTER
D: I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.

D: I'm not a monster.
E: a long pause
C: CARLOS
D: You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.

C: CARLOS
D: on't talk like that.
N: The waitress interrupts to clear the table, leaning over to grab the empty plates. Carlos checks her out. CARLOS (cont'd) (pause) Next week Annette is going away for a few days.

C: CARLOS
D: I'm just talking, man.
C: WALTER
D: Carlos, I never raped a woman.
C: CARLOS
D: I know. I'm just saying I understand.
N: Walter doesn't look at Carlos. CARLOS (cont'd) It's crazy out there. (signaling to the crowd) Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy- looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
C: WALTER
D: Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
N: Carlos looks at Walter.
C: CARLOS
D: I see a pretty woman, I look. That's the price of beauty, my friend. My god, you should see what Anna's friends wear.
N: arlos laughs. Walter looks at him.
C: WALTER

C: CARLOS
D: What do you mean?
C: WALTER
D: I mean... feelings.
N: A look of horror/disgust passes over Carlos's face, and he lurches forward grabbing Walter by the shirt collar. Drinks spill.
C: CARLOS
D: Listen, man. I don't got your sick problem, and if you or anybody else ever comes near my daughter, I'll kill you.
N: Carlos lets go of Walter roughly and gets up and leaves. Walter looks around embarrassed -- onlookers slowly turn away. Walter picks up a napkin and starts to blot the table dry.

C: WALTER
D: They grow outside, don't they?

D: What?
C: WALTER
D: The girl.
N: Lucas stares coldly at Walter, his face red. He looks dangerous.

BOB (cont'd) Any man who can't deal with it can see me in my office. I'll pay you for a week, and you can clear out. Bob crumples the paper in his hand. BOB (cont'd) We've got a hell of a lot of orders today. Get to work. Bob turns and walks away. he men are stunned. Three angrily follow after Bob. As does Mary-Kay.

WALTER (cont'd) I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?

C: WALTER
D: Why not?
N: She is quiet. WALTER (cont'd) Are you two alone when he asks you? Still silent. WALTER (cont'd) Does he touch you? Robin looks through her binoculars. WALTER (cont'd) Does he say strange things?

N: Tears come to Robin's eyes again.
C: ROBIN
D: But will he... ?
C: WALTER
D: Your daddy will always love you.
C: ROBIN
D: How do you know?
C: WALTER
D: I know because... it's just something I know.
C: ROBIN
D: I don't want to hurt my daddy.
C: WALTER
D: Robin, listen to me.
N: She looks at him. Walter struggles to find the words. WALTER (cont'd) At first he'll be upset... very upset. It's because he'll realize he's been a bad daddy. Then he'll try... He'll try very hard to be a good daddy... People will say stupid, ignorant things about your daddy. That will be hard for you... But one thing I know for sure, he'll always love you... always. There is a long moment of silence.
C: ROBIN
D: Walter?
C: WALTER
D: Yes?

C: WALTER
D: I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
