S: EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: BOOM! A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a perched crow large in the f.g. TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.
C: DIMITRI
D: We're losing the light; let's pack it in.
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI TWO GRAVEDIGGERS. Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic- style church b.g. Rolls of astro turf. They look up toward the sky.
C: ALEXI
D: Snow, maybe?
C: DIMITRI
D: What, you gonna ski on this?
N: He indicates the mound of fresh dirt. Spits into the grave.
C: DIMITRI
D: Come on, let's bag this. It's beer time.
E: CONT'D
N: Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt. LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in sequence. TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g. Large, glossy-black, the bird follows the arc of movement in the previous shot. Ruffles its feathers as it begins to sprinkle rain. ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast- offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic. She totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain. She stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.
C: ELLY
D: Guess the picnic got rained out.
N: She looks down o.s. at -- ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE as Elly places the gathered flowers down. Almost reverent. RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G. as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave near Shelly Webster's. ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the granite, darkening it. EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE It blinks in its alien way. WITH THE CROW as it takes wing from it's unseen perch. Lands stop Eric's headstone. It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument. ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.
C: ELLY
D: Oh, scary.
N: The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
C: ELLY
D: What are you, like, the night watchman?
N: Another blink from El Birdo. CAMERA WITH ELLY - BOOMING BACK HIGH as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking back. Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in the middle of the city.
S: EXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES
N: CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.
C: MICKEY
D: What this place needs is a good natural catastrophe. Earthquake, tornado...
E: O.S.
N: ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker. MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy open-front fast foodery.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You gotta put the mustard underneath first.
C: MICKEY
D: Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Here, let me do it.
N: He grabs the dog from Mickey. Mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks. Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling the dog in the bun. Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Come on... onion. Don't cheap out on me. Lotta onions.
N: MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS
C: MICKEY
D: Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.
C: ALBRECHT
D: How do you ride that thing on a wet street?
C: ELLY
D: Talent. Hi.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Care for a hot dog?
C: ELLY
D: You buying?
C: ALBRECHT
D: I'm buying.
N: Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht. They`ve done this routine before.
C: ELLY
D: No onions though, okay?
C: ALBRECHT
D: No onions?
E: horror
C: ELLY
D: They make you fart.
N: Mickey laughs. Spots Elly a Coke.
C: MICKEY
D: What's goin' on, Elly?
C: ELLY
D: I went to see a friend of mine.
C: MICKEY
D: Well, how's your friend?
C: ELLY
D: She's still dead.
N: Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re: Elly's matter-of- factness.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)
N: Thunder KABOOMS o.s. The crow pecks the top of the stone again and a chip of granite flies off, bang! EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock. CLOSE-UP - THE CROW A dot of blood on its ebony beak. LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the stone towards the earth. Rain does not interfere. Lightning plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g. RESUME THE CROW as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain. CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock. CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot. This time we see cowboy boots, leather chaps. The foot taps. Waiting. MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER as lightning strikes. Just enough for us to see a figure in a long duster and a cowboy hat. RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE DRAVEN fills with blood. Blood continues groundward. NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched arm. This is the SKULL COWBOY. We glimpse the deathshead, beneath the brim of the cowboy hat. RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave. TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW shaking off rain. Watching intently. CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND Black gloved. It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting. RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE The turf stirs beneath the white rose. Magically, a slim white parts the earth to grasp the rose. SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own headstone. LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC Pale. Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in back. WHite shirt. A nothing tie. No shoes. Rain sluices mud from his upturned face. He looks to the sky. Lightning. ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree. Looks o.s. ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched on his arm like a hunting falcon. He releases it and it flies to the tree. ANGLE - ERIC Watching this. Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision. The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye. Eric looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.
C: ERIC
D: What the hell are you?
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Interested? Follow the crow.
N: NB. The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike charnal house whisper. Unsettling and hackle-raising. Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His eyes follow it. He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the Skull Cowboy is gone. LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW Taking wing in the rain, showing the way. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC alone in the cemetery. After a moments hesitation, he lurches off, following the crow.

S: EXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:
N: A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.
S: INT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT
N: A MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines. Past dead video and pinball devices. Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup, ashtray -- someone was just there. Then past a WOMAN, trussed with duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her darting eyes. COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak with pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy. And T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is prepping an incendiary. He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of arson cocktail to Skank.
C: T-BIRD
D: Uncle T-Bird's 100-proof accelerator. I squirt you with this, you could jump in the Detroit river and burn all the way to the bottom.
N: INSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works. Silver canisters, an LED timer, wires.
C: T-BIRD
D: You know, Lake Erie actually caught on fire once, from all the crap in it. Wish I coulda seen that.
E: CONT'D
N: He CLICKS a switch. PEEP. LED countdown blurs.
C: T-BIRD
D: We're ready to rock.
E: CONT'D
N: Skank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor. Picks it up. Looks through it for valuables.
C: SKANK
D: What about working girl?
N: INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.
C: T-BIRD
D: What about her?
C: SKANK
D: I say we leave her here to fry, man.
N: T-Bird looks casually at the woman. Smiles hideously.
C: T-BIRD
D: No. Let's take her with us.
N: ANGLE - THE WOMAN Her eyes bug in a terrified NO!
S: EXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT
N: As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.
S: INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
N: TB drives. One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally fast countdown). Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in the back seat.
C: TB
D: Skank, shut her the fuck up!
E: pissed off
N: SKank punches her and she sags. Then he looks forward.
C: SKANK
D: Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!
S: EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT
N: As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention. ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS Reacting, with a mouthful.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Goddammit.
N: Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.
C: MICKEY
D: Call it in?
N: Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Yeah, do it! Stay right there!
E: to Elly
N: HOLD ON MICKEY. He points at Albrecht's hot dog. Yecch.
C: MICKEY
D: You want I should save this for you?
E: yelling after
S: EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT
N: The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.
C: SKANK
D: Dump her, man, dump her!
E: O.S.
N: The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a war hoop from the guys inside. ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement. Aims at the departing car. Gives it up. Still too far away. Pedestrians in the way. ANGLE - THE WOMAN hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster. Duct tape stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth. With her as she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN Their eyes lock. Eric stiffens with his first FLASH. NB: Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature of things with which he makes physical contact. Hints and fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR. Puzzle pieces he must assemble. Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and accompanied by a degree of pain. It hurts to remember.
S: FLASH: INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE
N: The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices hideous, distorted echoes. A knife snaps open. We see the blade. Blood. Skank hits her, pow! and -- FLASH ENDS. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN An airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them. MATCH WITH: ANGLE - THE CROW perched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting. ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN She fades. He lets her drop away, horrified. And staggers back into the cover of the alley. Her blood is on his hands. ANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING Skidding in, spotting the woman. Kneeling to her.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Here now! You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me? I'm a police officer...
N: The woman is no longer in pain. Deathly calm now.
C: WOMAN
D: He touched me and it stopped. The pain.
C: ALBRECHT
D: What did you say?
C: WOMAN
D: I saw a ghost...
N: Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Oh no... don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now... shit!
N: HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police units screech up to assist.
S: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT
N: Eric in lurching flight, panting. Stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games. ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING) Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric. BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION") "CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see. Visually distinct and immediately identifiable. ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes. ANGLE - ERIC looking up at the crow. Disoriented. Doesn't understand. Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield from: ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and debris. ANGLE - WITH ERIC he reels back, crashes into a dumpster. Falls. ANGLE - THE CROW landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat boots in the trash. Flames. LOW ANGLE - ERIC The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt. He tears the shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact. Wipes his face with his shirt. Discards it. Stops, held by his discovery -- PUSH IN ON ERIC as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest. Almost a circle. Comically, he feels his back foe exit wounds. Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow. His glance at the bird is almost accusatory. ANGLE - THe CROW Inscrutable. We should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place. ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET bare, muddied, frozen. TILT to Eric. His gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash. He grabs them, pushes them onto his bare feet. His eyes catch the firelight. Distant o.s. SIRENS
C: ERIC
D: Fire. In the rain.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT
N: We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash. The BG music is hard, savage, primal: a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band rules. Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup trendazoids. We'll see more of this circus later. Right now the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this establishment since we are -- TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10 Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots. Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage. ND BLUR as people CROSS FRAME. GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal. His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor.: NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in just a minute. They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10. Ngo Nwa's gloved fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of Eric in the photo. As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- suspiciously -- to Nwa.
C: NGO NWA
D: He will see me... unannounced.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open. Without a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either side.
S: INT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE. Through a large window (mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible through automatic mini-blinds. A fly-vision bank of 12 TV monitors is hot with surveillance. LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable, almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy. At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny, perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry. The desktop is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned beneath an Artemide lamp. Lao rises and feigns servility. NB: The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in VIETNAMESE.
C: LAO
E: formal greeting
C: NWA
D: 
E: dismissiveness, contempt, then chastizing anger as:
N: Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.
C: LAO
E: phony assuagement
C: NWA
E: knows it's bullshit
N: Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control. Deep breath. He turns back to his "master." Nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but is somehow errant
C: NWA
E: respect is required
C: LAO
E: begrudging agreement
N: Lao sees the blade. An idea. He lifts it reverently, bears it the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth.
C: NGO NWA
E: why give me this?
N: Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade. It gleams. Hypnotic. Even Nwa has to admire it. Turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum. His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do anything untoward.
C: LAO
E: sinister punchline
N: Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's chest, pinning him to the door. It's over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes Nwa. Lao is much more than merely treacherous, he is extremely capable.
C: LAO
D: When I spoke of an offering, I didn't mean an offering to you.
E: in perfect English
S: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
N: Grange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both Bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the door OPENS. ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods affirmatively.
C: GRANGE
D: You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it?
N: Lao smiles indulgently. He wipes the blood from the blade on the jacket of his ex-lord. Lao now bows to no one.
S: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him. Up. He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal. Ouch. CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM Blood flows from the gash. He vises his fist shut. ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE Eye-to-eye with the crow. Opens his hand. CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, leaving another scar. ANGLE - ERIC Vising the rail. Speaks to the night. Almost a mantra.
C: ERIC
D: "My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all. And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall. I think he loves the lady night..." Am I alive? Am I dead? Something else? Something in between?
E: to crow
N: CLOSE-UP - THE CROW Inscrutable. No answer here. RESUME ERIC Almost bemused. Steadier. A hint of friendliness.
C: ERIC
D: Thanks for sharing that.
N: ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside. Menacing.
S: INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
N: A junkyard of loot and dusty discards. Junkie thievings and other people's stereos. Behind a wire-meshed security counter GIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene. He is pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt. Food on his shirt. JINGLE of doorbells. Gideon lowers his paper to reveal Skank and T-Bird on approach.
C: GIDEON
D: Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night, here they come. Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.
N: Skank riles
C: SKANK
D: Hey, blow me, fat boy!
N: Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.
C: GIDEON
D: Blow yourself, bigmouth.
C: T-BIRD
D: Whoa, hey, whoa. Business.
E: interposing hands up
N: He lifts a small carton onto the counter.
C: GIDEON
D: Whatcha got?
N: NEW ANGLE - COUNTER Transaction time. T-Bird passes items through the screen slot and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection.
C: T-BIRD
D: Coupla more rings... 24k.
C: GIDEON
D: 18k. Crap.
C: T-BIRD
D: ...necklace... pearls...
C: GIDEON
D: Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
C: T-BIRD
D: Leather purse...
N: He hands though the bag rested from the woman.
C: GIDEON
D: What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
E: doesn't matter
C: T-BIRD
D: Yeah, I know, fatso. Do us all a favor. Make Top Dollar smile.
C: SKANK
D: You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile.
N: Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up. He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT
N: Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on. Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.
C: ERIC
D: All right.
N: And he takes off on a run. Only to stumble and fall. But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving. He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and runs out of the frame. ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN. as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain. He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof. The next roof-top is a one-story jump down. Eric clears the jump with a WOOF of air. Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength. His next leap is more like a broad-jump. Athletic. FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW keeping airborne, keeping ahead. MOVING ANGLE - ERIC Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space... UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building. CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward. ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed. He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
C: ERIC
D: Gotcha.
N: He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge. As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat. UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL It's a looooooong way down. ANGLE - ALLEYWAY as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two. A beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped. PUSH IN as Eric rolls from facedown to his back. TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece. ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands. Frustrated and pissed off.
C: ERIC
D: Thanks.
N: CLOSE-UP - THE CROW Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience. It waits. RESUME ERIC
C: ERIC
D: Where're we going next -- the sewer?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
N: Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline. The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb. CLOSE-UP - THE CROW It just blinks at him.
S: INT. ABANDONED STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: as Eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist ANGLE - FOOT OF STAIRS Trash and detritus all around, clogging the arteries of the building, which is old, unoccupied, forsaken. The crow lights on a scarred banister knob. Eric's footsteps come down into frame. ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
T: which now sags, faded.
N: A sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that this is -- was -- a crime scene. Eric slows, stops, his hand on the banister. ANGLE - THE CROW as is wafts ahead of Eric, arriving at the door first. ANGLE ON ERIC, THE DOOR, THE CROW Eric has had enough.
C: ERIC
D: Are we finished yet?
N: CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND ON BANISTER sliding along, as he speaks, until it hits a cigarette burn. PUSH IN ON ERIC - TIGHT stiffening as he suffers his second -- FLASH: IMAGES and DIALOG are not linked. A rapidfire MONTAGE set in the loft, a year earlier (it is decorated for Halloween). The broken door. The stairwell is filled with cops and cop noise; lab guys bustle. Albrecht is there, making notes as a DETECTIVE steps over to him.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Victim's name is Shelly Webster. The guy who got tossed is, uh ...--
E: checks his notebook
N: Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister. FLASH ENDS. RESUME ERIC ON THE STAIRS. He sits down hard, hurting from the flash. His eyes seek the crow. He completes Albrecht's line:
C: ERIC
D: "Draven, Eric."
S: EXT. THE PIT - NIGHT
N: LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the entryway of the pit. MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she nears. ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY Luridly-lit. A grown-up's place. A burly BOUNCER appraises her, his tone jokey. He knows Elly.
C: BOUNCER
D: Hey! You got any ID?
C: ELLY
D: Very funny. Ha. Ha. Oh my, sides.
N: The Bouncer jerks a thumb. Go on in.
S: INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
N: A grungy sawdust-floored shot-and-beer joint packed tight with urban BURNOUTS rushing to drink their lives away. Hammering MUSIC and rude whorehouse lighting. Each predator straining to be badder than the next. TRACK THROUGH this maze at Elly's eye level until we reach DARLA, waitressing her heart out, the drug mileage on her obvious.
C: ELLY
D: Mom --?
C: DARLA
D: I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
C: ELLY
D: I lost my key.
E: a quick lie
N: Disgustedly -- goddamn kids -- Darla fishes up a key and slaps it into Elly's hand.
C: FUNBOY
D: Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
E: O.S.
C: DARLA
D: Out. Now. I gotta work.
E: to Elly
N: RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN.
S: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
N: As Eric shoves the door open from the outside. The lock, popped from the frame, spins on the wooden floor. The barrier tape whisps and dust roils. Dark, chilly, damp. A rat's nest of disuse. PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW as Eric enters. Glass blown out. Shards poking. Jagged. NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN He scans the loft. Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor. ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light. ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT He kneels. Extends his hand. The cat nears; likes Eric. CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND. as the cat makes contact. Sudden white jolt - a FLASH. FLASH: we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s. We see what he saw: Shelly, holding the cat. FLASH ENDS. UP ANGLE - ERIC Wincing. Recovering from the flash. He purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger... FLASH: A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight. Shelly and Eric, once upon a time. FLASH ENDS. REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way. CLOSE-UP - ERIC vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding.
C: ERIC
D: No! Don't look! No! No!
N: He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall. FLASH: Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz. He spins her and they collapse on the bed. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - ERIC slowly pulling his arm out of the wall.
C: ERIC
D: Stop it.
E: whispering
N: His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man. ANGLE - GABRIEL watching Eric. He hits with an o.s. THUD.
S: INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT
N: As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots.
C: FUNBOY
D: Let's have some fun.
E: O.S.
N: Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down. T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy. T-BIRD You first.
C: TIN-TIN
D: You're outta your fuckin' mind.
N: Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and T-Bird does likewise. Points to Skank.
C: T-BIRD
D: No. I'm not the lunatic. He is.
N: Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's face, cocking.
C: SKANK
D: Fuck you, T-Bird.
N: Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone. He makes a kissy face.
C: T-BIRD
D: I love you too, you madman.
N: They all crack up laughing like ax murderers. Skank drinks, Tin-Tin spot checks the satchell from Top Dollar's. Darla delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass.

N: He's awake. Pushes himself up. REVERSE ANGLE - THE CROW Is perched in a dead light fixture, monitoring Eric. ANGLE - ERIC ON FLOOR He's awake. Pushes himself up.

T-Bird instantly on top of her, rough. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - WITH ERIC as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window... where he cuts open his hand on jags of glass.

FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - ERIC AT THE WINDOW Reeling backward, same trajectory as in the Flash, but toward the floor, in SLO-MO. Overloaded. Blacking out.
T: AS ERIC FALLS - INTERCUT MONTAGE
N: A jumble of good/bad images from the loft: Tin-Tin embedding a page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife... Shelly's face as she lights a candle... a POPPING champagne cork... the echoing CANNONADE of the shots that killed Eric... Skank backhanding Shelly... Shelly blowing bubbles from a clawfoot tub full of suds... Eric catching Funboy's first slug high in the chest... NEW ANGLE of the glass in the window blowing out as T-Bird and Funboy through Eric through... ANGLE - ERIC'S REAL TIME FALL He plummets to BLACK OUT FRAME. THUMP. Out cold.

D: I hate this goddamn thing...
N: ANGLE - DARLA watching them from a distance as Tin exits.
S: INT. LOFT - FLOOR LEVEL - NIGHT
N: An enormous cockroach trundles past, large in FRAME. RACK to show Eric lying on floor b.g. as his eyes pop open. A flurry of dark motion as the crow flies past frame. ANGLE -- THE CROW -- Having snatched the bug in it's beak. Eats it. ANGLE - ERIC rising from the floor. Careful. Stealthy. Watches his fireplace.
C: ERIC
D: We have company.
N: ANGLE ON FIREPLACE Huge. Marble. COld. Eric's paper mache masks of Comedy and Tragedy still hang there. The Skull Cowboy steps out of the dark and into the vague blue light. Shadowy as ever.

E: beat
C: ERIC
D: Shelly?
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Miss her?
C: ERIC
D: Yes.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
N: The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife(like Tin- Tin's). Eric's gaze follow it closely.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: You must use your eyes.
E: CONT'D
N: He points to the crow. ANGLE - THE COMING KNIFE - ("CROWVISION") Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow. TIGHT ON ERIC As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the bird's eyes. He rolls. ON THE CROW It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall. Eric's ROLL finishes him up nearby.
C: ERIC
D: Goddammit.
N: He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH. FLASH: Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder. FLASH ENDS. RESUME ERIC vising his head with his hands, in pain. Too much pain.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Get it?
C: ERIC
D: Leave me alone -- !
N: He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Do something about it. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.
E: contempt
N: A horrible beat between them. The Eric runs full tilt across the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping. ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY as close to surprise as he gets. Steps out to watch as -- ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC FLIES feet first out into space. CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps!
S: EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT
N: High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose stray shards that fall toward frame. He swings into an upside- down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip. CLOSE-UP - ERIC Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension. Hold. Then he relaxes, and swings back inside.
S: INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT
N: He arches, flips, to land on his feet. The Skull Cowboy is gone. No knife either. The crow watches. O.S. "meow". ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT
C: ERIC
D: I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet.
N: He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this time -- and returns to the window. Feeling safer.
C: ERIC
D: The last time we saw each other, I didn't do so well. Huh, Gabriel?
E: CONT'D holds cat up
N: He moves to the fireplace. With his free hand, lifts the Tragedy mask off its hook. Puzzles it, fact-to-mask.
C: ERIC
D: I bet you need some cat food... right?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING:
N: Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip. An occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized by the city. Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION")
N: Two men around a trashcan fire. We should recognize Tin-Tin by his black leather trench coat. A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick," RAZZLES b.g.
S: EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT
N: As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen. Slows. Stops. And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.
S: EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT
N: He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel. FOLLOW as he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept. Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Three hundred and your a gunslinger.
N: HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO As the crow is still watching, yet perched. A brief shove-and-standoff. The gun deal has gone bad.
C: RATSO
D: Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good for the money, man, I promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don't --
E: choking scream
N: Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Ratty -- shut the fuck up.
N: Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him. Ratso goes slack, deader'n hell. Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.
C: ERIC
D: Another satisfied customer?
E: O.S.
N: TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN galvanized by the surprise voice. He automatically draw a fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside the coat. Can't yet track the source of the voice.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Who the hell is that? Come on out man, I won't hurt you.
E: beat, venomous
N: ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan. Wearing a long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.
C: ERIC
D: Hello, Tin-Tin.
N: ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO) trying to process what he sees. And cover. And buy time.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Little early from trick-or-treat, homie. This dick trying to bushwack me.
E: re: Ratso
C: ERIC
D: Murderer.
N: Tin-Tin blows out a breath. No bluff. Time to kill again.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Guess you got that goddamn right.
N: He shrugs. The shrug becomes the launch of a knife. TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from his nose. It CLATTERS. Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.
C: ERIC
D: Try harder. Try again.
N: SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN as Tin-TIn throws another knife. Eric closing in. He claps hand together, immobilizing the next knife. Opens his hands, almost an "oops" gesture. Keeps on coming. ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN As they meet. Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse. Eric blocks it and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.
C: ERIC
D: A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a loft. You helped to murder them.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Last Halloween, eh? Yeah... Yeah, I remember. I fucked her too, I think.
E: beat
C: ERIC
D: You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
E: rage
C: TIN-TIN
D: Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
N: They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense. Eric peels off the Tragedy mask.
C: ERIC
D: I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
C: TIN-TIN
D: I don't know you...
N: But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him. Fear. Sweat. For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.
C: TIN-TIN
D: Holy shit... you're dead, man...
E: CONT'D
N: EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC
C: ERIC
D: Victims. Aren't we all.
S: INT. LOFT - NIGHT

An open can of cat food CLANKS down big in f.g. as Eric walks b.g. obviously wearing Tin-Tin's trenchcoat. Gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.
S: INT. LOFT, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Shelly's vanity. Dusty, disused. The mirror spiderwebbed with cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame. Eric is seated, his image crazily split into many. He pulls on a long- sleeved, tight-knit, black shirt. WIDEN ANGLE to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle stubs. Placed all around. Ceremonial and weird. CLOSE-UP - ERIC

N: In the mirror, multi Eric's. He touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another -- FLASH: Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric (O.S.) says "Boo". She cracks an eye open.

C: SHELLY
D: I think red's my color, don't you?
N: FLASH ENDS. RESUME ERIC wincing. He drops the lipstick on the floor. Grabs a hairbrush. FLASH: Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall, trailing broken glass. FLASH ENDS. NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY Later. He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks. Shaky. FLASH: Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest. 1-2-3-4. FLASH ENDS. RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet. He looks at his own reflection. In one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the Skull Cowboy. Just one.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Glad to see you're finally with the program.
C: ERIC
D: Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all.
N: The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there. Eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now.
C: ERIC
D: Forget this.
N: He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave white. ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity. Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped. CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND as it glides down to pick up the lipstick. CONTACT, and -- FLASH: Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both corners of his mouth, a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face.
C: FLASH ENDS.
D: RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT
C: ERIC
D: She always red red was her color.
N: EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow harlequin smile.
S: EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT
N: A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.
S: EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT
N: CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS crossing the floor. Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework. CLOSE-UP - VANITY Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there. He moves off. CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose. Thunder rumbles long o.s. ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE The storm boils. Eric framed in broken window. CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW Eric all in black, Firm-wrapped. Tight-wired. The trenchcoat flutters, cloak-like. His shadowy face framed by the upturned collar, his hair punkish and spiky. SIDE ANGLE - ERIC as he moves forward in the light. The crow lights on his shoulder.
C: ERIC
D: All right, bad guys...
N: FRONT VIEW - ERIC Full crow regalia. Face makeup streamlined. Eric's eyes flash.

N: ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him. Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Sure it coulda. Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
C: TORRES
D: You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
C: ALBRECHT
D: This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
C: TORRES
D: Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
C: ALBRECHT
D: He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
C: TORRES
D: Was.
C: ALBRECHT
D: This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new.
E: sigh
N: Albrecht lights a fresh smoke. Torres waves the smoke away.
C: TORRES
D: And you're gonna tell me who.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Who ever made that.
N: Albrecht points. CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin. A crow silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.
C: TORRES
D: What in the hell... do you call that?
C: ALBRECHT
D: I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.
S: INT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
N: CLOSE-UP of Gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency. Some scratchy 1920's TUNE plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast from another time and place. TIGHTER ANGLE - GIDEON looking up at a metallic SOUND, o.s. Irritated.
C: GIDEON
D: Piss off, we're closed.
N: As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door.

D: Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn.

C: GIDEON
D: HEY!!
E: CONT'D
N: And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door, gun up. Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass. He loses the pistol. Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him. He disclaims, thespian.
C: ERIC
D: "Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door." You heard me rapping, right?
E: pause
N: LOW ANGLE - GIDEON ON THE FLOOR reacting to Eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.
C: GIDEON
D: Oh, bullshit! You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door!
N: During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed. Now he flings Gideon across the room. Gideon crashes into the counter cage. As Eric advances on him:
C: ERIC
D: I'm looking for something in an engagement ring. Gold.
N: As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.
C: GIDEON
D: You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains!
N: And he tries to nail Eric with the knife. NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS No Eric behind him. TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage above Gideon. Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head. Drops down like a spider and collects the knife.
C: ERIC
D: I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... "T-Bird"?
N: IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red.
C: ERIC
D: Cute nickname, don't you think?
E: CONT'D

D: I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
E: gasping
C: ERIC
D: Wrong answer.
N: Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top. Gideon howls!
C: GIDEON
D: All's I got is in a box! Behind the counter!
N: Eric jumps through the cage door. Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized. ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER scans the shelves. Rows of boxed ammo. Kerosene tins. A shotgun. Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios. And the ring box. CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND. Dozens of gold rings. Eric's fingers sift through them. TIGHTER ON ERIC He brings each ring to his face. INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o.s.
C: ERIC
D: No... no... no... no...
N: He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder. Until: CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light -- FLASH: Shelly's face. A perfect vision... FLASH ENDS. RESUMING ERIC He closes his fist tightly around the ring. A moment of decision. Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand. It goes spinning across the countertop. Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.
C: ERIC
D: Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath. You have one chance to live.
C: GIDEON
D: No fucking way. He'll kill me.
C: ERIC
D: Who would waste time killing you... besides me?
N: Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.
C: GIDEON
D: Top Dollar.
E: cowed
C: ERIC
D: Another jolly nickname?
C: GIDEON
D: You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
C: ERIC
D: T-Bird?
C: GIDEON
D: Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top Dollar.
C: ERIC
D: A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
N: Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand. Blows just miss Gideon's head. Soon he's cowering. LOW ANGLE - ERIC Looking down at Gideon in revulsion.
C: ERIC
D: You feed off the living.
N: SMASH! as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon. Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely. As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables. He reaches for it. ON GIDEON As he summons some last minute budget bravery.
C: GIDEON
D: You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass! Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch!
N: RESUME ERIC - FRAMED IN DOORWAY The guitar now bowslung across his back, the shotgun levelled at Gideon's position.
C: ERIC
D: One chance to live. Take it.
N: MOVE IN TIGHT ON GIDEON as he realizes what Eric means. Hauls ass and bangs through the rear door with a bleat of terror. ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC IN DOOR as he cuts loose with the shotgun.
S: EXT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

Eric is the black eye of the fireball. LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC lit by flames and residual explosions. He hurls the shotgun into the inferno. Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus from his own clothes.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Don't move! I said don't move.
E: O.S.
N: NEW ANGLE - ERIC as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn. Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.
C: ERIC
D: I thought the police always said "freeze:.
N: Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of Gideon's.
C: ALBRECHT
D: I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White. You're under arrest; I don't care what else is wrong with you! You move and you're dead.
N: Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht. Palms up. A gesture of submission. Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.
C: ERIC
D: And I say I'm dead... and I move.
C: ALBRECHT
D: No further. I'm serious.
N: Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.
C: ERIC
D: Then shoot, if you will.
N: TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT He gives it up. Can't shoot. This is too weird for him.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
N: NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT
C: ERIC
D: You must listen carefully: the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
E: meaningfully
N: Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed gun. B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You wanna run that back for me one time?
N: SIRENS near, o.s. Eric listens to them, to the night.
C: ERIC
D: Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass."

D: Fucking A, my friend.
C: ERIC
D: The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht.
E: beat

C: ALBRECHT
D: Watch it...
N: Eric slices open his palm. Blood flows. To his fingertips. NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall... then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht. CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up. TIGHT ON ALBRECHT and the silhouette. Mouth hangs.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You're the one who did Tin-Tin...
N: PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame. Albrecht does a quick 180. No Eric. Flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face.

Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that admits T-Bird to the room. TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by Showtime's exterior neon. This is TOP DOLLAR.

N: NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the bird's position, the guitar bowslung.

C: DARLA
D: Fun -- look at that guy...
C: FUNBOY

D: How the hell did you do that?
C: ERIC
D: Magic.
N: Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.
C: FUNBOY
D: Either die or do a solo.
N: Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing. He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough. He turns his attention back to Funboy. But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.
C: ERIC
D: Neither.
C: FUNBOY
D: Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
N: Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun. Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly.

E: whack! whack! whack!
N: ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing. Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.
C: FUNBOY
D: Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left.
N: In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand. Twists to the crunching of bones. Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh. Funboy fall back across the bed.
C: FUNBOY
D: Owwwaaaa -- fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!
C: ERIC
D: Does it hurt?
C: FUNBOY
D: Does it hurt?! You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
N: Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted.
C: ERIC
D: I have some pain killer right here.
N: And he fills the syringe all the way. ANGLE ON FUNBOY as he begins to see the light. He can't get away. Growing terror.
C: FUNBOY
D: No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
C: ERIC
D: Your pain ends now.
N: And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose. Funboy begins to convulse. Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent. Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized. On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes. The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

C: ERIC
D: Shut up.
C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Maybe I was wrong about you.
N: The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed. All we get is a little shake of his skull-head. Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her. She's really confused. She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.
C: ERIC
D: Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you.
N: She's stunned, utterly speechless. All she can do is look in Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.
C: ERIC
D: Go. Now.
N: Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without a glance back at Funboy. Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with Funboy. The Skull Cowboy has vanished. PUSH IN. Grimly, Eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

N: EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp. More soft GUITAR strokes as CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged cables to: ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up streaked by the night's work. His fingering is unsure and he tries the tune again. INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong around Eric's neck. Like an amulet. ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING He's got it right this time. Strong, sure CHORDS. Passionate. We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery. He holds a stroke, letting it ring. Sun rises behind him.
C: IRATE VOICE
D: Hey, shut the fuck up!
E: O.S.
N: Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left. Funny.
S: EXT. MAXI-DOGS - DAY
N: Later. Elly is seated on a stool.. Mickey gives her a chili dog.
C: MICKEY
D: Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
C: ELLY
D: Mom tried to cook.
C: MICKEY
D: Oh.
C: CUSTOMER
D: Hey, Mickey, I need a special with everything. No sawdust.
E: O.S.
C: MICKEY
D: Everyone's a comedian. Enjoy.
E: to Elly
N: Mickey EXITS FRAME.
C: GRANGE
D: You're Elly, right? I know your mom.
E: O.S.
N: Elly turns. Grange sits next to her. Lao's mirrored-windowed car is parked across the street, b.g.
C: ELLY
D: A lot of people "know" my mom.
N: Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.
C: GRANGE
D: I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
C: ELLY
D: I don't know you.
C: GRANGE
D: I'd like to get in touch with him.
E: easily
N: Elly sizes Grange up.
C: ELLY

C: GRANGE
D: I'm looking for a good guitar man.
C: ELLY
D: Right.
N: Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to Mickey.

E: CONT'D cuts him some slack
C: GRANGE
D: I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
S: INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY
N: No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode. He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room. On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe. FLASH: Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown. PUSH IN TIGHT as she is embraced by a nude Eric. He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place. FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the floor... FLASH ENDS. LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring. Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up. ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's. FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC as he drops the dress. Absorbing the pain and memories. ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill. He grasps it with both hands. FLASH: A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each moving along the other's body. Curves and dips and contours. But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW His GAZE similarly FIXED. Bringing his hands away and clapping them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like Kung Fu prep. When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before him on the sill.
C: ERIC
D: That's better.
N: He wipes his torso down with a towel.
C: ERIC
D: It's almost time.
E: CONT'D
N: He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it. We can HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness. Closes it into a powerful fist.
S: INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT
N: TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table. He has a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter.
C: SKANK
D: Top, I made the sumbitch! Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo!
N: WIDE ANGLE to include all present: Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry. Top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy.
C: LAO
D: Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: "Our" Crow...?
C: LAO
D: Come now. You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
E: mockingly
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: The night is young.
E: pissed off
C: SKANK
D: The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car!
E: hot
N: Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao. He rises and goes to the window. Neon glow. Top sees something outside, below, that really torques him off.
S: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHOWTIME - NIGHT (TOP'S POV)
N: A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the condemned building right across the street.
S: INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT

E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT
N: As Top turns from the window, PULL BACK to incorporate the chunky shadows where the lights don't fall. Eric is there, perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.
S: INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT
N: LAO AT TABLE -- angered by this macho horseshit, annoyed at his time being frittered.
C: LAO
D: I am sitting over here.
N: He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent. Top looks sheepish.
C: LAO
D: Do you think this childish machismo impresses me? When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time, one building at a time. Whole lives erased. A way of life, polluted. Today, no one forces me to move. I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time, one building at a time.
E: CONT'D regains composure
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean?
C: LAO
D: Your comprehension is not required. Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
N: Top rallies to this.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Whatever you say, I can do.
N: Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's guarantee.
C: LAO
D: That's reassuring.
N: CLOSE-UP - TOP'S SHELL CASING IN ERIC'S HAND from the ledge. Endstamp is for a .45 caliber. ANGLE - ERIC ON LEDGE He sniffs the cartridge. We can see Funboy's cartridge in his hair. He fists the shell casing tightly. ANGLE - DOWN-TABLE, AT SKANK Jittery, grabbing a clip for his own automatic.
C: SKANK
D: What was that -- !?
N: It wasn't anything. Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on his gun. Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Too many poppers, Skank. Relax. Heel.
N: ANGLE - WINDOW BEHIND TOP DOLLAR A black blur as Eric arches through, spilling Top. ANGLE - MEN SEATED AT TABLE Eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from Skank's hand. All react. Weapons out. CLOSE-UP - SKANK'S GUN spinning mid-air to land in Eric's open hand! GENERAL ANGLE - BIG MOBY SHOOTOUT - (VARIOUS) Death cleans house. Standing on the table, Eric fires rearward under his own arm to clip Lao Guard #1. He pivots, shooting, and takes out Lao Guard #2 -- who slams backward into the steel door as it being opened by the Sentry outside. Crash! The door is shut again. ANGLE - GRANGE AND LAO Grange sprays the room with a Calico 950 Auto, shoving Lao beneath the table for cover. ANGLE - ERIC Bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him. Skank hits the deck again. Eric fires and Lao Guard #1 sucks three hits across the chest, firing convulsively against the ceiling, blowing the lights. ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR springing up from behind table. But Eric is gone from the field of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end. ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE making for the door, Grange as shield. Lao draws a pistol. The door opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way. ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out. Door SLAM o.s. Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: You want my attention, man you got it.
E: awed but maintained
N: ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same.
C: SKANK
D: It's him, Top! He dusted T-Bird!
N: ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE
C: ERIC
D: You have to be SKank. One moment.
E: to Top Dollar
N: As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair.
C: ERIC
D: Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down.
N: Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window! Skank howls all the way down.
S: EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT
N: Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg and MJ. Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the flashbar and windshield. MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.
C: MJ
D: OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!
N: ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
C: ALBRECHT
D: Jesus Christ...

S: INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT
N: Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke.
C: ERIC
D: Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
C: ERIC
D: Do you know what you destroyed?
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Take the dope, too.
N: Eric backhands Top into the wall. Gets in his face, seething.
C: ERIC
D: A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: That's ancient history.
C: ERIC
D: It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed?
N: Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: Who gives a fuck! I'm a businessman. You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
C: ERIC
D: You don't even remember...
C: TOP DOLLAR
D: I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy... end of story.
C: ERIC
D: Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you.
N: And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall. Nose-to-nose. FLASH: Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp. Eric winces, hard, and -- FLASH: Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird. Wild. FLASH ENDS. ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC Viciously close, more intimate and lethal than anything.
C: ERIC
D: You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more.
N: This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good. FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light. Bloody, bruised and broken (from Albrecht;s memory) FLASH ENDS. CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR arching, stiffening in pain. CLOSE-UP - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC
C: ERIC
D: All of her pain, Top. Thirty hours. All at once...

E: CONT'D
N: FLASH: Rapidfire CLOSE-UPS. A jagged compound fracture, jutting, Shelly's eye, blood-red sclera, purpled and sunken. Her scraped-raw hand clawing at air. Icebox lighting. A TIGHT SHOT of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee... TWO-SHOT - RESUMING ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR. as Top sags in Eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide-staring dead eyes. Eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.
C: ERIC
D: I didn't think you could handle it either.
N: O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door. Eric turns. ANGLE - STEEL DOOR as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power-ram. All weapons snap up to bear on Eric.
C: LEAD SWAT
D: That's all she wrote, Bozo! You stand down now, and that's an order!
N: ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open fire on command. Bullets tear the room to pieces.
C: LEAD SWAT
D: The fire escape's covered.
S: EXT. SHOWTIME - FRONT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
N: Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing him. Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork. Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof. ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE Eric somersaults over. Bullets chip brick in his wake. STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF. Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant shadow figure above. Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.

COPS right behind him on the roof as well. WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE. and finds a void waiting there. No connecting building. ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC staying ahead of the search light.

E: CONT'D
N: Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch.
C: ERIC

E: sees Eric's condition
C: ERIC
D: It's only a flesh wound.
C: ALBRECHT
D: It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
N: Eric sits up as the car gains distance. Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth. Takes his single puff.
C: ERIC
D: You shouldn't smoke these.
N: He pitches the smoke out the open car window.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Great. Litterbug of the Living Dead.
N: Eric turns back to Albrecht.
C: ERIC
D: I'm finished.
N: Eric shoots him a doubtful look.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY
N: High blue sky. It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.
S: INT. LAO'S CLUB OFFICE - DAY
N: The TV flybank pulses with videotaped images of Club Trash's of various performers -- including Diabolique. On several screens, one-by-one, various images of a guitar-playing Eric Draven FREEZE-FRAME as we PULL BACK to the desk. Lao has the 8x10 from the corridor gallery. He places it within eyeshot and resumes work on the desk BELOW FRAME; we can't see it yet, among other scattered research and inconcubula. ANGLE - GRANGE Entering and crossing to the desk. As he comes up to the desk, he DRAWS BACK.

E: calmly
N: NEW ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE Revealing Lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in his hands. The killing blade is nearby.

C: LAO
D: Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
E: beat
N: Grange makes a face. Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.
C: GRANGE
D: Give me a break. That guy's a wacko...
C: LAO
D: I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
C: GRANGE
D: Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
N: Lao chuckles indulgently.
C: LAO
D: Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
C: GRANGE
D: Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
C: LAO
D: Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.
C: GRANGE
D: Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.
C: LAO
D: To the contrary...
N: ZZLIP! Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body. He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes like a dark pimento. LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT. Off Grange's stunned expression.
C: LAO
D: ...all the dying tonight will be done by the former Eric Draven.
E: CONT'D
N: Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all.
C: LAO
D: Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead. When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
E: CONT'D
C: GRANGE
D: Kill a dead guy?
N: Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it. Pleased.
C: LAO
D: Truly kill him. So I may crush his skull and smoke it.
N: Lao SHRUGS. Grange can handle it.
C: LAO
D: Let it suffice that I need him... and to get to him, we'll need his little friend.
E: CONT'D
N: Finally, an assignment Grange can comfortable understand.
S: INT. LOFT - DAY

E: upset
C: ERIC
D: Elly...
N: He draws her close. Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.
C: ERIC
D: Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason. Sometimes that's really tough. I cry. But if the people we love are gone, we keep them --
E: CONT'D
N: He taps Elly's temple, then his won.
C: ERIC

D: I remember him! Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
C: ERIC
D: I think he's yours, now.
N: The cat seems to like that idea. Elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'" ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and creased. He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to Elly.

C: ERIC
D: Shelly would've wanted you to have it. This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...

S: EXT. LOFT BUILDING ROOFTOP - SUNSET
N: Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset. Eric plays the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key. Where before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and heartbreaking. Definitive. Pain replaced by strength and a sense of homecoming. As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose. He's finished here. ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.

ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning. ANGLE - ERIC WALKING A fire engine races past on the street. He steps out in its wake and crosses over to -- MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY waiting for him as he crosses to the fence. Beyond the fence, in the distance, the church looms.

C: SKULL COWBOY
D: Very well, it's your ass.
N: And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully. ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT) As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to disassemble him. The fire in his eye sockets goes out. His hat flies off an is pulverized by the wind. The garments begin to disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in mid-air. ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected development. A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face and transmutes to dust! RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT) Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass mentor CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's heart would have been. TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too, renders down to nothingness, leaving a vague green glow that dies. And as he looks to the sky -- UP ANGLE - THE CROW flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder. Eric is astonished.
C: ERIC
D: But why are you still here?
N: CLOSE-UP - THE CROW No answer in the crow's eyes. RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC That's good enough for Eric. He marches to the double doors and shoves them back.
S: INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT
N: The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the disused Gothic dark. Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds. A giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static. LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION") Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places. ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME Onscreen: Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron ring bolted to a flagstone wall. Could be anywhere inside the church.

E: CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED
N: Grange sights his weapon. CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER Bluring as Grange resights. Eric is not the target. Blur FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of a giant stained glass window. NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots. ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in some pastoral religious presentation. TINKLE of glass. ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness.

C: GRANGE
D: Move in, guys.
E: into headset
N: HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle. Both wield calico's and one bears a sword. CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit. Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.
C: LAO
D: I wish to possess what you have now.

D: I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
C: LAO
D: I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ?

ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to breathe. Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric.
C: LAO
D: Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
C: ERIC
D: You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
E: beat, gasping
C: LAO
D: I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
C: LAO
D: Time for you to die for me. Funny, how the dead can still bleed. How they need air.
E: CONT'D beat
N: Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade. To Grange:
C: LAO
D: Break its neck.
E: CONT'D
N: ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on the bird. Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through the hole.
S: EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT
N: Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to himself.
C: ALBRECHT

N: A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under. CUTS LOOSE on full auto into the Madonna on the window.
S: INT. CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT
N: As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from behind, DROPPING the crow. The bird hits the ground, flapping weakly. LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos, RETURNING FIRE.
S: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
N: Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily destroyed all around his position. Chunks of the window continue to disintegrate.
S: INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT)
N: Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, screaming.
C: LAO
D: I said no shooting!
N: Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs. The sanctuary comes apart around Lao. He RETREATS to the alter and EXITS whence he came. TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there. Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP. TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire. INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload. Guard changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips. ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW -- Guard #4 slides. Sits up with his gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword. ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW firing now with a gun in each hand. RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire, but not before he puts a round through Eric. Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet. RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol. His machine gun jams, he fights to get the clip. ANGLE - GUARD #3 -- reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht dead-bang in the open by the window. MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC -- A complex leap with the sword flashing. He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up. CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 -- screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S. TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of something AIRBORNE toward him. CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating strike. ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 -- to REVEAL Eric in the background. Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword. WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn apart by gunfire. Hazy smoke. Two dead guys. And Eric.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You sorta looked like you might need my help.
C: ERIC
D: This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You're welcome.
C: ERIC
D: Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
C: ALBRECHT
D: The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more.
N: Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who pursues Eric to:
S: INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - TO BELL TOWER - NIGHT
N: The crow FLAPS UPWARD through the void. Eric grabs the thick bellrope, testing it. A final look to Albrecht.
C: ERIC
D: Don't interfere.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You're bleeding, man. You can't make it.
N: Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht. ON ALBRECHT Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast.. Grumbles.
C: ALBRECHT
D: You won't mind if I just take the stairs, then, smartass...
N: He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the steps. ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE -- A weird perspective of speed climb. Zip! All the way to the top.
S: EXT - CHURCH ROOF - NIGHT
N: Slanted, shingled, slippery, dark. Lightning deep in the turbid clouds. The crow circles as Eric RISES INTO FRAME.
C: ERIC
D: Here I am.
N: DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD (large, Victorian, lance-like) at the far end of the roof from the bell tower. SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it. Elly flinches at the strike.

S: INT. BELLTOWER SPIRAL STAIRS - RESUMING ALBRECHT
N: He stops his ascent to light a cigarette.
C: ALBRECHT
D: I ain't cut out for this superhero shit.
S: EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT
N: Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing lightning rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the roof, his blade brandished. CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but weaponless. He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED and RUNNING along the precarious peak. Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head. ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the roof. Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts. The steel RINGS. Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick that DUMPS Lao. Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling. Distantly, Lao similarly saves himself. NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward the peak. Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning rod and tries to wrest it loose. SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still blue-hot. MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod. Lao closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow. The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE. ANGLE -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC as he dodges Lao by using the lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off the roof. With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs on to Eric. UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising the sword.
C: LAO
D: Face me!
N: Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses. When he looks up, Lao is gone. ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last. Looks around, finally spots Eric below and to the left. YELLS, serio-comic.
C: ALBRECHT
D: Is he dead yet?
N: INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's gun quickly. ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.
C: LAO
D: No. You are.
N: He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times. CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter. Shock. INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope, trailing sparks, snuffing out. ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the night above him. ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.

D: You've caused another death, Mister Draven! The girl will die as well -- because of you!
N: ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.
C: ELLY
D: You go to hell, you pervert!
N: RESUME ERIC Rage over the loss of Albrecht. He RISES, hurting but mad as hell. GLARES UP toward Lao.
C: ERIC
D: And how many lives have you destroyed?
C: LAO
D: I took yours from you. Your little girlfriend? I took hers, too. Your meaningless, petty life? I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose. You're no avenger. You're mine.
N: PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC. Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.
C: ERIC
D: You're right, I'm not an avenger. Not any more.
E: to himself
N: As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY. HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION") SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes. ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING! CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws. Pecking out Lao's eyes. WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G. RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him. Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS down the roof - toward Eric. SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall, fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose. Fury.
C: ERIC
D: Time for a sacrifice.
N: Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the eyes used to be. He smiles gruesomely.
C: LAO
D: I don't need eyes to take what I want from you.
N: He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's back! ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his sternum. Tight grimace. A lot of pain.
C: ERIC
D: Can you fly?
N: He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM TIGHT. MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and INTO Lao. Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE, the killing blade still embedded in him! WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's position. Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress. Sees the blade in his own chest. CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen. RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric. He PLUMMETS off the roof edge. ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF -- He slows, stopping when Elly is in frame. He clutches his own chest. Regards his own shaking hand, drenched in his won blood. Glazed. ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying to get to Eric. She flails and cries out.
C: ELLY
D: Don't let me fall!
N: CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)
N: A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly). Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves. Eric's pace is slow, crippled, limping. They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal the flowers there. Eric is bloody and out of it. She helps him walk.
C: ELLY
D: Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
C: ERIC
D: In a better place. I hope.
C: ELLY
D: You're not gonna come back, are you?
N: Eric's response is halting and uncertain. But he tries to give her hope. He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds it up to her.
C: ERIC
D: I don't know if I can. But you have this... and you know where to come.
C: ELLY
D: You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave? Euww.
N: Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries. He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss her on the forehead.
C: ERIC
D: For you, I'll try. Promise.
N: MOVE WITH ERIC Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never going to make it the few yards back to his own grave. So close. His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus. One groping hand tries to drag him further.
C: ERIC
D: Leave me now.
N: ANGLE - ELLY Tears on her face. She can't watch this. She TURNS and drops the flowers on Shelly's grave. ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE Still too far away to matter. RESUME ERIC ON GROUND He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand. No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward. ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve. She turns toward Eric's grave. Then, surprised, she looks close. ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE Eric is gone. The white rose lies neatly on the top of the undisturbed earth there. HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard. LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground -- She walks OFF. HOLD the rose.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)
N: A grey day but no rain. Elly stands wistfully by the window, her doll on standby. The apartment is in order and perhaps we notice a few new items. Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is sprawled on a chair, licking himself. Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME B.G. Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done. Her manner is hectic but natural.
C: DARLA

D: It can't rain all the time.
N: Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door. Elly OPENS her hand to consider the ring. She looks back out the window -- ANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE Elly is looking right at it. Same crow. We're positive. So is Elly. It TAKES WING and flies away.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
N: An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water. PUSH IN on the crow. Watching. Waiting.
