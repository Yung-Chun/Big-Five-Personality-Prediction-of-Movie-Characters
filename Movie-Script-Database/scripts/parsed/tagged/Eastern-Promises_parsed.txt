S: EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING
N: It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional barber's shop called Ozim's.
S: INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING
N: The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk) is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA). Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands. Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters. Soyka speaks with a Russian accent.
C: OZIM
D: Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says - `but Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas! We're Islam!
C: SOYKA
D: Oi, how much are you taking off?
C: OZIM
D: Christmas! So I said to him... alisverise cimac. The kid's sixteen...
N: Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

C: OZIM
D: This is him. The kid I'm talking about.
N: Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror. Soyka nods at Ekrem in the mirror.
C: SOYKA
D: He looks OK to me... how you doin' Ekrem?
N: Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted...
C: OZIM
D: He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. Here, look... Ekrem, take this...
N: Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified.
C: EKREM
D: Ozim... memnum etmek.
C: OZIM
D: We had a deal now he's backing out.
C: SOYKA
D: Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It's obviously a psychological thing...
E: laughing
C: OZIM
D: Take it Ekrem.
C: SOYKA
D: Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.
C: OZIM
D: This is the kid who walks around like Al Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca.
C: SOYKA
D: What?
E: startled
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 3. Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream bubbles in the blood.
S: EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT
N: We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA) hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop. She is barefoot.
S: INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT
N: The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER. Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance.
C: TATIANA
D: Please... I have...
E: Russian accent
C: CHEMIST
D: For methadone I need to see paper prescription.
N: The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then faints onto the floor.
S: INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT
N: We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.
C: ANNA
D: Did you get a name?
C: PARAMEDIC
D: No.
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 4.
T: CUT TO
S: INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT
N: A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse. Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double speed. We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks. A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table.... NURSE 1 Her stats are very poor, very poor. Baby's very distressed. Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag. We see a business card from a restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.
C: JUNIOR DOCTOR
D: Shoulder distocia, I think. Stuck on the pubic bone.

C: JUNIOR DOCTOR
D: Anna, I'm trying to rotate the shoulder medially... shit...
N: THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby. The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters... WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 5. NURSE 1 Baby stats sixty-eight and in free fall. NURSE 2 I'm not getting a pulse. Heartbeats. Doctor Aziz joins the junior doctor, who looks out of his depth.

C: ANNA
D: We need to get the baby out now.
E: softly
N: Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...
C: AZIZ
D: OK, let's go.
N: All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.
C: TATIANA
D: My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life.
E: V.O.
N: We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.
C: ANNA
D: You had a girl.
E: whispers
N: A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 6.

D: Oh, don't be ridiculous.
N: He grins.
C: AZIZ

C: HELEN
D: It's the chicken. The smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him.
E: pause
C: ANNA
D: You should have done beef, then.
N: They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion.
C: HELEN
D: It wouldn't be Christmas without tears in the gravy, would it.
N: We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living room (UNCLE STEPAN).

D: I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward.
C: STEPAN
D: Do you always rob the bodies of the dead?
C: ANNA
D: Of course, we all do it. It's one of the perks of working in a hospital.
E: suppressed, familiar anger
N: Stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing. Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts which she places on the table. Pause. Stepan looks pointedly at Helen.
C: STEPAN
D: Did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead?
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 10.
C: ANNA
D: Stepan, is there an address?

C: HELEN

E: she straightens the table cloth
C: STEPAN
D: You should put this in her coffin, Anna. Bury her secrets with her bodies.
C: ANNA
D: Body. Singular.
N: Stepan leaves in a huff. Anna picks up the diary and begins to study it. She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card between the pages.
C: ANNA
D: How long will dinner be?
E: CONT'D
N: Helen looks at Anna, suspecting an attempt to escape.
S: EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY
N: Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana in V.O.
C: TATIANA

E: V.O.
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 11. Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively and recently finished.

E: V.O. CONT'D
N: As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
N: The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain. Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.
C: KIRILL
D: So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here.
N: He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.
C: KIRILL
D: Then I'll think of an excuse and we can get away.
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: I'll think of an excuse. Your excuses are like fucking fairy tales.
N: Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys. The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response. Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of the restaurant.
C: KIRILL
D: Who the fuck's that?
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 12. They both see Anna removing her crash helmet and shaking out her hair. She walks towards the front door.

E: in Russian
C: KIRILL
D: You're so... fucking unbelievably disrespectful.
E: grinning
N: Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
T: fades. We sense jealousy.
C: KIRILL
D: Hey, you've got work to do. Go...
E: CONT'D
N: Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car. Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
N: As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel, dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon.
C: SEMYON
D: We are closed.
C: ANNA
D: I know.
N: She fumbles in her bag.
C: ANNA
D: Sorry... I'm a midwife.

C: SEMYON
D: So, you are Anna Ivanovna.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
N: The tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on step ladders, fixing some Christmas decorations. Other relatives are getting the place ready. Semyon hurries through the restaurant, leading Anna by the hand.
C: SEMYON
D: We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! Come on!
E: he hisses at Kirill he claps his hands
N: Kirill follows Anna's progress through the restaurant with a glare. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 13A. There are three little girls in extravagant party frocks, all holding violins and giggling near to the door that BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 14. leads to the kitchen. Semyon stops when he reaches them and puts his hands on his hips.
C: SEMYON
D: My angels. You should be practising. You must make the wood cry. Like this, like this...
E: CONT'D
N: Semyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of sad Russian violin music.
C: SEMYON
D: You see...
E: CONT'D
N: Semyon hurries on into the kitchen. Anna smiles, delighted at the eccentric old man.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.
C: SEMYON
D: Come, come, hurry, hurry. They will be here any moment. Ok, show me this card.
E: to Anna
N: Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans- Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag. Semyon angles his head to look as he stirs.
C: SEMYON
D: It is the old card. From before the renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this.
E: CONT'D
N: Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy. She sips it.
C: ANNA
D: God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that.
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 15. Semyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes back to stirring. He speaks as if unconcerned.
C: SEMYON
D: So did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the driver's seat. He gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY
N: Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling each other's hair. The third is sobbing, sitting on the floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen. Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place. Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper.
C: SEMYON
D: This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be closed until New Year.
N: As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise.
C: KIRILL
D: Papa, Ozim is here.
N: Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.
C: SEMYON
D: Ten minutes!! Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes! OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming.
E: to the rest of the kitchen
N: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 16. Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.
C: SEMYON
D: Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help. It is sad.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: That's OK. I'll probably find out more when I get her diary translated.
C: SEMYON
D: Her diary?
N: There is the tiniest of changes in Semyon's manner. He lays his heavy pot down.
C: ANNA
D: I found her diary in her bag.
N: A pause. Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.
C: SEMYON
D: Why did you not tell me you found a diary?
N: He peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.
C: SEMYON
D: OK, Anna, this is how it will be. You will bring the diary here and I will translate it for you. Then if we get the names of any relatives I will call them myself. I am something of a... community leader for the Russians here in this unfriendly city. What do you say?
E: CONT'D
N: Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.

D: Dosvedania.
E: CONT'D Goodbye
C: ANNA
D: Dosvedania.
N: Anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant. Semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out.
C: SEMYON
D: Oh Anna, you always work at the Trafalgar hospital?
C: ANNA
D: Yes, always.
N: A pause before Anna leaves Semyon to his clouds of steam.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a deadly smile and a professional eye.
C: KIRILL
D: Hey, you OK? You want a drink?
C: ANNA
D: No, thanks. I'm driving.
N: As Anna smiles, Ozim mumbles something in Turkish and Kirill shushes him. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18.
C: KIRILL
D: OK. Merry Christmas. Drive safely.
N: Ozim giggles. Anna departs.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's bike.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Nice bike.
E: in Russian
C: ANNA
D: What?
C: NIKOLAI
D: Nice bike.
C: ANNA
D: Thank you.

D: A Ural. You don't see them anymore.
C: ANNA
D: It was my dad's.
C: NIKOLAI
D: How much do you want for it?
N: Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit and tattoos say it all.
C: ANNA
D: It has sentimental value.
E: irritated
N: Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18A.
C: NIKOLAI

C: NIKOLAI
D: You're not staying for the party?
E: CONT'D

D: Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead?
N: Anna mounts her bike.
C: ANNA
D: It's Christmas. Everything's closed.
N: Nikolai smiles.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know?
N: Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette.
S: INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken.
C: STEPAN
D: Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve?
N: Stepan takes a large sip of vodka.
C: ANNA
D: I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit.
C: HELEN
D: For as long as you want.
E: softly
C: STEPAN
D: I knew he would run away from you.
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 20.

C: STEPAN
D: Black men always run away.
C: HELEN
D: Oh Stepan!
C: STEPAN
D: What? I am allowed to be honest?
C: HELEN
D: He was a doctor, Stepan.
C: ANNA
D: What the hell has that got to do with it?
N: A pause. Stepan sips his vodka.
C: STEPAN
D: It is not natural to mix race and race. That is why your baby died inside you.
N: Anna slams her napkin onto the table.
C: HELEN
D: Stepan, shut up! Please Anna.
E: Anna gets to her feet
N: Helen takes Anna's hand but she turns and leaves. Helen stands to follow her, but first she whips Stepan's vodka away from him.
C: HELEN
D: You're just how he was. Stupid bloody drunken Russians.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT

N: A pause. Anna blows smoke, clearly upset.

N: Helen reacts.
C: HELEN
D: I knew this would happen.
C: ANNA
D: Good. Fine. So you know everything.
C: HELEN
D: Anna, she isn't your responsibility.
C: ANNA
D: The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother. The mother is dead.
C: HELEN
D: Then it's up to the proper authorities.
N: Anna smiles as if in agreement.
C: ANNA
D: The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year.
N: Anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette. Helen takes the butt as if it were poisonous.
C: HELEN
D: It's part of the grieving.
C: ANNA
D: What grieving?
N: Helen touches her hand. An inadequate gesture. GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 22.
C: HELEN
D: In the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby.
N: Anna is irritated but doesn't put words to her feelings.
C: HELEN
D: Come in and have your dinner.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: I'm not hungry.
N: Anna and Helen look into each other's eyes for a moment before Helen heads for the kitchen, carrying the cigarette butt as if it were a deadly snake.
S: 22A INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A
N: NIGHT In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another world. Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table. His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel to answer it. When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

C: KIRILL
D: No, my dad's not involved. I'm a big boy now. I do my own stuff. Yeah. Merry Christmas.
E: CONT'D to phone
N: Kirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar. Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her on both cheeks.
S: EXT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - NIGHT
N: We see the car pull up sharply outside Ozim's barber's shop. Nikolai jumps out and opens the door for Ozim. The three men walk to the door beside the barber shop. Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the door to the upstairs. He stops.
C: OZIM
D: The driver stays down here.
N: Kirill smiles and shakes his head.
C: KIRILL

S: INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. UPSTAIRS ROOMS - NIGHT
N: The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.
C: OZIM
D: Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, durgun.
C: EKREM
D: I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game.
C: OZIM
D: OK, OK, OK. You go and watch a DVD, yeah?
N: Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill watches him go.
C: KIRILL
D: He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim?
N: Ozim finds the key to the kitchen.
C: OZIM
D: He don't know anything. He's touched by the angels.

S: INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them.
S: INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 25. Kirill studies the face and nods.
C: KIRILL
D: That's him.
N: Kirill crosses himself.
C: KIRILL

C: KIRILL
D: OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And show some respect. This Muslim is scared of ghosts.
E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai squeezes the body inside the bags. It is rock hard.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Have you got a hair dryer?
S: INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: We cut close to an ancient-looking hair dryer from the shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a large eagle tattoo. We pull wide to reveal the full, gruesome scene. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 26. Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood. Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves. As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed. Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside. He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously. Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai as if he were a devil from hell. Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it, then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You'd better burn that.
N: Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Did you finish cutting his hair?
E: CONT'D
N: Ozim can't answer.
C: NIKOLAI
D: I just thought you might want six- fifty out of his pockets.
E: CONT'D
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 27. Kirill laughs. Nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare himself.
C: NIKOLAI
D: OK, now I'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers. You might want to leave the room.
E: CONT'D to Ozim
N: Ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast. A pause.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You too, Kirill.
E: CONT'D
N: Kirill smiles and pats Nikolai on the cheek. Kirill leaves. Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a little as he picks up his cup of coffee.
S: EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING
N: Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.
C: KIRILL
D: Aren't you going to weight him down or something?
N: Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.
C: NIKOLAI
D: If you want to dump a body, this is the place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
N: Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a fast ocean-bound current.

S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Semyon sits alone at the dinner table in the restaurant where before there was family and uproar. Outside it's dark and raining. He is reading a Russian crime novel. A half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table. Tatiana's voice-over continues as we cut inside the restaurant.
C: TATIANA
D: My friend says his uncle owns the restaurant where you can sing. He is sure this man will take care of me.
E: V.O.
N: There is a knock at the door and Semyon looks up sharply. His eyes glisten. He puts his novel aside.
S: INT./EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. DOOR - NIGHT
N: Semyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle and half light, that it is Anna.

S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Semyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table. Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page.
C: ANNA
D: I copied the whole thing.
N: Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.
C: SEMYON
D: Where is the original?
N: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 29.
C: ANNA
D: I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday.
N: Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.
C: SEMYON
D: I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it.
N: He folds the papers carefully.
C: SEMYON
D: Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna?
E: CONT'D
N: There is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally...
C: ANNA
D: Not far. I can drop by and pick it up.
C: SEMYON
D: Then maybe I can drive you home.
C: ANNA
D: I'm fine. I'm on my motorbike.
N: Semyon stares at her for a moment.

C: SEMYON
D: Who will?

N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 30. Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft toy.
C: MARIA
D: Grandpa.
C: SEMYON
D: Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.
C: MARIA
D: I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days.
N: Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.
C: SEMYON
D: But you have had so many presents.
N: The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.
C: MARIA
D: You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.
C: SEMYON
D: I know.
N: Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar. Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering her own father.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Nikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain. Kirill is so drunk he slips through Nikolai's hands and lands in the gutter.
C: KIRILL
D: We're partners now, man, you know?
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 31.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Yeah, yeah, I know.
N: Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face splashed with rain.
C: NIKOLAI
D: What? You never seen anybody pissed before?
E: CONT'D
N: Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill and starts to go through his pockets.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Come on, Kirill. Where are your keys?
E: CONT'D
N: Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles at her.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Who are you, anyway?
E: CONT'D
N: Anna hurries away into the rain. Nikolai finds Kirill's keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.
C: NIKOLAI
D: We went to a Kurdish place. They don't even celebrate Christmas.
N: Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill grunts and moans. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 32.
C: KIRILL
D: Hey, Papa, what did I do? This is Merry Christmas or what?
N: Semyon kicks him hard in the guts again.
C: NIKOLAI
D: I think he's had enough.
N: Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is shocked that anyone should face him like this.
C: SEMYON
D: Who... the fuck... are you to tell me enough?
N: Nikolai's face hardens.
C: NIKOLAI
D: We're partners.
N: Nikolai looks down at Kirill.

N: Semyon bends to roughly hoist Kirill into a chair.
C: SEMYON
D: ...someone to stop him killing himself.
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: Well, you got more than a driver.
N: Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on Nikolai's hand. It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to Semyon, and he reacts.
C: NIKOLAI
D: I run a mini-cab business.
E: CONT'D MORE

E: CONT'D in Russian
N: A pause. Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.
C: SEMYON
D: I have no idea what business you're talking about. Now get out.
N: Nikolai smiles and then leaves. Semyon watches him go then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something approaching compassion.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Nikolai hurries out to his car in the rain. He hears an engine splutter and spots Anna still trying to kick-start her motorbike. He approaches. She's already soaked. Nikolai watches her try to start the bike and fail.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You've got water in it.
N: Deadpan, Anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring rain.
C: ANNA
D: Water? What makes you think that?
N: Anna tries to start the bike again. Nothing.
C: NIKOLAI
D: The postmen used these. In my village. When I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin.
N: Anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 33A. He tries again. And again. He climbs off. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 34.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Get a bus.

N: Anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to set off walking.
C: ANNA
D: Just across the park.

E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai holds open the rear car door. Rain pours.
S: EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
N: Nikolai is driving Anna through the rain-swept streets. The wipers beat time as they drive in silence. As Nikolai holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.

N: Anna smiles politely.
C: NIKOLAI
D: What's it like?
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA

N: Nikolai half shrugs. Pause.
C: ANNA
D: What, you don't know?
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: Yeah, I know, I know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains.

D: Left here.
N: Nikolai turns.
C: ANNA
D: So Semyon employs you?
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: I'm... sort of freelance.
C: ANNA
D: You said he'd fire you.

D: Did you ever meet a girl called Tatiana?
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: I meet lots of girls called Tatiana.
C: ANNA
D: She was pregnant.

D: She died last night on my shift.
N: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 36.
C: NIKOLAI

E: pause
C: NIKOLAI
D: You know what? I hate the rain. This time of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers your whole house.
E: quickly, without a pause
N: Nikolai glances at Anna in the rear-view mirror.

D: Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes covered in ice. You don't want to walk across them, though. Ice gets thin where you least expect it.
E: CONT'D
C: ANNA
D: You think Semyon's son knew her?
C: NIKOLAI
D: Like I said, I'm a driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead. That's it.

N: Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier. A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the Thames lapping at their feet.
S: 40A INT. FORENSIC TENT - MORNING 40A
N: A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body. One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows him the eagle tattoo.
C: OFFICER
D: We think he might be Russian Mafia.
N: Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg. When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small star tattooed on the knee cap.
C: YURI
D: He is actually a Chechen. He is also a member of the vory v zakone. The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone.
N: Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an eight-pointed star on his chest.
C: YURI
D: In Russian prisons, your life story is written on your body in tattoos. You don't exist without tattoos. He was a captain.

D: And he said he wouldn't do it so I've found somebody else.
N: Stepan explodes.
C: STEPAN
D: No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.
N: Stepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns.
C: STEPAN
D: I go to wash my hands.
E: CONT'D
N: He disappears. Anna and Helen are left in awkward silence. Anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. Helen looks at her with anxiety.
C: HELEN
D: Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that means?
C: ANNA
D: Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again.
C: HELEN
D: You never listened to me even then!
C: ANNA
D: Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
N: A pause.
C: HELEN
D: Who named her Christine?
N: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 40.
C: ANNA
D: I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. She's very beautiful.
E: pause
N: Helen is now deeply concerned.
C: HELEN
D: If I can persuade Stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police?
N: Anna looks at Helen, then digs out the diary and hands it to her.
C: ANNA
D: Tell him I've heard bad words before.
N: Helen is about to leave. She stops in the doorway.
C: HELEN
D: Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. There's no cure once they've touched you.
N: A pause. Anna smiles.
C: ANNA
D: Momma, this is London.
S: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. NEGLECTED SITTING ROOM - DAY
N: We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON. A large portable stereo is playing rock music. The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch paintings still decorate the walls. Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but they are painted with so much make-up they almost look like tiny, sad clowns. They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands. BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 41.
C: ALBANIAN
D: OK, boss is here. Boss, boss. You make him happy...
N: All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet. He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again. Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she begins to dance, sobbing as she does.
C: ALBANIAN
D: No fucking crying. It's a party!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

S: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. SITTING ROOM - DAY
N: Kirill and Nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and dancing with the girls. Some of the girls are drinking, too, and managing to laugh. Kirill is dancing maniacally and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she falls over. Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing. Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second and he goes back to dancing. After a moment Kirill dances his way over to Nikolai and yells above the music.
C: KIRILL
D: OK, which one you going to fuck!?
C: NIKOLAI
D: What's it to you?
E: laughing
C: KIRILL
D: Serious. Pick one.
C: NIKOLAI

D: OK, OK, Jesus...
C: KIRILL
D: You're going to fuck one of these girls right now. That's an order.
C: NIKOLAI
D: What? What's the matter with you?
N: Kirill suddenly goes to the stereo system and yanks the plug from the wall. Silence. The girls look terrified. The only sound is the sobbing of the girl who won't dance. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 43. Kirill is glaring at Nikolai.
C: KIRILL
D: Come on Nikolai. Who are you going to fuck?
N: A pause.
C: KIRILL
D: I'm recommending you to my dad. I want to make sure you're not a fucking queer.

Helen also tries hard to concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes. Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice...
C: STEPAN
D: ...like potato sacks. Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it... He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, Kirill'.

C: KIRILL
D: Yeah? So what? What's that got to do with me?
C: SEMYON
D: Don't lie to me!!

N: Nikolai shrugs Semyon off, holding his ground.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police.
N: A pause. Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolai's knowledge. He peers at him.
C: SEMYON
D: For a driver, you are well informed.
C: NIKOLAI
D: I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard.

C: KIRILL
D: Papa, I swear to you, I was going to...

N: Nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car.
C: ANNA
D: You murdered her! You bastards murdered her!

N: Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly.

N: Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over...

D: I don't want to repeat it.
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 61.

N: Nikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half knows already. He shrugs...
C: SEMYON
D: You play with the Prince to do business with the King. But if you want to do business with me you must be open with me. Thieves- in-law.

D: The cold gets into my bones.
N: A pause.
C: SEMYON
D: And also... the KGB would be waiting for me.
E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at Semyon.
C: NIKOLAI
D: FSB. They are called FSB now.
C: SEMYON
D: Whatever they call them they are worse even than the KGB were. Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. We had rules, they had rules.
N: He swigs some more vodka.
C: SEMYON
D: Now in Moscow, the thieves don't wear tattoos and the police don't wear uniforms. You never know who they are...

C: NIKOLAI
D: I got that address you wanted.
E: CONT'D
N: Anna turns and sees Nikolai is offering a scrap of paper.
C: NIKOLAI

E: CONT'D
N: She hesitates. Nikolai approaches and gives her the address.
C: NIKOLAI
D: If you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in London. Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed.
E: CONT'D
N: A pause.
C: ANNA
D: You read the diary?
N: Nikolai looks all around. Anna studies him, unsure.
C: ANNA
D: So how can you keep doing what you're doing?

S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT
N: The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor.

S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. TWO DAYS LATER - NIGHT
N: Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes. The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits and shades. He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.
S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy, Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel. After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for the biggest interview of his life. The vory behind the table greet him. Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow). He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied the tattoos does the interview begin. WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 78. The following dialogue should not be translated, and can be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.

C: NIKOLAI
D: That's right. My father means nothing to me. My Mother....
C: GYPSY
D: You have no mother. She was a whore anyway.
N: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 79.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Yes. I have no mother and no father. There is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always followed.
C: VALERY
D: That is why there is an empty place above your heart. Where the stars will go. And why there is an empty place on your knees.
C: NIKOLAI

C: GYPSY
D: You have never worked for the government? Any government?
C: NIKOLAI
D: I have lived off Albanians and Georgians. I steal from them within the law.
N: The questions and answers are delivered with great solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious. Candles burn, the men all sip water. Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively. Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.
S: EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.

N: The choral music continues as we see the old man opening his case and pulling out tattooing equipment. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 80. Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps for the tattoos. The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist wipes away the blood. Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol. Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight- pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory v zakone.
S: INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

S: EXT. TURKISH BATHS - DAY
N: We are in St. Pancras, North London. More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a Victorian red-brick edifice. Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.
S: INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY
N: Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.
C: OZIM

C: NIKOLAI
D: Where do they dock?
N: Ozim grins.
C: OZIM
D: I will tell you when I return from the bathroom.
N: Ozim chuckles as he leaves in a swirl of steam. Nikolai leans back against the cold wall, his tattoo almost the only visible thing through the steam.
S: INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY
N: Ozim is dressing frantically, his face suddenly betraying his real anxiety. He checks his watch as he puts it back on his wrist. After a moment the two Chechen brothers who killed Ekrem enter the changing room. They swagger up to Ozim. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 83-83A. He gulps down his fear.
C: OZIM

N: Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will see the vor tattoo. They head towards the steam room as Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit.
S: INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY
N: Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he can't see who has entered.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Ozim?
N: He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately. Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with an open razor. Nikolai is naked, alone. Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother. In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously has serious combat training but the brothers are strong and angry. Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water. Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the temple. As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor, and staggers out of the steam room. GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 84.

E: into phone
N: A pause. Anna looks exasperated.
C: ANNA
D: Mum, I don't want to tell you how I found him because I don't want another argument. I just wanted you to know he's definitely safe...

S: EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - MORNING
N: It's cold and the wind is blowing. We see rooftops behind them. Yuri is lighting Nikolai's cigarette. Nikolai is wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown. Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence for a moment.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You got my message?
N: Yuri chuckles.
C: YURI
D: Using a dead body to file a progress report must be against FSB regulations.
C: NIKOLAI
D: It's called improvisation.
C: YURI
D: You've been improvising quite a lot lately. And taking risks.
N: He glances at the cuts on Nikolai's hands...
C: YURI
D: Maybe too many.
E: CONT'D in Russian
N: Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You didn't come here to give me flowers...

N: Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news. Nikolai turns as if to go back inside. Yuri grabs Nikolai's arm and speaks formally.... PINK Revision - 11/12/06 90.
C: YURI
D: In light of what has happened to you...
N: Nikolai shakes his head wearily....
C: NIKOLAI
D: Ah, Christ...
E: in Russian
C: YURI
D: ...and in light of other violent incidents associated with you, the Russian desk at Scotland Yard have made an official request to the Russian embassy that your undercover operation in London be terminated.
N: Nikolai doesn't react for a moment.
C: YURI
D: You have gone beyond what was agreed.
E: CONT'D in Russian
N: With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins to unbutton his overcoat..
C: YURI
D: In my opinion you should see this as good news. You've been in the zone far too long...
E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the thin hospital gown beneath it. He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.
C: YURI
D: My God...
E: CONT'D
C: NIKOLAI
D: If they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this...
N: A pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified. Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles. PINK Revision - 11/12/06 91.
C: NIKOLAI
D: You tell the Russian desk you saw stars over my heart. OK? Tell them I'm through the door.
E: CONT'D
N: A pause. Yuri is still overwhelmed.
C: YURI
D: They are bound to ask... who did you kill?
N: A pause.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Tell them I only killed myself.
E: in Russian
N: A pause. Yuri is humbled. They share a moment of understanding as they smoke. Finally...
C: NIKOLAI
D: And you can tell them I'm going to replace Semyon at the head of the London organization.
E: CONT'D
N: Yuri laughs.
C: YURI
D: What drugs are they giving you? Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.
C: NIKOLAI
D: I need you to take Semyon out of the picture. I want you to arrest him.
N: Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one he is smoking. Yuri is incredulous.

E: incredulous
C: NIKOLAI
D: She doesn't have to. She's dead.
N: A pause.
C: NIKOLAI
D: But she had Semyon's baby. If you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape.
E: CONT'D
N: A pause. Yuri begins it think it through.
C: NIKOLAI
D: All you need is the baby and some of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood.
E: CONT'D
N: Yuri peers at Nikolai with awe. A long pause. Finally Yuri smiles.
C: YURI
D: You intrigue me.
N: A pause.

S: INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY
N: Nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the bed, trying hard to concentrate. There is a knock and Anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. She takes out a worn pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a denim jacket and a battered pair of shoes. Nikolai smiles...
C: NIKOLAI
D: How is Uncle Stepan?
N: Instead of answering, Anna lays the clothes on the bed.
C: ANNA
D: They're from the morgue. They belonged to someone who died yesterday.
E: deadpan
N: Nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them. They're way too big.
C: ANNA

E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai smiles but Anna turns to leave...
C: NIKOLAI
D: Hey... wait a minute...
N: Nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans. He speaks from behind the screen.

E: CONT'D
N: A pause. Anna considers leaving but hesitates.
C: ANNA
D: Yeah. It's OK.
N: Nikolai steps out from behind the screen, the baggy jeans tightly belted, his chest bare. For the first time Anna sees the extent of Nikolai's body tattoos and reacts.... Nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesn't care for it. He grabs the T-shirt and pulls it on.

D: Did you get in touch with Tatiana's family in Russia?
C: ANNA
D: No.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Good.
N: Nikolai is now dressed, his cut and tattooed arms still showing.

N: They peer at each other.
C: ANNA
D: Why do you care?
E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai shrugs and grabs the shoes.
C: ANNA
D: Stepan said you were kind to him. He said you were risking your own life to keep him alive.
E: CONT'D
N: Nikolai laughs.
C: NIKOLAI
D: Yeah, and all the thanks I get is a pair of dead man's shoes. * I listen to you. *
E: pause
N: ANNA * (sarcastic) * Do you really? * NIKOLAI * Yes. About Semyon and the baby. * Thank you. * 94A ANNA * (still wary) * You thank me for that? * Their eyes lock across a huge divide. He rubs the tattoos on his arm.

C: YURI
D: What, you are afraid of needles, Semyon?

S: INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY

C: SEMYON
D: To poison me.
N: Semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.
