M: ELECTION by Alexander Payne & JIM Taylor
M: Third Draft July 22,1997
M: Based on the novels by Tom Perotta
S: EXT. MILLARD HIGH -- DAWN
N: The school stretches out before us, slumbering in the overcast morning air. Along the front sidewalk, a lone JANITOR trundles a garbage bin filled with overstuffed hefty bags. A weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and comes to a stop near the athletic field. A TEENAGE GIRL'S VOICE -
C: TRACY
D: None of this would have happened if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did. He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny. You see, you can't interfere with destiny. That's why it's destiny. And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.
E: VO
N: JIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and coffee mug. On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the janitor.
C: JIM
D: Morning, Lowell
N: Lowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.
S: EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD -- DAWN
N: JIM CIRCLES THE TRACK, sweating and panting. ON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups
C: JIM
D: Twenty-one... twenty-two.
N: He collapses onto his back. His head rolls to one side, and he glances past the fence at -- THE PARKING LOT Where a second CAR is just arriving. JIM watches as TRACY FLICK, a junior, and her MOTHER get out. The mother helps remove a CARD TABLE and a big plastic sack from the trunk before Tracy heads toward the school.
C: MOTHER
D: Good luck!
E: distant
N: JIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.
S: INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM -- DAY
N: Naked in the showers, JIM pumps liquid soap from the wall- mounted metal dispenser.
S: INT. HILLARD HALL DAY
N: THE LEGS OF A CARD TABLE - as Tracy spreads them open and locks them into place. STICKS OF GUM from a Plen-T-Pack are emptied into a FISHBOWL- SCOTCH TAPE is wrapped around the end of a pen to attach a piece of string
S: INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM DAY
N: AT THE MIRROR JIM adjusts the knot of his tie, notices a little shaving cream in his ear.
S: INT. MILLARD HALL DAY
N: FOUR CLIPBOARDS with pens and lined sheets of paper are being placed in a row like little soldiers. The top of every sheet reads "Tracy Flick for President: Official Nomination Signatures."
S: INT. FACULTY LOUNGE -- MORNING
N: AT THE REFRIGERATOR JIM tries to place his lunch inside, but the shelves are too crammed with old take-out containers. He opens one and smells it. Disgusted, he drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away. Lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart and watches JIM conduct his purge as A CHINESE FOOD BOX misses the can and rolls on the floor.
S: INT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY
N: Tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the school's main entrance. A sign taped to the wall behind her reads, TRACY FOR PREZ. SIGN UP FOR TOMORROW, TODAY! She checks her watch, readies herself. JIM walks around the corner whistling vaguely.
C: TRACY
D: Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
C: JIM
D: Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
C: TRACY
D: You know what they say about the early bird.
E: chirping
C: JIM
D: Yes, I do.
N: An awkward moment passes between them.
C: JIM
D: Well, good luck there, Tracy
C: TRACY
D: Thanks, Mr. M.
N: AS JIM turns and walks away, Tracy watches him. He stops and picks up some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.
C: TRACY
D: No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister had it out for me from the start. Oh sure, he was all smiles and good wishes and everything, but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else.
E: VO
S: INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM DAY
N: Alone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald
C: TRACY
D: He'll probably tell you how committed he was to teaching and democracy and integrity and all. Don't be fooled.
E: VO CONT'D
N: After laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.
C: JIM
D: It's hard to remember how the whole thing started, the whole election mess. What I do remember is that I loved my job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else.
E: VO
N: Suddenly a VOICE --
C: VOICE
D: Hey, Mr. M. Mr. M.!
E: OS
N: JIM glances OUT THE WINDOW and sees a kid -- PAUL METZLER -- pointing at him. Paul walks with a LIMP. Behind him, other STUDENTS approach the school.
C: PAUL
D: Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!
N: JIM enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid a wave. He returns to his newspaper, a contented man.
C: JIM
D: The students knew it wasn't just a job for me.
E: VO
S: EXT. MILARD HIGH FOOTBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT

E: VO CONT'D
N: JIM slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class

C: JIM
D: You're on the right track, who can help him out?
C: DEREK
D: ..morals are when...
N: Tracy's hand goes higher.
C: JIM
D: Michelle?
C: MICHELLE
D: Morals are like lessons, you know, like the moral of a story; it's what you learn from a story or a fable or something. . .
C: JIM
D: Or a life experience. Good. And ethics?
C: MICHELLE
D: That's more like, urn... Ethics is how you use the morals... that you learn from a story?
N: JIM weighs the answer, tries to be encouraging.

E: VO
S: INT. STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM -- DAY -- ONE YEAR PREVIOUS
N: JIM sits to one side, monitoring the student council MEETING about to convene. A younger Tracy enters briskly and, unlike her casual teen comrades, has made an attempt to dress for success. She takes a seat right up front and opens her backpack. After preparing her notepad and pen, Tracy puts a MICROCASSETTE RECORDER on the table in front of her and pushes RECORD.
C: JIM
D: She first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council. I'd seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years, but I could tell right away Tracy Flick was different.
E: VO CONT'D
N: JIM observes Tracy, trying to size her up. ON TRACY -- putting all her little things in order, finally folding her hands to wait.
C: JIM
D: It wasn't long before everyone knew who Tracy Flick was. She made sure of that. Her drive was astonishing. Even scary.
E: VO CONT'D
N: A FAST-PACED MONTAGE BEGINS UNDER TRACY'S VOICE-OVER: INSERT HILLARD HIGH YEARBOOK It fans open to the INDEX. PAN DOWN to Tracy's name followed by countless page references

E: VO CONT'D
N: A page number turns BOLD, and the other numbers drop away Suddenly we are on that page, and we PAN to a headline: "Spanish Club says Oh La!" PAN to the group shot and ZOOM in on Tracy smiling in a big SOMBRERO.
C: TRACY
D: My Mom always tells me I'm different -- you know, special. And if you look at all the things I've accomplished so far, I think you'd have to agree.
E: VO CONT'D
N: We see Tracy on other pages too: "Yearbook Staff goes for it!" "Junior Achievers put on the dog!" "Student Council meets the challenge;" Oklahoma's a hit!

E: off-key
S: TV INSERT/INT. CAFETERIA DAY
N: It's the closed-circuit school NEWS BROADCAST. Tracy is delivering a stand-up report from the crowded cafeteria. Her dress and makeup are an obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman.
C: TRACY
D: And here I am on KMHS, our student-run TV station.
E: VO
C: TRACY
D: ..that's why Principal Hendricks made the controversial announcement that the littering must stop. Tracy Flick reporting.

S: INT. STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
N: A Student Council meeting is underway led by the president, LARRY FOUCH. A girl, ASHLEY, is speaking. JIM observes from the side.
C: TRACY
D: But it was in SGA, the Student Government Association, where I made my biggest mark. I never missed a meeting, and I volunteered for every committee as long as I could lead it.
E: VO
N: Before Ashley can finish, Tracy STANDS UP
C: TRACY
D: I agree with Ashley. We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand. What happened last time was a travesty, I mean, we were --

S: INT. MILLARD STAFF-ROOM -- DAY
N: CLOSE ON DAVE NOVOTNY, another teacher in his mid-thirties
C: DAVE
D: Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.
N: WIDE - Dave is leaning across his desk to speak with JIM at an adjacent work area. They eat sack lunches.
C: JIM
D: A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
E: VO
C: JIM
D: Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that.
C: DAVE
D: She's incredible. Everything just gets soaked.
N: INT. JIM'S BASEMENT DAY Dun-dun-DUN... Dun-dun-DUN JIM and Dave are playing the opening notes of "Foxy Lady" through cheap, distorting amps. JIM plays bass. Dave plays guitar and sings into a microphone. They're bad. As in not good. The basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half storage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room.
C: JIM
D: Dave came to Millard the year after I did, and we hit it off right away. We backed each other up in teachers' meetings and shared an interest in 60's music and micro-breweries.
E: VO
N: CLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium. Behind him JIM is very careful with his chords.
C: JIM
D: You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
E: VO CONT'D
C: DAVE
D: Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
E: singing
N: CAMERA DRIFTS toward the stairs leading up.
S: INT. JIM'S KITCHEN
N: CAMERA DRIFTS from the open basement stairway door and toward DIANE MCALLISTER and SHERRY NOVOTNY seated at the kitchen table. They are fussing over little six-month-old DARRYL NOVOTNY in his highchair.
C: JIM
D: Our wives became best friends too. And when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was born, they asked us to be godparents.
E: VO
N: At a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and closes the basement door.
S: INT. GEOMETRY CLASS
N: AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected. PULL OUT to reveal Dave explaining. The class is taking notes, and we zero in on a younger Tracy.
C: TRACY
D: YOU probably think the worst - that Mr. Novotny was just taking advantage of one of his students, but it wasn't like that at all. Our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration. I mean, during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us -- I mean, nothing.
E: VO CONT'D
N: EXT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT The parking lot, the neon lights, the promise of good times.
C: TRACY
D: It wasn't until junior year when we worked together on the yearbook that things got serious.
E: VO CONT'D
N: INT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT Dave and Tracy are at a booth along with six other students. TWO KIDS DISSOLVE OUT OF FRAME, and the others shift positions. Others continue to disappear in the same way, until only Dave and Tracy remain.
C: TRACY
D: One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
E: VO CONT'D
C: DAVE
D: You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
N: Dave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug.
C: TRACY
D: what?
C: DAVE
D: Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
C: TRACY
D: No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
C: DAVE
D: I know. I know its not by choice. I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
C: TRACY
D: What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
C: DAVE
D: What kind of person?
N: Dave looks directly into her eyes.
C: DAVE
D: Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met. I mean, you're the real thing. Special.
E: CONT'D
C: TRACY
D: Thank you.
E: embarrassed, low
C: DAVE
D: And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
N: Tracy nods in quiet recognition.
C: DAVE
D: I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. But it seems like you might need a friend.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. MILLARD YEARBOOK OFFICE -- DAY
N: A DOOR with cloudy glass and a stenciled sign: YEARBOOK OFFICE. DISSOLVE through the door and TRAVEL through an empty room to discover another door with a sign that reads DARKROOM.
C: TRACY
D: Since I grew up without a dad, you might assume psychologically I was looking for a father figure.
E: VO
N: DISSOLVE through the darkroom door to DAVE AND TRACY bathed in red light. Tracy is sitting on Dave's lap as they make out hungrily.
C: TRACY
D: But that had nothing to do with it at all. It was just that Dave was so strong and made me feel so safe and protected.
E: VO CONT'D
S: INT. DAVE'S CAR -- DAY
N: Dave drives. Tracy sits in the passenger seat.
C: TRACY
D: It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
E: VO CONT'D
C: DAVE
D: Here, get down.
E: looking around
S: EXT. NOVOTKY HOUSE - DAY
N: Dave wheels his car into the open garage. The automatic door closes behind him.
S: INT. NOVOTHY LIVIMG ROOM
N: Dave stands up from his squat at the STEREO, and the sexy sounds of Sade set the mood. Tracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa, a Diet Dr. Pepper in one hand. Dave walks slowly toward her, a sexy, knowing look in his eye. The music is sexy. Tracy is sexy. He's sexy. Keeping his eyes locked on Tracy's, he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip himself. Sexy.
S: INT. NOVOTHY STAIRCASE DAY
N: Dave and Tracy walk up the stairs and down the hall. Dave enters the bedroom first, while Tracy pauses in the hall. His arm reaches out and pulls her inside.
S: INT. NOVOTNY BEDROOM DAY
N: IN QUICK TIGHT CUTS we see Dave and Tracy DISROBING Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow. She looks toward the foot of the bed at -- DAVE, unable to believe his eyes. He looks at naked Tracy up and down, up and down, his breath quickening. Sade wafts up the stairs.
C: DAVE
D: Look at you.

C: TRACY
D: When I think back on my relationship with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is our talks.

S: INT. DAVE'S BASEMENT DAY
N: JIM is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated
C: JIM
D: You did it at your house? Your own house?
C: DAVE
D: Look, Jim... Okay. I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger. But now it's different. Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
C: JIM
D: In love?
C: DAVE
D: Yeah, it's serious. I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
C: JIM
D: But you haven't written your novel.
C: DAVE
D: That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here. I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. It's beautiful.
C: JIM
D: Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
N: Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps JIM has reached him. Perhaps not.
C: DAVE
D: You're not just jealous, are you? I mean, we both used to talk about her
C: JIM
D: That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
E: exploding
C: DAVE
D: I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay? I know what --
C: JIM
D: I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals.
N: CLICK. SQUEAK. STEP STEP STEP.
C: SHERRY
D: Peek-a-boo!
E: OS
N: Sherry comes down the basement stairs with Darryl in her arms.
C: DAVE
D: Look, I appreciate your concern. I really do. But like I said, I got it under control.
E: to Jim, whispering
N: As Sherry approaches them, Dave rises to take Darryl, the perfect father: hug, tickle, kiss.
C: JIM
D: I guess I don't have to tell you how all this turned out.
E: VO
S: INT. PRINCIPAL HENDRICK'S OFFICE DAY
N: CLOSE ON DAVE slumped in a chair. He is lost in agony: all he can do is look down and draw short, gasping breaths. Principal Walt Hendricks is at his desk, examining a little BOOKLET.
C: JIM
D: sits on the vinyl sofa.
N: CLOSE ON -- the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, "There's a place for us" in overdone fancy cursive. THE SECOND PAGE shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky BEACHFRONT HOTEL. One room has been circled with the words "you and me" written next to it. Below: "A time and place for us." We HEAR Walt clearing his throat, swallowing. THE THIRD PAGE has glued to it a POSTCARD showing a couple hand-in- hand on the beach at sunset and reading, "Maui is for lovers." Below: Take my hand and we'll soon be there. THE LAST PAGE has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers. It reads, "Tracy, See you in paradise? Love, your 'teacher' David. P.S. I really, really need you now." The booklet is lowered.
C: DAVE
D: Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.
C: WALT
D: No, I'd say she doesn't. I don't think I've ever seen a mother quite so upset. We're all very, very lucky she doesn't want this public.
N: Dave looks at JIM for help. JIM looks away. Dave's breaths grow more convulsive. Finally -
C: DAVE

C: WALT
D: I want you to get some help.

N: RINGGGGG Maybe not. At the bell, students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their things.
C: JIM
D: Okay. We'll pick up here next time
N: Tracy is miffed as she puts her things away: slam, stuff, zip. She slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door. She looks back at -- MR. MCALLISTER who himself now FREEZES as he talks to a couple of students
C: TRACY
D: Now that I have more life experience, I feel sorry for Mr. McAllister.
E: VO
N: CLOSE-UP FROZEN DETAILS - of Jim's appearance - his slightly frayed collar and bad tie; the heels of his old docksiders worn down at irritating angles; the faded impression his too-big wallet has made in his khakis; his growing bald spot; his ear hairs.
C: TRACY
D: I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same little room saying the exact same things year after year for his whole life, wearing the same stupid clothes, while his students go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money has got to be at least a little jealous. It's like my room says - the weak always try to sabotage the strong.
E: VO
N: Tracy turns and walks out the door.
S: INT. TRACY'S HOUSE -- DAY
N: CLOSE ON A SMILING LITTLE TRACY - in a Sears-style portrait. PAN across a wall full of other framed photos of Tracy accepting awards, dancing in a recital, poised to dive at a swim meet.

S: INT. MILLARD HALLWAY DAY
N: A politician's SMILE plastered to her face, Tracy is at her card table vigorously gathering signatures.

C: TRACY
D: I can't wait to start campaigning.
E: cheery, awkward
C: JIM
D: Should be easy. So far no competition.
C: TRACY
D: Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
C: JIM
D: Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy
N: They exchange a long, curious stare. There's a tone at once confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.
C: TRACY
D: You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
C: JIM
D: Sure
C: TRACY

C: JIM
D: Good luck, Tracy.

S: INT.EXT. JIM'S CAR ON STREET -- DAY

C: PAUL
D: What do you mean?
C: JIM
D: Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell?

D: Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run. And she got in just under the wire. Nothing I can do.
N: Now TRACY replaces Lisa and Paul
C: TRACY
D: Let me see them. Let me see them
N: Sighing, JIM fishes in his drawer and hands Tracy some sheets
C: TRACY
D: These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
C: JIM
D: Looks like Tim Kobza.
E: taking the sheet
N: LISA AND PAUL again
C: LISA
D: She's doing this to get back at me
C: PAUL
D: For what?
C: LISA
D: I mean at you.
C: PAUL
D: For what?
C: LISA
D: I don't know. You're her brother you should know.
N: TRACY returns.
C: TRACY
D: Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him!
C: JIM
D: Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy? We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
S: INT. MILLARD GYMNASIUM DAY
N: The entire student body is assembled on the bleachers. There is a palpable mood of boredom and apathy. JERRY SLAVIN, a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, is at the microphone. His head lists to one side, and he takes long breaths as he speaks.
C: JERRY
D: I love Millard High, and I will be a dedicated vice President. A vote for Jerry Slavin is a vote for good government. And even if I can't really stand up for you, I will. Thank you.
E: cracks himself up
N: Jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs. JIM steps forward, clapping, and raises the mike.
C: JIM
D: Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick.
N: Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. During her speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.
C: TRACY
D: Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better." With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better. During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns. I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom. I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes. I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess; commitment -
C: DOUG SCHENKEN
D: Eat me
C: DOUG'S BUDDY
D: Eat me raw!
N: There is scattered laughter. Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up and grabs the mike.
C: WALT
D: If you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children* Because that's what children are. And you'll be treated like children. So let's all listen up.
N: Walt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes
C: TRACY
D: The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience. I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference. One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard. I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist.
N: Walt whispers to Jim.
C: WALT
D: I'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue.
N: JIM nods solemnly
C: TRACY
D: When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me. You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better. Thank you.
N: Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair. There is polite applause and a few whistles. JJJB comes back to the microphone. Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him. Paul scares straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs is jiggling.
C: JIM
D: The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier. Paul?
N: Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike. Though by no means thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's. A small cluster of jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air. Paul manages a weak grin for his buddies. Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked about. Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals nothing. The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible monotone, never once glancing up.
C: PAUL
D: As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.
N: JIM pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained A few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.
C: PAUL
D: I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you.
E: big breath
N: Paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain loyal.
C: JIM
D: Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.
N: Tammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and catcalls. Tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside. She makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.
C: WALT
D: People. People I
N: The room quiets down. Tammy puts her lips close to the mike,
C: TAMMY
D: Who cares about this stupid election?
N: NOW there's something worth listening to.
C: TAMMY
D: We all know it doesn't matter who gets elected president of Millard. You think it's going to change anything around here, make one single person happier or smarter or nicer? The only person it matters to is the one who gets elected. The same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college. So vote for me, because I don't even want to go to college, and I don't care, and as president I won't do anything. The only promise I make is that if elected I will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again!
E: CONT'D
N: There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause. Tammy has set them free. Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his buddies join in.
C: STUDENTS
D: Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
N: In total control, she steps back from the mike and CURTSIES. Walt shoots an angry, confused look at Jim, who shrugs. Tracy is clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks confused and ashamed. Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and chants along with the multitude. Tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation.
C: TAMMY
D: 0h don't vote for me I Who cares? Don't vote at all!
N: The students go nuts.
S: INT. WALT HENDRICK'S OFFICE DAY
N: Dr. Hendricks is in a serious post-assembly discussion with JIM and VICE-PRINCIPAL RON BELL.
C: WALT
D: That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that. She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
C: JIM
D: Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about.
C: WALT
D: Yeah... whatever. All I know is she's a troublemaker. She's on my list.
E: grumbling
C: RON
D: All we need to do is send a message, so maybe we should just suspend her.
C: WALT
D: Right. That's it. She's suspended for a week!
N: To emphasize his point, Walt throws his STYROFOAM CUP at the wastepaper basket and misses. Lowell the janitor, passing by outside the door, notices the cup bouncing on the floor.
C: JIM
D: I think that's a little strong Walt. Ron?
C: RON
D: We don't want to make a martyr out of her. Three days sounds right to me.
C: WALT
D: Okay. Three days. Take care of it.
S: EXT. STREETS DAY
N: Tammy rides her bike on this crisp sunny spring day. The music is buoyant. Tammy is all smiles.
C: TAMMY
D: Being suspended is like getting a paid vacation. Too bad it was only three days
E: VO
S: EXT. 7-11 DAY
N: Tammy is hanging out by the entrance. A DUDE emerges from the store carrying a 12-pack of beer. En route to his car, he throws Tammy a pack of CIGARETTES.
C: DUDE
D: Here you go.
N: Tammy looks at the pack
C: TAMMY
D: Hey -- I said lights I
S: EXT. SACRED HEART ACADEMY -- DAY
N: A cigarette hanging out of her mouth, Tammy rides by the front of this Catholic girls' school. NOW AT THE ATHLETIC FIELD - Tammy gets off her bike, goes to look through the surrounding fence at GIRLS PLAYING LACROSSE in their cleats, short skirts, jerseys. LITURGICAL MUSIC accompanies SLOW-MOTION close-ups of the girls in action. Tammy seems to breathe them in
S: INT. TAMMY'S ROOM -- DAY
N: Wearing headphones. Tammy DANCES to music only she can hear. She happens to glance toward her door and notices a MANILA ENVELOPE sliding under it. She opens the door and finds a startled Paul.
C: TAMMY
D: What do you want?
C: PAUL
D: Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
N: Tammy looks at him, picks up the packet.
C: PAUL
D: I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
E: CONT'D
C: TAMMY
D: Okay, Paul. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
N: Paul smiles at the acknowledgment of his good deed.
C: TAMMY
D: Now could you leave me alone?
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything. But that's okay, you know. l respect your privacy. I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister. Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
C: TAMMY
D: Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.
C: PAUL
D: Okay. Great. I feel good.
N: Paul is about to leave again but
C: PAUL
D: Oh. Oh. Yeah. Right. One other thing. Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice? I want to get her something for helping me with the election. You know, something really special -- like flowers or candy or flowers and candy. Or is that too typical? I mean, can you think of something? Something really special? You know, something she'd really like?
N: Tammy looks as though she'd like to push the button on all the world's atomic bombs.
S: EXT. TRACY'S DRIVEWAY DAY
N: CLOSE ON A GIANT OUTLINED "0" -- drawn on white paper. A hand enters frame with a brush and begins to fill in the outline with blue tempera-paint. Camera RISES to reveal the "0" as part of a giant banner. Tracy is working on some letters, while ERIC OVERHOLDT is working on others.
C: TRACY
D: What happened at the speeches was an unconscienceable travesty. That little bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to work. People do care who wins. Things do matter.
E: VO
N: Finally, we're high enough to read: WHO CARES? I DO: VOTE TRACY!
C: TRACY
D: Eric, the "r" is supposed to be green, not blue.
C: ERIC
D: Oh. Okay.
N: Eric carefully paints over his mistake, then works up some courage.
C: ERIC
D: So, Tracy, I was wondering if after we finish with these you'd like to go to a movie or something.
E: CONT'D
C: TRACY
D: That's okay. I'm too busy.
N: Ouch. INT. MILLARD YEARBOOK OFFICE -- NIGHT A haggard Tracy sits alone at a computer monitor
C: TRACY
D: People are so ungrateful. If all those students who cheered for Tammy Metzier only knew how hard I worked for Millard. Like all the late nights I spent at the yearbook office just to give them their memories.
E: VO CONT'D
N: THE MONITOR displays a DIGITIZED PHOTO of the Millard yearbook staff. DAVE NOVOTNY peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. A CURSOR in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around Dave's face. Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Dave's dislodged head into the TRASH. Tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse.
C: TRACY
D: One of my duties was to clean up the group photos. It was a cinch with our new software.
E: VO CONT'D
N: THE COMPUTER MONITOR AGAIN -- as Tracy outlines a piece of the WALL and places it in the void where Dave used to be, blurring the edges for a perfect effect, voila! Satisfied, Tracy taps on the keyboard.
C: TRACY
D: Let's see... "save" is Command "S." Okay.
E: under her breath
S: INT. MILLARD HIGH HALLWAY -- NIGHT
N: Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that HER NEW "WHO CARES?" BANNER has come loose on an upper corner and is drooping. Tracy puts down her things and JUMPS up to slap the corner back into place. Satisfied, she turns away. But then - SHOOP! The banner fights back, peeling even further from the wall. Tracy prepares for battle.
S: INT. YEARBOOK OFFICE NIGHT
N: Tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum STRAIGHT-EDGE.
S: INT. HALLWAY NIGHT
N: Standing on an overturned GARBAGE CAN and wielding the straight-edge, Tracy tries to smooth the banner. But she's not holding the ruler flat against the wall and -- RIP! -- she slices the banner lengthwise. Now the plastic garbage can begins to buckle. Struggling to retain her balance, Tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she TUMBLES yanks the whole thing down. Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground and TEARS UP what remains of her banner. PAUL METZLER smiles down at Tracy from his poster across the hall. Tracy looks up at it. Instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the poster. She jumps up, TEARS it down, and RIPS Paul's head into pieces. Blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand. Tracy regards it at first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth. While sucking her wound, her gaze falls on -- ANOTHER SMILING PAUL mocking her pain. ANGLE FROM WAY DOWN THE HALL Hurricane Tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of Millard High. Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage.
T: TIME DISSOLVE --
N: to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping. TRACK FROM OVERHEAD - THE HALLWAY FLOOR - where a thousand bits of Paul lie scattered -- a grinning mouth here, an eye there. TILT UP finally to Tracy, sweating, panting. She finishes ripping a poster and looks to find another. But there are no more Paul posters: she has destroyed them all. Tracy raises her hands and sees they are streaked with Blood.
S: INT. GIRLS ' BATHROOM NIGHT
N: Tracy is at the sink, washing away the blood. She pats her hands dry with paper towels. The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and she panics.
C: TRACY
D: I didn't do this. I didn't do it.
N: She lifts the top off a garbage can, removes the PLASTIC LINER.
S: INT. MILLARD HALLWAY NIGHT
N: With frantic haste, Tracy stuffs the evidence of her awful deed into the garbage bag.
S: EXT. BACK OF HILLARD HIGH -- MIGHT
N: Tracy's face is half-obscured by the bulging bag she carries down the sidewalk.
S: EXT. HILLARD PARKIMC LOT - MIGHT
N: Tracy opens her TRUNK and heaves the garbage bag inside slamming the trunk, she looks around - no one.
S: INT. TRACY'S CAR NIGHT
N: Tracy drives, sucking on a wounded hand. She glances frequently in the rear-view mirror.
S: EXT. STREET MIGHT
N: Tracy's car drives down a REMOTE ROAD. There are no sidewalks here, and the surroundings consist of scrubby vegetation and industrial structures. In the background looms a POWER PLANT.
S: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: We now sense that Tracy has a plan. She throws the car into reverse, backs up and turns onto -
S: EXT. A SMALL ACCESS ROAD -- CONTINUOUS
N: Tracy stop the car near an EMBANKMENT. She gets out and pulls the garbage bag from the trunk. With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her deed tumble into obscurity. NOW THROUGH BINOCULARS Tracy's shadowy figure runs back to the car.
S: EXT. HILL ABOVE POWER PLANT NIGHT
N: Tammy momentarily drops her BINOCULARS before raising them again. THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - Tracy's car speeds away. Tammy drops her binoculars and mounts her bike
S: EXT. EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT
N: Tammy skids to a stop, drops her bike, and heads down the embankment. CLOSE ON THE HEFTY BAG as Tammy draws near. She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity conquers her fear. She unties the knot. FROM INSIDE THE BAG we see Tammy's sudden look of HORROR PAUL'S MANGLED FACE smiles up at her. Tammy raises it toward camera
S: INT. NOVOTWY BATHROOM -- MORNING
N: CLOSE ON A DRAIN as a hand extracts a huge WAD OF HAIR -- stringy, mucousy. fetid. JIM holds it up for Sherry, who stands behind him in her bathrobe.
C: JIM
D: There's your culprit
N: He examines it from different angles. Both scrunch their faces
C: JIM
D: Shall we give it a name?
E: CONT'D
C: SHERRY
D: Dave.
E: not missing a beat
N: CLOSE ON AN OPEN TOILET - Plop! The hairwad joins several smaller stringy friends. NOW AT THE SINK JIM washes his hands. Sherry glances between JIM and the water running in the shower. It's getting steamy.
C: SHERRY
D: Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
C: JIM
D: No, I... uh, didn't know that
C: SHERRY
D: All his life. He's tried everything.
C: JIM
D: Still clear?
E: about the shower
C: SHERRY
D: Yep.
C: JIM
D: We'll let it run awhile
N: JIM turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel. Sherry offers him another.
C: SHERRY
D: This one's clean.
N: JIM takes it and dries his hands. Sherry now stands very close to him. JIM sets the towel on the sink. It's a little awkward as they look into each other's eyes, standing so near.
C: SHERRY
D: I guess you'd better get to work huh? You're going to be late.
E: CONT'D
N: She slowly wraps her arms around Jim's neck and pulls him to her, a hug of gratitude and warmth -- nothing sexual here, just the embrace of two people in need of shelter from the storm of life. No, nothing sexual at all.
C: SHERRY
D: Thank you, Jim.
E: CONT'D
N: Now sherry begins to cry a little, and things begin to change -- hands wander, cheek brushes cheek. Finally lips meet, tenderly at first. And then it is a deluge.
S: INT. NOVOTNY LIVING ROOM DAY
N: JIM and Sherry stumble in from the hallway locked in an embrace. They rove around the room, barely able to keep their balance. Finally, they fall to the ground. CLOSE ON LITTLE DARRYL -- playing with his foot in the CRIB. Through the bars behind him we can discern the murky shape of Sherry and JIM rutting and grunting like wild boars.
S: EXT. NOVOTNY DRIVEWAY DAY
N: JIM starts his car. Sherry leans into his window. She looks around the neighborhood before kissing him firmly on the mouth.

D: Hey Yeah?

D: Right now?

E: VO CONT'D

N: Paul sits next to Lisa on the vinyl sofa. He wants to console her, but he doesn't know how.
C: PAUL
D: I just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose. It must have been some kind of mistake. Like a maintenance thing.
N: JIM enters.

D: Nowhere. I don't have class until second period.

C: TRACY
D: When I arrived at school that morning, I was shocked to find that one of my key banners had been removed by vandals. I noticed that a few of my rival's posters had also been tampered with. Of course, I was outraged, but one day before the election is not the time to lose your head over a couple of posters. When you're in the public eye, attacks like that just come with the territory.

N: She goes in and closes the door in our face.
S: INT. LITTLE CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
N: Tracy is seated in a chair. JIM hovers above her, alternately leaning on a desk and pacing.
C: JIM
D: I guess you know why you're here
C: TRACY
D: If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
C: JIM
D: A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it.
C: TRACY
D: Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious. I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
E: indignant
N: JIM stares at her.
C: TRACY
D: Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications. I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down. Did I do that too?
E: CONT'D
C: JIM
D: Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
C: TRACY
D: I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
C: JIM
D: 6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
C: TRACY
D: I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
C: JIM
D: Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we "interrogate?"
C: TRACY
D: well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
N: JIM shifts gears
C: JIM
D: You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities. But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that. And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
C: TRACY
D: Why are you lecturing me?
C: JIM
D: This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
C: TRACY
D: I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
C: JIM
D: I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
C: TRACY
D: And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
N: JIM draws a long breath as he tries to control himself
C: JIM
D: Okay, Tracy. Have it your way.
N: There's a KNOCK. JIM and Tracy turn to see TAMMY METZLER timidly poking her head in.
C: TAMMY
D: You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
C: JIM
D: Just wait outside. Tammy.
C: TAMMY
D: Okay. But is this about the posters?
C: JIM

S: INT. JIM AND DIANE'S KITCHEN NIGHT
N: JIM enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place. He opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer. As he closes the door, something catches his eye. He reaches inside and throws a plastic container away. Rooting around noisily, he finds other things to dispose of. Suddenly -- A BABY CRY stops him cold. JIM stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in. He carefully closes the refrigerator and tiptoes toward the living room.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
N: Jim's face slowly appears around the corner, bad eye first. Finally, he's able to see -- SHERRY AND DIANE together on the living room sofa, staring at him. Their eyes are red from crying.

N: He turns to leave, and nobody stops him.
S: EXT. JIM'S HOME -- NIGHT

C: JIM
D: As I walked out of my home that evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my entire life in question, I somehow discovered within myself a place of perfect peace. Oddly, in my solitude I felt more than ever a sense of communion with every human being - past, present and future. Because no matter what we tell ourselves, no matter what illusions of friendship and family we create, each of us is always and forever profoundly alone.

D: Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak with You and ask for things, but now I really must insist that You help me win the election tomorrow, because I deserve it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well know. l realize that it was Your divine hand that disqualified Tammy, and now I'm asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong, so that I may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven. If elected I promise that I will pray more often. Okay? Amen.
S: EXT. TAMMY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: FROM OVERHEAD -- Tammy wears a white t-shirt and underwear and kneels at her bedside.
C: TAMMY
D: Dear God, I know I don't believe in you, but since I'll be starting Catholic school soon, I thought I should practice. Let's see... what do I want? I want people to be nicer to each other. I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she has been and feel really bad and apologize for how she hurt me and know how much I still love her. In spite of everything, I still want Paul to win the election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy. I also want a really expensive pair of leather pants... and someday I want to be really good friends with Madonna. Love, Tammy

S: INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM
N: FROM OVERHEAD -- Paul lies in bed looking at the heavens beyond his ceiling,
C: PAUL
D: Dear God, thank You for all Your blessings. You have given me so many things, like good health, nice parents, a nice truck, and what I've been told is a large penis, and I'm very grateful. But I sure am worried about Tammy. In my heart I still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes she does get so weird and angry. Please help her be a happier person, because she's so smart and sensitive, and I love her. Also, I'm nervous about the election tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and all, but I know that's totally up to You. You'll decide who the best person is, and I'll accept it. And forgive my sins, whatever they may be. Amen.

TRACY (VO CONT'D) I remember she was so happy, like there was nothing in the world she'd rather be doing. Besides me and her job, I guess my mom doesn't have much of a life.

S: INT. JIM'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS
N: Reclined in his car seat, mouth open as he sleeps, JIM is awakened by the truck. His breath steams. His eye has turned bluish. He tries to wipe the condensation from the windshield, but it's on the outside.
S: EXT. SHERRY'S DRIVEWAY -- CONTINUOUS
N: JIM opens the door and looks around -- no sign of Sherry's car. He stiffly walks to the side of the garage and unzips his pants to pee. Now cradling his head on the roof of his car, JIM gathers what little strength he has, gets in, and tries to start the cold engine.
C: JIM
D: I had no choice but to go home. I needed to shower, get fresh clothes, explain what I could to Diane. But what was I going to say? That our marriage had become a charade? That making love with Sherry had given me a vision of a better life?

Maybe you've even had a chance to speak with them personally.

N: It's PASSING PERIOD, and the halls are jammed with students at their lockers and walking to class. JIM is walking quickly back to his classroom. He passes Paul.
C: PAUL
D: Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?
N: Jim doesn't even hear.
S: INT. CLASSROOM DAY
N: Larry is just finishing his count. The ballots are on a desk in front of him, neatly organized into three piles. JIM enters.
C: JIM
D: What d'you got?
E: impatient
C: LARRY
D: I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
C: JIM
D: You're kidding, right?
C: LARRY
D: I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
C: JIM
D: Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
N: Jim's use of profanity scares Larry, and he responds reluctantly
C: LARRY
D: It's a squeaker, Mr. M. I've got Tracy by a vote. Just one vote.
N: Jim, who hasn't cared about any of this today, suddenly takes note. He stares blankly at Larry as the news sinks in.
C: LARRY
D: Mr. M.?
E: CONT'D
C: JIM
D: Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
N: Jim-scoops up the three piles of ballots and takes them to his desk.
S: INT. HISTORY CLASS DAY
N: CLOSE ON DALE - a junior honors student. He is thinking. The wheels are turning, grinding. Finally --
C: DALE
D: Sputnik.
N: MR. FLAGG is lecturing, really trying to make history come alive. Tracy takes notes, but she is noticeably distracted.
C: MR. FLAGG
D: Right. And what year was that?
C: DALE
D: 1958?
C: MR. FLAGG
D: Almost. 1957. So the point here is when we found out about Sputnik, we got really scared. It seemed like no matter what we had and kept secret, they could develop it too. A-bombs, h-bombs, rocket ships. And this time we were behind them. So -- February 1961, Kennedy tells Congress and the American people he wants to go to the moon. May 1961, the Apollo program is announced...
N: Tracy just can't take it anymore. She abruptly stands up, takes the GIANT HALL PASS off the lip of the blackboard, and starts to leave. Mr. Flagg gives her a small nod.
S: INT. RAILWAY DAY
N: Tracy nears a room, a special room. She slows down and peeks in the window of the door. She sees -- LARRY FOUCH sitting at the back of the classroom, staring front. Tracy presses her face to see what Larry is staring at -- JIM at his desk counting ballots LARRY catches sight of Tracy in the window. TRACY crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look LARRY sneaks a guilty look at Jim, absorbed in his counting. Then, against his better judgment flashes Tracy a quick, furtive double THUMBS-UP. TRACY suddenly disappears from the window. IN THE EMPTY HALLWAY - Tracy pogos with unbridled joy
C: TRACY
D: You know that moment when they announce the winner of a beauty pageant? When Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes she's Miss America, and all she can do is scream and weep and hug the losers? I had my moment in the hallway that Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but myself.
E: VO
N: She pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the OTHER DOOR to Jim's classroom, the window behind which JIM is still busily doing his count.
S: INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY
N: JIM counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to himself.
C: JIM
D: I was at the end of my count when it happened. I'd come up with exactly the same numbers as Larry: Tracy had won the election by a single vote, 256 to 257. I was about to announce my tally when...
E: VO
N: JIM looks up and sees TRACY in the window, her face exploding with joy. She FREEZES. We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION. What actually occurs in a split-second is suspended in time
C: JIM
D: The sight of Tracy at that moment affected me in a way I can't fully explain. Part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face. Looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she wasn't sweet. And she wasn't innocent. She was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top. who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her? I had to stop her now.
E: VO CONT'D
N: Tracy UNFREEZES and darts out of sight. JIM glances at Larry. Larry is writing in a notebook. JIM'S HAND creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of TRACY VOTES. His fingers nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk. JIM coughs as beneath his desk he CRUMPLES THE BALLOTS into a ball and drops them into the wastepaper basket.
C: JIM
D: Larry?
C: LARRY
D: Yeah?
E: looking up
C: JIM
D: I think we've got a problem.
S: INT. WALT HENDRICKS'S OFFICE DAY
N: Walt is just finishing counting the ballots on his desk. Larry and JIM stand over him.
C: WALT
D: 253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
C: LARRY
D: No way I It doesn't make sense.
C: WALT
D: Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
C: LARRY
D: And 290 "disregards," right?
C: WALT
D: If you say so.
C: JIM
D: Mostly Tammy fans
C: LARRY
D: See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
C: JIM
D: He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
C: LARRY
D: But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
C: JIM
D: It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
C: LARRY
D: I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
C: WALT
D: Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
C: LARRY
D: I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
C: JIM
D: Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
E: stern
C: LARRY
D: But, Mr. M. -
C: WALT
D: Fouch, that's enough! End of story.
S: INT. MILLARD HIGH GYMNASIUM -- DAY
N: AN ASSEMBLY - The students are taking their seats on the bleachers. ON THE FLOOR are all the candidates: three for secretary, two for treasurer, one for vice-president, two for president. PAUL AND TRACY sit side-by-side. Paul seems a little overwhelmed by the whole thing. Tracy leans over and offers her hand.
C: TRACY
D: Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, you too, Tracy. I'm just glad it's over.
C: TRACY
D: Yeah.
N: CLOSE ON PAUL
C: PAUL
D: You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time. She was always super- nice to me.
E: VO
N: JIM approaches the microphone
C: JIM
D: If we could get started. People! Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay?
N: The students quiet down
C: JIM
D: Some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose. I think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today. All of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership.
E: CONT'D
N: OS TRACY - Jim's voice momentarily recedes.
C: TRACY
D: Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.
E: VO
C: JIM
D: That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done. We'll begin with president.
N: JIM pulls a folded paper from his back pocket
C: JIM
D: Let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race. It's my pleasure to announce the next president of Millard High School.
E: CONT'D
N: Tracy just can't wait. Smiling, she STANDS UP.
C: JIM
D: Paul Metzier!
N: The crowd breaks into applause -- and laughter ON TRACY - AS she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation Paul begins his acceptance speech. We cut alternately to a thrilled Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and to JIM, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and tasting of metal.
C: PAUL
D: Geez, you guys, thanks a lot. I mean, wow, thanks. I promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president. And I want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager. And I just want to say that I think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand.
N: The auditorium erupts into applause and whistles, and JIM takes the microphone again.
C: JIM
D: And now, for vice-president.
S: EXT. COCO'S BAKERY/RESTAURANT DUSK
N: In the growing darkness, the restaurant radiates its distinctive orange glow. The parking lot is nearly empty.
S: INT. COCO'S BAKERY/RESTAURANT DUSK
N: JIM sits alone at a booth by the window, finishing a slice of berry pie. He gets the attention of a WAITRESS and holds up his coffee cup.
C: JIM
D: Could I get a...?
N: As JIM gets his warm-up, in walk the Metziers: Paul, Dick and Jo. JIM notices them as they wait to be seated. He wishes he were invisible. As a PERKY HOSTESS leads the family to a table, Paul spots Jim. Here it comes.
C: PAUL
D: Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild. We came to celebrate my victory, and I can't believe it. Here, these are my parents.
N: JIM stands up awkwardly.

C: PAUL
D: I never would have ran if it wasn't for Mr. M.
C: JIM
D: Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's going places. You should be very proud.
C: JO
D: We are
C: DICK
D: Having a problem with your eye there?
C: JO
D: Dick.
C: JIM
D: Just a bee sting.
C: DICK
D: You ought to get that looked at. Shot of cortisone or something.
C: JIM
D: Thanks, I'll be fine.
C: DICK
D: Anyway, we're awful sorry about what went on with our other one, you know, our Tammy.
C: JO
D: We were mortified...
C: JIM
D: Oh, she's not a bad girl. She'll come around.
C: JO
D: ... but we've had some good talks, and I think we're sorting things out. We're starting her at Sacred Heart in the fall.
C: JIM
D: Good school.
C: DICK
D: Say, you're all alone, why don't you join us?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah!
C: JIM
D: Oh, no. No. I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
C: PAUL
D: Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
E: to his parents
C: DICK
D: All right. Well, sure nice to meet you.
C: JO
D: So nice
C: JIM
D: You bet.
N: The Metziers go, and- Paul slides in across from Jim.
C: PAUL
D: So, Mr. M, I was starting to think about ideas for next year. I was thinking it would be cool to have, like a carnival. With rides. And, you know, it could be for, like. Muscular Dystrophy.
N: JIM tries to smile and seem attentive, but we sense his profound fatigue and his profound sadness.
C: PAUL
D: And on Halloween we could have a haunted house. But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones. You know, more like the radio station ones. This one would be really scary. And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
E: CONT'D
C: JIM
D: Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later. A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
C: PAUL
D: Oh, okay. Yeah, sorry.
N: The wind out of his sails, Paul gets up and is about to go when
C: PAUL
D: Just one more thing. So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
E: CONT'D
C: JIM
D: Don't worry about Tracy. She'll be fine.
S: INT. TRACY'S BEDROOM NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON TRACY - her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted from crying.
C: TRACY
D: One vote... one vote
N: She falls again headlong again into the throes of despair. Her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry of pain. Her anguish grows convulsive. Barbara Flick comes in and sits on the bed. She's carrying a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and a glass of milk.
C: BARBARA
D: Why don't you take a couple of my pills, darling? You'll feel better.
N: Tracy takes the pills and sips the milk weakly. Her mother kisses her.
C: BARBARA
D: Don ' t worry. .. don ' t worry. . . sshhhhh... that's it, baby... that's it, darling. Everything's going to be fine.
E: CONT'D
N: She lays Tracy on the bed, and Tracy begins to quiet. Barbara kisses her again and rises to leave. At the door she pauses to add a few final words of comfort.
C: BARBARA
D: Maybe you needed more posters, honey. Or if you'd taken my suggestions about your speech. I don't know. We'll figure it out.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. MCAILISTER HOME NIGHT
N: JIM stands at his own back door, beaten and ashamed. He lifts a hand and knocks. After a moment the door opens, and there is Diane.
C: JIM
D: Diane, I...
N: Diane looks at JIM in silence. Her face reveals nothing, but there is a deadness in her eyes. After a moment, she turns back inside, leaving the door open. JIM follows his wife inside, closes the door. The camera moves to peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch JIM and Diane but cannot make out anything they say.
C: JIM
D: I don't know how Diane and I made it through that night, but we did. Our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end I guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other. So we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together. The worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us.

S: INT. MILLARD HIGH JIM'S CLASSROOM -- NIGHT
N: A WASTE BASKET peeks out from under Jim's desk. We hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak, and a shadowy head appears in the window. Keys jingle. The door opens, and Lowell turns on the lights. He approaches the waste basket and slides it out.

S: EXT. HILLARD HIGH (REAR PROJECTIOH) -- DAY
N: As JIM moves toward the parking lot, the school recedes in an odd REAR PROJECTION that suggests he is floating. The MUSIC here reinforces the gravity of the moment, the inevitability of his fate. JIM stops walking, and a disembodied STEEPING WHEEL floats into his hands. The scene behind changes to:

S: INT. GRIFFITH SATURN EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM DAY
N: The room consists of mismatched sofas and chairs around a coffee table. There's a TV that no one watches. Sleeves rolled up and tie loosened, JIM eats a sandwich next to TWO OTHER SALESMEN and a FEMALE ACCOUNTANT who like him are eating lunch and watching TV. NO one speaks.
C: JIM
D: So that's about it. Maybe I'll get back to teaching someday, but for the time being, I guess I'm pretty happy where I'm at.

E: low, as JIM passes

C: TRACY
D: Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think?
N: JIM just looks at Tracy - it's so very odd
C: JIM
D: Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.

D: My house.
N: Tracy sets the parking brake. Jim's eyes register a suppressed panic.
C: JIM
D: I don't understand. What's the deal?
N: Tracy looks deeply into Jim's eyes.
C: TRACY
D: I want you to do something for me.
C: JIM
D: Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
C: TRACY
D: I just have to get something. I'll be right back.

C: JIM
D: Oh, is this...? God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
E: thumbing through it
C: TRACY
D: Would you sign it for me?
N: Tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the blank pages at the beginning.
C: JIM
D: What a surprise.
C: TRACY
D: Take as much room as you want
N: JIM removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps it. He considers what to write.
C: TRACY

E: CONT'D
C: JIM
D: You'll be fine.
C: TRACY
D: I hope so
C: JIM
D: You will.
N: CLOSE ON JIM He looks at the yearbook. He looks at Tracy. He looks out the windshield. It's all so odd. CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write: "Dear Tracy,"
