M: TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
M: We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
M: distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
M: Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
M: In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
M: the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
M: HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
M: gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
M: landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
M: CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face the resplendent
M: Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr ont walk, able to
M: admire the manicured hedges and the black E scalade in the
M: driveway, to the front door decorated with a whimsical
M: placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we pass THROUGH THE
M: KEYHOLE into the foyer.
S: INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her side.
C: WOMAN
D: Yes Donna, I'm out the door. We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the kitchen, unable to see her face.
E: into phone
C: WOMAN
D: Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and I'll be there as soon as I can. Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she talks.
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: And promise her she's about to have a woooonnderful labor. As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket. They give each other a silent wave.
E: CONT'D
C: WOMAN
D: Right, I'll see you in twenty. She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead.
E: CONT'D
C: JESSICA
D: Buenas dias, Rosario.
C: ROSARIO
D: Good morning Miss Jessica. Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY. In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Honey? Honey, wake up. Pick up the- And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips-- SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion. Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark. Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --
E: on machine
C: LEAD GUNMAN
D: Get away from there! Don't touch that -- !! -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!! He blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica.
C: LEAD GUNMAN
D: Where is he? Jessica cringes.
E: CONT'D dire
C: JESSICA
D: Where is who?
C: LEAD GUNMAN
D: Wrong answer. The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold. Then he turns to his men.
C: LEAD GUNMAN
D: Search the house. And as the answering machine fills the silence:
E: CONT'D
C: CRAIG VO
D: -I'll call back later. The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness of his masked face.

S: EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
N: The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing. As the van stops-- WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:
S: INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
N: A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--
C: THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
D: Standing in front of her. Sturdier than the rest. Solid. Imposing.
C: JESSICA
D: Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her --
C: JESSICA
D: No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --
E: CONT'D
N: JESSICA (CONT'D)
C: NO! PLEASE--//
D: SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--
C: JESSICA
D: Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.
E: CONT'D
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: THE OCEAN
D: Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA
N: PIER.
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
N: It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.
S: INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING
N: ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN. The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed. Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is: RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi Master of the game. Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the screen.
C: RYAN
D: You recording this?
C: CHAD
D: Yeah, sure... CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone. Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes on the shoulder.
E: OS
C: RYAN
D: Move, bitch. He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD." Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.
C: KID
D: Nice. The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.
C: RYAN
D: Get that? Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.
C: CHAD
D: Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum Monster in Hi-Def videostream-
C: RYAN
D: C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that. Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".
C: CHAD
D: Sweet. It's going to my email right now. S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad wipes it dry on his pants.
E: through cup-holding teeth
C: RYAN
D: Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in seven days.
C: CHAD
D: They aren't giving you shit yet?
C: RYAN
D: Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else. Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames. Game Over.
T: CUT TO:
C: THE OCEAN
D: As seen looking over the rail of the pier. The tide is in, but it's still a forty foot drop.
N: RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal.
C: CHAD
D: Go already. No one's looking. His left hand holds his WALLET.
C: CHAD
D: Need me to hold that? Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.
E: CONT'D re: wallet
C: RYAN
D: Waterproof. But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left leg starts trembling like crazy.
C: RYAN
D: This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick another dare. Chad lowers the phone, irritated.
E: CONT'D
C: CHAD
D: My ass. Not after you made me march in the Gay Pride Parade wearing a thong.
C: RYAN
D: Screw it then. In one... Two... Two and a half--
C: CHAD
D: Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot. Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to the deck.
C: CHAD
D: Just so you know, I'm emailing this to every chick you ever met. But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare. His eyes are glued to something else--
E: CONT'D
C: CHAD
D: Transmitting pussy file now. CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the "Heal The Bay" rally. Ryan walks over like he owns the place.
E: CONT'D speaking like HAL 900
C: RYAN
D: Got any more? I'm here to help.
C: CHLOE
D: Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.
C: RYAN
D: What's in 'em? Chloe opens the box. Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.
C: RYAN
D: Cool, you're handing these out during the concert?
E: CONT'D
C: CHLOE
D: Yeah, wanna help? Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.
C: RYAN
D: Hell yeah. I'm all about "Heal the Bay. " His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.
C: RYAN
D: Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course... An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade... I'm surprised I haven't seen you. He offers his hand.
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: Ryan. She takes it.
E: CONT'D
C: CHLOE
D: Chloe. The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other. Chad splits.
C: CHLOE
D: I can't tell if you're full of it. Ryan stops posturing, gets real.
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there all
C: RYAN
D: the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back.
E: CONT'D
C: CHLOE
D: Maybe you and I can take a break later when Pat Benatar goes on.
C: RYAN
D: Sounds like a plan. There's a moment... Then --
C: CHLOE
D: Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to pick up a box of T-shirts at the Kinkos on Venice.
C: RYAN
D: I'll do it for you... if you want.
C: CHLOE
D: Seriously, you would?
C: RYAN
D: Sure. How much is the bill?
C: CHLOE
D: Nothing. It's been paid up front.
C: RYAN
D: Do you promise not to go anywhere?
C: CHLOE
D: Done. Ryan makes a graceful exit. Turns back.
C: RYAN
D: Okay, I won't be long.
C: CHLOE
D: Bye. Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:
E: laughing
C: RYAN
D: Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VENICE - DAY
N: A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice neighborhood. Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now sits on the shotgun seat. Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush. He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing. Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone.
C: RYAN
D: Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light.
E: into phone
C: RYAN
D: Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING. It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn. When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily.
E: CONT'D quickly adding
C: RYAN
D: What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED
E: CONT'D covering his ear
N: WITH STATIC.
C: RYAN
D: Dex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.
E: CONT'D into phone

S: INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC
N: ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone, foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS, tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:
C: RYAN
D: Hello...? Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a desperate hope filling her eyes.

D: Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone... Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably. Desperate, fearful and frustrated.

E: VO

N: INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN FORD BRONCO/JESSICA BOUND IN ATTIC SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again. He considers everything Jessica has said, then:

C: RYAN
D: Oh, it's like that, huh? Nice with the fake tears, lady...
C: JESSICA
D: Please... I just need help. But Ryan won't be manipulated.
C: RYAN
D: You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else.
C: JESSICA
D: These men!!!-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control.
C: JESSICA
D: These men killed my housekeeper. My dog. You have to help me. Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.
E: CONT'D
C: RYAN
D: No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier.

D: Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room. Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the Gangbanger back over to the holding cells. Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.
C: ON THE TELEVISION
D: a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him, FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court; being led away in handcuffs.
C: NEWS REPORTER
D: ...was somber when the indictments came down this afternoon in the 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Though the names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney stated that this was merely the "tip of the iceberg" and that unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the investigations proceed.

C: PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM
D: Attention travelers. Due to a security problem, all persons are required to clear the terminal and return immediately to the security checkpoint at the entrance to Concourse B...

Ryan stops and stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE HELMET hanging on the handlebars. The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the Messenger hot on his heels.

Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty cops enter, brushing right past him. Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter, desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet. Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area, but knows better than to make any waves.

C: MAIL CLERK
D: Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard? Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

D: Sees Greer and Hodges coming. Big-ass guns out and ready. Shit.' THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM. PEOPLE start filling the stairwell on every floor. Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof. He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the stressed metal. Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear. Desperate to console her, Ryan -- BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks up to see it angrily launching itself right at him! He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit. He presses himself to one side but -- WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS
N: SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE! Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

N: The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he checks it out and-- DEASON
C: WHAT THE--?!
D: WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR. And it's lit. Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away toward the attic...

D: Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.
N: DEASON (CONT'D) WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! JESSICA NO, DON 'T H URT M E-- Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand. HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR, shattering it in a million pieces around her. Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip. DEASON YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD! She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath... You win.
C: JESSICA
D: Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--
C: DEASON
D: Oooh. --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. Deason drains white; dizzy. He looks at Jessica, confused.
E: sarcastic

D: Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic.

She's on her own. When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the glass. Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns. When her son sees her, he races to the bars.

D: Drop your gun, now. I got you. Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some cover, gun aimed and steady.

And just when he's thinking that he may have successfully created an element of surprise for himself-- SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY! Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang-- But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Two miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER! OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of- BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload-- Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.
C: MOONEY
D: Damn it! DAMN IT!! Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her gun away and kneels. But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough. Just scared.

Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.

C: TOMLIN
D: It's over kid. Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end of the pier. MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.
C: TOMLIN
D: For all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. Where is it? Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him. Like a nightmare, he closes in. Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up.

C: CROWD GOER
D: Dude's gotta gun! Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground. He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT! SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as he spins headlong into the Pacific! TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the CHOPPY WATER below.

The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon! Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater, BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.

C: TOMLIN
D: You're wounded kid, just give me what I came for, and I'll let you all go. Police sirens in the distance grow louder. Tomlin's offer goes unanswered. That's when he notices the BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends! It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit! He's gonna have to search this whole place-- Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone, making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT MESSAGE to-- x95 EXT.

Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.
