M: SCRIPT AS SHOT COMPILED SEPTEMBER 2006
T: FADE UP ON
N: THE SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECTS. A MAZE OF BUILDINGS AGAINST THE HARBOR.
C: COSTELLO
D: I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product...of me.
E: V.O.
N: YELLOW RIPPLES PAST THE CAMERA AND WHEN IT CLEARS WE SEE THROUGH DIESEL SMOKE: A BUSING PROTEST IN PROGRESS. THE SCHOOL-BUS, FULL OF BLACK KIDS, IS HIT WITH BRICKS, ROCKS. N.B.: (THIS IS NOT SETTING THE LIVE ACTION IN 1974; IT IS A HISTORICAL MONTAGE, THE BACKGROUND FOR COSTELLO'S V.O.).
S: INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY.
N: COSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room.
C: COSTELLO
D: Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS
N: The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island. Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.
C: COSTELLO
D: Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chaps it's this. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.
E: V.O.
S: INT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY
N: COSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: Don't make me have to come down here again.
E: leaning over cluttered counter
C: PROPRIETOR
D: Won't happen again, Mr. C.
N: The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener. His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis. YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish. COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen?
N: The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: You Johnny Sullivan's kid?
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN nods.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: You live with your grandmother?
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN nods.
C: YOUNG COLIN
D: Yeah.
N: COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.
C: COSTELLO
D: Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup.
N: He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.
C: COSTELLO
D: Do you like comic books?
E: CONT'D
N: Colin nods. He adds a couple of comic books. When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: You do good in school?
N: YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.
C: COLIN
D: Yes.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: That's good. I did good in school. They call that a paradox.
N: He gives some money to Carmen.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the change.
E: CONT'D
N: Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it. Colin does.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: You ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street.
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN nods: everybody does.
C: YOUNG COLIN
D: Thank you.
N: He pushes out with the bags of groceries. The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it. YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy street.
S: INT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH
N: YOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense.
C: PRIEST
D: To you, O Lord we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the sight of this world he is now dead; in your sight may he live forever. Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting peace.
E: V.O.
C: ALL
D: Amen.
N: CLOSE on COLIN'S face.
C: PRIEST
D: May the angels lead you into paradise; May the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the holy city, The new and eternal Jerusalem.
E: VO
N: A liturgical bell tings.
S: INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY
N: COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing). YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older, is among them.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: Church wants you in your place. What sort of man wants to be kept in his place? Do this don't do that, kneel, stand, kneel, stand...I mean if you go for that sort of thing...
N: YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for that sort of thing.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. Non serviam.
E: CONT'D a beat
C: YOUNG COLIN
D: James Joyce.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: Him and Lucifer. And me. Guineas from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do...And something maybe happened to them.
E: to the room
S: EXT. A REMOTE BEACH. DAWN
N: Rose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who
T: has just been executed.
C: COSTELLO
D: Jeez, she fell funny.
N: FRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand.
C: FRENCH
D: Frank, you gotta see somebody.
N: They go about their business.
S: INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY
N: YOUNG COSTELLO walking, talking...Not continuous with the above. We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: You decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you, the Church.
N: MISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: When I was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you are facing a loaded gun...
E: CONT'D
N: very close on COSTELLO, holding Colin's shoulder.
C: YOUNG COSTELLO
D: What's the difference?
E: CONT'D
N: ECU: COLIN'S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN'S EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the "age leap"...on the unchanging eyes. THE SAME EYES. Pull back to reveal: POLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing.
C: INSTRUCTOR
D: The slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes through the brain...
N: COLIN writes.
S: INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY
N: POLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee.
S: EXT. A TRAINING FIELD. DAY
N: STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming down his face. His opinion on the experience is not decipherable. Ad libs: "Sir, yes, sir."
S: EXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY
N: Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.
C: COLIN
D: Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire. Or pussy.
N: COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light behind. Misty golden beauty.
C: BARRIGAN
D: What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, and his son's only a cop.
C: COLIN
D: You're in trouble if you're "only" anything.
E: not vainglorious, but innocently stretching for the idea
C: BARRIGAN
D: Don't tell me I'm looking at the first dickhead-American president of the United States.
N: COLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to pretend that he does. He smiles.
S: EXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY
N: Bagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN.
C: SPEAKER
D: The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity.
E: V.O.
N: CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person, through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.
C: THE MAYOR VO
D: Congratulations. You are dismissed.
N: The bagpipe band plays "Minstrel Boy." COLIN'S POV: AN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the car. COLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX. COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE: The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.
C: COSTELLO
D: School's out. You earned it. Yeah, no more teachers, no more books.
S: INT. AN EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY
N: TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their hair has grown in. A CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around. BILLY'S EYES on it.
C: INSTRUCTOR
D: Begin.
E: O.S.
N: BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying to read the questions.
S: EXT. A TRACK. DAY
N: BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running, alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs.
C: BROWN
D: She tells me, you never finish anything. You finish the police course you get taken care of again baby. So after graduation I get a blowjob again.
E: puff puff puff puff puff puff
C: BILLY
D: That's great. Your mom must be a wonderful woman.
C: BROWN
D: Fuck yourself.
C: BILLY
D: Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.
C: BROWN
D: Ways to get ahead, though, man, ways to get ahead.
C: BILLY
D: To where.
E: exasperated by this Yeah
N: BROWN is left thinking about this.
S: EXT. TRAINING FIELD. DAY
N: BILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI.
C: DRILL INSTRUCTOR
D: This is not the regular police. This is the state police. Your training will illustrate the difference. What's the difference?
C: BILLY
D: Rage issues and lower median IQ.
E: sotto voce to BROWN
C: DRILL INSTRUCTOR
D: You say something?
C: BILLY
D: Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir.
C: DRILL INSTRUCTOR
D: We're not superior, we're the best.
C: BILLY
D: Sir, yes sir.
S: INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY
N: BILLY, in glasses and ear-protectors, waiting for the target. Go from the GUN to
S: INT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY.
N: COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job, on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.
C: COLIN
D: Douchebag!
E: calling to other cops
N: COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The smartest guy in the room.
S: EXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY
N: BILLY fires, and changes clips.
S: EXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY
N: A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses and walks towards the door.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher.
C: QUEENAN
D: Congratulations on passing the detective exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit.
C: DIGNAM
D: Whoop-di fuckin' do.
E: tonelessly
C: QUEENAN
D: We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. You're a worker, you rise fast.
E: contemplating him
C: DIGNAM
D: Like a twelve year old's dick.
E: Alt: Like a turd in the pool.
C: COLIN
D: Thank you, Sergeant.
C: DIGNAM
D: My pleasure.
C: COLIN
D: Thank you, sir.
E: to Queenan
N: He turns to go.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM. DAY
N: As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues, and walks on.
C: QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
D: Congratulations.
E: whispering, joyful, in love with COLIN
C: COLIN
D: Thanks, hon.
N: As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and:
C: QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
D: You can go in there now.
E: coldly
N: BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen him. He has his interview on his mind.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER
N: BILLY stands at attention. The picture of a spit-and-polish trainee.
C: QUEENAN
D: You can sit.
N: BILLY does.
C: QUEENAN
D: So.
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass. Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt, stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he seems.
C: QUEENAN
D: Do you know what we do here? My section?
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY doesn't want to answer unless he can answer correctly.
C: BILLY
D: Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea...
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Whoa, let's say you have no idea and leave it there. No idea. Zip, none. If you had an idea about what we do we would not be good at what we do. We would be cunts. Are you calling us cunts?
N: BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does. He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at him. BILLY looks evenly at QUEENAN.
C: QUEENAN
D: Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own. I'm afraid we all have to deal with it.
E: not looking up from papers
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: You have family connections down in Southie. Through your father. Tell us about your uncle Jackie.
E: getting to business, hard
C: BILLY
D: Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.
E: MORE
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: He got popped by Nicastro in '95. They found his body out by the airport.
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY says slowly:
C: BILLY
D: That's right. I remember his funeral.
E: tightly
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Closed casket?
E: cruelly
C: BILLY
D: That's right.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: You tell anybody at Deerfield - that is, before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that?
N: BILLY says nothing. Eyes luminous.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: I got a question. How fucked up are you?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CORRIDOR POLICE BUILDING. DAY
N: COLIN, in his good suit, moves along the hall. He owns the building. He looks into offices. He is looking at his future. From one room BARRIGAN (still working in uniform) gives him the thumbs up. COLIN gets a coffee. He looks at a secretary's ass. Caught at it, he smiles beautifully. She smiles back.
C: BARRIGAN
D: What you got? "Staff Sergeant". In four years you're a sergeant.
E: with admiration and envy
C: COLIN
D: SIU. What a country.
C: BARRIGAN
D: Perfect.
E: after a beat
N: Meaning to some extent "Perfect for a dick like you". This is how friends come apart. BARRIGAN is unable to continue his pose of congratulation. COLIN (close on Colin) is on to him.
C: COLIN
D: I don't mind going it alone. If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself.
C: BARRIGAN
D: We're cops. This isn't "somewhere".
C: COLIN
D: I know you're a worker. I might be able to do something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade Poland.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: BILLY is still at attention. DIGNAM going with wet thumb through papers.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Let's look at the rest of the family tree. Your maggot uncle Tommy Costigan--he's another goof-- got busted selling guns to federal officers. Among many, many, many other departures from, ah, "normative behavior".
N: QUEENAN is inspecting Billy, watching his reactions. Specs catching light.
C: BILLY
D: What's this got to do with me?
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Why are you pretending to be a cop?
S: INT. OCS CONFERENCE ROOM. CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN is eyeing a woman COP across the table. She smiles at him and lowers her eyes. At the end of the table:
C: ELLERBY
D: This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.
E: MORE
C: ELLERBY
D: This is an elite unit. Our job is to smash--or at least marginally disrupt-- --organized crime in this city by our own efforts and by enhanced cooperation with the FBI, represented here by Agent Frank Lazio-- and we will do it. And by organized crime in this city...you know who we mean.
E: CONT'D he gets the laugh he expected show the deeply unreliable dandy LAZIO
N: SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS come up. COSTELLO in sunglasses standing in front of the Autobody shop. COSTELLO standing with UNCLE JACKIE COSTIGAN.
C: ELLERBY
D: That's Jackie Costigan...that's an old picture. Jackie met his demise.
E: CONT'D clicking the button
N: PHOTO OF JACKIE'S DEMISE: PHOTO OF JACKIE, DEAD.
C: ELLERBY
D: Last known photograph.
E: CONT'D
N: MORE RECENT PHOTOS. FITZY, DELAHUNT, FRENCH, all photographed with COSTELLO. Coming out of buildings, talking on the street, getting into cars.
C: ELLERBY
D: Costello uses three key guys. There's Fitzy...off the boat psycho...lives in Brockton with his mother who looks like she's straight out of "Going My Way"... There's Delahunt, muscle, and here's French...the number one. But of course the rock star is...[you know who]
E: CONT'D
N: A picture of COSTELLO comes up. COLIN looks at it. In the MUG SHOT Costello is serene, untouchable legally, untouchable at the heart. He's like a hilarious devil.
C: ELLERBY
D: We've done a briefing book. Read up.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: ELLERBY
D: I want to have any and all ideas, so I can pass them off as my own. Do your jobs and you will rise fast. You're in the best position in the department. Let's go to work.
E: CONT'D laughter, a long beat
N: The recruits disperse into a glittering modern office. COLIN, in his flash suit, gets a cup of coffee. He looks at the BRIEFING BOOK. He opens to a picture of COSTELLO.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: DIGNAM still working Billy.
C: DIGNAM
D: Your old man was a hump from Southie. Baggage-handler at the airport. Family's all criminals except your old man.
C: BILLY
D: And one priest. Since you seem to know everything.
C: DIGNAM
D: I ain't sure about him, either. Family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there. Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La di da.
E: ALT: Last I heard he was happily married to a 12 year old boy and living on a beach in Thailand. fuckin'
N: Dignam leans over Billy.
C: DIGNAM
D: You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class in the week, and then dropping your 'r's and hanging in the Southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends. I got that right?
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY, opened up expertly and crudely, stares with contained hatred.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: You have different accents? You did, didn't you. You were different fuckin' people.
E: You little fuckin' snake.
C: BILLY
D: You a psychiatrist?
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: If I was I'd ask you why you're a Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties?
C: BILLY
D: Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right?
C: QUEENAN
D: Who said that?
E: appreciative, kindly, looking up from his papers
C: BILLY
D: Hawthorne.
N: SGT. DIGNAM (although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne is) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him with an "I'm going to kill you" expression which is not without wit and which Dignam seems to admire.
C: DIGNAM
D: What's the matter, smartass? You don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare?
C: QUEENAN
D: We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV...
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: A lot of em just want to slam a nigger's head through a plate glass window.
C: BILLY
D: I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant.
C: DIGNAM
D: What the fuck did you say to me, trainee?
E: after a "we got a live one" glance at Queenan
N: BILLY looks at him, and then looks forward.
C: BILLY
D: Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me?
C: DIGNAM
D: Hey asshole, he can't help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop.
C: QUEENAN
D: He's right. We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper.
E: Billy looks at Queenan
C: BILLY
D: You sure of that?
C: QUEENAN
D: I'm sure of that.
C: DIGNAM
D: Guaranteed.
C: QUEENAN
D: You don't have much family.
E: looking up from his papers
N: CLOSE ON BILLY.
C: BILLY
D: I don't have any family.
E: deciding this on the spot
S: EXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY
N: A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line, is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums. BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry young man at his life's turning point.
S: INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER
N: BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights. A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air. Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.
S: EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER
N: BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not- bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY, hands in the pocket of a good suit.
C: WASP UNCLE
D: What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?
C: BILLY
D: You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie?
C: UNCLE
D: That Stephanie.
C: BILLY
D: Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.
C: UNCLE
D: Are you trying to prove something to the family?
C: BILLY
D: When you say "family", what do you mean? You?
C: UNCLE
D: You always question everything, don't you?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. "Am I an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?" "Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" Those are questions. "Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?" Too late now, right?
E: the UNCLE starts to leave he's stung THE UNCLE
C: UNCLE
D: Do you need some money for the funeral?
N: THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat.
C: BILLY
D: When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it?
S: EXT. BOSTON. TWILIGHT
N: AERIAL. FLY FROM the HOSPITAL TO: THE GOLD DOME ON BEACON HILL
S: INT. AN APARTMENT ON BEACON HILL. TWILIGHT
N: A REALTOR switches on lights. An empty, flash apartment above the Parisian rooftops of Beacon Hill. A view of the Dome. More than you'd think a cop could afford. We see, as COLIN does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE DOME.
C: REALTOR
D: This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.... Joke...not a very good one. So, you're a policeman?
E: uneasy
C: COLIN
D: I'm a State Police detective.
E: like something he is used to reciting
C: REALTOR
D: State Police Detective. You a married State Police Detective?
E: wondering where he gets his money from
C: COLIN
D: ...No.
E: coming out of his reverie and coldly:
C: REALTOR
D: Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop...
C: COLIN
D: I have a cosigner.
C: REALTOR
D: You intend to have a housemate. That's cool.
C: COLIN
D: Give me the fuckin' papers.
S: EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT
N: BILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He's smoking a cigarette, making his decision.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: Continuation of the interview.
C: BILLY
D: So what do I do?
C: QUEENAN
D: During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we'll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't...
E: a beat MORE
C: QUEENAN
D: By the way, this isn't police work for peanuts. There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free.
E: CONT'D
N: QUEENAN writes on a slip of paper and hands it to BILLY. BILLY looks up from the paper, impressed.
C: DIGNAM
D: Luck of the Irish. All that and you're still young enough to fuck undergraduates.
C: QUEENAN
D: We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense.
C: DIGNAM
D: Given your nature.
C: QUEENAN
D: You'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it's no set- up. You'll be on probation. The whole nine yards.
C: DIGNAM
D: I need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.
N: BILLY looks up with a glazed insolence. In one beat he is not a scared trainee but a smart criminal.
C: BILLY
D: Every weekend...Sergeant.
C: DIGNAM
D: Perfect.
C: QUEENAN
D: Do it again. For me.
S: EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT
N: BILLY throws down his cigarette. He has decided. FILM TITLE: THE DEPARTED
S: EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
N: Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy seems to have no real connection with any of them. LATER BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind- blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is signed: "F. Costello".
S: INT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY
N: A CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal. Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is in a holding tank.
S: EXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
N: COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston. THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied: worried.
S: INT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY
N: BILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not trying to be friendly.
C: OTHER PRISONER
D: You're Bill Costigan?
C: BILLY
D: Who wants to know?
C: OTHER PRISONER
D: Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L Street.
C: BILLY
D: My cousin.
C: OTHER PRISONER
D: Connected but not too bright-- No offense.
E: BILLY looks at him with an only-I-can-insult-my- cousin look
N: Billy gets his clothes.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY
N: On the wall is a rogues gallery of COSTELLO and all his primary guys...MISTER FRENCH, DELAHUNT, FITZY. COLIN and others sitting listening. COLIN, reading a paper (Boston Herald) which may or may not have the headline, CASE DROPPED AGAINST DRUGS CADET (featuring a picture of Billy), looks up as SGT. DIGNAM comes in.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Sorry I'm late.
C: ELLERBY
D: Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sgt. Dignam.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: OK. They're out there, my people. They're like the fuckin' Indians. You're not gonna see them. You're not gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy.
C: ELLERBY
D: Fuck yourself.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: I'm tired from fucking your wife.
C: ELLERBY
D: How's your mother?
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Good. She's tired from fucking my father. OK, today, girls, what I got for you is microprocessors.
E: opens a FILE
N: LAZIO, the Fed, comes in and sits down. With folders, pencil.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on "America's Technology Highway". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: What was his name? The, ah, departed.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in...
C: LAZIO
D: South Boston?
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Who forged your transcript, dickhead?
C: COLIN
D: I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.
C: ELLERBY
D: We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello.
N: COLIN stands down, embarrassed.
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: We got a guy says that he hears Costello is moving the processors to China...that he set up the whole fuckin' job and popped Kennefick. You don't want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.
E: LAZIO is writing, lawyerish.
C: ELLERBY
D: We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI ...
E: Bureau
C: LAZIO
D: Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently?
C: SGT. DIGNAM
D: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day.
S: EXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY
N: BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen cylinder, smoking.
C: BILLY'S AUNT
D: Billy?
N: BILLY nods.
C: BILLY
D: Aunt Cathy?
N: His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he is. But he might well love his aunt.
C: BILLY'S AUNT
D: Good to see you. Good to see you.
S: INT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY
N: BILLY is eating soup.
C: BILLY'S AUNT
D: They said you were in the Staties, I couldn't believe it.
C: BILLY
D: I got kicked out about four months ago.
C: SEAN
D: It was in the papers.
N: Sean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it off. He has been at a funeral.
C: BILLY
D: Well. So you know.
C: SEAN
D: And why are we graced with your presence?
C: BILLY
D: I brought your mother some pictures of my father.
N: It's true. They are on the table.
C: BILLY
D: My mother had them. My mother's dead.
E: CONT'D
C: SEAN
D: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your troubles.
E: reflexively
N: Sean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY. He opens one for himself.
C: SEAN
D: I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact. You workin'?
E: CONT'D affably to Billy
C: BILLY
D: No.
S: EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER
N: Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer.
C: SEAN
D: When did I see you after that?
C: BILLY
D: Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think.
C: SEAN
D: Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'...All of them. That was a night.
N: Sean looks deflated.
C: BILLY
D: Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance.
C: SEAN
D: Yeah?
C: BILLY
D: In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back?
C: SEAN
D: My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars.
C: BILLY
D: That's what I'm saying.
N: Sean nods, and nods.
C: SEAN
D: You know what we usually say at these moments.
C: BILLY
D: You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin.
S: INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT
N: BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear.
C: SEAN
D: Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
N: He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.
C: SEAN
D: Double the money, double the fun. Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is for Ricans...P is for pigs...
E: CONT'D high as a kite confusing his TV jingles
N: They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer.
C: SEAN
D: I can't stop drinkin.
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY laughs.
C: BILLY
D: Why would you even think of stopping drinking?
C: SEAN
D: He don't like it. He don't like drinkin...he don't like fightin... ...he says stay out of the bars... You know, we're not even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin' Worcester.
E: Sean looks sad
C: BILLY
D: Who says?
C: SEAN
D: He says. Costello says. God says, as far as you're concerned.
S: INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
N: Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer.
C: SEAN
D: Not a cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks like his shit don't stink but he's good people.
C: VILLAIN
D: Cunt cop.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I knew his father. I liked his uncle Jackie better.
C: SEAN
D: Uncle Jackie was excellent.
C: AN IRISH VILLAIN
D: Fucking guineas.
N: They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering at the bar.
C: BILLY
D: A cranberry juice.
C: WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR
D: It's a natural diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she got her period. You got your period?
E: to BILLY
N: BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH. Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the hook.
C: BILLY
D: Get your hands off me.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Do you know me?
C: BILLY
D: No.
N: BILLY shakes his head no.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I'm the guy who tells you there are guys you hit and there are guys you don't. That's not quite a guy you can't hit, but it's almost a guy you can't hit, so I'm fucking ruling on it right now that you don't hit him, understand?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah. Excellent. Fine.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I know you. I know your family. Also I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet cousin I'll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Now you know me.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah.
N: A beat: they stare at each other.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: What are you drinking?
C: BILLY
D: Cranberry juice.
N: A beat.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: What is it, your period?
N: BILLY laughs.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Get him a cranberry juice.
E: CONT'D
N: The WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG is bleeding, incredulous. MISTER FRENCH takes him by the shoulder.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: (sotto voce to WELL-
E: CONT'D
C: DRESSED SCUMBAG)
D: That's Jackie's nephew.
C: WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG
D: Oh...
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Oh, what?
N: FRENCH demolishes him with body blows.
C: FRENCH
D: Get the fuck out of here.
S: EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY
N: COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes) stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking whiskey at 9 in the morning.
C: COLIN
D: Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him?
C: MRS KENNEFICK
D: Allegedly.
C: COLIN
D: "Allegedly".
E: grimaces
C: MRS KENNEFICK
D: If he was killed he probably did something wrong.
C: COLIN
D: You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That's not what you think he did wrong.
N: MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.
S: INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. DAY.
N: Costello and Gwen are in the car. Gwen is dressed like Jackie O.
C: COSTELLO
D: Wave to your girlfriend.
S: EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY.
C: MRS KENNEFICK
D: I mean fuck yourself.
N: She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery van.
C: COLIN
D: You get that?
C: BARRIGAN
D: "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself?"
C: COLIN
D: Welcome to the neighborhood.
S: EXT. AN INTERSECTION. MOMENTS LATER
N: FRENCH pulls up to a light. [COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a snarl of traffic.]
C: COSTELLO
D: Cut 'em here.
N: French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the follow cars behind.
C: COSTELLO
D: Bye, bye.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY
N: COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age, beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees policemen.
C: COLIN
D: Making a house call?
C: MADOLYN
D: Have I seen you professionally?
C: COLIN
D: No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are.
N: MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively) sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted by him.
C: COLIN
D: When guys have to "use their "service revolvers" in the "course of duty" they get to talk to you about their "feelings" and whatnot.
E: CONT'D
N: MADOLYN laughs.
C: COLIN
D: No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: I have an appointment on this floor.
E: laughing
N: The door opens.
C: COLIN
D: That's good. They're all fuckin' crazy on that floor. I'm one floor up.
E: points up
C: MADOLYN
D: Oh, fancy policeman.
C: COLIN
D: That's right. Fancy.
C: MADOLYN
D: Are you a Statie?
N: After she steps out he prevents the door from closing.
C: COLIN
D: Yeah, I'm also getting my law degree.
C: MADOLYN
D: Suffolk, nights?
C: COLIN
D: They don't run Harvard Law at night, last time I checked.
C: MADOLYN
D: When was the last time you checked?
C: COLIN
D: Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
C: MADOLYN
D: I went to U Mass. I wasn't insulting you.
C: COLIN
D: Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner.
C: MADOLYN
D: Maybe you could shoot someone and I'd have to see you professionally.
C: COLIN
D: Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you.
N: MADOLYN hands him a card.
C: COLIN
D: I don't need a card, I'm a detective.
E: CONT'D
N: She hesitates. He takes the card.
C: COLIN
D: I'm only joking. Nice to meet you... "Madolyn".
E: CONT'D
N: The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open, the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.
C: COLIN
D: I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day.
E: CONT'D walking, voice low
S: INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING
N: The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN, all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog on separate document]. Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....
C: BILLY
D: You guys from Providence?
N: The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene. BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.
C: PROPRIETOR
D: What have you done to my place! Get out of here.
N: BILLY goes.
S: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT
N: BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might have dated her. Not in this one.
S: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT
N: A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.
C: COLIN
D: You also do probation work, right?
C: MADOLYN
D: That's right. I see "violent offenders".
C: COLIN
D: Bad guys.
C: MADOLYN
D: That's one way to look at it. Not necessarily.
N: COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives: some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.
C: COLIN
D: That have this and they don't have duck l'orange.
N: MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long bitterness over the duck l'orange.
C: MADOLYN
D: Was your dinner OK?
C: COLIN
D: Oh, the lobster was excellent. I just thought, French restaurant...
E: holding balloon of inappropriate wine
N: The look at the dessert.
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm waiting for you to make your move.
C: COLIN
D: I don't know what you're gonna do, but if it moves I'm going to arrest it .
E: shoot it
N: MADOLYN laughs. COLIN sees his shot: he's got her laughing.
C: COLIN
D: What's it like having people "find themselves?" All day long people "finding themselves." Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room?
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: Why, does that make you uncomfortable?
N: Colin stares at her. Water glass nearly goes over.
C: MADOLYN
D: You know what Freud said about the Irish?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Yes I do.
C: MADOLYN
D: If you actually do I'll see you again.
C: COLIN
D: Who says I want to see you again?
C: MADOLYN
D: Don't you?
E: concerned, perhaps unexpectedly
C: COLIN
D: Yes, course I do. What Freud said about the Irish is We're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis.
E: a beat
N: MADOLYN is impressed.
C: COLIN
D: Tough luck for you with a client list of Mick cops, isn't it. "Opening up"? Good luck to you.
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN laughs but looks nervous about the concept of "opening up".
C: COLIN
D: Why do you do it?
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: Some people do get better.
N: COLIN takes it seriously; admires it.
C: COLIN
D: Fair enough.
C: MADOLYN
D: Sometimes, though, I want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.
N: Unsaid: Like I do.
C: COLIN
D: Including the criminals?
C: MADOLYN
D: If they don't do their jobs you don't have one.
C: COLIN
D: Me? I'd just arrest innocent people. I'll arrest you right now.
C: MADOLYN
D: You're trouble.
C: COLIN
D: You don't know the half of it.
S: INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
N: A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look around)... COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR. BILLY observes: MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering the room. COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender. No sound whatsoever in the bar. They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH. BILLY sits motionless.
C: COSTELLO
D: Do you know who I am?
N: BILLY does: but shakes his head.
C: BILLY
D: No.
C: COSTELLO
D: You met my friend, Mister French the other night.
C: BILLY
D: Is his real name Mister French?
C: COSTELLO
D: No. Come with me. I'm not the cops. I'm not askin' you.
E: a beat As BILLY hesitates
N: BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO, and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:
C: COSTELLO
D: You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS.
C: COSTELLO
D: Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them?
C: BILLY
D: Is it something I can't do personally?
N: COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister French. Then back at Billy, smiling.
C: COSTELLO
D: I'm going to have my associate search you.
N: BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire.
C: BILLY
D: Search me? Search me for what?
N: MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: C'm here.
C: COSTELLO
D: Contra-fucking-band. Take your fuckin' shoes off.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Shoes off.
N: BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes. COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a table.
C: COSTELLO
D: I knew your father.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah. He's dead.
C: COSTELLO
D: I'm sorry. How did he go?
C: BILLY
D: He didn't complain.
C: COSTELLO
D: That was his problem.
C: BILLY
D: Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
C: COSTELLO
D: I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything.
C: BILLY
D: Are you saying he was nothing?
C: COSTELLO
D: I'm saying he worked at the airport.
N: COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: He's clean.
C: COSTELLO
D: The arm.
N: With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain. MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs: "such a fuckin' pussy."
C: COSTELLO
D: It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway.
E: CONT'D holding Billy by the collar
N: He grabs Billy's broken right hand.
C: COSTELLO
D: Are you still a cop?
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: No.
N: COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.
C: COSTELLO
D: You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop.
C: BILLY
D: I am not a cop.
C: COSTELLO
D: You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin?
C: BILLY
D: Yes!
N: COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.
C: COSTELLO
D: Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas.
S: INT. THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR. MOMENTS LATER
N: COSTELLO, the visiting king, points at a group of drinkers, including a BLOND WOMAN (1st), GWEN.
C: COSTELLO
D: What's this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar?
N: The IRA MOTHERFUCKER is terrified.
C: COSTELLO
D: Only kidding. How's your mother?
E: CONT'D slapping him on the back
C: JIMMY
D: Ah, she's on her way out.
C: COSTELLO
D: We all are. Act accordingly.
E: straightens suit and tie
N: Costello exits.
S: INT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
N: MISTER FRENCH is methodically shelling and eating peanuts.
C: COSTELLO
D: Do you trust him?
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: These days, who's reliable?
C: COSTELLO
D: His Uncle Jackie was.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: The Costigans are talented in general.
C: COSTELLO
D: You don't trust a guy behaves like he's got nothin' to lose.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I'm reliable.
N: And he is.
C: COSTELLO
D: Well, you're one in a million.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Ten million.
C: COSTELLO
D: What about your wife?
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I thought she was.
C: COSTELLO
D: She wasn't.
N: SILENT FLASH of MISTER FRENCH strangling his wife with a wire in a 70's bathroom.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: She got reliable.
N: GWEN looks up:
C: GWEN
D: Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?
C: COSTELLO
D: "Another county heard from."
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: One too many.
S: EXT. LYNN MARSHLAND. DAWN
N: SEAGULLS squabble over unusual food. POWER PLANT IN THE DISTANCE, the MTA-train going by. TWO BODIES lie in a tidal ditch in the salt-marsh. They are the Italians who Billy fought in the restaurant. Hands taped together behind their backs. Two in the head each. COLIN is with the LYNN POLICE and the State Police forensics people. COLIN gets down and lifts a soaking lapel. Revealed is the tag of a men's shop in Providence.
C: COLIN
D: The principles of detection tell me that these men came from Providence.
C: LYNN DETECTIVE
D: I'd appreciate it if you got out of my crime scene.
C: COLIN
D: This is my crime scene, but knock yourself out.
N: COLIN gets up. He walks back across the marsh. Opens his cell phone.
C: COLIN
D: I saw a dead guy. I think I have post traumatic stress. You available for lunch? See you then.
E: CONT'D walking
N: At a PAY PHONE he dials another number.
S: INT. COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. MORNING
N: One of Costello's homes.
C: COSTELLO
D: Who's the lead detective?...Good, he's a moron.
N: BILLY cannot hear what COSTELLO is saying. He has an aluminum brace taped on his wrist and hand.
C: COSTELLO
D: I want you to get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of course he had nothing to do with it and will say so. You look in
E: CONT'D MORE

D: Lennon said `I'm an artist. You give me a fuckin' tuba and I'll get you something out of it'.
E: smiles
C: BILLY
D: I'd like to squeeze some fuckin' money out of it.
N: COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH look at each other.
C: COSTELLO
D: Smart mouth. Too bad.
N: COSTELLO lifts a piece of plastic on the table revealing a severed human hand. BILLY tries to conceal his shock.
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

S: INT. A CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. CONTINUOUS.
N: COSTELLO takes the ring off the finger of the severed hand. Partial exchange with MISTER FRENCH. BILLY watches.
C: COSTELLO
D: The point with John Lennon is a man can look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at you and I think what can I use you for?
C: COSTELLO
D: Get rid of this. Maybe we can work something out. Let me get dressed.
E: CONT'D giving the hand to Mister French back to Billy
N: He gets up.
S: INT. COSTELLO'S BATHROOM. DAY
N: BILLY runs the water in the sink. He starts to leave the bathroom and then impulsively takes off his wire and chucks it out the window as far as he can.
S: EXT. THE BUILDING. DAY
N: The wire falls into the water.
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS.
N: Queenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal. He removes his headphones.
C: DIGNAM
D: That was quick. He dead already?
S: EXT. "ACROPOLIS RESTAURANT". DAY
N: A GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow.
C: COLIN
D: This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news.
C: BARRIGAN
D: No wonder you get ahead.
S: EXT. A STREET BY THE HARBOR. DAY
N: BILLY walking and talking on the phone.
C: BILLY
D: I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. Micro what?
E: listens
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Queenan on the phone.
C: QUEENAN
D: Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody says anything about anything like that, you let us know.
S: EXT. POLICE BUILDING. DAY. TELEVISION IMAGE.
N: ELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones.

C: ELLERBY
D: No, it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #1. DAY
N: COLIN is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers. BROWN (last seen as Billy's friend) and BARRIGAN, new plainclothes recruits to Colin's special squad, sit across from him.
C: COLIN
D: I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly.
N: Through glass we see ELLERBY, preening. ELLERBY gives the thumbs up.
C: COLIN
D: Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police.
E: CONT'D
C: BROWN
D: Really?
C: COLIN
D: Yeah. Really.
C: BROWN
D: Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers?
C: COLIN
D: No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me.
E: not happy about this
N: BROWN and BARRIGAN leave. Colin leaves as well.
C: BARRIGAN
D: I know why I'm here. I made him feel guilty. Why are you here?
E: to Brown
C: BROWN
D: Intelligence and aptitude.
C: BARRIGAN
D: That's new.
N: COLIN opens his cell phone.
C: COLIN
D: Hello Dad. I have a new job.
E: ALT: I got a promotion.
S: INT. A BOOKIE SHOP. DAY
N: MISTER FRENCH backhands a guy into a table of betting slips.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Where's your fucking license? I don't see no fucking license.
C: BOOKIE
D: What license.
N: BILLY, who is not wearing a cast anymore, watches.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one. If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.
E: grabs the bookie by the ear
N: A HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the sprawled HARD GUY with the gun.
C: HARD GUY
D: I was going for my fucking cigarettes...
E: spitting teeth
N: He was. They fall from his fingers.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the fuck you doin'?
C: BILLY
D: What the fuck. I didn't know....
C: BOOKIE
D: There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Then make more money or go out of business. This is America. If you don't make money you're a fucking douchebag. What are you going to do?
C: BOOKIE
D: Make more money.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: That's the spirit.
S: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER
N: BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Very interesting.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, well. Fuck.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Don't worry about it. Guy didn't need need his teeth anyway. Maybe if he was an Eskimo. But in this country we eat a variety of items.
N: They get into COSTELLO'S CAR. Billy in the front seat. Mister French in the back.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.
E: CONT'D
N: COSTELLO does an Edgar Kennedy.
C: COSTELLO
D: So?
C: BILLY
D: He was...
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Reaching for his cigarettes.
C: BILLY
D: Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reason----he put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck he's doing...
C: COSTELLO
D: Well, you know what the fuck a bookie does?
E: interrupting
C: BILLY
D: Pays you.
E: to Costello
C: COSTELLO
D: Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.
N: He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.
C: COSTELLO
D: Here. From now on call the bar and ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there's no Mikey. Wait. We'll call.
E: CONT'D
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Forty-eight hours from the time this phone first rings, you take the fucking chip out - like so - and you fucking destroy it. After three days a phone ain't clean. If you use a phone which is not clean, you will have a accident. You never call us. We call you. You got that?
C: BILLY
D: I got it.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I can't fuckin' hear you.
C: BILLY
D: I got it.
S: INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY
N: A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.
C: BILLY
D: Don't look. There's a white van across the parking lot?
N: WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.
C: COSTELLO
D: They don't have directional microphones.
E: lifting and looking at his sketch
C: BILLY
D: What, do you got x-ray vision?
C: COSTELLO
D: They don't have directional microphones.
E: not taking his eyes off his sketch
N: BILLY registers what seems to be inside information. COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about him.
C: COSTELLO
D: People looking at you make you self- conscious?
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY shrugs. Indicating: Yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't be.
C: BILLY
D: I don't know.
C: COSTELLO
D: Why? They're minuses. They can't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.
C: BILLY
D: Anyone not a criminal is a minus?
C: COSTELLO
D: What are you soft? That's not what I said. Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun's shining, gulls are up...Nice smell of ozone...
N: TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up and leaves.
C: COSTELLO
D: You know if your father were alive and saw you, sitting here with me, let's say he would have a word with me about this, in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could do it, which is something you may not know about William Costigan, Sr.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: He never, ah, I mean never?
C: COSTELLO
D: He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money. You can't do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I think about this.
C: BILLY
D: So what are talking about here?
C: COSTELLO
D: Fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don't see you up the dog track as a general manager.
C: BILLY
D: Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it.
N: COSTELLO smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.
C: COSTELLO
D: You ever think of going back to school?
C: BILLY
D: With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out.
C: COSTELLO
D: Well that's your problem. Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.
N: He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there. COSTELLO stops to speak to the priests.
C: COSTELLO
D: Good day, Fathers.
E: CONT'D
C: PRIESTS
D: Good morning [day], Francis, good morning.
E: terrified and simultaneously
N: The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated. COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.
C: COSTELLO
D: You recall our chat? "I am as God made me", was that what you said? May I remind you, God don't run the bingo in this archdiocese.
E: the OLDER PRIEST nods, terrified
C: YOUNG PRIEST
D: May I remind you, Mr. Costello, that pride comes before the fall.
C: COSTELLO
D: What comes before the Fall is the Summertime.
N: COSTELLO notices that THE NUN is heading back to the table.
C: COSTELLO
D: How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: FITZY beats up a guy with a pipe. Billy watches from the background.
S: EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT
N: FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches. Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off.
S: INT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING
N: OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small fistful.
C: COLIN
D: I'm not making enough progress with Costello?
C: ELLERBY
D: "Progress" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up.
N: He has a bowl of ice water on his desk.
C: ELLERBY
D: Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough. Who did the two guys from Providence?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Jimmy Pappas.
C: ELLERBY
D: And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?
C: COLIN
D: He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers.
N: ELLERBY stares at COLIN.
C: ELLERBY
D: Are you happy with this result?
C: COLIN
D: It's a result.
C: ELLERBY
D: Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.
C: COLIN
D: Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it.
C: ELLERBY
D: I think you are a cop, my son.
E: with true appreciation
N: He drops his face into the bowl of ice water.
S: INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING
N: A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped. Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper. BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the photographs in different ways. NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT. FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them. FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the cheek. FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other way.
C: BRIAN
D: No, please...
C: FRENCH
D: Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt you.
N: He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim. He turns to leave, passing BILLY. He give him a slap.
C: FRENCH
D: Wake the fuck up.
E: CONT'D
N: They leave.
S: EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY
N: BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated. Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it. In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.
C: QUEENAN
D: Hey. Let's go through the routine.
C: DIGNAM
D: You think you can pop someone. There's no special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department.
C: BILLY
D: I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day.
C: DIGNAM
D: Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal?
N: Dignam is drinking coffee.
C: BILLY
D: I'm not them.
C: DIGNAM
D: You're nobody. You signed the paper. We're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. Maybe we'll just erase your file.
N: This is Billy's deepest fear.
C: DIGNAM
D: And zip, you're a soldier for Costello, open to arrest for how many felonies? Maybe we'll do that.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: Maybe I'll fucking kill you.
N: He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.
C: QUEENAN
D: Easy now. That was a joke, Billy.
C: DIGNAM
D: Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.
N: The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the wall.
C: QUEENAN
D: Be smart. If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you?
E: gently, like a man calming a wild animal
N: BILLY looks desperately inland. REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.
C: QUEENAN
D: Get in the car.
E: CONT'D
N: They do.
C: QUEENAN
D: Keep your act together. It's just a little while longer.
E: CONT'D
N: BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his hands in disbelief.
C: BILLY
D: When are you going to take Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street.
E: MORE
C: BILLY
D: What, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?
E: CONT'D
C: DIGNAM
D: Well. That would stick...
C: QUEENAN
D: You shut up. We're building a case. It takes time. You know that.
C: BILLY
D: There's something wrong.
C: QUEENAN
D: Maybe. Maybe.
C: DIGNAM
D: Keep your ears opened. No bullshit.
C: QUEENAN
D: I want you to listen for any chatter about a spy in the Special Investigation Unit. You hear anything like that?
E: BILLY looks at him
N: BILLY shakes his head.
C: BILLY
D: Are you serious?
C: QUEENAN
D: I'm afraid so.
C: BILLY
D: Jesus H. Christ.
C: QUEENAN
D: Hang tight for me. Just a little longer. We're this close.
N: BILLY nods reluctantly.
C: BILLY
D: Okay.
C: QUEENAN
D: Thank you, Billy
S: INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE. DAY
N: COLIN walks into the office. BROWN and other team members are watching a closed-circuit monitor. The MONITOR shows FITZY sitting in an interrogation room. COLIN is spooked.
C: COLIN
D: What have you got?
E: to Brown
C: BROWN
D: Uniform clipped him on the Pike for a suspended licence. However, as he's the subject of an open investigation----
C: COLIN
D: At least one. He's one of Costello's crew.
C: BROWN
D: ----we're entitled to get a warrant. We can't get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.
C: COLIN
D: Who's the lawyer?
C: BROWN
D: He didn't know the name. He just had the number on a card. Beeper number.
C: COLIN
D: Did he beep him?
C: BROWN
D: Twice.
C: COLIN
D: All right.
N: COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk. He picks it up. He takes off his ID badge and tosses it on a desk.
C: COLIN
D: Give me your phone. Turn the camera off. Turn it off.
E: CONT'D to Barrigan
N: He takes Brown's cellphone out of Brown's pocket goes into the interrogation room.
C: BROWN
D: What?
C: COLIN
D: Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this.
N: He picks up a BRIEFCASE. BARRIGAN touches two buttons and switches off the sound recorder and video feed. COLIN goes into the interrogation room.
C: BROWN
D: He can't do that, can he?
C: BARRIGAN
D: He just did.
S: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS
N: FITZY looks up at COLIN hopefully. COLIN says nothing. He sits down, opens his case, takes out a yellow pad.
C: COLIN
D: Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.
C: FITZY
D: You my attorney?
C: COLIN
D: What do you think? Did you make any statements or phone calls I need to be aware of?
C: FITZY
D: I beeped you. The card they gave me...that's it.
C: COLIN
D: That's it? Don't you have to call your mother and tell her you're not gonna be home for supper?
N: ON FITZY. He looks up at the CCTV camera.
C: COLIN
D: The cameras are off. Call your mother.
E: CONT'D gently puts phone on the table
N: Fitzy hesitates.
C: COLIN
D: Lookit. They're in there suiting up for a raid. I don't know where they are going, but they do. And so do you. Call your mum.
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN puts a cellphone on the table. FITZY takes up the phone and punches in a number. It is answered.
C: FITZY
D: Mum, I'm not gonna make it for supper. I got held up. Yeah, talk to you later.
S: INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS
N: BILLY looks up at MISTER FRENCH, who is on the phone. Other men are frozen, holding bags of Ex.

S: INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS
C: MISTER FRENCH

N: COLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket.

S: INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE.
C: COLIN
D: Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra.
C: BROWN
D: Why'd you use my phone?
C: COLIN
D: Because you didn't go in there.
S: INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table. Madolyn looks at him.
C: MADOLYN
D: The light's nice here in the morning.
N: COLIN doesn't respond.
C: MADOLYN
D: It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: I gotta go to work.
N: COLIN simply gets up and walks away.
S: INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy. Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more guarded than Billy.
C: BILLY
D: It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing.
N: A beat.
C: BILLY
D: People make things up in confession. You know that?
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: I know they do.
C: BILLY
D: People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films.
C: MADOLYN
D: That's an interesting observation.
C: BILLY
D: Do you lie?
C: MADOLYN
D: Why do you?
C: BILLY
D: I'm asking if you lie.
C: MADOLYN
D: Honesty isn't synonymous with truth.
C: BILLY
D: You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?
C: MADOLYN
D: I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel.
C: BILLY
D: So, you had a parent who was a drunk?
N: MADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her.
C: MADOLYN
D: Did you?
E: flustered
C: BILLY
D: No.
E: simply
C: MADOLYN
D: Let's keep this with you.
C: BILLY
D: There was a cop leaving when I came in.
E: abruptly
C: MADOLYN
D: How do you know he was a cop?
C: BILLY
D: Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?
C: MADOLYN
D: That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy.
C: BILLY
D: You should get a better job...
C: BILLY
D: Do they all come in and cry...your cops?
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons.
C: BILLY
D: Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.
C: MADOLYN
D: I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail?
C: BILLY
D: You want to hear about the showers?
C: MADOLYN
D: Did something happen to you?
C: BILLY
D: No. You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever.
E: a beat
C: MADOLYN
D: What do you expect from coming here?
C: BILLY
D: I have to come here.
C: MADOLYN
D: I know it's not elective...on your part...but, now that you're here, what do you want?
C: BILLY
D: You want the truth? Valium.
E: a beat
C: MADOLYN
D: If you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted.
C: BILLY
D: What's that say about what you do for a living?
N: Madolyn is taken aback. She closes her file.
C: MADOLYN
D: Look, I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.
N: She closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her.
C: BILLY
D: I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks.
C: MADOLYN
D: Is this true?
C: BILLY
D: Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here.
C: MADOLYN
D: Yes, you are.
C: BILLY
D: If only fuckin' here.
N: She retrieves his folder.
C: BILLY
D: Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?!
E: CONT'D giving into stress Is that what you do, Mrs. Fuckin' Doctor?
N: MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY looks at it.
C: BILLY
D: Two pills.
E: CONT'D
N: She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills on the desk.
C: BILLY
D: Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit?
E: CONT'D
N: MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished.
C: MADOLYN
D: You can leave!
C: BILLY
D: What if that was a legitimate threat? .
E: Hot shot
N: BILLY leaves. MADOLYN stares after him.
C: MADOLYN
D: Fuck...
S: EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY
N: Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches up to him.
C: MADOLYN
D: Why is the hardest patient of the day always the last one?
C: BILLY
D: Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural.
C: MADOLYN
D: Look, I'm not just...somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.
N: Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.
C: BILLY
D: What's this?
C: MADOLYN
D: My card. And a prescription for twenty Lorazepam.
N: BILLY stands holding the prescription.
C: BILLY
D: Is it enough to kill myself?
C: MADOLYN
D: Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.
E: she fixes him with a stare
C: BILLY
D: Thank you.
E: re: prescription
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm transferring you to another counselor.
N: She starts to go back inside.
C: BILLY
D: You wanna get a cup of coffee?
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER
N: It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present, very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.
C: ELLERBY
D: All right, let's bring it in, please. Come in please. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team... Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.
E: addressing room he nods at COLIN
C: COLIN
D: Did you guys know anything about this?
E: to his guys
N: No.
C: ELLERBY
D: How long have we been tapped on this building?
E: to LAZIO
C: ELLERBY
D: Our unit will not take action until a man Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction. Questions? Anyone? This is who we're after.
E: CONT'D taps picture of Costello MORE
C: ELLERBY
D: We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him. Get to work.
E: CONT'D
N: ON COLIN as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks about the best way out of this.
C: ELLERBY
D: We've been after this son of a bitch for a long time, and we're getting him tonight. Get to work.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Go find out what we're doing and get on it.
E: to team
N: COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.
C: ELLERBY
D: Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy.
N: ELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away.
C: COLIN
D: Dad?
E: into cell
C: COSTELLO
D: Yes?

S: INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN turns away from the activity.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, my friends are still coming.
N: COLIN sees QUEENAN staring at him.

D: We'll just say lunch tomorrow. All right, bye.
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN ends the call. QUEENAN is there.
C: QUEENAN
D: The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game.
C: COLIN
D: Thank you, Captain.
N: He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area. LATER COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his hand.
C: GEEK COP
D: Piece of cake. I'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them.
N: COLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up.
C: QUEENAN
D: All cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends over there...
N: COLIN looks: sees LAZIO and two others.
C: ELLERBY
D: Patriot Act. Love it. Love it.
E: as if on coke and he probably is
N: COLIN, using his left hand, not looking, opens his cellphone, autodials, and then taps an instant message into it, pushes "Send." DETAIL OF IM: "No Phones" ONSCREEN, CARS PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE TARGET BUILDING.
C: COLIN
D: All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46.
C: BROWN
D: Who are they meeting?
C: ELLERBY
D: I don't know. Some Chinamen from points unknown. They're already inside.
E: leaning over screens
N: DETAIL OF COLIN'S PHONE. COLIN hits "send", sending the message "No phones". THE SCREEN then reads "Erasing Sent Message".
S: EXT. TARGET BUILDING. NIGHT
N: COSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS
N: Watching images. COSTELLO'S GUYS move through pillars and disappear.
C: CAMERA GEEK COP
D: We have a blind spot.
C: ELLERBY
D: Why do you have a blind spot?
C: CAMERA GEEK COP
D: We had two hour's notice. Two hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA?
C: ELLERBY
D: It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back?
N: TECH COP IN DOWN VEST What back? Ellerby blows his nose. He is on coke. COLIN sends another TEXT MESSAGE: "Blind spot inside door."
S: INT. TARGET BUILDING. CONTINUOUS - REVISED 6/8-9/05
N: COSTELLO looks at his IM screen and turns to his guys.
C: COSTELLO
D: Turn off your cell phones.
N: FITZY and some others mutter.
C: COSTELLO
D: Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken...
E: CONT'D

C: ELLERBY
D: Narrow the area.
C: LAZIO
D: What you see for coverage is what you get.
C: DIGNAM
D: Why the fuck did they turn off their phones?
E: like Queenan, an observer of Ellerby's operation
C: PHONE TECH COP
D: Wait, there's still one phone up.
C: DIGNAM
D: Where?
N: A single light on the screen. QUEENAN looks at an IM (from Billy) on his phone. DETAIL: "buyers here". ("$")
C: QUEENAN
D: The buyers are there.
N: COLIN wonders how Queenan knew this. The single light winks out on the screen. ELLERBY looks at Queenan, impressed.
C: ELLERBY
D: You know, direct access to your fucking guys would have certain fuckin' advantages.
C: QUEENAN
D: Not to my guy.
E: mildly
N: ELLERBY stares at him.
C: DIGNAM
D: This is unbelievable. Fuck it, who put the cameras in the fucking place?
E: looking at screens
C: CAMERA TECH COP
D: Who the fuck are you.
C: DIGNAM
D: I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.
C: QUEENAN
D: Hey, hey, hey...
S: INT. AN OPEN AREA IN THE RUINED BUILDING. NIGHT
N: COSTELLO'S BOYS spread out. Across the open, lumber-strewn area, CHINESE GANG MEMBERS are waiting. A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD SUIT - terrified. FITZY carries a case containing the processors.
C: COSTELLO
D: How you going, Robert?
E: to translator
C: CHINESE TRANSLATOR
D: Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns.
N: COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a Malay pirate. Costello's gunmen are perched above, automatic weapons trained on the Triad. BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to indicate "buyers here."
C: CHINESE GANGSTER
D: Waiting, waiting. We almost departed! This man is from the Embassy. He will have to blow his brains out if he is captured. His entire family will be killed.
E: in Cantonese, not subtitled
C: CHINESE TRANSLATOR
D: He's a little upset.
C: COSTELLO
D: Tell him light on the starch.
N: BILLY is watching carefully. [As (INSERT) ONSCREEN in the OPERATIONS ROOM the last lights wink off...] He removes his hand from his pocket, having just switched off his phone.
C: CHINESE TRANSLATOR
D: He's fronting the Chinese government and he's just scared shitless.
E: roughly translating
C: COSTELLO
D: Government man. I'm concerned about Chinamen who think it's wise to bring automatic weapons to a business transaction.
E: loudly, to Chinese
N: The CHINESE GANGSTER interjects --
C: CHINESE GANGSTER
D: Ngup, Ngup, Ngup. Ngaw um ming. Kay ngup mutt. [Yap, yap, yap. I don't understand. What is he saying?]
N: The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates Costello's statement about "concern." SEVERAL OF THE TRIAD, hearing a "automatic weapon," stupidly raise their MACHINE GUNS. They don't aim them.
C: COSTELLO
D: For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in this country, it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.
N: We (but no one else) hear a double click as MISTER FRENCH cocks a pistol behind his back.
C: CHINESE GANGSTER
D: Put away that machine gun.
E: in Cantonese
N: The MACHINE GUN is put away.
C: COSTELLO
D: If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show me one million dollars.
N: The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates.
C: COSTELLO
D: What we generally do in this country is one guy shows up with the items, and the other guy pays him. No tickee...no laundry.
E: CONT'D
N: COSTELLO gestures and a BOX of PROCESSORS is put on the floor. Opened. The CHINESE GANGSTER gestures and a case of money is put on the floor. Opened. FITZY looks at it, nods.
C: CHINESE GANGSTER
D: Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon. [Make sure it's real. It's a million dollars.]. ALTERNATE/ALSO : Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun. [Next time you make me wait, I'm going to cut your dick off.
E: insult
C: COSTELLO
D: In English, thank you, also.
C: CHINESE GANGSTER
D: Du ne. [Fuck you.]
N: The deal is done.
C: COSTELLO
D: The expedition continues this way.
N: To Billy's surprise both Costello's men and the Chinese head out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side pier.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS
N: The CARS of the CHINESE GUYS are driven away, passing a van full of... Startled TACTICAL COPS. TWO TACTICAL UNITS are hidden outside.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS
N: ELLERBY is staring at the screens.
C: ELLERBY
D: Don't tell me those cars were empty. Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty. Do you have a camera in the back.
E: to Camera Tech Cop
N: An IMAGE comes up. Nothing.
C: ELLERBY
D: Can I talk to you a minute?
E: CONT'D
N: As the Camera Technician gets up, Ellerby pounces on him.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS
N: Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI, and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.
C: COSTELLO
D: See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with.
C: BILLY
D: What about us, Frank? What're we gonna do?
C: COSTELLO
D: We depart. We didn't commit no illegalities.
N: BILLY is stunned. Admiring.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin' plastic.
N: The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and then follows him.
S: EXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT 103A
N: A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers approach the cars they realize they are empty except for hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the command center.
S: INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY
N: Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.
C: MADOLYN
D: Good Morning.
N: MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.
C: COLIN
D: Good morning.
C: MADOLYN
D: I beat the movers.
C: COLIN
D: How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment?
C: MADOLYN
D: Lonely.
E: putting the box on the kitchen counter
C: COLIN
D: I'm glad to hear that. It sucked here, too.
N: They kiss. MADOLYN takes in the apartment.
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for the square footage.
C: COLIN
D: Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven. So am I.
N: MADOLYN unpacks food. Coffee. Croissants.
C: MADOLYN
D: French donut?
C: COLIN
D: Yeah. Hey, can I...
E: re: box of stuff
C: MADOLYN
D: Sure yeah.
N: He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures, breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.
C: COLIN
D: Well, we're not having this out.
C: MADOLYN
D: What?
N: MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
C: COLIN
D: You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company.
C: MADOLYN
D: Company?
N: She laughs. COLIN looks at a diploma. Veritas.
C: COLIN
D: Why work for the state?
C: MADOLYN
D: Why not? You do.
C: COLIN
D: Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor?
C: MADOLYN
D: I believe in public service.
E: deadpan, over her coffee cup
N: COLIN stares at her.
C: COLIN
D: Now you're just being ridiculous.
C: MADOLYN
D: You like me living here?
E: kissing him, and intently:
C: COLIN
D: Yes I do.
E: hands down her shorts
N: THE PHONE (landline with mobile handset) rings.
C: COLIN
D: Answer it. You live here.
E: CONT'D
N: MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the interruption, gets the phone.
C: MADOLYN
D: Mayor Sullivan's Office.
N: After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm sorry!
E: CONT'D whispering
C: COLIN
D: Who is it?
C: MADOLYN
D: I think it's a guy with a, ah, A cancer guy.
E: She touches her throat, and whispers
N: COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead. A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.
C: COLIN
D: Hello?
N: COLIN exits the kitchen.
C: COLIN
D: Something for work.
E: CONT'D to Madolyn
N: MADOLYN looks after him. She doesn't start eating again, she watches Colin. She is seen staring at him through the following scene.
C: COSTELLO
D: What the fuck is it with your phone?
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE CHELSEA YACHT CLUB. CONTINUOUS
N: COSTELLO, with his collar turned up, is walking along the floats. Wearing a headset. INTERCUT TERRACE OF COLIN'S APARTMENT/CHELSEA YACHT CLUB. CONTINUOUS COLIN hunches, closing the glass door, and glancing in at Madolyn.
C: COLIN
D: Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once.
C: COSTELLO
D: Was that that shrink cunt answered the phone?
C: COLIN
D: Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in.
C: COSTELLO
D: You better get organized, quick.
C: COLIN
D: Last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail.
C: COSTELLO
D: Are you listening to me?
C: COLIN
D: Yes.
C: COSTELLO
D: Are listening to me, son? Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking your cock?
N: COLIN looks in at MADOLYN.
C: COLIN
D: Yes. Yes I do.
N: COLIN is frustrated.
C: COSTELLO
D: So earn it. I'm gettin' the feeling we got a cop in my crew.
E: a beat
C: COLIN
D: I been gettin' that same feeling.
C: COSTELLO
D: He's one of yours. Inside. Have you seen anything?
C: COLIN
D: Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don't give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best...
C: COSTELLO
D: Your best? What do you think we're in, the fuckin' haberdashery business?
E: interrupting
N: COLIN takes a breath, tries to reason and mind his place.
C: COLIN
D: Please Frank, if you don't relax I can't relax. Let's start with this...get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me...
C: COSTELLO
D: Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?
E: interrupting Colin
C: COLIN
D: Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a...
C: COSTELLO
D: Collie, calm down or you'll shoot in your pants. I'll get you the records and whatnot. You'll have 'em but listen to me son, don't disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be putting their cock up Little Miss Freud's ass.
E: relenting a little
S: EXT. DOCK/WATERFRONT - CONTINUOUS
N: Costello hangs up and walks along and sees QUEENAN and DIGNAM step out.
C: QUEENAN
D: How are you, Francis?
C: COSTELLO
D: My mother called me Francis.
C: QUEENAN
D: I know she did. And your father called you the tumor.
N: COSTELLO, not liking that:
C: COSTELLO
D: Oh, what did your father call you, Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't around.
C: QUEENAN
D: Where are the real microprocessors, Frank?
C: COSTELLO
D: Microprocessors...oh yeah, I heard that story. You arrested some Chinese government guy at the border carrying some light sockets or somethin'.
C: DIGNAM
D: I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face.
C: COSTELLO
D: Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?
E: to Dignam
C: QUEENAN
D: I will get you, Frank.
C: COSTELLO
D: If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own pace.

C: COLIN
D: What?
C: MADOLYN
D: You have a boss that has a laryngectomy?
C: COLIN
D: No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.
C: MADOLYN
D: You're lying to me.
C: COLIN
D: Not exactly. There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about.
E: the charming Colin: Or your own life. more seriously, after a long beat
C: MADOLYN
D: Okay, then say that.
E: after a beat
N: COLIN looks at her steadily: if she's serious, she's pure gold.
C: COLIN
D: I will. Thank you.
N: He kisses her. The DOORBELL RINGS.
C: MADOLYN
D: That's the movers.
C: COLIN

E: O.S.
C: DIGNAM
D: Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.
S: INT. IM PEI TYPE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A PEDESTRIAN CONVEYOR. DAY
T: (INTERCUT)
N: BILLY is talking on the phone, in a fury.
C: BILLY
D: Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan?
C: DIGNAM
D: He's not here.
C: BILLY
D: They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out.
C: DIGNAM
D: And how do we do that Mr... fucking genius who didn't even graduate the academy?
C: BILLY
D: Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan.
C: DIGNAM
D: Are you deaf? He's not here. Call me when you get something real.
N: BILLY is in a full-on panic attack. He takes a pill, leans back against a wall, closes his eyes. The second phone rings. He stares at it: opens it.
C: BILLY
D: It's me.
S: INT. DESERTED CAFE - DAY
N: Madolyn and Billy sit at a table. Talking like friends now, emphatically non-clinical. Billy is zoned out, preoccupied, nervous.
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all...
C: BILLY
D: Confucius say that?
C: MADOLYN
D: So you do...something radical.
C: BILLY
D: "Something radical," huh?
C: MADOLYN
D: ...yeah, you do... Sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it...
C: BILLY
D: So how long you been with this guy?
C: MADOLYN
D: Oh, four months. About four months.
C: BILLY
D: You love this guy?
C: MADOLYN
D: It's pretty serious, yeah, it is.
C: BILLY
D: A head case or anything? I'm just curious...
C: MADOLYN
D: No more than I am.
C: BILLY
D: Then you're lucky. Considering the odds, right?
N: He lifts his cup to drink.
C: BILLY
D: Good, give him a shot.
E: CONT'D
N: This may not be exactly what Madolyn wants to hear. But she nods.
C: MADOLYN
D: Doctors aren't supposed to have illusions.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. Godlike, really.
N: Smiles, called on her shit.
C: MADOLYN
D: OK, I'm in a serious, newly serious, relationship...there are...ups and downs...everybody has doubts, problems -- I mean doubts.
N: She realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on "problems".
C: BILLY
D: What would you do if he was standing right there and saw us?
C: MADOLYN
D: I'd lie. To keep things on an even keel. You know all about it.
S: INT./EXT. BANKROBBER'S APARTMENT. CHARLESTOWN. DAY
N: The BANKROBBER, a junkie, wakes up to a vision: JESUS, indicating the sacred heart. BILLY smashes the glass and the frame over the guy's head.
T: CUT TO OUTSIDE:
N: MISTER FRENCH has lit a cherry-bomb. He throws it. He hands out fireworks to KIDS. BACK INSIDE: BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his head.
C: BILLY
D: You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?
C: BANKROBBER
D: Fucking now I do.
C: BILLY
D: What the fuck do you do.
C: BANKROBBER
D: What, I pay Costello and wait for him to trade me to the FBI? Cause that's what he does.
C: BILLY
D: FBI? What the fuck are you talking about.
N: {Firecrackers off}
C: BANKROBBER
D: Oh my God, is that French out there?
C: BILLY
D: What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?
E: grabbing him by the shirt
C: BANKROBBER
D: Forget what I said. I'm fucking high, I'm high.
N: Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows what this means.
C: BILLY
D: Whatever's going through your very poor, very limited, brain...I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said.
C: BANKROBBER
D: Forget it, I'm high, I must be high, I would never say what you thought I said.
N: As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's "Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.
C: BILLY
D: Tell me what the fuck you said.
C: BANKROBBER
D: Why do you think he's not arrested? Costello's a protected FBI informant. He'll trade you out. I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts. It fucking hurts.
E: covered with blood a beat
N: BILLY gets out of the house. OUTSIDE MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.
C: BILLY

S: INT. A THEATER. NIGHT
N: From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in progress----LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE. PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars, COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.
S: INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.
N: COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.
S: EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT
N: A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.
C: BILLY
D: Hey, it's me.
C: QUEENAN
D: What do you want? What are you doing here?
C: BILLY
D: Come here.
N: QUEENAN approaches him.
C: BILLY
D: Costello is giving people up to the FBI.
E: CONT'D
N: QUEENAN stares.
C: QUEENAN
D: The FBI?
C: BILLY
D: He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made?
C: QUEENAN
D: Go around the back. Go around the back.
E: realizing he has to be very careful
S: INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER
N: BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along the hall.
C: QUEENAN
D: My wife's asleep. She left supper out. Come and have something to eat.
N: BILLY shakes his head.
C: BILLY
D: No, I...
C: QUEENAN
D: We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and have something to eat.
N: BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.
S: EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)
N: COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.
C: ELLERBY
D: Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy like you since me. You'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation Unit.
C: COLIN
D: I don't get it.
C: ELLERBY
D: We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit.
C: COLIN
D: Right.
C: ELLERBY
D: You'll investigate. Everybody. Anybody.
C: COLIN
D: Well, that's just a dream job for a cop.
C: ELLERBY
D: We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. I have an immaculate record.
E: a beat
N: ELLERBY hits a drive.
C: ELLERBY
D: Play golf?
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: No.
C: ELLERBY
D: That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships. How's the wedding coming along?
E: a beat
C: COLIN
D: Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor.
C: ELLERBY
D: Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, it's working. Overtime.
C: ELLERBY
D: I'm glad to hear that.
N: Hits a drive. Ponk.
S: EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY
N: HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings. BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway, and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.
S: INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY
N: It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around. Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO. DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Boss wants your real name, your social, your license number, all your bank account numbers.
C: BILLY
D: I don't have a bank account.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: I'm a cash business myself.
C: BILLY
D: What's he doing, setting up IRAs?
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: No, I ain't.
E: CONT'D
N: MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope on the bar.
C: DELAHUNT
D: Put the forms in there.
C: FITZY
D: I don't know if this is how you spell Citizens'.
N: BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.
C: BILLY
D: No, no, no. Jesus Christ.
N: He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.
C: FITZY
D: What are you, retarded? That ain't right.
N: BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope. BILLY gets up.
C: DELAHUNT
D: Billy, he said to stay here.
C: BILLY
D: I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Where you going?
N: BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.
S: EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY
N: BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone vibrates and he takes it out.
C: ONSCREEN
D: Follow the envelope.
N: BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.
C: BILLY
D: Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
N: QUEENAN closes his door.
C: QUEENAN
D: They can't. They are compromised.
S: EXT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
N: Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.
S: INT. CINEMA. NIGHT REVISED ON SET 5/31/05
N: Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN. Costello is wearing the dildo. He watches the movie, moaning.
C: COSTELLO
D: Oh yeah, be dirty.
N: Colin goes for his gun. Costello gets up, shows him the dildo.
C: COSTELLO
D: See anything you like?
E: CONT'D
N: COLIN unnerved, recognizing COSTELLO now.
C: COLIN
D: Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you.
N: Frank sits, closer to Colin.
C: COSTELLO
D: You're not indulging in self abuse are you?
C: COLIN
D: Frank, we got problems.
C: COSTELLO
D: I hope you're not turning into one of those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You're not crackin' up are you?
C: COLIN
D: I don't crack up.
C: COSTELLO
D: Pick a place where any cop could see you...
C: COLIN
D: Why did you show up then?
C: COSTELLO
D: I own the place.
C: COLIN
D: Why am I not fuckin' surprised. Look...
C: COSTELLO
D: You're gettin' reassigned.
C: COLIN
D: How the fuck did you know that?
C: COSTELLO
D: Where'd they put you?
C: COLIN
D: I have to find myself.
N: COSTELLO chuckles, truly enjoying this.
C: COSTELLO
D: You're telling me, sonny boy.
C: COLIN
D: I have to find the guy you have in the department.
C: COSTELLO
D: With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding nothing.
N: We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello. His idol doesn't like him.
C: COLIN
D: Frank, for me, you've got to lay low.
C: COSTELLO
D: Laying low is not what I do.
C: COLIN
D: Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.
C: COSTELLO
D: Okay. But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.
E: gives him the envelope
N: COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.
C: COLIN
D: Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this.
E: MORE
C: COLIN
D: It involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right?
E: CONT'D
C: COSTELLO
D: Maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theatre.
E: looking at the screen
N: Costello gets up to go.
C: COSTELLO
D: Who knows what's easy? Collie, take care of business.
E: CONT'D
N: The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see: BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes. BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when: The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through the emergency exit beside the screen. Billy follows.
S: INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT
N: It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone. COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and right, then goes after
S: EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his coat. BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate to see Colin's face. COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the corner. ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet). BILLY'S POV: COLIN is halfway down the street. BILLY follows. BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street (And COLIN is aware of the tail) when... BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen. BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
S: TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
N: Make arrest. COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
S: EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER
N: COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner. COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife. As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN. COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
S: EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER
N: COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
S: EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER
N: BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement. BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
S: INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
N: COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY. Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the Shroud of Turin.
S: EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)
N: Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the door. The chain on.
C: BILLY
D: Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients.
C: MADOLYN
D: How obsessive are you?
C: BILLY
D: Medium.
C: MADOLYN
D: Are you okay? Why are you here?
C: BILLY
D: I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations.
C: MADOLYN
D: I'm glad you want to see me...it's nice to see you...I enjoyed talking...I enjoyed having coffee with you, very much...but I don't see people...I don't see people in my home.
N: Billy gets soaked.
S: INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
N: BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest.
C: BILLY
D: Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave.
N: MADOLYN takes a moment to react.
C: MADOLYN
D: No, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate...you're not a patient...
C: BILLY
D: You moving in or out?
C: MADOLYN
D: I still have three weeks on the lease...
N: BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of effects.
C: MADOLYN
D: That's me.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, I know.
N: He hangs the picture on a nail.
C: MADOLYN
D: Would you like a cup of tea?
E: the kettle whistles OS
N: BILLY nods.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
N: Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment.
C: MADOLYN
D: Do you want some...
C: BILLY
D: Sugar? No...
N: She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..
C: MADOLYN
D: I've always needed my own place.
C: BILLY
D: Hedging your bets?
C: MADOLYN
D: No. I'm not "hedging my best"...I told you when we had coffee...There's a choice. You choose...you have to make a...
C: BILLY
D: Decision.
C: MADOLYN
D: ...decision...and stick by what...you choose...you have to...
C: BILLY
D: Move in with your boyfriend?
C: MADOLYN
D: Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise it's... I have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. Is it real?
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, I think so.
N: Tick...tick...tick.
C: BILLY
D: You don't have cats.
E: CONT'D
C: MADOLYN
D: No.
C: BILLY
D: I like that. That's good.
S: INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
N: Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy.
S: INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT
N: In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He continues.
S: INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
N: Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.
S: EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT
N: Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.
S: INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT
N: A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night. One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.
C: COSTELLO
D: You got a girlfriend?
C: BILLY
D: No. No. What does that matter?
C: COSTELLO
D: Depends. I'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I'm not sure.
N: He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.
C: BILLY
D: What about the FBI.
C: COSTELLO
D: It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife, an old friend or stupid...that's what brings you down in this business.
C: BILLY
D: Stupid...Well, that leaves me out.
C: COSTELLO
D: Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me.
C: BILLY
D: Better safe than sorry, I suppose.
C: COSTELLO
D: On the other hand, back then, it was only five...or six...and French.
N: But COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry.
C: BILLY
D: I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think "could I do murder?" And all I can answer myself is, "what's the difference".
C: COSTELLO
D: Give em up to the Almighty. Like that.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah, that's my point. You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else.
N: COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And impressed.
C: COSTELLO
D: You got something you want to say to me, William?
E: to Billy
C: BILLY
D: You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money.
N: COSTELLO smiles, and continues with the sketch. Later he will light up the paper.
C: COSTELLO
D: I haven't needed "the money" since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don't need pussy any more,but I still like it.
E: MORE
C: COSTELLO
D: Point I'm making...you see...I got this rat...gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat...questions come up...questions...see, Bill, you're the new guy...and the girlfriend. Why don't you stay in the bar when I get the numbers. Your numbers. Everybody's numbers.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: Is there something you want to ask me, Frank?
C: COSTELLO
D: Start with, you agree there is a rat?
C: BILLY
D: You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do.
C: COSTELLO
D: Sure, sure, all that aside...but you Bill, what would you do?
N: COSTELLO sketching.
C: BILLY
D: How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise. The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you?
E: COSTELLO nods, accepting this
C: COSTELLO
D: Only one that can do what I do is me. You want to be me?
N: BILLY stares over a precipice: he knows this as well.
C: BILLY
D: I probably could be you. I know that much. But I don't want to be you.
C: COSTELLO
D: Heavy lies the crown...sort of thing.
N: FRENCH comes in from the kitchen.
C: MISTER FRENCH
D: Francis.
C: BARTENDER
D: We're out of here, Mister Costello. You'll have to set the alarm.
C: COSTELLO
D: Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow.
E: eyes on Billy
N: ON SOUND the door closes and locks.
C: COSTELLO
D: There's a boat coming in, up in Gloucester. French will give you all the details.
E: CONT'D
N: COSTELLO leaves.
S: INT. COSTELLO'S KITCHEN. DAY/INTERCUT: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE
N: COSTELLO is on the phone. MISTER FRENCH is sitting on a stool, smoking. OPERA playing on sound.
C: COSTELLO
D: You heard nothing?
C: COLIN
D: No.
C: COSTELLO
D: Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester?
C: COLIN
D: No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it.
N: COSTELLO hangs up and turns to MISTER FRENCH.
C: COSTELLO
D: You're sure. No other departments, no codes, like that...
C: COLIN'S VOICE
D: Frank. You can relax on this one.
C: COSTELLO
D: Okay, Collie. I will.
N: Costello hangs up and turns to Mr. French.
C: COSTELLO
D: It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Thank God for Billy.
E: CONT'D emotionally
S: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY
N: Everybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen. COPS stare at him with resentment.
C: COLIN
D: Morning.
N: He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out. DIGNAM faces COLIN down.
C: COLIN
D: A problem?
E: CONT'D
C: DIGNAM
D: Yeah, I run rat fucks like you. I don't like them.
C: COLIN
D: The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours.
C: DIGNAM
D: Fuck yourself.
C: COLIN
D: I need to know the identity of your undercovers.
C: DIGNAM
D: Blow me. Not literally, there's no promotion in it for ya.
N: He walks away. COLIN goes into Queenan's office.
S: INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER
N: QUEENAN puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into the trash.
C: COLIN
D: Morning, Captain.
C: QUEENAN
D: Look who's here. The Queen of the prom.
C: COLIN
D: They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam.
C: QUEENAN
D: What do you expect? Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat.
N: COLIN sits uneasily.
C: COLIN
D: Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right?
C: QUEENAN
D: Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization----
C: COLIN
D: Who is that?
C: QUEENAN
D: Lots of luck. You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer.
E: Not a chance.
C: COLIN
D: Fair enough.
C: QUEENAN
D: As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street.
C: COLIN
D: Really? Did he get a look at him?
C: QUEENAN
D: ...No.
C: COLIN
D: Nothing that could help us?
C: QUEENAN
D: Nah.
C: COLIN
D: Any advice? Generally?
E: swallows Too bad.
C: QUEENAN
D: Costello can't do business without coordinating with his source... Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and you'll find his rat.
E: much gestures out window
N: COLIN realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat.
C: QUEENAN
D: You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee.
E: CONT'D turns away
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY
N: COLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what Queenan has just told him:
C: QUEENAN
D: Follow Costello and you'll find his informer.
E: V.O.
N: In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not found". COLIN keeps working.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER
N: MUGSHOTS of all of Costello's guys. He looks at them desperately...no one squares up with the blurred, impossible, images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger), locks his door. He picks up the phone.
C: VOICE ON PHONE
D: Internal Investigations.
E: V.O.
C: COLIN
D: This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now.
S: INT. COLIN AND MADOLYN'S NEW BEDROOM. SAME NIGHT
N: COLIN is lying in bed, his back to MADOLYN.
C: COLIN
D: If I wasn't with the Mass State Police. If I did it full time,law school, I'd be through in a year. I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a trooper.
C: MADOLYN
D: What's going on?
C: COLIN
D: Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing going on. Just thinking.
C: MADOLYN
D: Okay, all right. And what about money?
E: thinking about it; blows a breath
C: COLIN
D: I got some money. Another city...I'm thinking that.
N: Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.
C: MADOLYN
D: Another city? It'd be a clean slate.
N: COLIN is in hell. He looks at her intensely.
C: COLIN
D: I want you to know you don't gotta stay. If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out. I'm not capable I'm fuckin' Irish, so I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.
E: a beat
N: Long pause.
C: MADOLYN
D: Not a bad idea, another city.
S: EXT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY
N: FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the restaurant.
C: DELAHUNT
D: Of course I know how to spot a cop.
C: FITZY
D: Oh yeah, how's that?
C: DELAHUNT
D: If he's not paying attention to us, he's a cop.
N: THEIR POV: A MAN across the street is looking into the window of an antique shop.
C: DELAHUNT
D: See that guy over there, he's a cop. He's not paying attention to us. He's a cop.
E: CONT'D
C: FITZY
D: Lot of fucking cops.
N: A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a lapdog.
C: FITZY
D: What kind of dog is that?
E: CONT'D
N: No response.
C: FITZY
D: She's a cop.
E: CONT'D
C: DELAHUNT
D: She's probably the fucking Police Commissioner.
S: INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS
N: Too early to be opened for business. COSTELLO and NEW GUYS, six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back. COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar and looks at BILLY.
C: COSTELLO
D: You can get out of here. This is the crew for tonight.
C: BILLY
D: I thought I was on for that.
C: COSTELLO
D: I changed my mind. Take the night off. Jimmy, get the mop.
E: to Bartender
N: COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH, grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at him.

N: BILLY, trying to save Costello...
C: BILLY
D: How do you know you don't have a tail?

MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up. FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).
S: INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
N: COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing. COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.
C: COLIN
D: You're an FBI informant.
N: COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.
C: COSTELLO
D: Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm talking to the FBI.
C: COLIN
D: Do they know who I am?
N: COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.
C: COSTELLO

D: I know you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up. You're like...
C: COLIN
D: A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks?
N: COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve. He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as COLIN shoots him. COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader. ANGLE ON COLIN. Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the dead body again and again. He backs away.
C: COLIN
D: I got Costello! I got Costello here!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello. [Dialog separate document].
S: INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY
N: COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees: Dignam, staring at him evenly.
C: COLIN
D: It's not any reason for, ah...
E: to crowd
N: QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.
C: COLIN
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
C: QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
D: No, thank you.
N: He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.
C: BROWN
D: He's waited a long time for you. (COLIN looks up and sees
C: BILLY)
D: How'd you get him without the files?
C: COLIN
D: Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy?
C: BROWN
D: Yeah, we were classmates together.
C: COLIN
D: I'm gonna go talk to him.
N: COLIN goes off.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT
N: In Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge.
C: COLIN
D: Good to see you Trooper.
C: BILLY
D: Yeah. "Trooper".
C: COLIN
D: Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover?
C: BILLY
D: Long time. Long fuckin' time.
C: COLIN
D: I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.
C: BILL
D: Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's kinda like a gold star around here, right?
C: COLIN
D: It's the highest honor we got.
C: BILLY
D: I just want my identity back.
C: COLIN
D: You want to be a cop again?
C: BILLY
D: No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back.
N: COLIN takes it.
C: BILLY
D: You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink.
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: A police shrink. Was that... helpful for you?
E: throat clicks instead of asking the obvious
C: BILLY
D: What are you gonna do about the rat in this building?
C: COLIN
D: I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything...
C: BILLY
D: I'm all done being a cop. I just want to get my money and go home.
C: COLIN
D: Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password.
C: BILLY
D: The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you.
N: He writes it. Colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment.
C: COLIN
D: All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me.
N: Billy nods. He goes.
S: INT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT
N: COLIN accesses the personal database, enters the password. Billy's confidential file opens up. Every fact about the man. Photos.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS
N: Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written "CITIZENS." BILLY picks up the envelope...and knows everything.
S: INT. COMPUTER ROOM. CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN is reviewing it Billy's file. Outside the glass wall we see BILLY, staring at COLIN's back...and then moving on.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER
N: COLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file. He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the personnel file. COLIN clicks DELETE. "Do You Really Want to Delete?" COLIN clicks "Yes" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear.
S: EXT. POLICE BUILDING. NIGHT
N: BILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: BILLY waits outside Madolyn's office. MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked, opens her mouth to speak...
C: BILLY
D: I know. I'm not here to...I'm not here for that. I've got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me.
C: MADOLYN
D: What is it?
C: BILLY
D: I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That's for you to hold.
E: stopping her from speaking
N: He gives her a manila envelope.
C: BILLY
D: Only you. Open this if I'm dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please.
E: CONT'D
N: Madolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions. She accepts the envelope.
C: MADOLYN
D: All right.
C: BILLY
D: I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else.
N: He backs away, and then turns to go.
C: MADOLYN
D: I...we... I've, it's, been so confused... I just want to say...
E: he turns
N: He turns and looks at her. She doesn't speak: can't.
C: BILLY
D: Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right?
N: She moves her head slightly, watches him go.
S: INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER.
N: MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ... then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer.
T: We DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM.
S: INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
N: A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a horror film.
C: COLIN
D: I was dreaming...
C: MADOLYN
D: What?
C: COLIN
D: I was dreaming I was dead.
C: MADOLYN
D: Death is hard. Life is much easier.
N: Referring to the envelope
C: COLIN
D: What's this?
C: MADOLYN
D: Open it
N: He does.
C: COLIN
D: Really?
C: MADOLYN
D: Yeah.
C: COLIN
D: Really?
C: MADOLYN
D: Yeah.
C: COLIN
D: You're joking...
C: MADOLYN
D: It's not a joke, it's a human being.
N: Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her.
S: INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying there on the counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes the string and sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes looking at: AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20 Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.] MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it. Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET. And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens. COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t- shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong.
C: COLIN
D: What?
N: MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE DIALOGUE.]
C: COLIN
D: Your guys shouldn't have done that.
E: CONT'D
C: COSTELLO
D: One of us was going to have to die. It tends to be the other guy.
N: COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility.
C: COLIN
D: I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.
C: COSTELLO
D: So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom.
C: COLIN
D: He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking.
C: COSTELLO
D: Give me his location. Tonight.
N: COLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other.
C: MADOLYN
D: I thought I was the liar.
C: COLIN
D: I can explain.
N: She goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers it.
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY
N: BILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the knife.
C: BILLY
D: Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried.
S: INT. MADOLYN AND COLIN'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS
N: COLIN closes a door to speak privately.
C: COLIN
D: What do you want?
C: BILLY
D: I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick.
C: COLIN
D: Where are you?
C: BILLY
D: Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on.
N: COLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He knocks. No answer.
C: COLIN
D: Did we not talk about this? This is my job.
N: It's over. He starts to punch the door, and then does not.
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY
N: COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking for a tail...
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY
N: COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull.
C: BILLY
D: Get your hands up. Hands. Hands.
C: COLIN
D: Put the fuckin' gun down.
N: BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!" at Colin every time he makes a move).
C: COLIN
D: I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: What did you say?
E: turning him around
C: COLIN
D: I can get you your...
N: BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open. Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun.
C: COLIN
D: Fuck, shit...
E: CONT'D spitting teeth
C: BILLY
D: You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested.
E: going for Colin's cuffs
C: COLIN
D: Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant.
E: as BILLY cuffs him
C: BILLY
D: Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth.
C: COLIN
D: What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are.
C: BILLY
D: Would you shut the fuck up.
C: COLIN
D: I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
N: BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.
C: BILLY
D: You erased me?
C: COLIN
D: Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens.
C: BILLY
D: What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head.
C: COLIN
D: Watch what happens.
C: BILLY
D: What, you think you're gonna get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. I'm arresting you.
E: safeties the gun
C: COLIN
D: That's the stupidest thing you could do.
C: BILLY
D: Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick. But I'm still fucking arresting you.
E: hits him whaling him in the beats
N: COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
C: BILLY
D: [You are what you do.] Get up. I said get the fuck up.
E: CONT'D COLIN doesn't move.
N: BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both hear it.
C: BROWN
D: Put down the weapon and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.
N: BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.
C: BILLY
D: I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.
C: COLIN
D: Help me.
N: Billy realizes he's in a truly shitty situation: appearances are everything.
C: BROWN
D: Put the weapon on the deck and step away from Sergeant Sullivan.
C: COLIN
D: Shoot the fuckin' prick.
E: a mess, bloody-mouthed
C: BILLY
D: Where's Dignam? I told you to bring Dignam!
E: desperqte
C: COLIN
D: Shoot the motherfucker!
C: BROWN
D: Put the weapon on the ground and we'll discuss it.
C: BILLY
D: He was Costello's rat. I got evidence. Tapes. Other documents.
C: BROWN
D: Maybe you do, but right now I need you to drop the weapon.
C: BILLY
D: I told you I've got the evidence cold linking this prick to Costello... You fuckin' know who I am. I'm taking him downstairs now.
E: BROWN wavers
N: BROWN, weapon ready, follows into the elevator lobby.
S: INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY/ELEVATOR. DAY
N: BILLY moves COLIN into the elevator and as the doors close looks back at BROWN, still in a Mexican stand-off. COLIN, nose broken, blood masking his face.
C: COLIN
D: I can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun.
N: The indicator ticks. Down, down, down. Colin sobs.
C: COLIN
D: Just fucking kill me.
E: CONT'D
C: BILLY
D: I am killing you.
N: The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face, half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up. BARRIGAN lowers his pistol. COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the bloody elevator and down at the dead man.
C: BROWN
D: Shit...
E: holstering his gun
N: BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head. COLIN stares at him.
C: BARRIGAN
D: Did you think you were the only one he had? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI. It's you and me now. We have to take care of each other. You understand?
C: COLIN
D: All right. Give me that.
N: BARRIGAN casually hands COLIN BILLY'S GUN. COLIN presses the gun against BARRIGAN's forehead and fires.
S: EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY
N: POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto ambulances. COLIN, hands free, is drinking coffee from a paper cup, being checked out by a doctor.
S: INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER
N: COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics. He's maybe had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody clothes.
C: COLIN
D: At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired.
E: drinks water
N: COLIN looks up, eyes clear, perfectly believable. As we transition to the FUNERAL...bagpipes coming up.
C: COLIN
D: I'd like to go on record that I am recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.
E: CONT'D
N: ON SOUND BAGPIPES (Something like"Cross of Fire") as we DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
N: BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting. MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him, apparently forever. COLIN squares off: his job in the world is to get ahead. A salute is fired with rifles. But later... COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.
C: COLIN
D: What about the baby?
N: She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.
S: INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
N: COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows, DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has plastic hospital boots on his feet.
C: COLIN
D: OK.
E: accepting it, sort of, but only in a COLIN way
N: DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor. DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so it's not in the shot when it FREEZES.
