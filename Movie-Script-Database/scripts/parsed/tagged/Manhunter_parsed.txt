S: EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
N: The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington. His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio- let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea. Then:
C: CRAWFORD
D: I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
E: beat
C: CRAWFORD
D: How much do you know?
C: GRAHAM
D: What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions?
E: beat
C: CRAWFORD
D: Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;
E: beat
C: GRAHAM
D: What else did you keep out of the papers?
C: CRAWFORD
D: Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
C: GRAHAM
D: Somebody hurt him?
C: CRAWFORD
D: Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
N: Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham. Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Why not?
C: GRAHAM
D: The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
C: CRAWFORD
D: And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
C: GRAHAM
D: You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Last two like this we had, you caught.
C: GRAHAM
D: That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
C: CRAWFORD
D: That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
C: GRAHAM
D: I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that.
E: beat
C: CRAWFORD
D: You look all right now.
C: GRAHAM
D: I am all right.
N: Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.
C: CRAWFORD
D: If you can't look anymore, I understand...
C: GRAHAM
D: As long as they're dead...
C: CRAWFORD
D: These are all dead, Will.
N: PICTURES If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling. CLOSE: GRAHAM looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he puts them down and looks along the beach. GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand. MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen around her ankles. Her body language openly states hostility. It's towards Crawford.
C: GRAHAM
D: Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
E: O.S.
C: CRAWFORD
D: I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect
E: O.S.
N: Molly starts walking forward. On it...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT
N: are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes.
C: MOLLY
D: He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
C: GRAHAM
D: What did he want?
C: MOLLY
D: He asked how you are.
C: GRAHAM
D: And you said?
C: MOLLY
D: I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
C: GRAHAM
D: I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything.
E: sarcastic
C: MOLLY
D: You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
E: heat
C: GRAHAM
D: We have it good, don't we?
C: MOLLY
D: All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
N: There is a soft pleading in her voice.
C: GRAHAM
D: What the hell can I do?
C: MOLLY
D: What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
E: after a pause
C: GRAHAM
D: If I were?
C: MOLLY
D: Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh?
E: facing him heat
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
E: touches the side of her face
N: As he puts an arm around Molly...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEACH - KEVIN - TWILIGHT
N: is working in the sand. Behind him Graham is stapling chicken wire to two foot-high fence posts.
C: KEVIN
D: Will it keep them out?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yeah. ..
C: KEVIN
D: How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
C: GRAHAM
D: In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
C: KEVIN
D: Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CRAWFORD + MOLLY - NIGHT
N: On the porch swing. Beyond them at the water's edge Graham nothing to each other the fence. Crawford and Molly say or a while. Then, finally:
C: MOLLY
D: Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
C: CRAWFORD
D: I have to.
C: MOLLY
D: You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
C: CRAWFORD
D: Because it's his bad luck to be special.
C: MOLLY
D: He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
C: MOLLY
D: You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
N: There is a pause between them. Molly lights a cigarette. Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms on his knees.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
C: MOLLY
D: No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
E: beat
C: CRAWFROD
D: I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ATLANTA STREET - WIDE - NIGHT
N: Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted. The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME. An Atlanta Police department car pulls to the curb and stops. The door opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the passenger side.
C: GRAHAM
D: Thanks for the lift.
E: distant
C: OFFICER
D: I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's right.
C: OFFTCER
D: There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS.
C: GRAHAM
D: Thanks.
E: getting out
N: Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT
N: Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re- placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts playing through the bushes in the side yard.., then the light appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been undisturbed. CLOSE: GLASS DOOR We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham enters. It's like he's a burglar. GRAHAM'S FEET walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going. A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly. Graham's feet pass our of frame...
S: INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR
N: is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash- light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing.
S: INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH
N: Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch. BLOOD screams at us from the walls.
C: CLOSE: GRAHAM
D: doesn't visibly react.
N: WIDER - GRAHAM moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports. OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic. Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.
C: GRAHAM
D: intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot...
E: beat beat beat MORE
C: GRAHAM
D: Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds?
E: CONT'D beat
T: CUT TO:
N: ZNT. LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT is dark. We see nothing. Light comes on. Graham enters. He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees... ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom. He doesn't let it unnerve him.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT
N: The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant... More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image. He takes out his tape recorder again.
C: GRAHAM
D: There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?
N: HOLD ON Graham.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE, ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT
N: Graham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big "Hi" badges. One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby below. A good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them. Graham is leaning against the glass. CONVENTIONEER #1 ...like to rip me off a piece of that! CONVENTIONEER #2 Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds. The other cracks up. GRAHAM snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2. CONVENTIONEER #2 sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles: CONVENTIONEER #1 What the fuck are you lookin' at? Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens. Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2. CONVENTIONEER #l (being pulled out of elevator) What are you, a faggot? Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall. Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist Graham looks away.
T: CUT TO:
N: ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth- day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope. The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise. GRAHAM has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs. Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat- tress.
C: GRAHAM
D: When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?
E: into the tape recorder beat
N: Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks up the phone and dials. He waits. Then:
C: GRAHAM
D: Molly?
E: into phone
C: MOLLY
D: Huh? Will? Is that you?
E: V.O. asleep beat
C: GRAHAM
D: It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. I love you...
E: beat
C: MOLLY
D: Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
E: V.O.
N: Will hangs up the phone. He reaches over and punches "Play" on the VTR. WIDE SHOT: THE ROOM - GRAHAM VTR backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs. Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib- bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It's indoors. It's rain- ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic. Mrs. Leeds smiles.
C: GRAHAM
D: You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did you open their eyes? There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it? There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off
E: into tape recorder beat beat
N: to touch her. You took off your glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched her with your bare hands! And then you put the gloves back an. And you wiped her down! While your gloves were off? (shouts) DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES? THEIR DEAD EYES?! FAST MOVEMENTS: GRAHAM'S HAND snakes out and hits the "Stop" button on the VTR. PHONE is picked up and we MOVE WITH IT to his face. Graham punches numbers into the phone. He waits. He clamps dawn again. He is cold, calm.
C: GRAHAM
D: Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
C: CRAWFORD
D: He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
E: V.O.
N: Get him to Atlanta.
C: CRAWFORD
D: You said the guy down here is good.
E: V.O.
C: GRAHAM
D: He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
C: CRAWFORD
D: What do you want to do?
E: V.O.
C: GRAHAM
D: Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
E: heat
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ATLANTA DETECTIVE BUREAU - MOVING WITH GRAHAM, CRAWFORD
N: + SPRINGFIELD -DAY down the corridor.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
C: GRAHAM
D: The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: Why do you think he took his gloves off?
C: GRAHAM
D: Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: 'Intimate? !"
E: sudden distaste
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. Everybody else was dead.
E: beat
N: Springfield looks at Graham. Springfield needs answers, not voodoo. Then they enter the squad room. Twenty detectives sit at desks. Graham and Crawford move to the back of the class.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: All right. House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. R & I has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now. Dr. Princi.
E: beat
N: DR. DOMINIQUE PRINCI, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of teeth. He hold's up a dental cast.
C: DR. PRINCI
D: This is what the subject's teeth look like. The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham. As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors -- the teeth here and here.
E: beat
N: The teeth look like teeth from a small bear.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything?
N: Graham doesn't like talking in public. He stutters and starts to say something...
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: Can't hear you. Can you come up to the front?
N: Graham walks to the front of the room.
C: GRAHAM
D: He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: He only bit women so far, right?
C: GRAHAM
D: That's all we know about.
E: MORE
C: GRAHAM
D: Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... He bites a lot.
E: CONT'D beat beat beat
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: What's average?
C: GRAHAM
D: Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.
N: Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... (beat) ... that's all I have. Graham sits down.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go.
N: They start to rise. Springfield remembers.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: One more thing: I've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy. Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That's it.
E: on laughter
N: Detectives file out. Crawford and Graham remain. Springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other detectives to leave.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: We don't have shit, and we know it.
E: to Crawford
N: Dr. Princi joins them.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. He killed nine people, didn't he?
E: to Graham beat
C: GRAHAM
D: Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: What happened to them?
C: GRAHAM
D: One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter?
C: GRAHAM
D: Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: What would you call him?
N: Graham doesn't answer.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: To yourself...
C: GRAHAM
D: I call him a monster.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: I understand he cut you pretty good...
C: GRAHAM
D: (cold right turn> What about the dog?
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
C: GRAHAM
D: Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: No.
C: GRAHAM
D: Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
C: CRAWFORD
D: A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
E: alert
C: GRAHAM
D: Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
N: Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield answers.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: Yeah? Lemme put you on the speaker phone.
E: waits
C: JIMMIE PRICE
D: Who am I talking to?
E: V.O.
C: CRAWIIORD
D: Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here.
C: JIMMIE PRICE
D: I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm.
E: V.O.
N: Springfield reacts.
C: JIMMIE PRICE
D: Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
E: V.O.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Can you make an identification off it?
C: JIMMIE PRICE
D: Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Hangs up.
E: V.O.
C: SPRINGFIELD
D: thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very changed.
N: GRAHAM senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door.
T: CUT TO:
N: EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield, the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No- body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them.
C: LOUNDS
D: Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... !
N: CLOSE: GRAHAM walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel trap. He's repressing something powerful.
C: LOUNDS
D: When did they call you in, Will? What have you got?
E: running on, behind them
N: Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Lounds, give it a rest...
C: LOUNDS
D: Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!
N: Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:
C: LOUNDS
D: How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them?
N: Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to turn him around. GRAHAM Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from Lounds.
C: GRAHAM
D: Keep the fuck away from me!
E: very low
N: Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go. WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and lands on all fours.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally:
E: over his shoulder to Lounds
C: GRAHAM
D: ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
C: CRAWFORD
D: I know...
N: Graham looks away. Then he lights another cigarette.
C: GRAHAM
D: Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
E: back to business
C: CRAWFORD
D: Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
C: CRAWFORD
D: You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. ..
C: GRAHAM.
D: Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right? We'll get him one way or the other.
E: pause
C: CRAWFORD
D: What's one way?
C: GRAHAM
D: We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever... If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
E: beat
C: CRAWFORD
D: We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack. What's the other?
E: beat
C: GRAHAM
D: He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
C: CRAWFORD
D: No other possibilities?
C: GRAHAM
D: You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.

E: long stare at Crawford; then

D: I have to see somebody.
N: There is a silence. Graham does not want to tell her that he is going to see Lecter. Molly stays cool, she doesn't pursue it.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
E: V.O.
C: GRAHAM
D: Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
E: coming back
C: MOLLY
D: Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL look green at breakfast.

N: Molly interrupts:
C: MOLLY
D: Will, I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff... I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you. And you are doing the right thing. It's costing you, too. And I know that. And I'm here. I'LL be here whenever you come home. Or I'LL meet you anywhere. Anytime. That's what I called to say...

N: Graham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of Molly herself.
C: GRAHAM
D: Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. ..
N: MOLLY (V.O.)
C: GRAHAM
D: I love you...
N: WIDE SHOT: GRAHAM slowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half- packed.

N: DR. CHILTON - DAY
C: DR. CHILTON
D: Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham?
C: GRAHAM
D: I'm not a doctor. I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible.
E: O.S. beat
C: TWO SHOT
D: Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted.
C: DR. CHILTON
D: Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
C: GRAHAM
D: I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
C: DR. CHILTON
D: As long as it's on soft paper. You may find this curious.
E: Pause
N: He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines.
C: DR. CHILTON
D: Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated. Do you notice the strange thing? His pulse never got over eighty- five. Even when he tore into her face.
E: pause
N: Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a. response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is a blank.
C: DR. CHILTON
D: The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
N: 25 .
C: DR. CHILTON
D: When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
N: DR. CHILTON looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility. Right now he's seeing some more.
C: GRAHAM
D: I want to see Lecktor now.
E: stands
C: DR. CHILTON
D: Uh... sure...
S: INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY
N: We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters. An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now: GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not stirred. Then:
C: LECKTOR
D: That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
C: GRAHAM
D: I keep getting it for Christmas.
N: CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain. Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham is the patient.
C: LECKTOR
D: Did you get my card?
C: GRAHAM
D: I got it. Thank you.
C: GRAHAM' S
D: struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions.
C: LECKTOR
D: And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
C: GRAHAM
D: Stuart is fine.
C: LECKTOR
D: Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: LECKTOR
D: Of course, you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
E: pause
C: GRAHAM
D: Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
C: LECKTOR
D: And?
C: GRAHAM
D: Very interesting, even to a layman.
N: Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his head. Then:
C: LECKTOR
D: A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
C: GRAHAM
D: You've read the transcript. It's all there.
C: LECKTOR
D: No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will?
C: GRAHAM
D: It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
C: LECKTOR
D: It doesn't matter to me, Will.
E: smiles
C: GRAHAM
D: I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
C: LECKTOR
D: Yes, I thought so.
C: GRAHAM
D: It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
C: LECKTOR
D: Yes .
C: GRAHAM
D: You read about it, I'm sure.
C: LECKTOR
D: In the papers. I don't rear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
E: laughs
C: GRAHAM
D: I thought you would have some ideas.
C: LECKTOR
D: Why should I tell you?
C: GRAHAM
D: There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
C: LECKTOR
D: Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. Never mind, it's boring.
E: laugh; beat
C: GRAHAM
D: You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
C: LECKTOR
D: Pray tell.
C: GRAHAM
D: I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
C: LECKTOR
D: Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
C: GRAHAM
D: No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are.
C: LECKTOR
D: Then how did you catch me, Will?
C: GRAHAM
D: You had disadvantages.
C: LECKTOR
D: What disadvantage?.
C: GRAHAM
D: You're insane.
C: LECKTOR
D: You're very tan, Will.
N: Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to Lecktor.
C: LECKTOR
D: Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
N: Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then relaxes:
C: LECKTOR
D: Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
C: GRAHAM
D: I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
C: LECKTOR
D: Do you have the file with you
E: interrupts
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes.
C: LECKTOR
D: Pictures?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes.
C: LECKTOR
D: let me have them,, and I might consider it.
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: LECKTOR
D: Do you dream much, Will?
C: GRAHAM
D: Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
C: LECKTOR
D: You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
N: Graham gets up and starts to walk away.
C: LECKTOR
D: let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think.
N: Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant. Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray. Lecktor pulls it through.
C: GRAHAM
D: sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:
N: GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP DR. LECKTOR Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour- nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with- no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light. Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:
C: LECKTOR
D: There is a very shy boy, Will.
E: O.S.
N: GRAHAM snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.
C: LECKTOR
D: What were the yards like?
C: GRAHAM
D: Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
C: LECKTOR
D: Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
C: GRAHAM
D: That's interesting.
C: LECKTOR
D: It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes. I'd considered it.
C: LECKTOR
D: You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
C: GRAHAM
D: I want your opinion.
C: LECKTOR
D: I don't have one right now.
C: GRAHAM
D: When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
C: LECKTOR
D: May I keep the file?
C: GRAHAM
D: I haven't decided yet.
C: LECKTOR
D: I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
N: Threat.
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: LECKTOR
D: Do you know how you caught me, Will?
C: GRAHAM
D: Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
N: Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked. Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to get unlocked faster!
C: LECKTOR
D: Do you know how you caught me?
N: The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears is :
C: LECKTOR
D: The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself.
E: O.S.
N: The DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor.

GRAHAM'S POV: GRASS is dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral breakup. As it returns to a normal green... TIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM breathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building: "CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE." He leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image is flattened in a LONG LENS.

We will come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy, a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade sign says: "THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL." Mrs. Sherman has brown hair. She wears a bikini. She has a nice body. She's sensuous and tan in her thirties. She dives into the pool. The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs. Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair. A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis- tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera. Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse. It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming our of the water... REAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN Beyond is the screen.

C: EILEEN
D: Mr. Dollarhyde?
N: CLOSER - DOLLARHYDE looks up. His face bears the scars of a Z-plast procedure to fix a harelip and cleft palate. Immediately, in characteristic gesture, he curls his right hand under his nose to hide his Z-plast scars.

C: DOLLARHYDE
D: Thank you, Eileen.
N: Graciously Dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses to an empty table. He opens his newspaper. TRACK ACROSS FRANCIS DOLLARHME'S BACK where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler. It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline. The only words we catch are: "FBI Manhunter Consults Fiend Who Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds." We also catch: "The Tooth Fairy - Psychopathic Slayer of Entire Families in Birmingham and Atlanta..." CLOSE: FRANCIS DOLLABHYDE takes off the black goggles with red lenses. His eyes are white violet. He turns the page. NATIONAL TATTLER'S OLD PICTURE OF GRAHAEI It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor. It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals. The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover- ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecktor." EXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi- tal. The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible. Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush- ing it sensitively. It works its way to Graham's face and the finger stops and blots it out.

He backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some trees. There are three. Graham looks around. BRANCHES now obscure the Jacobi house. Something glints right... SEARCHING THROUGH GRASS At the base of one elm tree. A ring tab from a soft drink can is half-buried in leaves. Graham's fingers move leaves aside. GRAHAM looks slowly up the tree trunk. RED CREEK MUD Wedged into the first strong limb, it's from the instep of a boot. GRAHAM hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs the far side of the elm. His head and his cheek raise through limbs. His eye is six inches away when he finds a soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk. GRAHAM I love it. Sweet Jesus, yes come on, can. He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt, bracketing exposures. Then he tears a small branch and uses it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. He looks to his left. Something he sees stops him cold. A SYMBOL is carved in the wood. GRAHAM photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by a cutting tool. Then he looks... OVER GRAHAM'S SHOULDER: THE JACOBI HOUSE A perfect view.

D: ...so how do I play him, Sidney?
C: DR. BLOOM
D: Compliment him. Tell him most people don't have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened, that sort of thing. If he's paranoid, play into his grievance. Let him air it. If he's picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat, give him what he's after. A little at a time.

D: No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.

C: KEVIN
D: How?
C: GRAHAM
D: With a knife.
N: (MORE)
C: GRAHAM
D: I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was.., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait .
E: CONT'D beat beat beat
C: KEVIN
D: You went in the apartment?
C: GRAHAM
D: Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
N: We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know.
C: GRAHAM
D: I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay.
C: KEVIN
D: Did the girl die?
C: GRAHAM
D: No.
C: KEVIN
D: She got all right?

C: MOLLY
D: It's hard to have anything, isn't it? Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This is a damn slippery planet.
N: When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares out to sea:
C: GRAHAM
D: Slick as hell.
N: Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.
C: MOLLY
D: You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?

D: Do you remember what you said?

D: I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
C: BLOOM
D: Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
C: CRAWFORD
D: That was Peterson upstairs.
C: BLOOM
D: It was you who did the asking.
C: CRAWFORD
D: He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
C: BLOOM
D: I wouldn't presume to try.
C: CRAWFORD
D: You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
C: BLOOM
D: He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall. But I don't think he's psychic. What he has it empathy and projection He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
C: CRAWFORD
D: Why aren't you ever alone with him?
C: BLOOM
D: Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. So do I. What do you want?
E: beat beat
C: CRAWFORD
D: His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
C: BLOOM
D: I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
C: CRAWFORD
D: That's when it happened?
C: BLOOM
D: No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? ' That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.

N: PULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his tape recorder.
C: GRAHAM
D: What have we missed?
E: to Bloom
C: BLOOM
D: He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds.
N: Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again.
C: GRAHAM
D: The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . And probably had sexual relations with his mother...

N: Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits. The photographer starts breaking down his gear. Crawford takes Graham aside.

C: GRAHAM
D: Molly. I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile...
E: pause
N: They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate. Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen.

His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. why the mirrors?

C: REBA
D: Put your back against the doer. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
E: WOMAN

D: The activities of nocturnal animals.
C: REBA
D: When do you need it?
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: In eight days.
C: REBA
D: Let me stick this in the black hole.
N: We see some movements. Then the light comes on. DOLLARHYDE'S hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars. Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an uncharacteristically open smile. He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand why he can do this. REBA McCLAIN is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's thirty with a handsome prairie face.
C: REBA
D: The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code . It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?

C: REBA
D: Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.

S: INT. REBA'S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - REBA

C: DOLLARHYDE
D: How did you come to Gateway?
C: BEBA
D: They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
N: Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime, guiding it with her thumb.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: You worked out well.
C: REBA
D: You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
N: DOLLARHYDE reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his attention goes to: KNIFE in Reba's hand. Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints in the light. Another slice of lime falls.
C: REBA
D: I'll probably go back to it someday.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: Uh-huh.
N: Silence. Reba hands him his drink.
C: REBA.
D: If you don't want to talk. okay. Bur I hope you will... because I like what you say.
N: Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness.
C: REBA
D: May I touch your face? I want to know if you're smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or not...
E: as Dollarhyde reacts
N: There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip and cleft palate were fixed. REBA' S HAND Dollarhyde's fist grabs it. DOLLARHYDE turns her hand in the light.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: Take my word for it that I'm... smiling .
N: There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face.
C: RZBA

It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them, REARSHOT: GRAHAM half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a life by two adults and three children. Everything from washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear:
C: VOICE :1
D: What's he doin'? Been in there all day .
E: O.S.
N: VOICE :2 (O.S.) Just sits and stares at the stuff... The CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD.

N: Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment.
C: DR. WARFIELD
D: All right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right. I'll be right here beside you.
N: We see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about to touch. TEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm. REBA'S HAND The fur springs between her fingers.
C: TIGER'S GREAT PAW
D: Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder.
N: TIGER'S HEAD Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head. TIGER'S MOUTH The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms. TIGER'S CHEST Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder.

T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING BOOM - PAN
N: It's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture. A Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room. A full-sized mural from JPL of the Mars surface is on one wall. We MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors, a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and Reba on it. They're watching a movie.
T: DISSOLVE TO:

C: DOLLARKYDE
D: I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
N: Dollarhyde looks at Reba. Then he looks at the film. The two of them are like a tableau of suburban TV-watching. They're like a married couple sitting on the sofa. Except: REAR SHOT OVER DOLLARHYDE + REBA TO THE SCBEEN The movie is Mrs. Jacobi looking up, And Mrs. Leeds looking up. And Mrs. Sherman's legs scissoring in the water. Then her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes herself our of the pool. Dollarhyde's blase, watching his horror show. He looks at Reba. REBA unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes of her face. EXTREMELY CLOSE: REBA'S NECK The smooth skin and down-like hairs undulate from the bearing of her living heart. DOLLARHYDE is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and doesn't see:
C: REBA'S HAND
D: moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde.
N: REBA moves towards Dollarhyde's face. ON DOLLARHYDE, AND REBA ENTERS THE FRAME and kisses Dollarhyde on the mouth. Dollarhyde's eyes freeze open. He is stunned. Reba's left hand opens Dollarhyde's shirt and slides down his' chest towards his pants...

E: O.S.
N: Reba's hand with her long, gentle fingers ENTERS THE FRAME caressing the side of Dollarhyde's face. We will hear Reba's voice and see little of her. We will see Dollarhyde's face and the expressions on it: wonder and amazement.

His hand caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her face . DOLLARHME wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re- lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves... REBA Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the back of her head and offers her some water. OVERHEAD ANGLE: DOLLARHYDE + REBA Dollarhyde's arm moves under her pillow. She snuggles closer to him. Dollarhyde's eyes are moist. Reba's hand moves up his stomach and rests on his chest. It rests above his heart. It rests on the face of the crimson dragon. When she is asleep again, Dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts it on his face. Dollarhyde -- cloven in two, accepted by a living Reba -- will not sleep for a very long time.

N: REBA In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard. DOLLARHYDE nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen- ing to him and that she's okay.

D: I'm fine, Francis.
N: Dollarhyde gets out.

D: Fill it up and check the oil, please.
N: Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He wipes and wipes the same spot. REBA'S dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat. Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats. From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better... MEN'S ROOM DOOR Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van. DRIVER'S WINDOW Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing... ATTENDANT unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba. DOLLARHYDE is coming around the van. Fast.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: You sonofabitch...
C: ATTENDANT
D: You don't like it? You know what you can do about it...
E: cocky
N: Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away... Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it. REBA'S FACE through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to roll down the window. ATTENDANT is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere. DOLLARHYDE pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end of the spout. ATTENDANT is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the man into the wall, compressing his thorax.
C: DOLLARHYDE
D: I ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart...
N: The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk. Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...

D: When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!

C: GRAHAM
D: I don't believe in God.
C: LECKTOR
D: You should, Will. God's terrific! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn. Don't you think that felt good? He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.

C: GRAHAM
D: That's why the boltcutter.
C: CRAWFORD
D: What's that?
C: GRAHAM
D: He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
C: CRAWFORD
D: Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
C: GRAHAM
D: You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
C: CRAWFORD
D: He had to.
N: Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy report on Donald Jacobi.
C: GRAHAM

E: beat
C: SHERMAN
D: I can't thank you enough, I..,
N: Graham shakes his head. He doesn't want to be thanked. No one knows what to say. Graham looks at them:
C: SHERMAN FAMILY
D: standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they are very special: they are alive.
C: GRAHAM
D: I just wanted to stop by and... see you... I guess. That's all.
N: Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory. Then he nods. Then he leaves. GEORGE SHERMAN closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SHERMAN HOUSE - WIDE FROM DOOR: GRAHAM - NIGHT
N: -- in the MIDDLE of the FRAME -- walks down the sidewalk away from us towards the waiting cab. The rain pelts his black hat and black raincoat. 'Before he reaches the cab...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BEACH (MARATHON, FLORIDA)- GRAHAM - DAY
N: sitting with his back to us. Beyond him the sun reflects off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the silhouetted image of Graham. GRAHAM IS WATCHING the fenced-in area of beach he and Kevin built at the opening of the film. A baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and is swept away by surf into the life-supporting sea. CLOSE: GRAHAM drinks a beer. He senses a presence and starts to turn... WIDE REAR SHOT: BEACH + CRAHAM turns towards us. Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Her coat is under her arm. She drops it and her flight Sag in the sand and continues walking to Graham. GRAHAM stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the water eat into their figures as they look at each other. Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:
C: MOLLY
D: Let's forget who said what to whom...
C: GRAHAM
D: You got a deal...
N: Graham takes Molly's hand. WATER'S EDGE Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea. The highlights burn out sections of the two people.
C: MOLLY
D: So how'd we do...?
N: Graham looks at her. He touches the side of her cheek and her hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make closer contact.
C: GRAHAM
D: We did okay. Most of them made it...
E: beat
N: REARSHOT: GRAHAM + MOLLY Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm across Molly's shoulder. Molly's arm moves around Graham's waist. They look out to sea. In front of them, the surf kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant atoms. THE END
