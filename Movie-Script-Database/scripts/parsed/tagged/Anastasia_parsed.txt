N: on a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM. An ELDERLY WOMAN'S HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a moment, as WE HEAR her voice.

C: TATIANA
D: and grand parties. . .
E: CONT
N: The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as the day turns into night and the summer cools into winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages pull up to the front door.
C: TATIANA
D: A beautiful, magical time. . .
E: CONT
N: MOVE INTO THE PALACE
C: TATIANA
D: That would soon be gone forever. . .

S: INT. PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT
N: Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an ORCHESTRA plays. All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase. Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well, all her daughters except. . . ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a SERVENT (SONYA) 16, who is trying to catch up with Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.
C: SONYA
D: Princess Anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault!
E: whispering
C: ANASTASIA
D: Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll notice. . .
N: Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair, stopping Anastasia with a
C: ANASTASIA
D: . . . owwwwwwwww!
E: loudly
N: All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride. Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile. The music suddenly becomes a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a proccession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. "THE RULARS OF RUSSIA" (OPENING NUMBER) The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the pride of all Russia". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever. During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father. Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a shock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his eyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still waltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The guests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia sees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a dance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses it to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her. Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel.
C: IVAR
D: You're a servent! Never forget your place!
E: angrily
C: DMITIRI
D: Someday my place will be out there!
E: defiant
C: IVAR
D: Never! You're a peasant, Dmitri! Back in the kitchen
N: RULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.) UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen. It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL CONFUSION. The servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior: they imply that they have their own "party", that change is coming. While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives. DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following scenes. ON TATIANA in a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious and very regal. She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her.
C: TATIANA
D: Why were you so late tonight
C: ANASTASIA
D: I was showing Sonya something . . .
C: TATIANA
D: What were you showing her?
C: ANASTASIA
D: How to read.
E: sheepishly
C: TATIANA
D: I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
C: ANASTASIA
D: I know, but I had to because . . .
N: Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with pride. Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.
C: ANASTASIA
D: Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
E: cuddling
C: TATIANA
D: It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
N: Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful MUSIC BOX. Tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key. CLOSE UP the key bearing the inscription "Together in Paris".
C: ANASTASIA
D: "Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
C: TATIANA
D: When you're older . . .
N: Anastasia makes a disgruntled face. Tatiana laughs.
C: TATIANA
D: Until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that I'm waiting for you.
N: Tatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they embrace. Then, suddenly . . . ON THE GRAND CHANDELIER the lights begin to fade in and out. GROUP SHOT as PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then, a WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance floor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO. Suddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs out of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the crowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in fear. The tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke - leaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the floor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other men in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes - which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is dressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope tied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a glowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern. VARIOUS SHOTS of Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitri peeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia, all of whom are frightened. NICHOLAS as he gathers his son and wife to his side
C: NICHOLAS
D: Rasputin! You're alive . . .
C: RASPUTIN
D: Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
E: advancing
C: NICHOLAS
D: I had nothing to do with it!
E: honestly
C: RASPUTIN
D: You gave the orders!
C: NICHOLAS
D: I did no such thing!
C: RASPUTIN
D: After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
N: Rasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smoke which seems to grow larger. Eerie moaning noises come from the reliquary. PEOPLE back awayin terror.
C: RASPUTIN
D: The Romanov dynasty ends here! You, your wife and children will all die within the fortnight!
E: CONT.
C: ANASTASIA
D: NO!
N: Anastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of her father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's shaking hands are the only thing that gives away her fear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.
C: ANASTASIA
D: We're not afraid of you!
C: RASPUTIN
D: You . . . my little babushka . . . you'll be so much fun to kill that I'll save you for last!
E: furious
N: Twirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as Bartok circles around his head. The smoke that emerges seems to have almosy a human shape to it.
C: RASPUTIN
D: THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV LINE - FOREVER !!!!
N: The tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a frenzy and then EXPLODING. The smoke clears and Rasputin is gone. As the lights return to normal the Romanov family all stand together, and try to look regal and in control once again.
C: TATIANA
D: Some say Rasputin ad harnessed all the dark powers of evil and that it was his curse which brought about the end . . .
E: O.C.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: the ROMANOV FAMILY fades into a PORTRAIT OF THE FAMILY.
C: TATIANA
D: I will never know for sure. All I do know is that the beauty of our world was soon Gone . . . Forever . . .
E: O.C.
N: a lick of BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME creeps into view. "RULERS OF RUSSIA" (VOCAL REPRISE) HUGE, OMINOUS VOCALS reprise the onceglorious watlz of the Romanovs, heralding the end of their world and underscoring the coming revolution. PULL BACK to see the PORTRAIT, a huge FRIEZE which covers an entire entire wall, singeing as the FLAME creeps up the nearby drapery, tinting the room in a red glow. A SCREAMING MOB, some in uniform, some not, has crashed into the palace and is heading up the stairs. A few in the mob fire off orange RIFLE SHOTS.
S: INT. ANASTASIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anastasia BOLTS UP, hearing the shots. Her music box is next to her on her nightstand.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Mass confusion as the MOB is met by a few SERVANTS, who try to stop them from advancing. More shots. ON THE ROMANOV'S still in nightclothes, are being rushed down the hallway. Tatiana is next to Anastasia as Anastasia stopsdead in her tracks.
C: ANASTASIA
D: My music mox!
N: Anastasia turns around and runs back down the hall. Tatiana tries to stop her.
C: TATIANA
D: Anastasia, no!
N: It's too late, Anastasia fights her way back into her room, with Tatiana following her. FROM THE OTHER END OF THE HALLWAY we see Dmitri watching amidst all the confusion.
S: INT. ANASTASIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Anastasia grabs her music box as Tatiana rushes in.
C: TATIANA
D: Hurry, child!
N: LOUD RIFLE SHOTS are heard as Dmitri bursts into the room, closing the door behind him.
C: DMITRI
D: No - this way!
N: Dmitri runs to a wall panel and thows his weight against it. It opens, revealing a passage way.
C: DMITRI
D: Go! Run!! Out the servant's quarters!
E: CONT.
N: Tatiana, enormously grateful, looks at Dmitri as he flips his hair out of his face unconsciously.
C: DMITRI
D: Go!
N: Tatiana goes in as Dmitri shoves Anastasia toward the passageway, knocking the music box out of her hand. She reaches for it, but hearing the mob voices growing closer, he pushes her through the panel without it.
C: DMITRI
D: Go!
E: CONT.
N: Tatiana quickly follows Anastasia into the passageway and Dmitri closes the panel JUST AS the mob bursts in.
C: DMITRI
D: No one's here! Let's try the next room!
E: CONT. lying to the mob
N: The MOB, accepts the word of a peasant boy and rushes out. Dmitri picks up the music box and looks sadly toward the panel.
S: EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
N: Which is under siege by ROYALISTS trying to board the overcrowded train and the REVOLUTIONARIES who are trying to stop them. A TOURING CAR pulls up RIGHT ON THE TRACKS behind the caboose as the train starts to pull away. Tatiana and Anastasia climb out of the car and race for the train, fighting their way through the frenzied and frightened crowd. WE HEAR shouts of "The Empress - let her through!" which helps clear the way. Anastasia reaches the train first, then turns to see Tatiana. trying to catch up.
C: ANASTASIA
D: Hurry, Grandmama!
C: TATIANA
D: Get on! Anastasia, get on!
N: Anastasia refuses to board the train. UP AHEAD A MOB OF REVOLUTIONARIES block the tracks with a TRUCK ON ANASTASIA who pushes Tatiana up the stairs of the caboose. This puts Anastasia a few steps behind as the train speeds up. Tatiana is gripped by other passengers as she reaches out to Anastasia.
C: TATIANA
D: Grab my hand!
N: Anastasia reaches up and takes Tatiana's hand.
C: ANASTASIA
D: Don't let go!
N: CLOSE ON the TWO HANDS. then suddenly. her small hand is pulled from Tatiana's grasp and falls out of the frame.
C: TATIANA
D: ANASTASIA!
E: O.C.
N: ON ANASTASIA who has stumbled, hitting the ground hard. ON TATIANA horrified, screaming:
C: TATIANA
D: ANASTASIA!
N: Tatiana rushes to jump off the train after her, but is caught and held back by the ROYALIST PASSANGERS as the train CRASHES through the truck and picks up speed. TATIANA's POV: Anastasia rising from the ground, her hand outstretched. But she is suddenly swallowed up by the mob. SUPERIMPOSE: A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of Anastasia, in a happier time, smiling. UNDERSCORE: "THE MUSIC BOX THEME"

D: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
N: A gray and ugly, post-revolution building with a sign above the door that identifies it: "Young Comrades Without Parents".
S: INT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
N: CHILDREN of all ages clean the cold, gray dormitory. Their clothes are ragged and they look underfed. CLOSE ON ANYA, 18, pretty despite the boy's hand-me-down clothes she is forced to wear, is busy scrubbing the floor. Unlike the others, she is determined not to let her surroundings get to her. She hums a tune. The door suddenly SLAMS open and GREGOR, 8, and clearly terrified, comes running in followed by COMRADE PHLEGMENKOF - a huge woman carrying a switch.
C: GREGOR
D: Anya! Anya!
N: All of the OTHER KIDS turn away, not wanting to get involved. Anya focuses on Gregor, who is shivering with fright and on the verge of tears as Phlegmenkof approaches, swinging the switch menacingly.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: You can't get away from me now . . .
N: Phlegmenkof advances on Gregor. Anya takes the scrub brush and SHOVES it across the floor, right under Phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot. Phlegmenkof's feet fly out from under her and she SMASHES to the floor. Gregor hops over her huge body and runs to Anya for safety. Some of the OTHER KIDS glance over. A CHUBBY GIRL and a very pretty LITTLE GIRL, look at Anya with greeat admiration . . . someof the OTHERS think she's crazy. Phlegmenkof rises, covered with soap bubbles , and spins on Anya - who gives her a very innocent smile.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: You! You did this!
E: CONT.
N: Some of the OTHER CHILDREN laugh as soap bubbles fly off the enraged woman. She spins on them, her back to Anya.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: Brats! There'll be no supper for any of you! Back to work!
E: CONT.
N: Anya, behind Phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and angry gestures perfectly - as the CHILDREN laugh harder. Phlegmenkof spins and almost catches Anya. She advances on Anya as Gregor hides behind her legs.
C: ANYA
D: Don't touch him.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: You ragged, skinny, little nothing! I have had just about enough of you . . .
E: to Anya
N: Phlegmenkof raises her hand to slap Anya, who hold her ground. Suddenly, Phlegmenkof SNIFFS the air. ON THE KIDS as the horrible smell reaches them too. They all make faces and hold their noses. ON PHLEGMENKOF who first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench . . .
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: Comrade Serebreakov!
E: CONT.
N: She tries to straighten herself out nervously - this must be someone very important. COMRADE SEREBREAKOV stands in the doorway, lecherously eyeing the girls. He is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: Comrade Serebreakov! What a lovely surprise! What brings you here?
E: CONT. flirting
C: SEREBREAKOV
D: I need. . . a worker.
N: His eye catches Anya. He looks her up and down, his beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her.
C: SEREBREAKOV
D: I will take her.

C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: No, no, Comrade - you don't want her . . .
C: SEREBREAKOV
D: I want her.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: That's horrible, skinny thing?! She's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here! She didn't even know her name! That one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . .
C: SEREBREAKOV
D: I'll break her will. . . I shall come for you tomorrow at dawn. You will enjoy serving under me.
E: to Anya he touches her face as she pulls away
N: Smiling in anticipation, he exit.
C: PHLEGMENKOF
D: I couldn't break you - but he can!
N: And she turns to leave in a huff. Anya does one more imitation of her, making the CHILDREN laugh. But as Anya turns away from her audience, we see her facade fade and realize her terror of the future.
S: INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
N: The CHILDREN huddle in their cots under tattered, thin blankets. Anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the light of a FULL MOON, she ties a dull gray sheets together and anchors the "rope" to an ice cold radiator and throws the other end out of the window. She is about to climb out when she looks at the sleeping children and smiles sadly. She walks over to Gregor's bed and puts one hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and takes the hand of a sleeping LITTLE GIRL, who opens her eyes and smiles.
C: GREGOR

N: A CHUBBY TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL looks at Anya.
C: CHUBBY GIRL
D: But you are home.

C: GREGOR
D: Where is your home, Anya?
C: ANYA
D: I'm not sure but look. . .
N: Anya shows Gregor the key around her neck. CLOSE UP on the inscription: "Together in Paris"
C: ANYA

D: . . . that I must have been someone someone loved.
E: CONT. beat

D: Is your home in Paris?
C: ANYA
D: It might be. I have to go and find out.
N: Anya smiles lovingly at the children. "A SOMEPLACE AND A SOMEONE" (Anya's "I want" song). Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the children about how all she has is the key around her neck to the "someone and thesomeplace" she was "lost from long ago". She tells the children that she must go find them again. UNDERSCORE continues.
C: ANYA
D: I have to go now, before it gets light.
C: GREGOR
D: But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
E: worried
C: ANYA

N: Anya embraces the children and walks to the window.
C: GREGOR
D: Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?!
E: nervous, sad
C: ANYA
D: Then come find me.
N: Gregor is relieved and cuddles into his bed as Anya smiles lovingly and crawls out the window.
S: EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
N: Anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots. The knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half, sending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift. From the depths of the snow we HEAR her voice.
C: ANYA
D: I hope there's no snow in Paris. . .
E: O.C.
S: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN
N: A glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon. Anya stands at edge of the hill, looking down on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray orphanage looms behind her. Anya "borrows" an old, beat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill. Music picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and St. Petersburg looms nearer. "A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.) Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS - - full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her rickety bike toward the city. "Her heart is on its way" and nothing is going to stop her. Anya passes though the countryside toward the city. A peasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy Troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very fancy car zooms by. "A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.) Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from a peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family. People stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city. She is captivated by all the activity: cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc. "A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (CONT.) Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity. She'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her. SOARING
C: MUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION.
D: END MUSICAL NUMBER
N: Anya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a HUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts across Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack. On reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley after him.
S: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
N: Meetoo is trapped. The PACK surrounds him, ready to pounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle. The PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya and Meetoo. Anya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . . growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious as possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's a girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave, behind her and growls along with her. Suddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder. The pack has definately had enough - some start to back out quizzically, others turn and run like hell. Anya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully, wagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it back in his mouth.
C: ANYA
D: I think you should be more careful about who you invite to dinner!
N: Meetoo nods and lets out a little "bark" that sounds as if he were saying "retu". Anya pats him and heads back to her bike.
S: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY
N: Anya rides down the street. She doesn't see Meetoo, running like a little maniac behind her. Anya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign over the door: "The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy". She leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo, breathing heavily from his run, follows and almost reaches her when the heavy door slams in his face. He slumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.
S: INT. BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY - DAY
N: Anya enters and STOPS when she sees. . . LINES and LINES of people which seem to go on forever. She walks down the side of one line, trying to figure out which one to stand in.
C: ANYA
D: Could someone tell me. . .
N: PEASANT 1 End of the line!
C: ANYA
D: Which line?
N: PEASANT 2 Any line. PEASANT 3 All lines are good lines. PEASANT 1, 2, & 3 (in unison) In our beloved Soviet Union! They turn toward an armed Soviet Guard and smile sweetly, hoping he heard their flattery. He did.
C: GUARD
D: Very good. . .
N: He jots something down in his notebook. ON ANYA as she gets closer to the window. She turns to the person behind her.
C: ANYA
D: Is this the right line to get papers to travel?
N: PEASANT 4 Travel? Travel to where?
C: ANYA
D: To Paris. I have to get to Paris
N: PEASANT 5, in front of her, turns around. PEASANT 5 Paris?! What do they have in Paris that they don't have here? PEASANT 6 Shorter lines?! Peasant 6 is immediately carted off by TWO ARMED GUARDS for his blasphamy against the state. PEASANT 7 (quietly) Nobody leaves Soviet Russia. The OTHER PEASANTS join in with variations of "Nobody leaves Russia" as Anya reaches the window and speaks to the clerk.
C: ANYA
D: Is this where I get traveling papers?
C: CLERK
D: It would be if we let you travel which we don't so it isn't. Russia is the people's paradise!
E: loudly, for all to hear
N: And to further make his point, he slams shut his window, which immediately opens a crack as he whispers to Anya.
C: CLERK
D: See Dmitri. He can help.
E: CONT.
N: He shuts the window, only to open it again immediately.
C: CLERK
D: But you didn't hear it from me.
E: CONT.
N: He shuts the window.
C: ANYA
D: I didn't
E: doesn't get it
N: He opens it again.
C: CLERK
D: No.
N: The clerk sticks out a sign: "Samovar Break - back in ten minutes" and slams the window shut.
S: EXT. BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY
N: Anya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo and looks around at the hoards of people waiting in lines for everything: bread, gas, clothes, etc.
C: ANYA
D: Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . .
E: to herself
N: FOLLOW ANYA as she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting Soviets. Anya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air. Her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air. She spins around and sees Serebreakov DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET. Serebreakov is on a mission to find Anya. He turns in her direction just as a bus passes. Anya is gone. We now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping - he knows he'll never catch up to her now. Then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off into the mud. Happily, Meetoo trots off in her direction. Anya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in front of a cafe. PEASANT 9 (to Peasant 10) Which line is this? PEASANT 10 The line to get into the line.
C: ANYA
D: Excuse me, do you know Dmitri. . .
N: PEASANT 9 I know nothing! PEASANT 10 Nothing! PEASANTS 9 & 10 (whispering simultaneously) Try the tavern/ library. They begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers as to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library. Exasperated, Anya walks away. They call after her. PEASANTS9& 10 But we didn't tell you! Anya rolls her eyes in frustration. She doesn't see Meetoo at her feet.
C: ANYA
D: I wish they'd all stop telling me they didn't tell me!
E: To herself
N: Meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement. Anya looks down and sees him.
C: ANYA
D: What are you doing. . .
E: CONT.
N: Just then, she catches another whiff of something foul in the air. Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses Meetoo. Anya peeks out. A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead fish and rotten food passes Anya. She sighs with relief, it wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him. Anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET ARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY HUSBAND looks over his shoulder.
C: TINY HUSBAND
D: Could you get rid of her moustache?
E: To Artist
C: ANYA
D: Excuse me - I'm looking for a man named Dmitri. . .
N: The Artist quickly scribbles and address on his pad and hands it to her without turning around.
C: ARTIST
D: But I didn't write it.

N: An ACTRESS stands in front of what looks to be an OLD WOMAN in a shawl who's back is to the "audience". ACTRESS 1 (over the top) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia! I've waited so long to see you! The Actress then LUMBERS over to the OLD WOMAN, with a gait like John Wayne. REVERSE ANGLE to see the "Old Woman" is Vladimir, with a shawl over his head. He looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache. He rolls his eyes.

N: IN THE SEATS is Dmitri. Now 20 and darkly handsome. His hair still falling in his eyes as he flips it off his forehead.
C: DMITRI
D: Vladimir, calm down!
N: Vladimir walks off the stage and toward Dmitri.
C: VLADIMIR
D: This, my friend, as an exercise in futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!
N: Vladimir dramatically throws one end of his shawl over his shoulder.
C: DMITRI
D: For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . . and all I need is the right girl.
N: "A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE" (REPRISE (Dmitri's "I want") Dmitri SINGS a reprise of Anya's song, a COMIC VERSION, in which he expresses the hope that he can find the right girl for his scam. Anyone from a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she can fool Tatiana. (NOTE: We don't want to give Dmitri a whole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in Act I. By giving him a short reprise of Anya's song, we can effectively align these two characters emotionally.)
T: QUICK CUTS:
N: of various aspirants: ACTRESS 2 (heavy hasal) Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you.

D: Next!
E: O.C.
N: BACK TO DMITRI
C: DMITRI
D: I wouldn't be on the outside anymore. The ten million rubles would make me welcome anywhere. I'd really belong somewhere - if I could just find the right girl.
T: BACK TO QUICK CUTS:
N: A very round ACTRESS 5 ACTRESS 5 Oh, Grandmama. . .
C: DMITRI
D: Next!
E: O.C.
N: ACTRESS 6 (very intense) What's my modivation? ON VLADIMIR

T: CUT TO STANISLAVSKI
N: shrugs innocently.

E: CONT. laughing
N: Anya pats him on the head and heads off in the direction of Vlad and Dmitri. Meetoo, of course, follows her. FURTHER DOWN THE STREET Anya spots Vladimir and Dmitri turning the corner in the distance. Anya runs, trying to catch up with them. She turns the corner and STOPS. ANYA'S POV the PALACE in the distance, only now it's run down, boarded up and partially burned. Anya is taken back. She stares, fascinated by it - moved by it . As the sun sets behind the Palace, it's bathed in a beautiful golden light.
S: INT. PALACE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: CLOSE on a roaring fire, over which Vladimir has fasioned a roatating "spit" which is propelled by a Victrola. Vladimir is carefully basting the only thing on the spit: a head of cabbage. Dmitri is sitting by the window, staring at the MUSIC BOX that Anastasia dropped the night of the revolution.

S: INT. DINING ROOM
N: Anya wanders into the partially destroyed room and bends down to inspect half of a broken plate that's lying on the floor. The instant she touches it, she pulls her hand away as if SHOCKED. Recovering, she picks it up. CLOSE ON PLATE painted with decorative dancing Russian bears. Anya wanders out of the room and to the top of a HUGE STAIRCASE which leads down to the once grand BALLROOM. She stops at a large landing half way down the steps. Meetoo sees a large curtain hanging precariously on the side wall. Being a puppy he can't resist leaping and grabbing at it with his teeth. Anya notices and runs her hand along a the carved butterflies in the worn banister. ON ANYA who jumps, startled, as Meetoo pulls the curtain and it hits the floor.

DMITRI'S POV Anya is caught in a ray of moonlight, directly in front of the image of Anastasia in the frieze. The resemblance is striking. Dmitri is taken aback, but Vladimir is unaffected.
C: VLADIMIR

C: DMITRI

All look human at first, but then we see MINION ONE, has the body of a human and a head of a JACKAL, MINION TWO has the face of a woman and the claws of a TIGER, and MINION- the most horrible of all - has a huge bear-like body with the head of a VULTURE. All wear long capes with hoods.

N: Dmitri leans over and tugs Anya's hair lightly.
C: DMITRI
D: Wake up!
E: to Anya
N: Anya's eyes flash open and - totally on reflex - she belts Dmitri in the nose. Ditri reels back, lands on his butt - Vladimir observes ruefully.
C: VLADIMER
D: We have a lot of work to do...
S: EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SECONDS LATER
N: Vladimir, using his ample belly, bumps people out of the way as they head for the train. Vlad climbs on just as it starts up, followed by Dmitri. Dmitri turns back and reaches out his hand to help Anya up. But she freezes... just STANDS THERE, not running. ANYA'S POV
C: DMITRI
D: Come on!
N: Dmitri on the train, his band extended - just like Tatiana's was. Although Anya can't quite remember, something about this terrifies bar. She snaps out of it when Meetoo nips her ankle. Anya looks down and sees the puppy, picks his up and runs for the train.
C: DMITRI
D: Take my hand!
N: Anya puts Meetoo into his hands and Jumps on without touching his.
S: INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT
N: The compartment is JAMMED with travelers. Suitcases and packages balanced precariously. Dmitri sits down and carefully touches his painful noso.
C: DMITRI
D: Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
C: ANYA
D: Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
C: DMITRI
D: I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
N: OVER ANYA'S SHOULDER, out of the window. we see the THREE MINIONS on horseback charging down a snow covered hill toward the train.
C: ANYA
D: By pulling my hair?!
C: DMITRI
D: I was all out of dynamite!
N: Dmitri touches his nose again. Anya opens the window and grabs some snow. WE SEE the minions racing wildly to catch up with the train. As the scene continues, we see the minions, by one, getting close to the train and then disappear from view - only their riderless horses ride away.
C: ANYA
D: Put it on your nose. For heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!
E: hands Dmitri the snow

D: Men are such babies...
E: to herself
N: An ELDERLY WOMAN loaded with packages cones into the compartment. Anya immediately rises to help her.
C: ANYA
D: Here, let me
N: Dmitri and Vlad both pull her back down.
C: DMITRI
D: You're a princess...
C: VLADIMIR
D: Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
N: Anya gives them both a look and helps the woman.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
C: DMITRI
D: Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
N: Vlad holds Meotoo, who is enthralled and plays with Vladimir's drooping mustache, like a kitten with a string. The COMPARTMENT DOOR swings open and an OMINOUS LOOKING GUARD strides in!
C: GUARD
D: Papers!
N: Everyone rustles for their papers. Dmitri confidently pulls out their papers, done in beautiful BLACK ink. Then, he glances at the PERSON NEXT TO HIM and sees that his papers are done in a bright RED ink. Dmitri looks over at Vladimir - who has seen the mistake as well.
C: VLADIMIR
D: It's what I hate about this government - everything in red!
E: sheepishly
N: The guard hand papers back to a soulful looking man with a frozen beard.
C: GUARD
D: Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.
C: ZHIVAGO
D: Doctor Zhivago.
N: GUARD approaches Vlad and Dmitri.
C: VLADIMIR
D: What do we do now?
C: DMITRI
D: Pray he's color-blind...
N: Dmitri flashes the Guard a charming smile as he hands over his papers. Vladimir is nervously playing with his mustache until it stands out straight. Anya has no idea what's going on.
C: GUARD
D: wait here.
N: As the Guard heads out of the compartment, Vlad turns to Dmitri and they exchange an "oh, no" look.
S: INT. CORRIDOR, ANOTHER CAR
N: The MINIONS, hoods pulled low, push their way through the PASSENGERS in search of Anastasia.
S: INT. CORRIDOR

C: DMITRI
D: That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way.
E: pointing the opposite direction of the guards
N: Anya looks at him like he's crazy and walks away.
C: ANYA
D: I must have hit him harder than I thought...
E: to herself
N: Dmitri runs back in and grabs his SMALL BACKPACK. He pulls Vlad, carrying Meetoo, out off the compartment Anya has a load on them as they follow.
S: INT TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
N: The GUARDS burst in, ready for an arrest. In the background, the hooded Minions pass. The Guards, seeing empty seats, head back out.
S: INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ANOTHER CAR
N: Anya looks out the window as the country side flies by and smiles.
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: The Guards spot three figures at the far end of the car.
C: GUARD
D: That's them! Come on!
N: They run after who they think are the fugitives. The Guard grabs a minion and spins him around. It's MINION THREE, who comes face-to-beak with him and lets out a HORRENDOUS SCREECH, causing the other Minion to turn around. The Guards scream and reel backward, pushing and shoving each other to got out of the way The Minions proceed up the corridor, MINION TWO, spot Anya looking out the window. He grabs her. palling her viciously to the other Minions. She spins around - it isn't Anya - it's a SERIOUSLY UGLY WOMAN. The Minions now scream and reel back in horror.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

D: Why?
N: Vladimir picks Anya from up from tobehind and hoists her up to Dmitri. She hollers.
S: EXT. TRAIN ROOF

C: ANYA
D: Just what do you think you're doing?!
C: DMITRI
D: Trying... to... breathe...
N: Suddenly, Meetoo appears, as if he were flying and lots out a little "retu". Vladimir has tossed his up and Dmitri catches his, band his to Anya, and reaches down to Vladimir.
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: Though the window the Minions see Vladimir's legs as he's being lifted. INT. ROOF oF TRAIN Dmitri struggles to got Vlad to the roof but he's losing his grasp. Anya puts Meetoo down and reaches to help the dangling Vlad. Even Meetoo helps by pulling an Vladimir's scarf .
S: EXT. PLATFORM
N: Minion one grabs for Vladimir's legs, just as they disappear.
S: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN
N: Dmitri and Anya let out a sigh of relief as Vlad in safe, but it's short lived as they both SIMULTANEOUSLY lot out a yell. DMITRI & ANYA'S POV: a TUNNEL rapidly approaching. They hit the deck, Vlad on his back between Anya and Dmitri. Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as the tunnel gets closer - Vladimir's stomach is sticking up too high to clear the tunnel. They reach up together and push down on his big belly, causing his eyes to bulge ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIN The minions, now climbing up the side are plunged into total darkness. ON THE ROOF light hits as the train comes out of the tunnel. Vlad lets out a gasp as they release his belly. Just then a Minion hand reaches up over the edge. Dmitri assumes it's a Guard.
C: DMITRI
D: The guards! I'll explain later.
E: Anya gives his a lack
N: Anya and Vlad follow Dmitri toward the back of the train. ON THE MINIONS now on the roof, seeing their prey in short distance. ON ANYA AND THE OTHERS running, without looking back. jumping from car to car, passing Meetoo like a football. Vladiair makes a huge running leap into the air...
S: INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT
N: As all PASSENGERS react to Vladimir's bulk hitting and denting the coiling.
S: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN
N: The TRAIN WHISTLE erupts and Anya glances back to see her pursuers just as they are enveloped in the thick black smoke of the engine. Behind them, Anya can another tunnel. TUNNEL They drop down, this time Vlad in on his stomach. Anya and Dmitri realize his butt won't clear the tunnel. They push it down. ON THE MINIONS An the smoke disappears, the Minions' eyes go wide when they realize it's too late for them. The train roars the tunnel as the MINIONS SMASH &"'not the sift of the mountain in a COLORFUL BURST OF SMOKE from which they were created.

T: DISSOLVE TO
S: EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
N: Rasputin stares at the scene in his reliquary, watching his well laid plan *go up in smoke", and lots out a simmering growl. Anya is standing with her hands an her hips arguing with Dmitri and Vladiair.

D: Forged papers! Now, what?!
C: DMITRI
D: Now just get off the train.

C: DMITRI
D: What do you see?
N: ANYA'S POV her smudged face and boy's clothes. Dmitri's hands come into frame, wipe off her face with snow and them pull her hair off her face. Anya does, truly, look pretty.
C: DMITRI
D: See? The Princess is under there ...
E: CONT.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Ah! Let us begin!
N: A POSSIBLE VLADIMIR SONG Vladimir would begin to sing here, telling Anya that she has a lot to learn. The music would probably have a LIGHT, SOMEWHAT COMEDIC tone, and would be just a SHORT SECTION OF SINGING, which would then SEGUE TO UNDERSCORE for the scenes of instruction which follow. We see the three of them from behind, walking down a road - Meetoo trots behind them, happily.
C: VLADIMIR
D: You were born on the Adriatic sea at the summer palace, where the parties and the buffets were marvelous ....
E: CONT.
S: EXT. SLEIGH - DAY

C: ANYA
D: You must have.

C: ANYA
D: ...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
E: repeating can't remember, then exasperated
C: DMITRI
D: It's the best fork of all

C: ANYA
D: The dessert fork!
C: VLADIMIR
D: Ah, yes ... I have always loved that fork...
E: lost in a memory of rich desserts
N: Dmitri and Anya exchange a look and then laugh, adding ad libs of "we can tell" and "There's a fork you should have skipped". This is the first time Dmitri and Anya have laughed together - actually the first time he's ever seen her smile.
S: EXT. PORT - DAY
N: Dmitri, who is sneaking around, pulling women's clothes out of a suitcase that clearly isn't theirs! He takes out a large, but pretty dress, a beautiful veil - and a huge brassiere, which he quickly stuffs back in the suitcase - somewhat frightened. He takes the dress and veil puts it in his backpack and joins Vladimir and Anya as they admire the ship.
C: ANYA
D: What a beautiful ship!
C: DMITRI
D: It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.

C: ANYA
D: Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
N: Dmitri and Vladimir exchange a quizzical look. No one told her that... Meetoo spots TWO UGLY PUG DOGS and a distinguished ELDERLY DOWAGER. He runs happily to play with them. She pulls her DOGS away from Meetoo.
C: ELDERLY DOWAGER
D: No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been!
N: They give him a disgusted look and walk away. Meetoo looks a little hurt.
S: INT. HALLWAY OF THE SHIP - NIGHT
N: Dmitri and Vladimir are standing by a closed door. Anya is on the other side. ANYA (0. C.) No! I look ridiculous!
C: VLADIMIR
D: Come out! I can do alterations.
C: ANYA
D: You'll laugh.
E: O.C.
C: VLADIMIR
D: I shant!
C: ANYA
D: Not you. Him.
E: O.C.
C: DMITRI
D: I won't laugh - I swear...
N: The door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress Dmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her. She is still wearing her hair up and despite the size which actually gives her a "Kate Moss" waifish look with her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings out her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.
C: ANYA
D: You said you wouldn't laugh!
C: DMITRI
D: It's not you - it's the dress!
N: Anya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her.
S: INT. CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION
N: When Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.
C: ANYA
D: I'm never going to be..
E: to herself
N: Just then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress, pulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees in the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely woman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself.
C: ANYA
D: Well! Maybe I am...
E: CONT.
S: EXT. CABIN DOOR - NIGHT
N: Vladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens and Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist of the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri and Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with confidence and throws them a look over her shoulder. "REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE) The tone of the song would now change - - the older, wiser person watching as two younger people are unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be light, as are the visuals here, but there would be an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary embrace. MONTAGE: (MOS) ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a smile. IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya - she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her covers and she SLUGS him. UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo grabs them in his mouth and runs. ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement. Anya turns to them. ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great vindication. BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks him with her head accidently. THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither of them even try to readjust. END MONTAGE STILL IN THE SCENE Vladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he knows he interrupted something) as he leads her away from Dmitri.
C: VLADIMIR
D: You are a natural! I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class orphanage ...
S: EXT. SEA - NIGHT
N: As a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl and the waves become more violent. REVERSE ANGLE just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see Rasputin's face.
S: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
N: The storm is pitching the boat wildly. Vladimir is sleeping, snoring loudly. Meetoo, sound asleep, is sliding from side of the cabin to the other. Anya is looking out the small port hole at the violent sea when Dmitri, carrying his back pack, sits on the bed next to her.
C: DMITRI
D: I wanted to show you something.
N: Dmitri takes out the music box and hands it to Anya. She is immediately taken by it, something about it ...
C: ANYA
D: It's so beautiful ... and sad.
C: DMITRI
D: Sad?
C: ANYA
D: Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
C: DMITRI
D: Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
C: ANYA
D: I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
C: DMITRI
D: Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
C: ANYA
D: I'm sorry.
C: DMITRI
D: Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
E: false bravado
N: Dmitri goes back over to his bed. Anya sees through him and knows how much it all did matter to him.
S: EXT. SEA CLIFF - NIGHT
N: The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing.
C: RASPUTIN
D: She's out there ...
E: low, slow
N: The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm.
C: BARTOK
D: I'm getting a chest cold..
C: RASPUTIN
D: Bartok... a question.
C: BARTOK
D: I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
C: RASPUTIN
D: What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
N: Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon. Bartok follows.
C: BARTOK
D: My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way...
N: Rasputin steps in
S: INT. WAGON - NIGHT
N: As Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the reliquary's cabinet.
C: BARTOK
D: ... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ... Ewwww, what a mess ...
E: shivers
C: RASPUTTN
D: Show her to me ...
E: to reliquary
C: BARTOK
D: And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either.
N: IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water.
S: EXT. SEA CLIFF - NIGHT
N: Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water. Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.
S: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
N: which is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who seems quite content. From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither. They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya. CLOSE ON: Anya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter her head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S DREAM. . .
S: EXT. FOREST - DAY
N: Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day. She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL. Anya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees. (All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT resemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE BEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back away as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape. It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree She climbs the tree and escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away. Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold on to it tightly. But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her! Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake. She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM. A BURST OF SUNLIGHT as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the beautiful sunny wheat field.
S: INT. CABIN
N: Reality. Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her sleep and sits up in bed. TINY WISPS of smoke still swirl around her head. As she gets out of bed, she unintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him. Meetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door and walks out. Meetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending him sliding across the cabin floor.
S: EXT. DECK - NIGHT
N: Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently in the storm, as she smiles. IN HER DREAM Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of a BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water; laughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a low flowering wall to look closer. PULL BACK REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean... smiling.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the reliquary.
S: INT. CABIN
N: Meetoo finally rights himself from his slide across the floor and begins to bark into Dmitri's ear.
S: EXT. DECK
N: Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water. IN HER DREAM Anya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from the frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who they are to her.
S: INT. CABIN
N: Meetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand. Dmitri leaps up with an "owwww!" and looks over at the excited Meetoo.
C: DMITRI
D: If you have to go - wake her..
N: Dmitri looks over to Anya's bed - she isn't sits up and throws his legs over the side
S: EXT. DECK
N: Anya is standing right on the edge of death... IN HER DREAM She isn't there. He of his bed. the FAMILY is waving to her. NICHOLAS waves for her to jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and moves to jump in...
S: EXT. DECK
N: Anya gets ready to jump into the violent and icy black waves. She takes one step out when... DMITRI GRABS HER SHOULDERS. Anya JOLTS awake from her dream. Confused at first, then terrified to see what almost happened to her. isn't lifts her to the other side of the railing and looks at her.
C: DMITRI
D: What were you doing?!
N: Anya puts her hands to her mouth in shock, shaking and almost crying with fear, she throws her arms around Dmitri and holds him tightly. Dmitri is surprised at first, but tightens his arms around her.
C: DMITRI
D: It's okay now - I've got you. You're safe...
E: CONT.
N: They stand steady on the deck in a tight embrace, their feelings for each other are stronger than the storm.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE SAME, as seen through the reliquary Rasputin watches ... seething quietly, as Bartok peeks meekly over his shoulder.
C: BARTOK
D: Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
C: RASPUTIN
D: She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
E: controlling
N: Rasputin studies Dmitri in the reliquary - Dmitri and Anya still in a warm embrace.
C: BARTOK
D: Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ...
N: But Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the reliquary and speaks directly to it.
C: RASPUTIN
D: You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close...
N: The reliquary, as if in answer, seem to be chuckling. Rasputin smiles and joins in with it.
C: RASPUTIN
D: Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
E: CONT.
C: BARTOK
D: Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
N: Rasputin returns the reliquary to its cabinet.
C: RASPUTIN
D: We are going to Paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man. He annoys me.
S: EXT. BOAT DOCK (LA HAVRE) - DAY
N: As Anya walks down the plank her dress gets caught on a nail. Dmitri is walking toward her as she yanks her dress free and accidentally punches him in the stomach. Dmitri takes it like a man.
C: ANYA
D: Oh! I'm sorry...
C: DMITRI
D: It's okay. Didn't hurt..
N: Vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank with Meetoo - they exchange an "oh boy" look, both noticing that clearly something is different between Anya and Dmitri. Anya catches something out of the corner of eye and turns quickly. CLOSE ON a sign: "Paris 30 kilometers" Anya walks away from Dmitri and over to the sign and looks at it longingly.
C: ANYA
D: I'm almost there... I'm finally going to know...
E: to herself
N: AT THE OTHER END OF THE DOCK Vladimir stares into his purse, depressed.
C: DMITRI
D: How is our current financial status?
C: VLADIMIR
D: If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
N: As he says this the ELDERLY DOWAGER from the ship passes by with her TWO OBNOXIOUS PUG DOGS. Meetoo growls as Vlad and Dmitri get an idea.
C: VLADIMIR
D: The "Odessa Dunk"?
E: CONT.
C: DMITRI
D: It worked in Odessa...
N: Vladimir picks up Meetoo and whispers instructions. Meetoo likes the plan. NEW ANGLE as Meetoo races past the PUGS. They ignore him, so he stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry", which piques them a little. Meetoo then bends over and waves his furry little butt at them. Now the PUGS are offended and TAKE OFF after him, yapping all the way. Meetoo turns and scrambles with the Pugs in hot pursuit. As they get closer, Meetoo SUDDENLY STOPS and the Pugs go FLYING OFF they edge of the dock and into the water below. Meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'Boy, are you guys morons look as the ELDERLY DOWAGER runs up screaming.
C: ELDERLY DOWAGER
D: Help! My little dogs! Chevalier! Maurice! Hold on, darlings!
N: Dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.
C: DMITRI
D: I'll save them, Madame
N: Dmitri dives into the water as Vlad rushes up behind the Elderly Dowager. Anya watches from a distance as Dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked (and pissed) Pugs.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Such bravery! Why, that man should be rewarded! Amply rewarded!
N: MINUTES LATER Dmitri hands Vlad a pile of FRANCS as Anya approaches.
C: ANYA
D: That was really very kind of you.
N: She gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with Meetoo, who turns back and gives Dmitri a look. A little guilty, Dmitri turns to Vlad.
C: VLADIMIR
D: I won't say a word...
S: EXT. GRAND OPEN CAR - DAY
N: Traveling is style! Vladimir is driving - badly - with Meetoo in the front seat. Meetoo covers his eyes. Dmitri and Anya are in the open back seat, enjoying the beautiful French countryside. Dmitri looks over at Anya.
C: DMITRI
D: Nervous?
C: ANYA
D: Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
C: DMITRI
D: You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
N: Anya smiles at Dmitri, knowing that all the confidence she has is because of him. She takes his hand but looks away.
S: EXT. TATIANA'S PARIS HOUSE - DAY
N: They pull up in front of the beautiful white house. Anya is nervous as Vladimir walks up to the front door ahead of Dmitri and Anya. Vladimir knocks. Sophie answers the door. She moves with grace and regal poise.
C: VLADIMIR
D: May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
C: SOPHIE
D: Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
N: Anya looks to Dmitri, a little confused by that last comment. Dmitri makes a little "she's slightly crazy" signal. They all leap to avoid her butt as she bustles into the house.
S: INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY
N: Sophie, flanked by her sisters, sits at a table. Anya, looking nervous but poised, sits across while Dmitri and Vladimir hover nervously at the far end of the room. Sophie's PAT CAT, TILLIE, attempts to cuddle up next to Meetoo, who wants nothing to do with her.
C: SOPHIE
D: I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear...
N: Sophie opens a huge book that SLAMS open. Vlad and Dmitri jump.
C: ANYA
D: Of course.
C: SOPHIE
D: Where were you born?
N: SCENE CONTINUES MOS TIME LAPSE MONTAGE Dmitri watches Anya answer questions gracefully and without hesitating. Anya smiles as her answers begin to surprise Sophie.
C: DMITRI
D: The real Anastasia couldn't have grown up to be lovelier.
E: V.0.
N: Sophie and the sisters look tired. Sophie has her last question.
C: SOPHIE
D: This is the hard one ... what rare treat was served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty? The last ball they ever had?
E: almost giggling
N: Dmitri and Vladimir exchange a nervous look. It's obvious they never briefed Anya on this one. Anya thinks a moment, then looks up, smiling, as she remembers ...
C: ANYA
D: Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. Oranges and pineapples from the far east. I remember ... I remember I threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...
N: Dmitri is shocked. He know this is Anastasia Romonov and he can't believe it.
C: SOPHIE
D: Yes ... yes, it was fresh fruit. Well, maybe not "fresh" Estelle got one rather brown banana but ...
E: shocked
N: CLOSE ON Dmitri, as he stares at Anya as Sophie prattles on. MINUTES LATER Anya sits near the window, stroking Tillie ... much to the consternation of a jealous Meetoo., She looks out the window and sees Dmitri, deep in thought, wandering in the garden. OUT OF HER EARSHOT at the other end of the room, Vladimir speaks to Sophie.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
C: SOPHIE
D: Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
C: SOPHIE
D: Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Perhaps you could convince her?
C: SOPHIE
D: Oh, heavens, no... but ... She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
E: Vlad-leans closer as Sophie shares a naughty secret
N: She rises heading towards Anya. Her butt knocks over a vase, which Vladimir deftly catches.
C: SOPHIE
D: Come my dear, we've much to talk about.
S: EXT. GARDEN
N: Vladimir has finished giving Dmitri the details. Both are ecstatic.
C: VLADIMIR
D: We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
C: DMITRI
D: But it's not the money, Vlad.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Are you feeling all right?
E: shocked
C: ANYA
D: But you never doubted who I was, did you, Dmitri? Not for a second ...
E: CONT. deeply grateful
N: Anya gratefully kisses Dmitri an the cheek and runs into the house. Vladimir, who's been watching, has a warning.
C: VLADIMIR
D: Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
C: DMITRI
D: What do you mean?
C: VLADIMIR
D: Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
N: Dmitri understands this and is devastated. Vladimir pats him on the back as he walks into the house. MUSIC BEGINS: BRIGHT, EXCITING, PARIS IN THE TWENTIES Anya and Dmitri, followed by Vlad and Sophie are walking down the Champs Elysees. Meetoo trots along after them, happily. They walk by AN ACCORDION PLAYER and a LADY FLOWER SELLER, who watch them and whisper to each other.
C: ACCORDION PLAYER
D: Lovers!
C: FLOWER SELLER
D: Ooh la la!
N: "PARIS HOLDS THE KEY TO YOUR HEART" (PRODUCTION NUMBER) In UPTEMPO "PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad, to Paris! The foursome explores the city and Anya has the happiest day of her young life. On the streets they encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud, Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties.. For those in the audience who don't recognize them, they'll simply be unidentified fascinating "types" who SING. As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's
T: wistfulness cuts against joy.
