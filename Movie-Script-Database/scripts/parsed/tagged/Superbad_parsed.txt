N: OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC, which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence. Instead we get:
S: INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING
N: Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver, cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out his cell and dials.
C: SETH
D: Yo.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
C: EVAN
D: What's up?
C: SETH
D: I was doing research last night, for next year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang Bus.
C: EVAN
D: Which one's Bang Bus?
C: SETH
D: The one where they bang the chicks on the bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works. It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging them myself.
C: EVAN
D: That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking it. And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill.
C: SETH
D: It shows up under a different name. I hope. Bang Bus.
E: beat MORE
C: SETH
D: That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.
E: CONT'D
C: EVAN
D: Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.
N: Seth pulls up in front of a house.
C: SETH
D: I could tell my parents I'm doing a project on Rome and I have to research orgies.
S: EXT. EVAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking towards Seth's car.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on blow jobs.
E: still into phone
N: They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.
C: EVAN'S MOM
D: Thanks for taking him, Seth.
N: Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.
C: SETH
D: Don't touch that!
C: EVAN'S MOM
D: You two are so funny. I can't imagine what you'll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn't get into State.
C: SETH
D: Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good places. I think we'll be fine.
C: EVAN'S MOM
D: Are you going to miss each other?
C: EVAN
D: Miss each other? No!
C: SETH
D: That's disgusting.
C: MOM
D: Bye, boys.
N: Seth and Evan drive off.
C: SETH
D: I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
C: EVAN
D: Fuck you, man.
S: EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER
N: They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth turns into the STAFF parking lot.
S: INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
C: EVAN
D: You're being an idiot, man. You really shouldn't park there.
C: SETH
D: Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate. They should be suckin' my balls. It's the least they can do for stealing three years of my life.
N: They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into Seth.
C: EVAN
D: What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
C: SETH
D: Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in capture the flag last week.
C: EVAN
D: Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate that guy.
N: They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.
C: EVAN
D: Look at those nipples.
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: They're like baby toes.
C: EVAN
D: It's not fair. I have to hide every erection I get.
C: SETH
D: Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away.
C: EVAN
D: Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.
C: SETH
D: You know it's been, like, a year and a half since I've seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it last month, and it was sick.
C: EVAN
D: Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
C: SETH
D: Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
C: EVAN
D: How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs!
C: SETH
D: And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin' career, and it happened way, way, way too early.
C: EVAN
D: You're like Orson Welles.
C: SETH
D: Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
C: EVAN
D: You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus.
C: SETH
D: But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
C: EVAN
D: I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.
C: SETH
D: Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?
C: EVAN
D: Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
C: SETH
D: Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker.
C: EVAN
D: Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!
N: Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
C: SETH
D: What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?
C: EVAN
D: I don't constantly insult her.
C: SETH
D: I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.
S: EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the rough-looking smokers, calls out.
C: TERRY
D: Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big grad party?
N: Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.
C: SETH
D: No.
C: TERRY
D: Yeah.
N: Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
C: TERRY
D: And you're not coming. Tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.
E: CONT'D
N: Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head back to school.
C: EVAN
D: Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
C: SETH
D: I bitched out? You bitched out! You were across the street before I even realized what was going on. That guy's such a douche bag.
E: beat
S: EXT. CLARK SECONDARY OVAL RUNNING TRACK - DAY
N: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys start running. We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the frame. He stops. CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER: Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.
C: SETH
D: This...is...bullshit.
E: panting
N: A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by.
C: KID
D: Poo-say.
E: as he passes Seth
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts. She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed. The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a pen.
C: HELEN
D: Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
C: EVAN
D: Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep it. Then you'll just have it, and you won't have to borrow another pen.
C: HELEN
D: Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did you hear about Terry's grad party? It's going to be so insane.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, it's a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I got my...
E: MORE
C: EVAN
D: there's so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night...so, you know...
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at any parties or anything.
C: EVAN
D: Because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
C: HELEN
D: Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's party on Saturday?
E: playful
C: EVAN
D: Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go, because, well, I did other stuff. Saturday... Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!
E: nervous, he desperately thinks
N: (The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage of quick flashbacks.)
C: EVAN
D: First my parents went out to a double feature, so a bunch of people came over...
E: CONT'D V.O
S: INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Seth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old.
C: EVAN
D: ...and we had a couple drinks in my basement...
N: An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer.
C: EVAN
D: ...and Seth's parents were having this cocktail party, and we went over there to, like, mingle...
E: CONT'D V.O
S: INT SETH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys are drunk as hell.
C: EVAN
D: ...and there were actually some really interesting and, like, entertaining people there...
N: The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several adults look at them like they are morons.
C: EVAN
D: ...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live music.
E: CONT'D V.O.
S: INT. SETH'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh.
C: EVAN
D: ...then we went to a club downtown...
S: EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
N: The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.
C: EVAN
D: ...and then we pretty much called it a night and went home...
S: INT. TBD HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Evan pukes all over Seth. Evan and Fogell laugh hysterically as Seth yells at them.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - DAY
N: We return to Evan talking to Helen in the halls.
C: EVAN
D: ...you would've loved it.
C: HELEN
D: That sounds so fun. I would love to go do something like that.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah...well, you know, me and Seth are always cooking up...uh...fun little...events.
N: Helen is disappointed in his response.
C: HELEN
D: So, are you guys going to the same school next year?
C: EVAN
D: Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got into different ones.
C: HELEN
D: What are you going to do without him?
C: EVAN
D: Same shit I've always been doing. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. I'm not.
S: INT. FOODS AND NUTRITION ROOM - NEXT PERIOD
N: Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below. Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.
C: SETH
D: Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I thought I'd be cooking with a partner. It's not fair. She's never here. I don't get twice the marks for doing all the work.
C: MRS. GREIR
D: I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
C: SETH
D: Look at Evan.
N: Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They both laugh hard.
C: SETH
D: While I'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food because I can't even properly mix ingredients by myself, I gotta look over at that.
E: CONT'D
N: The Japanese boy ties Evan's apron. Evan then turns around and ties the boy's apron. They both look happy.
C: SETH
D: I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like a single mother.
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. GREIR
D: Well, save it for next week. Today Jules' partner isn't here either. Pair up with her. Station four.
C: SETH
D: Jules?
N: The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four, nervous as hell. ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking. She stands alone at station four, laying out utensils. Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops, unsure of what to say.
C: JULES
D: Hey Seth, your partner didn't come again?
C: SETH
D: That's kind of a personal question.
C: JULES
D: What?
C: SETH
D: Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
E: nervous
C: JULES
D: Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd be forced to work with me. There's my attempt at humour.
C: SETH
D: Well, I would call that a success. Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that some kind of new cheese or something?
E: reading recipe sheet
C: JULES
D: All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.
C: SETH
D: Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.
C: JULES
D: Thank you! Yes! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's moldy, then they tell you to eat it anyway.
C: SETH
D: Well whoever "they" are, they can eat my dick.
S: INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM - LATER
N: Jules watches as Seth awkwardly removes the tiramisu from the oven and places it on the table.
C: JULES
D: What are you doing tonight?
C: SETH
D: I don't know, probably nothing. Why?
C: JULES
D: My parents are out of town and I'm thinking of having a party. I don't know how big it'll be, but you should come anyways.
C: SETH
D: Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love parties.
C: JULES
D: Really? I don't usually see you at them.
C: SETH
D: Oh, uh. It's more of, like, a love-hate thing. Right now I love them, though. Uh...how do I do this?
C: JULES
D: I'll write down my address and number.
N: ANGLE ON: Evan. Evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray. Behind him, at the table, is the small Japanese boy eating the tiramisu.
C: EVAN
D: That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?
N: Seth walks up to Evan.
C: SETH
D: Dude! She's havin' a fuckin' party.
E: whispering
N: ANGLE ON: Fogell entering the room
C: SETH
D: Don't tell Fogell about the party.
E: CONT'D whispering
C: FOGELL
D: Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a black g- string and you could see it right through the pants.
S: INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) - EARLIER
N: We see Fogell, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky; you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants. She turns and notices Fogell. He gives an awkward look.
C: FOGELL
D: It's nine thirty.
C: NICOLA
D: What?
S: INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (PRESENT) - CONTINUOUS
N: Back to Fogell, Seth and Evan.
C: FOGELL
D: I told her what time it was. It was awesome. She's got the nicest ass.
C: SETH
D: Like you'd know what to do with it.
C: FOGELL
D: Ha ha. I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State.
C: SETH
D: Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college where the girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me.
E: pissed
C: FOGELL
D: What are you guys doing tonight?
C: SETH
D: Nothing. Sorry. You'll just have to fingerbang yourself.
C: EVAN
D: What you doing?
E: to Fogell
C: FOGELL
D: Well, Seth always said I was too much of a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification card.
C: SETH
D: Dude! That's perfect, `cause, Evan, didn't you just say that you heard about a party?
C: FOGELL
D: Why didn't you tell me?
E: to Evan
C: SETH
D: Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.
C: FOGELL
D: Sounds cool. Cool.
C: MRS. GREIR
D: If you're not in this class, leave this class!
E: O.S.
C: EVAN
D: Well done, man. We'll see you after class.
N: Fogell leaves.
C: SETH
D: Did you tell that nimrod you're not going to room with him?
C: EVAN
D: Uh...no, not yet.
C: SETH
D: You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang repellent.
N: Seth sees Jules coming.
C: JULES
D: Seth, dishes time. What's the hold up?
C: SETH
D: We're getting a fake ID.
C: JULES
D: Well, you two have four more years to cuddle, so let's get to work.
C: EVAN
D: Actually, we're going to different schools.
C: JULES
D: Really? You're cutting the cord? What's going to happen?
C: SETH
D: Nothing! Jesus.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen? That's what I don't get.
C: SETH
D: We're not, like, dependent on each other.
C: EVAN
D: We met when we were 8, we were fine before then. It's not like we do everything together.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Seth and Evan are eating together.
C: EVAN
D: So it looks like we get a little graduation party after all.
C: SETH
D: I would do terrible things to get with Jules tonight. Terrible things.
C: EVAN
D: No shit. I'd give my left foot to start dating Helen. She's killin' me.
C: SETH
D: Ah, Helen's a bitch.
N: Evan slams his fist on the table.
C: EVAN
D: I'm fuckin' sick of this shit, man! Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there even an actual reason? Because seriously, I'm beginning you think you like her.
C: SETH
D: Hell no! I hate her.
C: EVAN
D: Why?
C: SETH
D: I was never going to tell you this story, because I knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with Helen, but over the last few weeks I've been having a hard time thinking of a reason not to. So, here it is. Helen and I went to elementary school together, right? Well, in the third grade, I had...like...an odd problem. For some reason, I don't know why, I used to have this thing...where I would...like, kinda...sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks.
E: beat
C: EVAN
D: What?
S: INT/EXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS
N: A MONTAGE of FLASHBACKS of YOUNG SETH (Age 10) drawing pictures of dicks in various places. A PARK, AT HOME, IN A SANDBOX, and finally, in a SCHOOL CLASSROOM.
C: SETH
D: I'd just sit there for hours on end drawing dicks. I don't know what it was. I couldn't touch the pen to paper without it drawing a penis.
E: V.O.
C: EVAN
D: That's fucked.
E: V.O.
C: SETH
D: No shit that's fucked up. Here I am this little kid who can't stop drawing dicks to save his life.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA -PRESENT
C: EVAN
D: What does that have to do with Helen?
C: SETH
D: Just listen.
S: INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM -FLASHBACK
N: Young Seth is still sitting at his desk drawing penises.
C: SETH
D: I was very secretive about this dick thing I had going, after all, even I thought I was a loon, lord knows what other people would have thought. So I would take all my dick drawings and stick them in this Muppet lunch-box I had.
E: V.O.
N: We see Young Seth sticking a picture of a penis in a lunch- box filled with pieces of paper.
S: INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Young Seth is drawing, however it is a different day.
C: SETH
D: So one day I was finishing up a picture of a real big and veiny bastard, when all of a sudden...
E: V.O.
N: Young Seth drops the picture of the dick off his desk. It floats down and hits the feet of a cute little girl, YOUNG HELEN.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - PRESENT
C: EVAN
D: You hit Helen's foot with your dick?
S: INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

N: A FLASHBACK of Young Seth sitting in the principle's office. The Muppet lunch-box is open and the penis drawings are completely covering his desk.
C: SETH
D: It turns out the principle was some crazy religious guy and he thought I was possessed by some dick devil or something.
E: V.O.
N: The principal puts his hand on Seth's head and begins praying for his soul.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - PRESENT
C: SETH
D: So, he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions. My parents wouldn't even let me eat dick-shaped foods for, like, months! No carrots, no Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick?
C: EVAN
D: Wow. That's really messed up.
E: half amazed, half amused
C: SETH
D: I can't even stand to look at her punk face. I'm going to go take a piss. Peace.
E: beat
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY BATHROOM - LATER
N: Seth finishes his piss. He goes over to the sink, looks at it for a moment, then walks out of the bathroom.
S: INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Just as Seth turns the corner he sees Jules, Nicola, and SHIRLEY standing by their lockers. Jules spots Seth.
C: JULES
D: Seth. There you are.
N: Jules turns and says goodbye to Nicola, who walks away. Jules and Shirley turn to meet Seth.
C: SETH
D: Hey. Here I am.
C: JULES
D: So you're coming to my party, right? It's fully on.
C: SETH
D: Yeah. Why? Should I not?
C: JULES
D: No, no, no. I really want you to come. But...uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that right?
C: SETH
D: Very right. Right. I'm getting that.
C: SHIRLEY
D: Can you get us drinks?
C: SETH
D: Ummm... I don't know. I... think...maybe.
C: JULES
D: Come on, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
E: half joking
C: SETH
D: Well, funny thing about my back. It's located on my cock.
N: Shirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. Seth laughs too hard.
C: SETH
D: Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you guys want?
E: CONT'D
C: JULES
D: Well, this is actually, like, a big favor, but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party.
C: SETH
D: Wow. I would never even think of doing something that nice.
N: Jules hands Seth a hundred dollars.
C: JULES
D: Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I really appreciate this.
N: Seth can't believe what he's hearing. He can barely contain his smile.
C: SETH
D: Should I just get, like, a shitload of different shit?
C: JULES
D: Whatever shit you think people would like, I don't really know.
C: SHIRLEY
D: I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.
C: JULES
D: Okay. I'll see you tonight.
C: SETH
D: Yeah! I'll see you!
N: The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly runs down the hall.
S: EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer.
C: GYM TEACHER
D: Evan, get into the game.
N: Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him.
C: SETH
D: Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked, and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick!
E: out of breath, worked up
C: EVAN
D: Did you ever think maybe she's just using you to get her alcohol?
C: SETH
D: Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO THIS!
S: INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (FLASHBACK)
N: The same scene as before with Seth and Jules in class.
C: JULES
D: Yeah! My older brother always eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy.
S: EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - PRESENT
C: SETH
D: She has an older brother! She could have asked him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me. She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the day that fucking has become possible.
C: EVAN
D: Are you stupid? You're not going to be able to sleep with her tonight.
C: SETH
D: She's going to be at the party, she's gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then, I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by the time college rolls around, I'm the fuckin' fucking master, man!
C: EVAN
D: Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That's good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet?
C: SETH
D: Once I've gotten with her, I write her love letters, flowers, I'll do anything - I'll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the universe - what chick wouldn't go out with a guy like that?
N: The soccer ball rolls towards them. They both watch as it rolls by.
C: CLASSMATE
D: What the hell, Evan?
N: Evan shrugs back.
C: CLASSMATE
D: Fuck you, man.
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: Fuck off, Greg. Why don't you piss your pants again?
C: CLASSMATE
D: That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!
N: He runs off.
C: SETH
D: Wanna hear the best part?
E: to Evan
C: EVAN
D: Oh, I haven't?
E: sarcastic
C: SETH
D: Helen!
N: Evan looks upset, assuming that Seth is about to trash-talk Helen, as usual.
C: SETH
D: You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are both drunk, get with her! This is the last party we're ever going to go to as high school people! I've fully ignored my hatred for Helen in coming up with this, which is a big ass deal. We need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out, man!
E: CONT'D
N: Evan seems to be swayed.
C: EVAN
D: I should get Helen alcohol?
C: SETH
D: Of course! It'll be pimp, and then you know she'll be drunk.
C: EVAN
D: Have you talked to Fogell?
C: SETH
D: You talk to Helen, I'll find that retard Fogell.
S: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
N: Everyone is rushing to class. Evan hurries through the halls and finds Helen at her locker.
C: EVAN
D: Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about the party tonight?
C: HELEN
D: Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet. You're not coming, are you?
C: EVAN
D: No, no, I am. That's why I came looking for you. Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so I was thinking I could buy you yours, if you needed someone to.
C: HELEN
D: Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me such a hassle, cause I was going to beg my sister, but yeah, could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay you back tonight.
C: EVAN
D: You will absolutely not. It's my treat.
C: HELEN
D: Wow. Thanks, Evan.
N: Evan swings a friendly little punch at Helen's shoulder, but someone walks into him, causing him to nail her in directly in the tit!
C: HELEN
D: Hey! You punched my tit!
E: CONT'D
C: EVAN
D: I'm sorry! Shit, shit. I'm so sorry! I just wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know? I'm so sorry.
E: mortified
C: HELEN
D: Don't worry about it. So I'll see you at the party?
E: giggling
C: EVAN
D: Yeah. I'll see you then. I'm so sorry about that.
S: EXT. CLARK SECONDARY - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth is waiting angrily in front of the school. Evan comes out the front doors.
C: SETH
D: That douche bag isn't back yet, I've been standing here with my thumb up my ass.
C: EVAN
D: I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it. It was pimp.
C: SETH
D: Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn't I do that? Shit.
N: The bell rings.
S: INT. WOODSHOP CLASS - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth and Evan work side by side in the woodshop.
C: SETH
D: That's what we get for trusting a mental midget! He's fucking it all up! I bet he pussied out, just like I said he would!
E: yelling over the machines
S: EXT. CLARK SECONDARY - AFTER SCHOOL
N: Seth and Evan walk out the front door.
C: SETH
D: I mean, what are we going to tell the girls? "Sorry, we couldn't do what we promised because we're dickless incompetents!" We'll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck. How did he get in to State?! He's got shit for brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?
C: FOGELL
D: Hey guys!
E: O.S.
N: Seth and Evan turn around to see Fogell running after them.
C: EVAN
D: Where have you been?
C: SETH
D: Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack! You better fucking have it, where is it?
C: FOGELL
D: I got it. It's flawless! It's great, man, look.
N: Fogell reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID. Evan grabs it.
C: EVAN
D: Okay Mr..."McLovin"? What kind of a stupid name is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&B singer?
E: reading the card
C: FOGELL
D: Well, they let you pick any name you want when you get there.
C: SETH
D: So you picked McLovin?
C: FOGELL
D: It was between that or Muhammad.
C: SETH
D: Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why didn't you just pick a common name?
C: FOGELL
D: Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most commonly used name on earth.
C: EVAN
D: Have you ever actually met a guy named Muhammad?
C: FOGELL
D: Have you actually ever met a guy named McLovin?
C: SETH
D: No! That's why you picked a bad name.
C: EVAN
D: You probably have federal agents tracking you for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID!
C: SETH
D: Look at this shit man, you don't even have a first name. It just says "NAME: MCLOVIN"
C: EVAN
D: One name?
C: FOGELL
D: I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the chicks would dig it.
C: EVAN
D: Under what circumstances would you ever have to show a chick your ID?
C: FOGELL
D: She could ask. Or, I could just show it to her.
C: SETH
D: Holy shit! I don't believe this. This says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you just put 21?
C: FOGELL
D: I knew you would ask that. Look, every day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID's trying to act like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are?
C: SETH
D: Fool!
C: EVAN
D: Calm down! It's not terrible! This might work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin, the twenty five year-old organ donor". What's it gonna be?
N: Fogell takes a deep breath.
C: FOGELL
D: I am McLovin.
C: SETH
D: You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and this is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to Canada or something?
C: FOGELL
D: I still think it's going to work.
N: They walk into the staff parking lot. Seth stops.
C: SETH
D: What the fuck? Where's my car?
C: EVAN
D: I told you, man! What did I say? I told you that was a dumb idea.
C: FOGELL
D: Why would you park in the staff-
C: SETH
D: Shut up, Fogell.
C: FOGELL
D: `Cause you're not staff.
C: SETH
D: I am aware of that, Fagell.
N: Seth storms off. Evan follows him.
C: FOGELL
D: Will you still pick me up from work?
E: yelling
N: Evan and Seth round the corner, leaving Fogell behind.
C: SETH
D: Let's go to your house.
S: INT. EVAN'S BEDROOM - SOON AFTER
N: Seth puts on a shirt that is way too small and he's wearing pants that are too tight. Evan is playing the video game Grand Theft Auto.
C: SETH
D: Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal your parents' booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every bottle. Piece of cake. It's not exactly what Jules wanted, but it'll do, right?
C: EVAN
D: Come on! Just wear what you wore to school.
C: SETH
D: I told you I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in the same shit I wore at school. It's completely unbecoming.
C: EVAN
D: Why don't you just go to your house and get your own clothes? `Cause this is stupid.
C: SETH
D: You're stupid! I can't go home. Then my mom will know the car got towed and I'll be grounded tonight. I'll just stay here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
C: EVAN
D: Where the fuck is the dirt bike? Ah, screw it. I'm just gonna kill everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!
E: RE: video game beat
C: SETH
D: Don't you have bigger clothes?
C: EVAN
D: See what my dad's got.
S: INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - PARENTS ROOM - SOON AFTER
N: Seth is wearing Evan's Dad's clothes: a 70s style cowboy shirt, just barely pulling it off, as well as slacks.
C: SETH
D: Not bad, eh?
C: EVAN
D: It's, like, 7:30 and my Mom's still here.
C: SETH
D: Alright, here's what we'll do. I'll fuck your Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor.
C: EVAN
D: Fuck you, asshole. Let's just sneak down there and grab it.
S: INT. EVAN'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Evan and Seth, carrying an empty two liter bottle of Coke, cautiously descend the creaking staircase. Their eyes watch the TV room, where Evan's mom is on the phone. The boys enter the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet. Seth enthusiastically reaches for a bottle.
C: SETH
D: Alright, dude. Get ready to receive.
E: whispering
N: Evan begins unscrewing his bottle, when he notices a little black line marking where the liquor bottle is filled to. Then, he realizes that every bottle has it.
C: EVAN
D: I can't believe it. They marked them.
E: whispering
C: SETH
D: What do you mean they...oh, man! Your parents are fuckers. What do we do now?
E: whispering
C: EVAN
D: Shh!!! We...we...take some and fill it back up with water. Get ready, I'll get water.
E: whispering
N: Evan hurries off. Seth looks at the liquor cabinet, trying to choose the best booze. He grabs a massive bottle of gin. Evan reappears.
C: EVAN
D: Gin? That stuff is literally undrinkable.
E: CONT'D whispering
C: SETH
D: It's the biggest bottle, you douche. Just do it! She's right in the other room!
E: whispering
N: Evan reluctantly holds an empty Coke bottle as Seth shakily pours the gin in. Evan starts refilling the gin bottle with water, when suddenly they both hear his mom coming.
C: EVAN
D: Run!
E: whispering
C: SETH
D: But, the booze?
E: whispering
C: EVAN
D: Take it!
E: whispering
N: Seth runs off with the gin and Coke bottle. Evan quickly closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom enters. Through the window she see's that Seth is already on the front lawn and thinks nothing of it.
C: EVAN
D: Bye, Mom! Love you.
E: CONT'D
C: EVAN'S MOM
D: Love you, sweety.
N: Evan leaves.
S: EXT. EVAN'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN
N: Evan and Seth triumphantly walk away. Seth holds up the gin.
C: SETH
D: Look at this mother. Smell it's glory.
N: He opens it up and takes a whiff.
C: SETH
D: Mmm. It's good. Barely a scent.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes a crazy big swig.
C: SETH
D: See that? I always said I had the highest alcohol tolerance. I'm like Superman.
E: CONT'D
N: Seth taste another swig, but makes a strange face. Evan grabs the bottle and takes a swig.
C: EVAN
D: It's fucking water!
C: SETH
D: Water? Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch. We have to go back!
E: drinks again
C: EVAN
D: We can't go back! She totally knew, she'll bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell.
C: SETH
D: Well, fuck...fine. Text your brother he's a stupid piece of crap.
N: Evan pulls out his cell and chuckles as he types.
S: EXT. SHOPWELLS - DUSK
N: Evan and Seth walk off the bus. They see Fogell walking towards them. He's in his uniform holding a hanger with a shirt and a vest.
C: SETH
D: What the hell is that?
C: FOGELL
D: A vest.
C: SETH
D: You're gonna look like a Pinocchio.
C: EVAN
D: What? It's just a vest.
C: FOGELL
D: Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in vests?
C: SETH
D: You know, they got a ton of liquor right in there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of Jules' shit.
E: eyeing Shopwell's
C: FOGELL
D: No way! I work there. They know I'm not twenty-five.
C: SETH
D: Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth. You have one name on your ID. It's out of the equation!
E: MORE
C: SETH
D: And now I'm gonna have to take drastic measures. I'm gonna steal the booze.
E: CONT'D
C: FOGELL
D: What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, right!
E: mocking
C: SETH
D: That's right. And that way I give Jules back her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that's fucking pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he's got, like, really bad scoliosis!
C: EVAN
D: You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's not going to steal it.
C: FOGELL
D: Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll get the liquor later.
C: SETH
D: I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't step back down. Maybe you "State" boys don't understand that.
N: Seth walks to the store.
S: INT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers.
C: SETH
D: Hope piggy can run.
E: to himself
N: He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers.
S: INT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING
N: Seth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze in the conveyor belt.
C: CASHIER
D: How old are you?
C: SETH
D: Twenty two.
C: CASHIER
D: You certainly are. That'll be eighty dollars.
N: Seth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.
C: SETH
D: Thank you kindly.
C: CASHIER
D: You're welcome, Seth.
S: INT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his head. He eyeballs the old lady.
S: INT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - EVENING
N: The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth.
C: SETH
D: Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse. Would you like me to help you to your car?
C: OLD LADY
D: That would be lovely, young man. Would you like me to buy you alcohol?
C: SETH
D: That would be lovely!
S: EXT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - MOMENTS LATER
N: Seth, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady as she drives away.
C: SETH
D: Enjoy your remaining years!
C: OLD LADY
D: I will. Enjoy fucking Jules!
S: INT. SHOPWELL'S (FANTASY) - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth shakes his head. He looks down the aisle again, takes a breath and starts walking. He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads, "GOLDSCHLAGER."
C: SECURITY GAURD
D: Don't do it kid.
E: O.S.
N: We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.
C: SETH
D: I never had a choice.
N: He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY in the head.
C: OLD LADY
D: AAAHHHHH!!!
E: in agony
N: Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out. Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.
S: EXT. SHOPWELL'S - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan and Fogell are talking.
C: FOGELL
D: Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the TV from her basement and I've got, like, three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so like, we can have that in the room-
N: Evan sees Seth coming out of Shopwell's.
C: EVAN
D: Shh. Seth's coming.
C: FOGELL
D: You still didn't tell him we're rooming-
C: EVAN
D: No. Shut up.
C: FOGELL
D: So, where's all the stolen liquor?
E: to Seth
C: SETH
D: Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security was tight as shit. I was gonna do it though, don't think I wasn't. Let's go to the liquor store and try your stupid ID.
N: Seth heads towards the bus stop.
C: FOGELL
D: Wait! I'm gonna put my vest back in my locker!
S: INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER
N: MORE MIND-BLOWINGLY BADASS FUNK MUSIC OVER Seth, Evan and Fogell sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy, unpleasant looking strangers. Nothing happens whatsoever.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - EVENING
N: The bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get out.
C: EVAN
D: Well, here we are. Fogell, are you ready?
C: SETH
D: Here's the list.
C: FOGELL
D: A list? Why?
C: SETH
D: We're getting girls their booze so they'll get with us. I put a lot of thought into that list. It's the perfect party bar, so don't mess it up and get Sambuca again.
N: Fogell reads the list. A worried look sweeps across his face.
C: FOGELL
D: Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-ger-
C: EVAN
D: Goldschlager. That's for Helen, so do not forget it.
C: FOGELL
D: -Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov-
C: SETH
D: Oh yeah, and Mike's Hard Lemonade.
C: FOGELL
D: This is too much. I can't get away with this much!
C: EVAN
D: What's the difference?
N: Seth hands Fogell the money.
C: FOGELL
D: I don't know, man. I'm getting, like, really nervous.
N: Fogell starts breathing very hard and making an ODD NOISE while doing so.
C: EVAN
D: Are you okay?
C: SETH
D: What the hell are you doing?
C: FOGELL
D: I don't know if I want to do this.
C: SETH
D: What are you talking about? You just promised you would. What is this shit?
C: FOGELL
D: What if they turn me down?
C: SETH
D: Then we're in the same place that we're in right now!
C: FOGELL
D: It's fucking humiliating! Everyone in the store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf? I can't do that!
C: SETH
D: This whole thing is bigger than you, asshead! Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!
C: FOGELL
D: What if I don't feel like it anymore?
C: SETH
D: Then I will kill you! How's that? If you don't buy the alcohol, I will kill you!
C: FOGELL
D: Killing me won't get you any alcohol, jerkoff! I'm the one with the ID!
C: SETH
D: Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly face, put it over mine, and buy it my fucking self.
C: FOGELL
D: You don't have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that!
N: Seth stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Fogell. Evan stands between them and breaks it up.
C: EVAN
D: Seth, calm down! Fogell, stop being a baby and go buy the alcohol! You said you'd do it, so do it. It's why you bought the ID, so just go do it.
C: FOGELL
D: I'll try.
E: beat
N: Fogell walks into the store.
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: At first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths.
C: CLERK
D: Hi there.
N: Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the opposite direction.
C: SON
D: Fogell?
C: FOGELL
D: No.
E: weird voice, covering his face
C: SON
D: Yo, Fogell. `Sup man. What're you doing here?
C: FOGELL
D: Uh...nothing. Not Fogell... Shut up, Moscovitch. You don't know me.
E: weird voice whisper
C: MOSCOVITCH
D: Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck.
E: knowingly
N: He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible.
C: FOGELL
D: Fuck.
N: A CLERK approaches Fogell.
C: CLERK
D: Is there a problem, sir?
C: FOGELL
D: Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.
C: CLERK
D: Sir, did you do this? On the floor?
E: pointing to the beer on the floor
C: FOGELL
D: No. I think it happened before.
E: beat beat
N: Fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs, holding a can of beer.
C: CLERK
D: Are you sure?
C: FOGELL
D: I think I would know, thank you.
N: Fogell walks away.
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER
N: Fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.
C: CASHIER
D: Um, yes, may I please see some ID?
C: OLD-LOOKING GUY
D: No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in years.
C: CASHIER
D: Anyone who looks under thirty-five.
N: The guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth and Evan peek through one of the store's front windows.
C: SETH
D: It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never had a problem. It's fine. Right?
C: EVAN
D: Calm down. Did you remember a condom?
E: beat
C: SETH
D: You brought a condom?
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well. I brought one of those little things of spermicidal lube too.
N: He takes them out of his pocket.
C: SETH
D: You asshole! You laughed in my face when I said we'd be having sex tonight.
C: EVAN
D: It doesn't mean you shouldn't be prepared. You didn't even bring one?
C: SETH
D: No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan! I can't believe you did that without even consulting me about it!
C: EVAN
D: I don't really even understand what your plan is.
C: SETH
D: I'm gonna go down on her for, like, hours. She'll love that. She'll want to go out with that.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in bringing just one little condom.
C: SETH
D: And one little bottle of spermicidal lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know you brought that! These girls are 18, not dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.
C: EVAN
D: Fine. I won't bring the lube.
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him kind of funny.
C: FOGELL
D: Hello... Mindy.
E: reading name tag
N: She rings up a six pack of Budweiser.
C: FOGELL
D: Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years. I heard they recently decided to start adding more hops.
E: CONT'D
N: Fogell just nods kind of proud of himself. She stops ringing stuff up and looks at him.
C: CASHIER
D: Umm, okay sir, I'm gonna need to see some ID.
C: FOGELL
D: Identification?
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth and Evan are still leaning against the window.
C: EVAN
D: Do you think I could get Helen to do some kind of long distance thing?
N: Seth looks as if he sees something in the distance. He stands upright.
C: SETH
D: Holy Shit! It's Cary Hutchins!
C: EVAN
D: I haven't seen her since she switched schools.
C: SETH
D: She had the biggest tits in the universe.
N: Down the block there is a girl walking a dog.
C: EVAN
D: I heard she had breast-reduction surgery. Her tits must be crazy perfect now.
C: SETH
D: I gotta see these bastards. Let's check `em out.
N: Seth and Evan run off towards the girl.
C: SETH
D: Man, I'm gonna pretend to trip and grab `em. I hope they've healed.
E: CONT'D beat
T: CUT BACK TO:
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: The cashier is still examining the card. She hands it back to Fogell.
C: CASHIER
D: That comes to a total of $123.59
N: A huge smile forms on Fogell's face as he pulls out a wad of money and hands it to the cashier. She starts to gather his change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Fogell right in the side of the head!!! Fogell falls to the ground. The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a handful of money and runs! The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Fogell is on the ground, dazed and confused.
C: FOGELL
D: What the hell happened?!
N: Fogell sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the police.
C: CASHIER
D: I don't believe it...I don't believe it....
E: breathing hard
S: EXT. UP THE STREET FROM THE LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Seth and Evan walk down the street towards the liquor store.
C: EVAN
D: That was a waste.
C: SETH
D: But she fully looked way better before. I thought when they reduced them, they just kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them more supple.
C: EVAN
D: I can't even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller.
C: SETH
D: It's like me making my nuts saggier.
N: Evan sees something in the distance.
C: EVAN
D: Whoa. What's this?
C: SETH
D: What?
C: EVAN
D: Check it out! The cops!
N: They see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside the liquor store. Seth and Evan cautiously approach the liquor store and look inside. They see two POLICE talking with the Cashier, and Fogell is standing right beside them!
C: EVAN
D: Shit! They busted Fogell!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: The two police, OFFICER SLATER, 30 and experienced, and OFFICER MICHAELS, 25 and learning, are talking to the Cashier. Fogell stands beside them, nervous and afraid.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: So, did he punch anyone else?
E: to cashier
C: CASHIER
D: I can't do this, okay!?! I told you, I have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand that? A goddamn exam!
E: losing it completely
N: The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of the store. The officers look at each other.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Apparently, she has an exam.
N: They chuckle. Then they turn to Fogell.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: So then, son, you're the one that got punched?
E: turn to Fogell
N: Fogell looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then back at the cops. He nods.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: We'd like to ask you a couple questions.
N: The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Okay, first things first. What's your name?
E: CONT'D
N: Fogell looks like his heart is about to explode out of his chest.
C: FOGELL
D: My name, it's...it's.. Mc..mac..laddle...
E: tripping over his own words
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: MicMac what?
C: FOGELL
D: No, no I said, "McLovin".
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: McLovin?
C: FOGELL
D: McLovin.
N: The officers both write down some information.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Cool name. And your first name?
N: Fogell looks twice as scared.
C: FOGELL
D: Oh...that's uh...a good one...it's a...an interesting...uh...event...
N: Fogell trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily, making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store, we see Seth and Evan peeking through.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Shocked, Seth and Evan walk away from the window. Seth starts to pace in anger.
C: SETH
D: I don't believe this bullshit! I can't...this isn't happening! I didn't even know you could get arrested for this shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR!
C: EVAN
D: Oh my god. Are they gonna take him downtown?
C: SETH
D: Fuck Fogell! He got arrested! We're on our own.
E: MORE
C: SETH
D: We need a new way of getting liquor. AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How much money can you get?
E: CONT'D realizing
C: EVAN
D: What are you talking about? Money? What about Fogell?
C: SETH
D: That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money!
C: EVAN
D: We have to help him!
C: SETH
D: Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him out of jail? I don't even know where jail is! What we need is the alcohol, which is impossible because we don't have any fucking money!
N: Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot.
C: EVAN
D: Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think. We need to think.
C: SETH
D: Fuck thinking! We need to act!
N: Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks Seth down!!!
S: INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: The cops are still talking to Fogell. He looks completely flustered. He's lost his composure.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's no need to get irrational.
N: In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is lying, apologizing frantically.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: A lot of people have strange names these days.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: I once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace."
C: FOGELL
D: It's just... I changed my name. I was going to be a singer. R&B.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Fine. That's not illegal.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: And, how old are you McLovin?
N: Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again.
C: FOGELL
D: Old enough.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Old enough for what?
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Can I see your ID?
C: FOGELL
D: Um...okay...
N: Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads of sweat are running down Fogell's face. In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: You're an organ donor?
C: FOGELL
D: What?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: I didn't want to be one but my wife insisted.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Just like a woman. Even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out.
N: The officers start laughing. Fogell is shocked. They hand back the ID.
C: FOGELL
D: Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't really have any information. I didn't really see him. His fist hit here.
N: Fogell points at his giant black eye.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Are you in a hurry or something?
C: FOGELL
D: Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a bus.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Where were you going?
C: FOGELL
D: Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: We'll take you there, get your information on the way. Sit tight.
N: Fogell is completely dumbfounded.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan.
C: DRIVER
D: I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you at all. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I do? Are you okay?
N: The driver glances at the cop car.
C: DRIVER
D: I mean, please don't report me, we can figure this out, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: Why wouldn't I report you?
C: DRIVER
D: Because I'll do anything! Please! Anything! What can I do?
C: SETH
D: You have any money?
C: EVAN
D: What are you doing?
E: quietly to Seth
C: DRIVER
D: Fine. Just take it.
E: beat
N: The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money. Seth looks at it. It's seven dollars.
C: SETH
D: What is this? This isn't enough.
N: Seth stuffs the money in his pocket.
C: DRIVER
D: It's all I have.
C: SETH
D: Well, you just came from the liquor store, give us your liquor.
C: DRIVER
D: I didn't get any. They're not letting anyone in. They're arresting someone or something.
C: SETH
D: Well, they'll be arresting somebody else if you don't do something quick. Ow! My shoulder! It's killing me.
N: Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is.
C: DRIVER
D: No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol? I can get you alcohol. I'm on my way to this party right now. There's gonna be tons of liquor. I will definitely get you plenty.
C: SETH
D: You better.
C: EVAN
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here.
N: Seth goes over to Evan.
C: EVAN
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: What? Jules' money is gone, Fogell's out, we've got no other option. Let's go.
C: EVAN
D: I don't....I don't like this idea at all. I'm just not feeling it. That guy's fucking creepy. Just look at him.
N: They look at the Driver, who is staring at Evan with a dumb expression on his face.
C: DRIVER
D: You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance? Cause you totally look like his brother.
E: to Evan
C: SETH
D: He's an idiot. And he's our only hope. Come on, don't break your promise to Helen.
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The Driver's car pulls away with Seth and Evan sitting in the back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Fogell right behind them carrying the bags of liquor.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Man, that lady just wouldn't stop crying, huh? And you're the one that got punched. Did you hear her say she has an exam tomorrow? Boo-fuckin'-hoo. Am I right?
E: to Fogell
C: FOGELL
D: Heh. Good one.
E: afraid
C: OFFICER MICHEALS
D: Could we have taken her in? Just to scare the shit out of her?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Hah. Probably could have found a way. But a good general rule is only take people in you want to ride with. And whiny bitches don't make that cut.
N: The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car.
S: INT. DRIVER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth and Evan sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the front.
C: DRIVER
D: One of you bros could have sat up here with me.
N: There is an awkward silence, when suddenly Seth starts to wriggle in discomfort.
C: SETH
D: Aaah!
N: Seth fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it.
C: SETH
D: 875-6611? Holy shit...
E: CONT'D thinking
N: Seth answers the phone.

D: Seth! Where are you?
C: SETH
D: Jules! I just got in a cab and I'm going to the liquor store as we speak.
C: JULES
D: Awesome. I can't wait for you to get here.
N: A huge smile sweeps across Seth's face.
C: SETH
D: Really?
C: JULES
D: Yeah. It looks like it could actually be a great party. I think, like, tons of people might show up. I hope they don't trash my house.
C: SETH
D: Well, if they want to do that they're going to have to get through me.
C: JULES
D: So I guess I don't have to worry then. I'll see you soon.
N: Seth hangs up the phone, completely elated.
C: SETH
D: She called, man! That's insane! She's practically begging for it. She said, "I can't wait for you to get here."
C: DRIVER
D: That sounds like she fully wants it. Where's she gonna get it from, huh, my man?
N: Seth and Evan are very weirded out.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The Driver's car pulls up in front of a house. The three get out.
C: EVAN
D: Hey, are you sure that it's cool we're here?
C: DRIVER
D: Oh, definitely. I'm essentially best friends with this guy. A whole bunch of my buddies are coming. Come on!
N: The Driver runs into the house happily, Seth and Evan following closely behind.
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS
N: The boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the huge party. It's in full swing with all sorts of random- looking people. Nobody is under the age of 25.
C: EVAN
D: This is weird.
C: SETH
D: Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All we gotta do is find the booze and haul ass out of here.
N: As they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them looks.
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY - KITCHEN
N: They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer, coolers, wine, vodka, everything.
C: SETH
D: Holy shit! Let's grab one of these buckets and go.
C: MARK
D: What the fuck do you think you're doing?
E: O.S.
C: DRIVER
D: What, man? It's nothing.
E: O.S.
N: The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive brute, MARK.
C: MARK
D: You calling more of your stupid friends again? Ya prick.
C: DRIVER
D: Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.
C: MARK
D: Get the fuck out of my house.
C: DRIVER
D: Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a dick.
N: Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan.
S: EXT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS
N: The Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front lawn. Seth and Evan watch from the doorway of the house, a group of people in front of them.
C: DRIVER
D: Mark! Dude! This is bullshit! Just chi-
N: Mark steps on the Driver's hand.
C: DRIVER
D: Ahhhh! Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot. He stands up.
C: DRIVER
D: Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts! The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.
C: MARK
D: Francis, you and your idiot friends stay the away from me and mine or I'll flipping shiv your ass!
N: Mark and his buddies head back in, leading them towards Seth and Evan, who quickly duck back into the party.
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS
N: The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.
C: EVAN
D: Dude, let's slip out the back.
C: SETH
D: Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just hurry up and do this.
C: EVAN
D: You want to end up like that guy? Not me, I need my nuts.
C: SETH
D: We need this liquor!
C: EVAN
D: You need it! I don't need it. I'm going to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe she'll get with me; not after I get her stinking drunk.
C: SETH
D: Then why haven't you ever made a move, you pussy?
C: EVAN
D: Because I respect her! I'm not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her.
C: SETH
D: These aren't girls, they're women! They need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor, so where's the fucking beef?!
C: EVAN
D: We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill us. You want to get killed for liquor?
C: SETH
D: You're really gonna bail on me?!
C: EVAN
D: Jesus...
E: rolls eyes
N: Evan walks out the door.
C: SETH
D: Okay, okay...if that's how you're going to be, then I'll get the booze on my own. And you're not getting any. And neither is Helen!
N: Seth storms off.
S: INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Fogell sits in the backseat. The cops are in the front. There is silence for a few beats.
C: FOGELL
D: Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer those, uh, questions now if you want.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: We get the gist of it. You were buying some beer, some guys came in and robbed the place. I don't think we're gonna find `em this time.
N: The officers start to chuckle.
C: FOGELL
D: It was only one guy.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could never catch one guy.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: You see, McLovin, if it was two guys, we'd have twice the chance of catching one of them. But just one guy? I mean, how are we supposed to find one guy in this whole city?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people there are in this city? I have trouble finding people I know.
C: FOGELL
D: Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or something? Don't you have a computer?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone walks up to me on the street, and is like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that?
C: FOGELL
D: Who's Bob?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then how am I supposed to know where he is?
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: When you're new to the force, like I am-
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Only six months in. I got two and a half years under my belt.
E: proudly
C: OFFICER MICHAELS

N: The car radio goes off.

D: Good fucking call, sir.
N: They chuckle.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Hey, McLovin. We got a situation at Bailey's. We have to see to that, but we'll drop you off right after. Okay?

N: Seth quickly walks away from the fridge and goes down the hall.
S: INT HOUSE PARTY - DANCING ROOM
N: Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then locates a cooler full of it across the dance area. He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot, sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn't know how to react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the girl.
S: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan is walking down an alley, mad as hell, when, suddenly, he jumps up and starts squirming.

E: CONT'D
N: He presses talk.
C: HELEN

E: O.S. through the phone with horrible static
C: EVAN

S: EXT. BAILEY'S BAR AND GRILL - CONTINUOUS
N: The cops and Fogell get out of the car and walk towards the Bailey's. They stop before they enter.

N: Michaels blocks the door and the Homeless Guy rams into him, knocking him to the ground.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Good one, Michaels!
E: sarcastic
N: Slater runs at the Homeless Guy and chases him into the dining area. The Homeless Guy knocks over a table, which Slater trips over.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Fuck!
E: CONT'D
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Should I shoot him?!?
E: nervous
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: NO!!!

C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: McLovin! Nice!

D: I am buying you a beer, McLovin!
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY - DANCING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: An R&B slow jam plays as an exuberant Seth, a Mike's Hard Lemonade in one hand and the Woman's ass in the other as the dancing becomes increasingly sexual. As the song ends, the Woman moves on. Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard. He grabs it and puts it in his pocket. The bulge is apparent. Extremely pleased with himself,
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY - ADJACENT ROOM
N: Seth walks into the adjacent room. There are a bunch of GUYS chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he enters.
C: SETH
D: Hey, wut up?
N: The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him strangely. GUY 1 What is that? Is that red wine? Thinking he's busted, Seth quickly covers the bulge in his pocket.
C: SETH
D: Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're talking about.
N: GUY 1 That shit you spilled all over yourself, idiot.

D: McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless people on the head. You're practically a cop now.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: So I pull up in front of her house and she asks me to come inside for some coffee. Of course, I say yes.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Oh shit.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I start taking off my clothes, she fucking flips, starts screaming at me, and I'm like "Can't have coffee without cream." Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then, she slaps me, throws me out. I'm telling you McLovin, stay out of bars.
C: FOGELL
D: Hey, you don't need to tell me.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: So, yeah, you gotta look in different places. The gym, an art class, you know, shit like that.

E: incredibly excited
S: INT. HOUSE PARTY BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Seth is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it's not doing much. He stops for a moment to take a breather as he looks around the basement. He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf is completely filled with beer.
C: SETH
D: Jesus's tits!

S: INT. HOUSE PARTY VACANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES wander into the room. DUDE 1 They're going to kill that guy, man. That bitch's boyfriend is so pissed. DUDE 2 Yeah. And he's a beast. They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of them notices Evan standing in the corner. DUDE 3 Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid with the splotch on his crotch? Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and horrified.
C: EVAN
D: No. What splotch-
N: DUDE 2 I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was at that party with me. DUDE 4 Who's he? DUDE 2 He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the crazy raps, the one I told you about! They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the door.
C: EVAN
D: Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy, man. Sorry.
N: Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door. DUDE 3 No. No, that's you, man. You are fully Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed up you can't remember.
C: EVAN
D: Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't even listen to rap.
N: DUDE 3 It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've been telling these guys about you. Just give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap. They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid.

C: SETH
D: I did it man. Peace out-tro.
N: He's inches away from the front door, when suddenly- GUY 1 There! That's the guy! Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver, walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his leg, too.
C: SETH
D: Hey! You got one, too! We're blood brothers.

N: There is a crowd gathered around Seth and Mark. The Enormous Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark.
C: SETH
D: I swear to God it wasn't me!
N: Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the room. Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands.
C: MARK
D: And what the fuck is this?
C: SETH
D: It's nothing. It's detergent.
C: MARK
D: Yeah. And what are you doing with it?
C: SETH
D: I...uh, I got blood on my pants.
N: Mark sees the bottle of MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE in Seth's pocket and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a look of death.
C: SETH
D: I brought them from home.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES Seth and throws the beer bottle at his face!!! Seth holds up a detergent jug and deflects the beer bottle.

A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting! Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him into Evan. DUDE 3 Hold him!
C: EVAN
D: What?
N: DUDE 2 HOLD HIM!!! Evan reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes pound on him. ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA.
C: JACINDA
D: You motherfucker!
N: She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth. She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!
C: SETH
D: AHH!!!
C: JACINDA
D: You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated me!!!
C: SETH
D: You're the one who used my leg as a tampon!
N: She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles. Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party.
S: EXT HOUSE PARTY
N: As Seth and Evan run up the block together, Jacinda talks into her cell phone.
C: JACINDA
D: Yeah, Fifth and Paysview, please hurry!

N: The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: You've been saying some bold words, my friend. Better not mess up.
C: FOGELL
D: You can do it, officer.
N: BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign.

D: What?
C: SETH
D: You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.
C: EVAN
D: No I didn't!
C: SETH
D: Of course you did! We were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it! That's the definition of bailing!
C: EVAN
D: If you said we should burn our dicks off and I didn't, that's not bailing!
C: SETH
D: It is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off!
C: EVAN
D: What?!
C: SETH
D: The bottom line is you're a bailer. You just bailed on me, you bailed on me this morning when Terry spat on me, and you're bailing on me next year!
C: EVAN
D: Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes out!
C: SETH
D: We were supposed to go to college together! Since elementary school! What ever happened to that!
C: EVAN
D: What happened to that, is that you're too stupid to get into the schools I did!
C: SETH
D: I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!
C: EVAN
D: You've wasted all my time, you selfish bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and making friends, I threw away the last three years talking bullshit with you! And now, because of you, I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin!
N: Seth can't believe it. He's extremely hurt.
C: SETH
D: Getting with a girl won't make you any less of a loser next year!
C: EVAN
D: You talking to me or yourself? You fucking loser!
N: Seth drops one of the tide bottles and shoves Evan hard. Evan shoves him back.
S: INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with his fist.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: How do they expect us to work these things while we're driving? I can't even work my iMac while I'm sitting at my desk.
C: FOGELL
D: So, like, what does that computer do?
C: OFFICER SLATER
D: Pretty much anything, if you're smart enough to figure it out. Like, who do you really hate? Gimme a name.

The cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over the place.

C: EVAN
D: No officer. Not at all.

N: Michaels looks back at the Homeless Guy, who looks a little bit more awake than before.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Are you awake, sir?
E: CONT'D
N: The guy starts to open his eyes a little. Michaels grabs the guy's face and slams it back, knocking him out again. Fogell jumps a little.
C: OFFICER MICHEALS
D: I'm sorry, McLovin. But I really need this to be a private thing.
N: Officer Michaels takes out two cigarettes, and gives one to Fogell, who accepts, quivering in fear. Michaels lights his, then passes the lighter to Fogell.

E: coughing
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Yeah, well, we're also on probation. You see, we've actually trashed two other cars. The first time wasn't our fault, and the second time a bee flew in and I freaked out. Point is, we trash another car, without a good reason, we're fucked. Know what I'm saying?
N: Fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette.
C: FOGELL
D: Sure.
C: OFFICER MICHAELS
D: Now, we're going to arrest these guys, and if you don't mind, which you shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front of our car. Cool, McLovin?

Michaels pulls Slater aside and mumbles into his ear. Fogell turns and sees Seth and Evan - he's completely dumbfounded! Evan starts to look really nervous, like he might literally explode. He starts to stand up. The cops are still talking when suddenly, Evan BOLTS!

C: BECCA
D: Where have you been, you almost blew it.
C: EVAN
D: What?
C: BECCA
D: Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's right over there. She's been yammering about you all night.
C: EVAN
D: What? What did she say? Does she think I'm a good guy? What did she say?
C: BECCA
D: It was something like, "I'll fully blow him tonight."
C: EVAN
D: What?!?
N: Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a big group of people. He gets really nervous.
C: EVAN
D: Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was supposed to bring her!
E: CONT'D
C: BECCA
D: Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila from her parents and her and Helen have been going at it. I think she'll be fine in that department. I'd just go over there and invite her upstairs, pronto.
C: EVAN
D: What? Oh man... But...she's totally hammered. If I get with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that, like, date rape?
E: so nervous
C: BECCA
D: It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.
C: EVAN
D: I guess.
N: Evan looks at Helen and takes a deep breath.
S: INT. JULES BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself in the mirror, seeming as though he's on the verge of a full- on panic attack.
C: EVAN
D: Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants to suck on your penis. That's a good thing.
E: panting

S: INT. JULES' DEN/ DINING ROOM- CONTINUOUS
N: Fogell sits bored in front of the TV, drinking a beer. He watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. Everyone is talking and laughing while he sits alone. He walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls dancing. In the corner dancing is Nicola. He stares at her for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the TV. He changes the channel and "COPS" comes on the screen. It shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee dropping him. Fogell ponders as he watches "COPS." He throws back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is dancing in. He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.
C: FOGELL
D: They call you Nicola, right?
C: NICOLA
D: And they call you Fogell.
C: FOGELL

S: INT. JULES BATHROOM
N: - Evan, who has drank about half the bottle and is pretty drunk, stands up, arms reached out, and tries to walk in a straight line. He does it fairly well. Frustrated, he sits back down and takes another disgusting swig of Ouzo.
S: INT. JULES HOUSE
N: - Jules throws Seth a smile when she sees him making everyone laugh as he re-fills their cups with very foamy, slightly blue-tinted beer from the detergent jug.
S: INT. JULES BATHROOM
N: - Evan can't keep his balance as he tries to touch his nose while standing on one foot. He's drunk. He drinks from the tap thirstily, eats some toothpaste, fixes his collar and hair, and then gathers his courage, takes a deep breath, and steps out of the bathroom.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan walks out on the balcony. He spots the circle of people Helen was standing in, only now Helen is laying on the ground, laughing hysterically. Everyone in the circle is looking at her and laughing as well. Evan is extremely nervous. Helen looks up and spots him.

C: JULES
D: No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously, thanks for getting all the drinks. It really made the night.
C: SETH
D: It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems, no problems.
N: Jules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working.
C: SETH
D: Uh...you know...I love talking, and conversing with you, you're so good at it, but I can't hear you. Could we just go on the...uh...balcony or something?
E: CONT'D
N: Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling drunkenly.
C: JULES
D: Why not? I haven't conversed in ages. Let's do it.
N: Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and after Jules.
S: INT. JULES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue. After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the remarkably drunk Helen.
C: EVAN
D: Are you okay?
C: HELEN
D: I so flirt with you in Math.
C: EVAN
D: Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long time-

C: HELEN
D: Like...so hard.
E: CONT'D
N: Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons. Evan yanks it off.
C: HELEN
D: Good...
E: CONT'D
N: Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model. Evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual. As Evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and concentrates on untying her shoes.
C: HELEN
D: What the fuck...stupid shoe...
E: CONT'D
N: Evan moves over to help her. He can't do it either.
C: EVAN
D: Shit. Can you, like, slip out?
N: Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. She grabs a pair of scissors off a desk.
C: EVAN
D: Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.
E: CONT'D

S: EXT. JULES' FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS
N: Jules and Seth step out onto the front porch. There is no one else out there. The moment the door closes behind them, Seth turns to Jules and puts his hands on her hips. He stares into her eyes and moves in for the kiss. Jules instantly pulls back.

C: JULES
D: Yeah, I'm...uh...throwin' a party, remember?

D: Ahhh....man...fuck....
N: Seth starts to cry.
C: JULES
D: Are you crying?
C: SETH
D: No! Yeah, so what if I am? I'm a fucking idiot and it was my last chance! So I should be crying.
C: JULES
D: Last chance to do what?
C: SETH
D: To make you my girlfriend for the summer, okay? There! You're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me, and I thought we'd both be drunk, but...
C: JULES
D: What would me be drunk have anything to do with it?

C: EVAN
D: I'm...I'm..I'm about to. But first I just want to tell you exactly how I-

D: I'm gonna suck your dick so good.
N: Evan is taken aback.
C: EVAN
D: You don't have to do that, you know, we can start this relationship on something more than just that.

N: Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking. They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.
C: EVAN
D: Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
C: SETH
D: Uh...morning.
N: They stare at each other, uncomfortable.
C: EVAN
D: You sleep good?
C: SETH
D: Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
C: EVAN
D: Um...
N: Seth looks at his watch.
C: SETH
D: Maybe I should get going.
C: EVAN
D: You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing anything.
N: Beat.
C: SETH
D: Oh...do you want to hang out? I was...gonna go to the mall, actually.
C: EVAN
D: Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a comforter. For college.
C: SETH
D: Yeah. That'd be nice. I'd really like that.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NEXT DAY
N: Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store. Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are way too small.
C: EVAN
D: Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your pants look good.
C: SETH
D: Well, I need someone's opinion.
C: EVAN
D: Fine. They're way too small.
C: SETH
D: Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's pants last night I realized that if I buy pants that are too small it'll encourage me to lose weight. And in tight pants chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, the male camel toe look is really big this year.
N: Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the pants. He walks out.
C: SETH
D: These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck out of here.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE
N: They walk through the department store, when suddenly, Evan sees Helen and Jules looking at comforters. ANGLE ON: Helen and Jules
C: HELEN
D: Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I actually did that.
C: JULES
D: I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a new one.
C: HELEN
D: I have to. It's puke.
N: ANGLE ON: Seth and Evan
C: EVAN
D: Holy shit!
N: Helen looks like hell and Jules has a horrible black eye.
C: SETH
D: Is that them?
N: They stare at the two girls from afar.
C: EVAN
D: Should we hide?
N: Helen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out to Jules. Seth and Evan wave back. The girls get up and start to walk over.
C: SETH
D: Fuck that, man. I can't talk to her, look what I did to her!
E: pretending to smile
C: EVAN
D: Helen called me a pussy to my face! What am I going to say to her?
E: pretending to smile
N: The girls walk up to them.
C: HELEN JULES
D: Hi Evan, Seth. Hey guys.
C: EVAN SETH
D: Hi Helen, Hi Jules. Jules. Helen. Hi.
N: Everyone looks very embarrassed.
C: SETH
D: Oh my god. I'm so sorry, Jules.
C: JULES
D: It's okay.
C: EVAN
D: How are you feeling?
E: to Helen
C: HELEN
D: Not bad, but not great, how about you?
C: SETH
D: That looks terrible. No! I mean, it doesn't look terrible, it looks-
E: to Jules
C: JULES
D: Don't worry about it, Seth. It was an accident.
C: EVAN
D: Did you have fun last night?
E: to Helen
C: JULES
D: Do you remember much?
E: to Seth
C: HELEN
D: I really don't remember much.
E: to Evan
C: SETH
D: Not really. I remember looking up, and you screaming at me. That's about it.
E: to Jules
N: Jules laughs.
C: HELEN
D: I didn't puke on you, did I?
E: to Evan
N: Evan laughs.
C: EVAN
D: No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.
C: SETH
D: But seriously, I acted like a fuckin' idiot last night. I'm really sorry, you didn't deserve that.
E: to Jules
C: HELEN
D: Yeah, I...um...I'm sorry, about all that. Thanks for being such a gentleman.
E: to Evan
N: There is a moment of silence.
C: SETH
D: You look good with a black eye.
N: They all chuckle a little.
C: JULES
D: Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of cover-up for the grad photo.
C: SETH
D: Oh man...
E: mortified
C: HELEN
D: Yeah, and I'm going to Linen Brothers to buy Jules a new comforter.
C: EVAN
D: Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for college.
C: JULES
D: So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and buy me my cover-up, or what?
E: flirtatiously, joking
C: SETH
D: Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff.
C: EVAN
D: You could get your college pants there.
C: SETH
D: Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Evan drove me here, how do we-
C: JULES
D: I've got my dad's car. I'll take you home, and Evan can give Helen a lift.
C: HELEN
D: That sounds good.
C: EVAN
D: Maybe we can go eat after?
C: HELEN
D: Sweet.
N: Seth and Evan look at each other, odd smiles on both their faces. They didn't blow it.
C: SETH
D: So, uh, I'll call you later.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah man, have a good one.
C: JULES
D: Come on, Seth. Let's go.
N: Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the opposite direction. As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave. A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as though they're never going to see each other again.
S: INT. MACY'S ESCALATOR
N: As Jules and Seth walk into Macy's and Helen and Evan descend an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome crescendo, and we humbly fade to black... THE END END CREDIT SEQUENCE: We flip through Seth's seemingly endless penis drawings from childhood. They are hilarious.
