M: DECEMBER 12, 1994
T: FADE IN:
C: A PAIR OF HANDS
D: men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay. A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the floor.
C: ALL IN CLOSEUP
D: The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a hook and walks from
C: THE CELLAR
D: and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid- forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying the open bottle by the neck.
S: 2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT
N: Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed. ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He glances about nervously. There are shutters on the storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man. He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store, the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile. ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.
C: ALEX
D: Twenty people tonight. I got a South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon -- they actually came together.
N: (A BEAT) These people -- all they really want is something to brag about at dinner parties. He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away. 2 CONTINUED: There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting room.
C: ALEX
D: There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into
C: THE TASTING ROOM
D: It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed underneath. The woman's voice that replies is Gabriella's.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Maybe I should get dressed. Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping red wine from a plastic glass.
E: 0.S. with a throaty laugh
C: GABRIETM
D: I don't want to spoil a religious experience.
C: ALEX
D: -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses.
C: ALEX
D: Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Oh, you have competition.
N: 2 CONTINUED: (2) ALEX (SLIGHTLY ANNOYED) You know how many bottles I have in this store? Open any one of 'em, I'll tell you the vintage and vintner, b lindfolded. He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties. She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band. She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Okay. Show me.
C: ALEX
D: Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose.
C: ALEX
D: Gabriella, I picked these wines.
C: GABRIELLA
D: So what is it?
C: ALEX
D: All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs.
C: GABRIELLA
D: I'm not wearing any.
C: ALEX
D: I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast.
N: ALEX (WITHOUT HESITATION) Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very aggressive. He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth softly, then fully. 2 CONTINUED: (3) GABRIELLA (LOW) -- I lo e y u, Alex. V O
S: 3 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)
N: Alex is unlocking the door for Gabriella. Dressed, she looks younger. They're awkward with each other.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Don't think you have to say it because .1 say it, Alex.
N: (SMILING BRIGHTLY) Doesn't mean anything..
C: ALEX
D: It means something to me.
N: GABRIELLA (EASED) We're good together, aren't we. Alex lets out a breath.
C: ALEX
D: Oh, yeah... We're pretty good. He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting room.
S: 4 INT. TASTING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Alex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air from the open bottles. He hears a quiet CLANK of METAL. Instantly alert, he reaches for his jacket and turns off the-light.
S: 5 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT
N: Behind the cash register Alex opens a drawer and takes out a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR, like someone trying to break in through the back door from the parking lot. Alex slings his jacket casually over the gun.
S: 6 EXT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT
N: Alex throws open the back door; he's counting on the element of surprise.
C: HIS POV
D: His red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties, whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain.
N: ALEX (ADVANCING) You think you're gonna steal my car, asshole? The younger man whirls around.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: You scared me, man. A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from behind the wheel.
C: REPO MAN
D: This is not your car, sir. This car belongs to the Star Leasing Company. Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a higher wattage than the security lights.
C: REPO MAN
D: I can collect either the money or the car. Given how much you owe, I figure it's the car. The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.
C: ALEX
D: Pop the. trunk.
C: REPO MAN
D: We inventory the property at the yard. He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as soon as the exit is clear.
C: ALEX
D: I just want to show you something. Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the still-running car.
N: 6 CONTINUED: In his hand he has the locking "Club" Alex usually uses to secure his. steering wheel. He's not stupid. Amused, Alex takes a step back, palms up.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: What are you doing? The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.
C: ALEX
D: Do you drink?
C: REPO MAN
D: Not on the job. What is this, booze?
C: ALEX
D: Two cases of single malt whiskey aged in the barrel before he was born.
C: REPO MAN
D: The Caddy's overdue.
C: ALEX
D: So are you. Drink it with the kid. Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy yourselves. Isn't that worth a few days' breather...
N: (A BEAT) My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I, maybe, for not firing him. The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: We're clear.
S: 7 INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Alex is driving fast, top down, Samba MUSIC loud on the STEREO. He keeps time on the wheel as the Miami skyline cruises by.
S: EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Alex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium building before the gate has slid all the way open. The TIRES SQUEAL as he powers the car around the corner. 8 CONTINUED:
C: A DUCATI MOTORCYCLE
D: hogs his space. Alex lays the car in tightly. He has to squeeze out the door. He bumps the Ducati. It starts to topple; he grabs it before it goes over.
S: 9 INT. CONDO - NIGHT
N: Alex lets himself in. The entry ALARM starts to BEEP. He turns it off and resets it. The light has been left on in the kitchen.
S: 10 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: JASON, a handsome, troubled 17-year-old with long, dark hair, is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the center island. He looks harder and wiser than his years. Tackle is strewn everywhere. Some spaghetti remains in the pot it was cooked in and Jason's knife is standing upright in it. Alex walks into the kitchen. He makes an effort to be pleasant, although he's irritated by the mess, by the motorcycle.
C: ALEX
D: It's late, Jason.
C: JASON
D: I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales.
C: ALEX
D: You can't'fish all night and work all day.
C: JASON
D: Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind.
C: ALEX
D: No wonder you drop bottles.
C: JASON
D: Fire me.
C: ALEX
D: Do you do it on purpose?
C: JASON
D: Fishing bought me my bike.
N: 10 CONTINUED:
C: ALEX
D: I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car.
N: JASON (SARCASTIC) I wasn't sure you were coming home.
C: SEVERS
D: The TOASTER OVEN DINGS. Jason takes out a muffin, it in two with his fishing knife.
C: ALEX
D: Use a regular knife.
C: JASON
D: This has a better edge. Feel it (pointing it at Alex,
C: BLADE FLAT)
D: -- feel it. Their voices are rising.
C: ALEX
D: Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away.
C: JASON
D: Hell with you. Jason exits to the stairs.
C: ALEX
D: And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep.
N: STAIRS
C: JASON
D: If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs.
C: ALEX
D: You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage.
C: JASON
D: Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to.
N: (CONTINUED)' 10 CONTINUED: (2) LANDING UPSTAIRS SUZANNE (O .S=.. ) Now what are you arguing about?
C: SUZANNE
D: is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.
C: JASON
D: It's not an argument.
C: ALEX
D: I asked him to clean up downstairs.
N: SUZANNE (SOOTHING ALEX) Maybe he hadn't finished-
C: ALEX
D: A modicum of cooperation, you know?
C: JASON
D: A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind.
C: SUZANNE
D: I don't like that tone from: you.
C: JASON
D: Then go to bed.
C: ALEX
D: Hey!
N: JASON (RIGHT BACK) What!
C: SUZANNE
D: It's too late for this.
C: ALEX
D: Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door.
C: CHOOSES
D: enters his bedroom. Suzanne, alone for a-moment, to enter Jason's room.
S: 11 INT. JASON'S ROOM
C: SUZANNE
D: He's my husband.
N: JASON (SOFTLY) I know, Mom.
C: SUZANNE
D: -- I still love him.
C: JASON
D: Whatever. She walks out.
S: 12 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Alex stands under water as hot as he can stand, parboiling himself. Eyes squeezed shut, he lets out a long breath. His life demands more energy than he has anymore. He soaps himself thoroughly.
S: 13 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Suzanne hears the front DOOR SLAM. Jason's DUCATI STARTS UP and ACCELERATES away. Alex comes out of the bathroom in a towel. SUZANNE (FONDLY) Lie down, I'll give you a back rub. She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh.
C: SUZANNE
D: -- maybe I'd better lie down. He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television. Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her best.
C: SUZANNE
D: I liked the twin nurses. There was kind of a story. Alex brings the remote control back to bed.
C: ALEX
D: You'll like this one better.
N: 13 CONTINUED: He hangs his towel on a doorknob, slides into bed, starts the tape, which begins with sweat-slick dancing girls at Carnival. To Suzanne's astonishment, it turns out to be a travelog.
C: SUZANNE
D: Rio?
C: ALEX
D: I've been so busy. We could sneak away for a week.. Would you like that?
C: SUZANNE
D: If we really go. Last time I packed, we went nowhere.
N: ALEX (SLEEPILY) Last time was different.
C: SUZANNE
D: The beaches -- I thought we had a beach. I read how the hotels keep spotters on the roof with scopes, to keep thieves away from the guests. They can look at every inch of your body through the scope. Do you mind that I like that? Alex? He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.
E: watching the tape with a low laugh
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BOAT - DAWN
N: On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat dips and dances to the music of the water. Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word.
C: JASON
D: :. Bite...
N: 14 CONTINUED: Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps behind the rod. The fish hits. JASON (CALLING OUT) Henryl Fish ont The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook.
C: JASON
D: Time to go to work, man! C'mon. A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning, scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's weathered his head for some time.
C: HENRY
D: Who we got?
C: JASON
D: Let's find out. He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean, they both recognize the fish at the end.
C: HENRY
D: Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out of the good stuff. Damn. He spits over the side. Jason grins.
C: JASON
D: This one's got more to worry about than you do. He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-
C: HENRY
D: Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I want to know the sucker's good and dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat. You got a barb on that hook? .
C: JASON
D: Oh, yeah. Jason braces for the fight.
S: 15 EXT. DOCK - MORNING
N: Jason and Henry are cutting the shark with the speed and dexterity of professionals.
C: HENRY
D: The Gulf, man, that's the place. And what makes you think fifty-fifty is right? My boat. My gas.
C: JASON
D: My skill. ... My fins.
E: slicing off the fins
S: 16 EXT. FISH MARKET - LONG SHOT - MORNING
N: Jason and Henry slap their catch onto the Fishmonger's slippery counter. The market's noisy, men shouting. We see the negotiation from a distance.
S: EXT. DOCK - DAY (MINUTES LATE)
N: Jason and Henry walk through the hubbub.
C: HENRY
D: You cool?
C: JASON
D: I'm cool.
C: HENRY

S: INT. WINE STORE - DAY
N: Alex comes out of his office.
C: ALEX
D: Rob, has Jason shown up? A man's French-accented VOICE answers him from the store.
C: ROBERT
D: Not yet.
E: O.S.
C: ALEX
D: You have his paycheck there?
C: ROBERT
D: All ready.
N: 18 CONTINUED: Alex takes it, and rips it up.
S: 19 INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY
N: The Chinese CHEF in the busy, steamy kitchen is inspecting the shark fins Jason has brought him. Jason is anxious to finish business and go.
C: CHEF
D: You no like my company? Fine. Who cares. Bring me more fin, you retire. You no want to retire? Good. Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things.
C: JASON
D: You ever caught a shark?
N: CHEF (BIGGER) You ever cook one?
C: JASON
D: Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm.
C: JASON
D: He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.
C: CHEF
D: -- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of
C: TEETH)
D: Nice fin, Jason. He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS.
S: 20 EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Jason jams on his helmet and starts his. motorcycle, guns it down the street. 20 CONTINUED:

C: ALEX
D: Just get in the car.
S: 22 INT. CADILLAC - DAY (TRAVELING)
N: Jason has fallen asleep while Alex drives. Alex picks up Jason's hand. Jerking awake, Jason tries to pull away, but his reflexes are sleep-slowed. Alex sniffs Jason's fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back.
C: ALEX
D: You stink.
C: JASON
D: I washed.
C: ALEX
D: There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands.
C: ALEX
D: ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively.
N: 22 CONTINUED:
C: ALEX
D: Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other.
N: JASON (SATISFIED) I'll send you a Christmas card.
C: ALEX
D: Save the stamp. They turn into the driveway to an expensive development.
S: 23 EXT. SECURITY BOOTH, CORAL GABLES - DAY
N: The Cadillac rolls to a stop at the ate. A tough, but amicable-looking armed guard in his forties, MIKE, opens the window of the air-conditioned booth. His RADIO is tuned to the FOOTBALL GAME.
C: ALEX
D: Hi, mike -- what's the score?
N: MIKE (CHECKING THE
C: APPOINTMENT BOARD)
D: Dolphins down by nine, minute forty to go. It's over.
C: ALEX
D: Don't underestimate Marino. Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate.
C: MIKE
D: I told you, they don't have it this year. With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto the grounds.
N: ALEX (YELLING BACK) â¢ Judas! Grinning, Mike routinely writes down the license plate number.
S: 24 EXT. CADILLAC - DAY
N: Alex cruises past a collection of oversized villas, and turns into the driveway of the gaudiest. He and Jason climb out of the car. Alex opens the trunk. He loads two wine cases into Jason's arms, takes the third himself. They haven't said a word to each other.
S: 25 EXT. VILLA - DAY
N: Alex rings the intercom with his elbow. Gabriella's VOICE CRACKLES in response.
C: GABRIELLA
D: on the intercom) Who is it?
E: V.O.
C: ALEX
D: Wine delivery. The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked. Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of clean burp cloths.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Oh, the boss himself!
C: ALEX
D: How are you? She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting what she sees. A circuit connects between them.
E: with a modest chuckle
C: ALEX
D: Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese.
N: (TO GABRIELLA) This is my stepson, Jason. GABRIELLA (VERY CORRECT) How do you do.
C: JASON

S: 27 EXT. REESES' BOAT DAY
N: A sleek, ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock, the crew unobtrusively at work. FRANK REESE, a powerful, confidant man in his mid-sixties, is sitting with his INSURANCE AGENT at a table on deck where policies are spread out next to a jewelry box. Reese's expensive 35- year-old wife DINA has turned her chair to sun her legs while she plays with the BABY.
C: DINA
D: -- what's the point of having it, if I can't wear it, Frank?
N: AGENT (DEFERENTIALLY) You can wear it anywhere you like, Mrs. Reese -- except out of the country. Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at Dina's long legs.. She smiles.
C: FRANK
D: Alex, should we insure the wine while we're at it? His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case.
C: ALEX
D: Aren't you covered on your home policy?
N: GABRIELLA (TO JASON) I'll show you, come on.
C: AGENT
D: How much wine are we talking about? Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck fading.
C: DINA
D: Why bother insuring it? Let's drink it instead.
E: O.S.
S: 28 INT. BOAT - DAY
N: It's quiet inside, not tasteful but impressive, like everything else of the Reeses. Jason takes a stab at conversation.
C: JASON
D: Big boat. Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him. They're both kids.
C: GABRIELLA
D: ugly, isn't it. He grins and relaxes, looks around.
C: JASON
D: The fittings are definitely -- yeah on the ugly side. But damn, she's solid.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Oh, a boat type.
C: JASON
D: I like.boats. Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.
E: proud, defensive
C: JASON
D: So where you headed?
C: GABRIELLA
D: I'm not going, 'I can't go.
C: JASON
D: They don't want to take the baby.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Iâ¢don't have a green card, I can't leave the country. Baby goes with an American nurse. I house-sit. It's fine.
C: JASON
D: You don't like them. Gabriella laughs.
N: 28 CONTINUED:
C: GABRIELLA
D: God. I'm obvious. I just don't like working for people, but that's life. He chafes under authority the same way she does.
C: JASON
D: Doesn't have to be.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Maybe not with a rich stepfather. He laughs.
C: JASON
D: Worst kind.
N: GABRIELLA (CORRECTIVELY) No. (A BEAT) You don't appreciate what you have, Jason. It's very poor where I came from.
C: JASON
D: Where's that?
C: GABRIELLA
D: Venezuela. Do I look it?
C: JASON
D: I don't know, I never been there.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Well, I don't. My mother's Indian. The India kind of Indian.
N: (LAUGHS) Imagine a house where the father asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish, and the mother answers 'Curry' in Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He says, 'No es importante.' No wonder I'm nuts.
C: JASON
D: You don't seem too nuts. She laughs.
C: GABRIELLA
D: You don't know mel
N: (OOR1TINUED ) CONTINUED: .( 2) They're suddenly both very aware that they're alone together.
S: 29 EXT. BOAT, THE DECK - DAY
N: The agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties. Alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the remaining case on deck.
C: AGENT
D: -- so back to the safe it goes -- Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.
C: FRANK
D: Dina, that's disgusting.
C: DINA
D: The alternative is using your fingers, Frank. which offends you more? Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.
C: FRANK
D: Don't encourage her, Alex. Her mouth is big enough. Dina is hurt.
C: FRANK
D: I'll show you that painting in our stateroom. The agent follows him away.
E: to the agent
C: ALEX
D: Do you want to see the label? She hides her hurt by not looking at him.
E: kindly; to Dina
C: DINA
D: Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us both a glass. I'm not allowed to drink alone. When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.
S: 30 INT. BOAT - DAY
N: Jason has almost finished storing the wine. Gabriella is sitting on a bar stool at the galley,. listening to him, snared by the quiet passion in his voice.
C: JASON
D: -- when you're skimming along the water, nothing between you and the bottom of the sea but a layer of wood, your thoughts... end. All that noise inside your head? Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.
C: JASON
D: . . . Stops. Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of apology to Jason.
C: DINA
D: Gabriella? Are you down there?
E: V.O.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Yes, Mrs. Reese.
C: DINA
D: The baby needs you. And bring a pacifier for Frank.
E: V.0.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Right there. She slides off the stool.
C: JASON
D: You should come out with me sometime. She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the remaining case of wine for him to stock.
S: EXT. BOAT - DAY
N: Gabriella. lifts the fussy baby from Dina, her hands sure and calming. She coos nonsense to his little ear as she- reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm.
C: GABRIELLA
D: He.'s ready for his nap.
N: 31 CONTINUED: Frank and the agent return from another section of the boat.
C: FRANK
D: You doing up to the house, Gabriella? Want to take this with you? He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.
E: off her nod
C: FRANK
D: Put it on my desk. He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass, and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.
C: FRANK
D: Are we all set, Alex?
C: ALEX
D: I'm going to check the storage room, see what else'll travel. I know I put some vintage Armagnac in there, maybe some Porto? He heads down the gangplank.
C: FRANK
D: He's a vendor, Dina. It's like drinking with the help.
N: DINA (DISARMING HIM) Did you pick the wine, sweetie? It's lovely. Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor present, the agent. AGENT (AWKWARDLY) So I'll messenger over the rider for your signature -- Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:
C: FRANK
D: -- You still here? Dina laughs, too.
S: 32 INT. VILLA, UPSTAIRS - DAY
N: Gabriella settles the baby on his side, the only Reese she likes. She starts to close the shutters. Lullaby MUSIC is playing on the baby's TAPE DECK.

D: ... Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to

S: 68 INT. GABRIELLA'S COUSIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The dinner hour. The table in the mean little house is too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder. Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says Gabriella's snooty.
S: 69 INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

N: Suzanne turns onto their street, pulls into the garage. She sees Alex's Cadillac already parked.
S: EXT. CAR - NIGHT
N: She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls. She walks a little faster.
S: INT. CONDO - NIGHT
N: Suzanne lets herself in. Alex didn't set the alarm. She sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.
S: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where he can reach it. He has almost finished packing. As he reaches for his underwear, he startles. Suzanne is leaning against the door frame. SUZANNE (CONTROLLED) Where are you going? Alex recovers quickly.
C: ALEX
D: Napa. I got a problem with a supplier. Boutique wineries -- they're all owned by ex-lawyers.

C: ALEX
D: I need to see the wholesaler.
C: SUZANNE
D: You're amazing, you really are. Now how are you going to explain 'Miss Vasquez?'
C: ALEX
D: Honey, I don't have to. I will, out of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the agent.
C: SUZANNE
D: God, I could even believe you, if I wanted to.
N: ALEX (HARDER) I don't want to fight with you on my way out the door. I don't have time for this. Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react, he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the stairs.
C: SUZANNE
D: I put Terry's life insurance money into that store -- and you spend it on your goddamn girlfriends while my checks bounce. Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.
C: ALEX
D: I worked my ass off for you with that store. Eight years of twelve- hour days and one-day weekends! So don't tell me I haven't treated you well.
N: He picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on. Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table. Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away behind her back.
C: SUZANNE
D: -- You're going to talk to me!
C: ALEX
D: When I get back.
C: SUZANNE
D: With more of your fucking lies! I hate you! Wasting my -- life!

C: ALEX
D: -- Give me my keys, I need my keys. I don't want to hurt you.
C: SUZANNE
D: That's all you ever do! He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto the sofa.
C: SUZANNE
D: Go to hell! He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up and up. She grips his keys tighter.
C: ALEX
D: (breathless from the
C: STRUGGLE)
D: Open your hand, Suzanne. Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers. She drives her elbow into his face.
C: SUZANNE
D: You sonofabitch! He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across the temple.
N: 75 CONTINUED: (3) The blow sends him sprawling to the floor; he doesn't move. She is stunned by what she has done. In a panic she races up the stairs, the heel of her hand to her nose to staunch the bleeding.
S: 76 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Suzanne spills everything out of Alex's suitcase and starts throwing in her own clothes, blood-spotting them in her haste.

N: Suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs.
C: ALEX
D: hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.
S: EXT. CONDO - NIGHT
N: Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right into Jason. She cries out in fright.

N: SUZANNE - JA-SONII
S: INT. CONDO - NIGHT
N: Ready to kill, Jason is shocked to see the job apparently already done for him. He bends over Alex to see if he's dead, and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he isn't.

The jewelry pouch spills out of Alex's pocket. Jason doesn't see it. The HORN BLARES, outside. Jason pulls his rod out of the closet. As he steps over Alex, he spots the pouch, the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude. The HORN BLASTS again. Jason swoops up the pouch.
S: EXT. CONDO.- NIGHT
N: Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in. Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.

S: 88 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

D: I can't see his face anymore. I can't hear his voice.
N: (DREAMILY) -- But when you come home from fishing -- with the sea and the salt and the engine oil? It's like he's walking through the door. I love that smell -- I can still smell him. She watches the highway posts clack past.

S: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

C: JASON
D: My grandmother asked me to bring in a necklace of hers -- Jason takes the velvet pouch out of his pocket, unlaces it, spreads out the necklace on the counter. He leans forward on his elbows while the jeweler examines it with a loupe. When the jeweler looks up, he's angry.
C: JEWELER
D: Your grandmother lets you carry around a million dollars worth of jewelry? Go put it back where you found it. The jeweler pours the necklace back in the pouch, cinches it closed, slaps it on top of the case.
C: JASON

C: HENRY
D: That ain't cool in my book! In a swift, unexpected move, victor jams Henry back down on his bar stool. The bartender starts toward them. Alex slips out the door. The stool and Henry are toppling over. Victor catches them both, sets Henry upright.

C: GABRIELLA
D: I miss you.
C: ALEX
D: Are there any messages? She carries the phone to the counter where she keeps mail and any messages and starts to leaf through the stack. Her eye falls on a crumpled light blue envelope; she moves it out from the pile. It has been forwarded several times. And it's addressed to her.
E: V.O.
C: GABRIELLA
D: It's lonely here. There's no return address. She slits it open with her thumbnail. A trickle of sand falls out.
C: ALEX

S: 141 INT. CABIN - LATE DAY
N: Jason throws open the door. A figure is bent over in the galley. It turns, and by the light of the refrigerator Jason recognizes Henry.
C: JASON
D: Jesus, Henry... What the hell you doing?... How'd you know this was my boat??
C: HENRY
D: I saw you cast off. Good little sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa -- hear that?
N: JASON (PARANOID) Where -- what?? Henry rubs his stomach.
C: HENRY
D: Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath.
C: JASON
D: It's complicated.
N: HENRY (NODDING) Always is. The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats the sandwich he made.
C: JASON
D: So why are you on the Gulf?
N: 141 CONTINUED:
C: HENRY
D: My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. -- Need a crew?

C: HENRY
D: A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather.
N: JASON (CAREFULLY) Maybe it was.
C: HENRY
D: No, no, no, no -- this guy was not any kind of family man, if you know what I mean. So you're in some deep shit, because he wasn't a cop neither.
C: JASON
D: -- What'd you tell him? Henry chuckles.
C: HENRY
D: Lots of ways to make fifty bucks. Misunderstanding, Jason shoves him up against the counter.
N: 141 CONTINUED: (2)
C: JASON
D: You gonna lean on me, Henry?? Is that the plan? Henry is hurt and offended.
N: HENRY (WITH DIGNITY) No, man, I wouldn't stoop that low. And if I'd taken the fifty, I wouldn't have to be eating your shitbag sandwich neither. Jason steps back, ashamed of himself. He sits down to recover. Henry looks at him with a friend's concern.
C: HENRY
D: You -- um -- you moving contraband, Jason? Jason shakes his head no.
C: HENRY
D: This guy struck me as a serious problem. A few raindrops spatter the windows. Jason makes for the cabin door.

D: Not likely to sink two of 'em.

N: Suzanne is driving. 'Jason has told her. He glances at her sideways. She takes a long breath. The rain speeds up. She switches on the wipers.
C: SUZANNE

N: Jason looking out the back window sees only the headlights and rain.
C: JASON
D: Still with us.

C: SUZANNE
D: ... How about Mexico? The Sea of Cortez? Your father fished for marlin there. The biggest catch he ever had. sharp left, She sees a side road coming up. She hangs a skidding into the turn, traction holding.
S: 151 INT. VICTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Victor can't make the turn in time. ALEX TURN1

C: SUZANNE
D: -- Shit! She 'spins the wheel to avoid a head-on, but in so doing she clips the curb and loses control. She throws an arm across Jason to protect him. The car rolls onto its top, scraping across the road.
S: 153 EXT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT
N: The upside-down car rips through a fence, slides down off the road. The engine dies. The only SOUND is the SPINNING back TIRE and the WINDSHIELD that now caves in.
S: 154 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Victor swerves to the side of the road. Alex leaps out of the car and runs toward the wreck. Victor follows at a slower pace, opening his umbrella. He's still eating his apple. He sees a neighboring house light come on in response to the crash.
C: AT THE WRECK
D: Alex is trying to open the jammed door when Victor reaches him.
C: VICTOR
D: We don't have much time. Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches in spasm. Car headlights pass by on the road.
C: ALEX
D: We need to get some help!
C: VICTOR
D: Already on the way, I'm afraid.
N: 154 CONTINUED: Alex kicks out what remains of the back side window and slithers into the car. Victor calls in after him.

S: 155 INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: With the car upside-down, Alex has to reach under the seat to press the trunk release.
S: 156 EXT. CAR - NIGHT
N: The car is rocked far enough forward on its hood to enable the trunk to open. The contents cascade onto Victor. He starts his search, the apple gripped between his teeth.
S: 157 INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: His own breathing noisy and shallow, Alex brushes the glass away from Suzanne's face.
C: ALEX
D: -- Oh, Christ... He lifts her shirt to see how badly she's cut and presses the heel of his hand against the gash to try to stop the bleeding. Her blood spurts through his fingers. With his other hand he pats down her body.
N: SUZANNE (BARELY CONSCIOUS) Jase... Alex checks Jason for her, searching his limp body at the, same time.
C: ALEX
D: I think he's okay, Suzanne. Just' tell me where it is. She can't answer. He opens the glove compartment and feels inside. He goes through her purse.
C: ALEX
D: Goddammit! Leaning over the seat, he fumbles with her clothes. He's trying to make her comfortable.
N: 157 CONTINUED: Then he reaches down her bra, into her panties, searching. Her voice is faint.
C: SUZANNE

C: ALEX
D: What? -- â¢ She mumbles something indecipherable. He puts his ear close to her mouth. The SIRENS are bearing down.
C: SUZANNE
D: ... Fuck you.
E: only a breath
C: VICTOR
D: We're out of time, Ale7. You can stay if you want, but I've left.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT

S: 161 INT. VICTOR'S CAR - NIGHT (LATER)

D: Hey, there... how do you feel?

D: Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news.
N: ALEX (QUIETLY) I'm sorry, Jason... I'm so sorry. Jason stares at him. He hasn't absorbed the fact.
C: ALEX
D: She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face.
N: JASON
C: N000!
D: He seizes the empty I.V. stand and hurls it at Alex, who throws up his arm protectively. Jason tackles Alex under his guard, smashing him into the metal dresser. Alex's head snaps backward, cracking the mirror.
C: JASON
D: -- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug.
C: ALEX
D: -- Don't, don't --
N: (CALLING OUT) I need someone in here! JASON (WEAKLY) Let go of me! Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms. An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse.

S: 170 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Alex walks down the corridor to Jason's room. He taps on the door. There's no answer. He pushes open the door. The room is empty, the bed stripped. Alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young DOCTOR he sees walking down the hall.
C: ALEX
D: Where's my son??
N: DOCTOR (PUZZLED) I released him this morning.
C: ALEX
D: You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself??

S: 171 EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: Jason is running down the road, his face contorted.
S: 172 EXT. BEACH - DAY
N: Jason keeps running onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes and plunges into the water and swims. Swims until he's exhausted and gasping. He tips his head back in the water and screams his grief to the pitiless sky.

D: Jason! -- Don't hurt me. Please.
E: her eyes on his knife
C: JASON
D: Where is he?
C: GABRIELLA
D: He went to get you! He's not coming back until tomorrow. She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade â¢ flat to her skin. She freezes.
C: JASON
D: His car's here.
C: GABRIELLA
D: It's been here since he went to Napa.
C: JASON
D: I keep hearing about Napa. Did you ever call him there? She shakes her head.
C: JASON
D: You don't know where he was.
N: 176 CONTINUED: She swallows to clear her voice. Her- eyes haven't left the knife.
C: GABRIELLA.
D: Why would he lie to me? Ever so lightly Jason's fingertips find her skin.
C: JASON
D: You didn't waste any time,. did you. You moved right in.
C: GABRIELLA.
D: You don't need the knife.. Put. the knife down. She knows men and children well enough to demand, not beg. Jason has almost forgotten he still. has the knife against her. He lifts it and folds it and puts it away.
C: JASON
D: I'm going to wait for him, and. I'm going to kill him. His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.
C: GABRIELLA
D: They'll lock you up.
C: JASON
D: Yeah.
C: GABRIELLA
D: 'Away from the sky and the air and the sea and the current running against the wind?' That was a very beautiful letter. Jason moves onto the bed, on his knees. beside her.

C: JASON
D: He had us followed.
C: GABRIELLA
D: W-why? He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.
C: GABRIELLA
D: How do you know? She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.
C: JASON
D: I'm not crazy. Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort him.
C: GABRIELLA
D: ... I'm so very sorry about what happened to your mother. His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.
C: JASON
D: Her loss, your gain. Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on top of her and pins her down.
C: JASON
D: Her home, her bed -- her life. He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.
C: GABRIELLA
D: . Don't do this for revenge.
N: 176 CONTINUED: (3)
C: JASON
D: Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple.
C: JASON
D: Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt.
C: GABRIELLA
D: I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love.
E: in a whisper
C: GABRIELLA
D: Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.
C: GABRIELLA
D: This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time.
N: GABRIELLA (IN SPANISH) What are you doing to me? (IN ENGLISH) Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side.
C: GABRIELLA

D: You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it.

N: GABRIELLA (SOFTLY) I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes:
C: GABRIELLA
D: I need him, Jason.
N: JASON (FURIOUS) You don't -- you don't!
C: GABRIELLA
D: I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away.
N: 178 CONTINUED: GABRIELLA (GROWING FRANTIC) You have to leave now, Jason.
C: JASON
D: What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan.
N: GABRIELLA (COLDLY) This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door.
C: JASON
D: You're never going to marry him, Gabriella.
C: GABRIELLA

C: ALEX
D: Why didn't you wait for me? Jason eats without answering.
C: ALEX
D: And what about all your stuff, and your mother's? Jason swallows, wipes his mouth.
C: JASON
D: She doesn't need it anymore, and I don't want it. Gabriella brings Alex a cup of coffee.
C: GABRIELLA
D: How about a sandwich?
N: ALEX (SNAPPISHLY) I'm not hungry. Jesus.
C: JASON
D: You haven't even said hello to her.
C: ALEX
D: , Hello, Gabby.
E: with great control
N: JASON (PROMPTING HIM) 'Did you miss me, honey?,
C: ALEX
D: What are you doing. Jason gets up from the table. He's wearing workout clothes.
C: JASON
D: Nothing. He walks out of the condo. Alex and Gabriella are left alone together. She jumps in before he can say anything.
C: GABRIELLA
D: He just lost his mother, Alex. You can't expect him to act normal. He steps up beside her and moves her hair off her shoulders.
N: ALEX (GENTLY) Did you try to make him feel better?
C: GABRIELLA
D: Yes. I gave him sonlething to eat. She walks out and up the stairs to the bedroom.
E: right back at him
S: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
N: Alex comes into the room. She's sitting on the bed. GABRIELLA (SOFTLY) ... I feel like I made her die. Alex sits down beside her and takes her hand.
C: GABRIELLA
D: I wanted her to go away so bad... I used to wish she'd die. And then she did. He lets go of her hand.
N: 183 CONTINUED:
C: ALEX
D: Oh,. please. I don't need two children in the house. -- What happened to your mouth? Gabriella's hand jumps to her lip.
E: noticing her mouth
C: GABRIELLA
D: Oh. -I bit my lip. He takes her lip between his and nuzzles it.

S: 184 INT. CONDO WEIGHT ROOM - DAY
N: Jason is working out alone in the little gym when in the mirror he sees Alex come through the door. He keeps lifting. Alex sits down on the bench beside him. Jason ignores him.
C: ALEX
D: You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back.
C: JASON
D: It's not yours.
N: ALEX (HARDER) Either way. Jason continues to lift. Finally:
C: JASON
D: Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money.
C: ALEX
D: I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people.
N: 184 CONTINUED: The bar wobbles with Jason's laugh.. Alex moves behind and spots him, unnecessarily.
C: ALEX
D: Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden.
C: JASON
D: I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did.
C: ALEX
D: It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex.
C: JASON
D: There was a car following us!
C: ALEX
D: Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no.
C: ALEX
D: I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead.
E: letting out a breath
C: JASON
D: Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper.
C: ALEX
D: Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head.
N: 184 CONTINUED: (2)
C: JASON
D: She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away.
S: 185 INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Victor is lying on his bed, the respirator beside him, while he talks on the phone to Alex. He looks dreadful.
C: VICTOR
D: Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates.
S: 186 INT. ALEX'S.DEN - NIGHT
N: Alex sits hunched over the desk, the phone in his hand, thinking.

C: SKIN)
D: I'm never leaving you again. He starts to caress her.
C: GABRIELLA
D: -- I'm already asleep, honey.
N: ALEX (LIGHTLY) Wake up. She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and deep.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Can he hear us? Alex's tone turns. Jason is causing him another problem.
C: ALEX
D: I think he's probably figured out why we sleep in the same bed, Gabby.
C: Â¢ GABRIELLA
D: He misses his mother.
C: ALEX
D: ... So do I. Gabriella props herself up on her elbow.
C: GABRIELLA
D: What?
N: ALEX . I wish she was alive and happy and someplace else. Gabriella lies down again and makes herself comfortable against him. He tries again to interest her body.
C: ALEX
D: We need to go somewhere, just us.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Where?
C: ALEX
D: I'm buying a vineyard in France. Have you ever been to Paris?
N: She rolls onto her stomach, indirectly blocking his frontal exploration.
C: GABRIELLA
D: No. Alex scoots down next to her, his hand takes possession of her ass.
C: ALEX
D: We'll stay at the Ritz, we'll eat our way through every three-star restaurant in town -- a new dress every night -- would you like that? Gabriella laughs in wonder and turns onto her side to face him. They fit themselves together like an old married couple.
C: ALEX
D: -- We'll drive down through Burgundy -- follow the Rhone into Provence, wind up on the Riviera -- Monte Carlo --
E: getting caught up in his own fantasy
C: GABRIELLA
D: -- Princess Stephanie. He gives a rueful laugh; she's younger than he easily remembers.
C: ALEX
D: They have tables at the casino where you play baccarat and the bets start at a hundred bucks.
C: GABRIELLA
D: You won't be able to afford it. You'll have spent all your money on my clothes and my jewelry. (slipping her leg
E: with a chuckle
C: BETWEEN HIS)
D: Ohl Remember Dina's necklace? Alex's eyes go cold and watchful, although she doesn't notice.
C: ALEX
D: Sure.
N: 188 CONTINUED: (3)
C: GABRIELLA
D: I'll wear something like that and then if you lose you can throw it on the table to cover your bet, like James Bond.
C: ALEX
D: James had an expense account. He rolls onto his back, she lays her cheek on his graying chest. He no longer wants to make love.
C: ALEX
D: What made you think of the necklace? She's drifting toward sleep.
C: GABRIELLA
D: I looked good in it, didn't I? He pats her shoulder without answering. He won't sleep for a while.
C: A SEA GULL
D: flaps away with a SCREECH that startles us.
S: 190 EXT. DOCKS - DAY

C: GABRIELLA
D: There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person.
C: JASON
D: Alex stole it.
N: 198 CONTINUED:
C: GABRIELLA
D: You really hate him.
C: JASON
D: The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen.
C: VICTOR

N: JASON AND GABRIELLA
C: GABRIELLA
D: ... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired??

S: INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING)
N: Victor makes a face; he thinks he has been spotted. Jason is getting harder to follow. The music ends; An ANNOUNCER describes what it was, gives the time. There's a BEEP. The NEWS THEME starts up. "On the hour every hour, we give you all the news you need..." The announcer continues with the lead stories, including the recently- discovered jewel theft.
S: 204 EXT. STREET - DAY

D: looks back.
S: INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The shutters have been closed, Alex is lying on the couch in the dark, having a nap. He's awakened by a nasty wheeze. Victor is standing over him.
C: ALEX
D: A man with your breeding usually rings the doorbell.
C: VICTOR
D: There was, is, no time.
N: ALEX (SITTING UP) You heard the news. Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as though to admire it.
C: VICTOR
D: I know you keep money here somewhere.
N: (A BEAT) Your stash. Give it to me. Alex spreads out his hands.
C: AALEX
D: Vic, Vic -- The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.
C: VICTOR
D: The. cops are about to drive up your street. He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.
C: ALEX
D: (through teeth clenched
C: WITH PAIN)
D: There's nothing here to.give you.
C: VICTOR
D: Where is it? He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away. The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.
N: ALEX " Believe me -- I swear to God, I DON'T -- Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He has to push the words out through aâ¢coughing spasm.
C: VICTOR
D: I refuse to die in a fucking prison clinic! Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses it on the floor.
N: 205 CONTINUED: (2) He puts his arm around victor's waist and helps him to the sofa.
C: ALEX
D: Come on, this is pitiful. Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his throat and desperately draws in air.
C: ALEX
D: What a mess. He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor. Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances. He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours a glass.
N: ALEX (QUIETLY) At least you got to die in your own clothes, Vic. That's something.
S: 206 EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
N: A few Truckers make remarks as Gabriella walks toward the bank of phones. "Hey, pretty lady." "Possibility?" "She's not your type." She doesn't mind swinging her hips a little for their benefit.
S: 207 INT. CONDO - NIGHT

D: He has a boat, Alex! It's on the boat. The dumb shit wants to turn it over to the cops. You know what'll happen to me. Alex is taking his passport out of his desk.
C: ALEX
D: Just tell me how to find you. He opens another drawer. There's a gun inside.
S: 209 INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
N: Jason comes out of the men's room. He doesn't see Gabriella for a moment. A couple of truckers block his view. Now he catches sight of her. She's coming from the direction of the phones, a can of soda in her hand. Their eyes meet. She smiles and waves the can, hurries to meet h1m.

S: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
N: Gabriella and Jason tenderly make love in the swaying cabin.
S: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
N: On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the slips.
S: INT. BOAT - DAY
N: Jason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin hatch.
C: HIS POV
D: Alex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.
C: ALEX
D: Good morning! I brought donuts. Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the boat, his arms around his ribs.
C: ALEX
D: Oh, it's not as bad as all that.
C: JASON
D: She fucking called you.
N: 214 CONTINUED: Alex shrugs.
C: ALEX
D: She has some residual loyalty, yeah.
N: (MODESTLY) Which I didn't expect either. Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.
C: ALEX
D: Where are we going?
C: JASON
D: I'm going fishing. Get off if you want.
C: ALEX
D: No, it's a beautiful day for a boat ride. Give us a chance to talk. He makes himself comfortable.
C: JASON
D: Then make yourself useful and cast off the stern line. Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow line.
C: ALEX
D: This one?
C: JASON
D: There's not a lot of choice. Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.
C: ALEX
D: -- If we could manage to ignore the personal history here, I think we could work something out between us. Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.
C: ALEX
D: You want Gabriella? This is the way to have her. Life costs, Jason. Love costs. And you love her more than I do.
N: (MORE) 214 CONTINUED: (2)
C: ALEX
D: (as Jason glances at
E: CONT'D
C: HIM)
D: So stake yourself to a life together. Give her what she needs --
C: (SEEING GABRIELLA
D: before Jason does) -- Hi, honey. Gabriella comes up onto deck. She glances bewildered at the ocean around them.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Why are we --
C: JASON
D: -- Shut up! Just shut up! She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.
C: ALEX
D: He's feeling like you let him down. .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL hitting the waves substitute for conversation.
S: 215 EXT. BOAT - DAY (LATER) -215
N: Jason finishes setting the lines.
C: JASON
D: -- Okay. I'm ready to listen. He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella, who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.
N: JASON (TO GABRIELLA) Alex wants to make me an offer. She gives no sign of having heard him.
C: ALEX
D: We're giving you a hard choice, Gabby. Two rich men. Gabriella swivels her head slowly.
C: GABRIELLA
D: I don't want either one of you. A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.
N: 215 CONTINUED:
C: JASON
D: Something's going to bite, just
N: ABOUT -- (his biceps tightening) -- now. And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it. Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in a little, making the line taut, testing the weight. He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to the surface a big, dark green fish. _
C: ALEX
D: Jesus! What the hell is that?
C: JASON
D: Hammerhead. Young. Male. Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Help him, Alex.
C: ALEX
D: I'd just get in his way. His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared without either of them noticing.
S: INT. CABIN - DAY
N: Alex is searching frantically.
C: JASON
D: No luck? Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand. Jason retreats a step.
E: O.S.
C: JASON
D: Is this your backup plan?
N: 216 CONTINUED:
C: ALEX
D: No.
C: JASON
D: You want it so bad, it's yours. He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.
N: ALEX (MOANING) You little prick.
S: 217 INT./EXT. CABIN - THE NECKLACE
N: skitters along the deck. The shark's body stops it from dropping out the open gate in the transom.
C: ALEX
D: scrambles toward the necklace.
C: GABRIELLA
D: Don't let him have it! He'll kill
C: USL
D: Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled, warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark continues to tear at him.
C: ALEX
D: Help me, help.mel! Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges. forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.
C: ALEX
D: You knew it wasn't dead. Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.
C: JASON
D: Mom didn't take the necklace. did.
N: Alex struggles to stay conscious.
C: ALEX
D: Then you killed her yourself. Jason slowly nods.
C: JASON
D: And you were in the car behind us. Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying slightly.
C: GABRIELLA
D: We were supposed to turn him ini I didn't think you were going to kill him!
C: JASON
D: Well, I didn't. Alex manages to laugh.
C: ALEX
D: Jesus. You set me up. You had her call me.
N: (TO GABRIELLA) Shit... I believed you. Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.
C: JASON
D: I'll get on the radio. Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace. They look at each other.
C: JASON
D: has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course. Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses the radio.
C: JASON
D: This is Hercules II, calling the Harbormaster...
S: 218 EXT. BOAT - DAY
N: The boat heads back to port.
S: 219 EXT. DOCK - DAY
N: At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them off. CLOSER ANGLE
C: HENRY
D: You cool?
C: JASON
D: I will be.
C: HENRY
D: See ya. He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is left with Alex.
C: ALEX
D: What's your name?
E: weakly; to Henry
C: HENRY
D: No way --
C: ALEX
D: -- No, listen, listen -- this is worth a fortune. (thrusting the necklace
E: still the salesman
C: TOWARD HIM)
D: Play the possibilities.
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Good advice. And he walks away fast.
C: ALEX
D: Wait, don't go! Come back here. Come on back!
N: Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to give up hope in a hopeless situation.
