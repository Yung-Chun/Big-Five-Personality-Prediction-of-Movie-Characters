S: EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING
N: Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the air. SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of Ayatollah Khomeini. PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime. Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as bystanders than peacekeepers. A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH. An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.
S: EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING
N: From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of the protest. There are three primary buildings on campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE. We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.
S: INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING

N: Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate and makes it to the other side. And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot.

A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to the front of the protest -- WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal. As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate CLOSED -- When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed PISTOL in his clothes. More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet to the other side, one after another. ARGO - Final 3.

On the ground: discarded banners from the protest, fliers and newspapers. We see something that looks like BLOOD on the street. ARGO - Final 10. They walk west. They're hurrying but taking care not to run. The five can hear the gunfire and shouting in Farsi. They walk up the street, away from the sounds of the protest, instinctively grouping together.

An open area of desks where Woodward and Bernstein might be spilling coffee on their thick 70s ties. Papers and files everywhere. Trash emptying happens only once a week. Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays. Everything is perpetually a mess. And typewriters. The constant percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome that beats out the day here.

You need a producer.

E: CONT'D
C: SIEGEL
D: The way this looks to me -- through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them.

D: Do you know that every ... J, don't. day...
C: J STAFFORD
D: ... every day they catch another friend of the shah at the airport. Kangaroo trials then firing squads. Just for having American names in their phone books. He puts the Iranian newspaper in front of Mendez.
C: J STAFFORD
D: You've been here an hour and you're asking us to trust you with our lives, Mr. --
C: MENDEZ
D: Harkins.
C: J STAFFORD

C: MENDEZ
D: No.
N: ARGO - Final 71. J Stafford nods, as if this has proven a point. He gs back into the living room, followed by Kathy.

D: Don't do this, J... ... the part where we say, That's so crazy it just might work'? C'mon...
C: BOB ANDERS
D: I saw it in Burma. They get people out. They know how.
C: J STAFFORD
D: Snitches in banana republics. They get them over the border after the coup...
C: BOB ANDERS J STAFFORD
D: That's your opinion. ... pay the guards at the crossing a hundred bucks to look the other way...
C: MARK LIJEK
D: His opinion got us out of the embassy in the first place.
N: ARGO - Final 72.
S: EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT
C: MENDEZ
D: If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a
N: DANGER --
C: TAYLOR
D: Pat and I discussed it. If they catch you at the airport, they come here and we go on trial for harboring the enemy. It's a risk we took. Can you pull this off?
E: after a moment
C: MENDEZ
D: I don't know.
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -
N: NIGHT
C: J STAFFORD
D: -- even if they do. They find us here, we're not lying, we're just hiding. We go out there with fake passports, we're spies, period, execution.
C: CORA LIJEK
D: So how long do we stay? A month? A year?
C: J STAFFORD
D: That man out there, he's got bad cards, he's gonna lose. If he loses, it's our lives.

N: NIGHT
C: MENDEZ
D: Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you. Mendez, now dressed to leave, is handing each Houseguest an envelope.
C: MENDEZ
D: What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope. A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it.
C: MENDEZ
D: When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed.
S: INT. SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT
N: A TELEFAX MACHINE spells out a message, letter by letter: MR KEVIN HARKINS - CARE OF HOTEL SHERATON.
S: INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tony is PREPPING the CANADIAN PASSPORTS -- expertly copying Farsi stamps with a small sharpened stick. A KNOCK on the door. Tony hides the passports. Answers the door.

T: CUT TO:
N: ARGO - Final 74.
S: INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mendez takes a small 1978 model radio out of his suitcase. He unscrews the casing and from inside takes out what looks like a 6-inch transistor board for the radio. On either side of the board: telephone jacks. He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them into the jacks on the transistor board. It's a phone scrambler.
C: MENDEZ
D: The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.'
E: V.O.
S: INT. SHERATON ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Mendez, on the phone --
C: MENDEZ

E: reading the telefax
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: O'Donnell on the phone.
C: O'DONNELL
D: They called your bluff.
C: MENDEZ
D: Or maybe they're cooperating.
C: O'DONNELL
D: N.E. says absolutely not. Seven Americans walking the bazaar, you're asking for a riot, it's the
N: HIVE --
C: MENDEZ
D: Seven Canadians, Jack.
C: O'DONNELL
D: Never give them multiple shots at a cover. Are they even ready?
N: ARGO - Final 75.
C: MENDEZ
D: They're getting there.
C: O'DONNELL
D: Terrific. There's no prize for Most Improved.'
N: MENDEZ (ESCALATING) I don't have a choice. We say no, they come to the residence and pull everyone out at gunpoint. How do you think the covers hold up with their fingernails pulled out?
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Mark Lijek is studying pages from the envelope Tony gave him. J Stafford is sitting near him, having a drink, watching Iranian State Television footage of the Ayatollah. J Stafford translates out loud.
C: J STAFFORD
D: We are a nation of 35 million and... many of these people are looking forward to martyrdom. Kathy Stafford looks into the room. J stops talking, looks up.
N: J STAFFORD (TO KATHY) Five minutes? He smiles at her. Kathy, who looks like she hasn't been sleeping, nods and leaves. J takes a drink. After a MOMENT --
C: J STAFFORD
D: She pleaded with me. Mark, looking to J. This is new.
C: J STAFFORD
D: When it started in the streets nine months ago. She begged for us to leave. She packed our bags. I said, A little longer.' And what I was thinking was, This is a good thing for me. Stay. Show Newsom you've got the balls. Grab for the ring.'
N: (MORE) ARGO - Final 76. J STAFFORD (CONT'D) (A BEAT) I think we're gonna die here.
S: INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS (AMIR ABAD DISTRICT) - DAY
N: The feeling here is dangerous. Young men carrying automatic weapons casually. Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary Committee security official. There are RECONSTRUCTED EMBASSY PICTURES ON THE WALL. We see the FAMOUS PICTURES OF THE HOSTAGES BEING MARCHED DOWN THE STEPS.
S: 197A INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 197A
N: A Kafka-esque stairway. We see a YOUNG KOMITEH call up from the bottom and head up the stairs. JUMP CUT TO: one flight to go. Now on the level WITH CAMERA, we carry him INTO the office as he hands off the ARGO script and STUDIO SIX BUSINESS CARD. Khalkali has some words in Farsi for the young man.
S: EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - MORNING
N: Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one depicting an EXOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAAR -- in the light.
C: CORA LIJEK

D: You said a day to learn your covers then straight to the airport.' You said that.
C: BOB ANDERS
D: They suspect something?
N: ARGO - Final 77.
C: MENDEZ
D: What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up --
C: J STAFFORD
D: We won't do it.
C: MARK LIJEK
D: He told them there were six of us. They're expecting six.
N: J STAFFORD (TO MENDEZ) You are about to show the only card we're holding. Which is that they don't know we're here.
C: MENDEZ
D: I'm asking you to trust me.
C: J STAFFORD
D: I don't trust you.
C: BOB ANDERS
D: What's the alternative? This is the ball game, J. What world are you living in?
E: fed up, to J
C: J STAFFORD
D: The one where they're hanging people from construction cranes, Bob. J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the others. After a moment --
N: MARK LIJEK (TO MENDEZ) So we'll see you at two?
S: INT. CARPET FACTORY - MORNING
N: A KOMITEH BOSS inspects the work of the CARPET WEAVER KIDS -- whose numbers have grown into the HUNDREDS -- as they labor quietly. Some HEADSHOTS are in various stages of repair. ARGO - Final 78. Dozens of documents are now complete, sitting on the floor in rows. Some pages from the EMBASSY MUG BOOK are now re-assembled. The boss picks one of the pages up: meticulously worked so that text and photos are now intact.
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY
C: PAT TAYLOR
D: This one. She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin, which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making subtle efforts to disguise themselves.
C: CORA LIJEK
D: (at a mirror, quoting
C: INSTRUCTIONS)
D: So don't be recognizable, but look exactly like your passport picture.
C: MARK LIJEK
D: Not that picture. You won't want to scare them. A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety. J and Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting reading newspapers while the other Houseguests prep for the scout. The PHONE starts ringing.
C: PAT TAYLOR
D: Hello? A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.
E: answering the phone
C: PAT TAYLOR
D: No, there's no one like that here. She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the touch.
C: BOB ANDERS
D: Who was it? Pat shakes her head.
C: ON J STAFFORD
D: listening. Kathy takes his hand.
N: ARGO - Final 79. KATHY STAFFORD (TO J) Somebody knows.
S: INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAY
N: Tony getting dressed. Thinking. He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of a man talking fast in Farsi.
S: EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY
N: It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.
C: MENDEZ
D: This one, how much? One day, how much?
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY
N: Four of the Houseguests are waiting on the couch, dressed in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie scout crew. Cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her shirt. They turn when they see Tony come in the door. Tony as he steps down into the living room, down the hall
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: ... to find J Stafford sitting at the table. They are badly shaken.
C: MENDEZ
D: I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow.
C: J STAFFORD
D: I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.
C: MENDEZ
D: My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy.
N: ARGO - Final 80.
S: INT. MINIVAN - DAY
N: Mendez, in the driver's seat, looks at the house, then at his watch. He starts up the van, filled with four of the Houseguests. Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back doors open. J and Kathy Stafford board.
S: EXT. TEHRAN - DAY
N: Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows. There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and- stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place right in their way. They stop at the demonstration, then realize people aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street. Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd -- chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS. They finally get through and pull away. With the demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain their focus.
C: MENDEZ
D: Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows.

N: ARGO - Final 81.
S: EXT. STREET NEAR THE BAZAAR - DAY
N: The minivan double-parks on Musavi Street. Taxis, men loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup trucks, chaos. A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid- 20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of Guidance. Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a narrow street toward the bazaar.
S: EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY
N: Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys. Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers, fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like Bourbon Street. Bob Anders walks toward the front.
C: REZA
D: You are the director?
C: BOB ANDERS
D: Yes.
N: REZA (PLEASANT) Is this film a foreign bride film?
C: BOB ANDERS
D: I'm sorry?
C: REZA
D: A film where a foreign bride is brought to Iran, but she dsn't understand the language and customs and there are misunderstandings and laughs.
C: BOB ANDERS
D: No.
N: ARGO - Final 82.
C: REZA
D: Mmmm. Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley of the bazaar.
E: not happy with that
N: MENDEZ (QUIET) Mike?
C: LEE SCHATZ
D: Yeh.
E: not looking up
C: MENDEZ
D: If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again.
C: LEE SCHATZ
D: Yep.
C: ANGLE
D: Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand. The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off one by one like a sniper.
S: EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE (TEHRAN) - DAY
N: Two sedans turn onto the property and head up the driveway. Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one of the cars. He's joined by a couple other OFFICIALS and by two armed REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS. Sahar is moving through the garden, she sees the men approach. She gs to greet them at the gate.
C: SAHAR
D: (Farsi, from behind
C: THE GATE)
D: Yes?
N: ARGO - Final 83.
S: INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY
N: Reza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero. BAZAARIS stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching the visitors. Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout, takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so. He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi at her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the Shopkeeper. REZA (TO KATHY) He wants the photograph you took.
C: MENDEZ
D: She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.
C: REZA
D: He says he did not give you permission to take a photograph of his store. Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather. Kathy holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.
C: KATHY STAFFORD
D: He can have the photograph. Tell
N: HIM -- The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand.

S: INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY
N: People are now starting to surround Mendez and Reza and the Houseguests. Bazaaris more and more heated. Women in chadors are screaming and finger-pointing. ANGRY MAN (IN ENGLISH) America NO!... NO! Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with his hand.
C: LEE SCHATZ
D: He's saying the Shah killed his son with an American gun. Cauldron heating up and --
E: quiet, to Mendez

D: Khalkali eyes Sahar, gauging her. She hides her fear well.
N: KHALKALI (FARSI) Sister, those who are with him, Rasool of Allah, we are tender among ourselves. (BEAT) But stern against the kuffar.
C: SAHAR
D: As god wills it.
N: KHALKALI (QUOTING MOSSADEGH) But those who sit silently have sinned. Ds he know? Ds he not know? Is he trying to trick her? His opacity makes it impossible to know. He holds his look to her -- and she holds hers.
S: INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY
N: Reza indicates an exit to the street.
S: INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE -
C: DAY
D: -- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost shaming these men --
C: SAHAR
D: Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran. Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.
N: ARGO - Final 86.
S: INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY
N: The CROWD heckles the Houseguests as they walk toward the exit.
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - DAY
N: Sahar calmly closes the door. After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden scared. Maybe she tears up. Either way, it's clear she knows the stakes of the game she is playing.
S: INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON
N: The aftermath. The Houseguests, badly shaken, come inside. Each dealing with shock and adrenaline. Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once, Taylor's ambassadorial calm is breaking.
C: TAYLOR
D: They drew you out there to take your picture.
C: MENDEZ
D: Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside.
N: TAYLOR (SOBERED NOW) And tomorrow? A beat on Mendez, who stamps out his cigarette and follows.
C: MENDEZ
D: Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.
N: THEN -- 223-224 OMITTED 223-224 ARGO - Final 87.
S: 224A MONTAGE - EXT. TEHRAN - DUSK 224A
N: The call to prayer echoing as night falls in Tehran. In an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of Khomeini. On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the care of his eight-year-old brother, watches a pickup truck of armed komiteh speed past.
S: 224B INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT 224B
N: Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob Anders' face. It feels late. The Houseguests are tired, sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves rolled up, drilling them. The ARGO STORYBOARDS are scattered around the room.
C: MENDEZ
D: Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
C: ANDERS
D: Vancouver.
C: MENDEZ
D: Where were you born?
C: BOB ANDERS

D: Uh... High and Dry.
C: MENDEZ
D: Who paid for the movie?
N: J STAFFORD C.F.D.C.
C: MENDEZ
D: What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper.
C: MENDEZ
D: He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated --
C: MENDEZ
D: They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your rÃ©sumÃ© so well that you don't flinch.
C: J STAFFORD
D: (nearly defeated,
C: LOOKING AWAY)
D: You think your little story will matter when there's guns to our heads?
C: MENDEZ
D: My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the rÃ©sumÃ© back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this.
N: ARGO - Final 89. 224B CONTINUED: (2) 224B
C: MENDEZ
D: Let's go again.
S: 224C INT. CIA - THE PIT - AFTERNOON 224C
N: O'Donnell, walking toward his office. It's the first time today Malinov has seen him. MALINOV (GOOD NEWS) They made it through the location scout. O'Donnell ignores him. He gs straight to his office. Looking like he's seen a ghost.
S: 224D EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT 224D
N: Mendez, finishing a cigarette outside. We might hear the distant sound of a phone ringing. Ken Taylor emerges. Waits a beat.

T: OFFICE - CROSS-CUTTING - NIGHT
N: Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone in Ken Taylor's home office. As soon as he ds --
C: O'DONNELL
D: Go to black on green. Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.
C: MENDEZ
D: What is it?

C: O'DONNELL
D: It all just changed. They called the game. You've got to come back. ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.
C: O'DONNELL
D: Joint Chiefs are planning a military rescue of the hostages in a month. Delta Force started training to storm the grounds. So if the six of them get brought down there, they won't be held for long.
E: quiet, fast, clear
C: MENDEZ
D: I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.
C: O'DONNELL
D: It's over, Tony.
C: MENDEZ
D: They will be taken. Probably not
N: ALIVE --
C: O'DONNELL
D: LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's changed. Six Americans get pulled out of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed, it's another world outrage. Six Americans get caught playing movie make-believe with the CIA at the airport and executed, it's a national embarrassment. They're calling the operation.
C: MENDEZ
D: We're responsible for those people.
N: O'DONNELL (GENUINELY SAD) What we are is required to follow orders. I'm sorry. Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver. ARGO - Final 91. 224F CONTINUED: (2) 224F Then, very suddenly, he looks at an old coffee cup near him and backhands it off his desk.

D: I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest.
E: after a beat

C: NIGHT
D: Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts them down on a table. Music plays on a record player.
C: BOB ANDERS
D: Scorched earth policy tonight. Nothing gets left. Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at Tony.
C: MENDEZ
D: So you know.
N: TAYLOR (NODS) ExtAff wants you to burn the passports before you leave. Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.
C: TAYLOR

N: (A BEAT) (MORE) ARGO - Final 92.

E: to J Stafford
S: EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - DAWN
N: Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
