S: INT. OLD FASHIONED STAGE
N: Circa 1900. A white man in a top hat introduces the final act of a black face performance.
C: TOP HAT MAN
D: In the spirit of true minstrelsy, you have again shown that laughter is the wine of life.
N: Some 50 performers stand and break out into song. Roll credits to the music. An average American teenage boy begins to speak. His name is JOLIE.
C: JOLIE
D: All my life, my parents have told me I'm smart and talented. That I can be anything I wanna be when I grow up. Getting into the West Branch Magnet Program was supposed to be some kinda honor. They probly thought I'd grow up to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or scientist that cures cancer and junk. I mean for me school has always been a breeze.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOL - CIRCA 1990
N: Now in the mid-90s, for our story present day.
C: JOLIE
D: But when I look around, I just feel surrounded by dorks.
E: V.O.
N: Angle on an old school hoop on the horizon. A kid silouettes against the sky lays the ball in.
C: JOLIE
D: All I want, is to be like the kids on varisty, who live in the Maple Ave towers.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MAPLE AVE TOWERS - DAY
N: A part of a suburban neighborhood lines with huge apartment buildings.
C: JOLIE
D: The maple ave kids are coming up from nothing. I mean, their only shot at college is balling. And they've got girls blowing up their pagers twenty-four seven.
E: V.O.
N: Black kids play ball apartment buildings towering over them.
S: INT. BASKETBALL GYM
N: The young naive face of Jolie in the midst of tryout.
C: JOLIE
D: I pray to God I make varsity. I'd do anything to be like the Maple Ave. kids.
E: V.O.
N: Montage of tryout - Jolie the olny white kid among them. Suicide drills. Push ups. Machine gun defensive stand exercises. Scrimmaging. Jolie is just a breath behind everyone at pretty much all of them. And now Jolie is at the line. A classic american basketball tryout drill. Miss and you run. All the players but Jolie watch from the baseline. Jolie lines up his shot carefully. He glaces at the coach who holds a clipboard. Jolie fires. For a split second it's dead on but then it bricks wildly. The kids take off running.
C: COACH
D: That was terrible.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Sounds of a high pace video game begin. JOLIE, in his tighty-whities, plays Sonic on a Sega Genesis. Also on the bed, black girl HENRIETTA AARONSON tries to do her homework.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Do you think you're gonna make varsity?
N: Jolie drops his controller and tears up.
C: HENRIETTA
D: School is so wack.
N: Jolie composes himself.
C: JOLIE
D: I support you no matter what. But I can't be changin' no diapers.
N: Henrietta looks defeated. Jolie pauses Sonic. Curls up with her.
C: JOLIE
D: I've been fucking Henrietta for a while. She's the best. She's pregnant with someone else's baby but I'm cool with that. In fact, I think that's why I like her so much. She's kinda thugged out.
E: voice over, whisper
N: Jolie rubs her stomach.
C: JOLIE
D: Your stomach's smooth.
N: Henrietta pops up.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Not now Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: I think you look more beautiful like this than anything. I wish you could be this way forever. We'd be so happy like this.
N: A drop of sweat runs down Henrietta's face and lands on a sheet of paper full of algebra equations.
C: JOLIE
D: I love you.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Jolie, now clothed, bounds down the stairs with bookbag and basketball.
C: JOLIE
D: Hey, Mr. Aaronson.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Hey.
E: emerging from kitchen
C: JOLIE
D: You got my check?
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Shit man, those hours really add up, hun?
N: Mr. Aaronson grabs his checkbook off the top of the TV and heads to the kitchen.
C: JOLIE
D: I guess.
N: Jolie flips on the TV and catchs a little of the OJ Simpson trial.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta's adopted. She lives in a big house like me. Her parents pay me to tutor her in geometry. She's kind of an outcast. I think that's why we click. Plus, our moms both work for the same law firm. They fly all over the country doing somethin'.
E: V.O
N: Mr. Aaronson flips off the TV.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: What a mess... So, how do you think she's doing? Is she gonna pass?
C: JOLIE
D: Uh, I don't know. Maybe.
E: STUMBING
N: Mr. Aaronson tenses up, then relaxes again and hands over the check.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: I don't get it. She was always a great student.
C: JOLIE
D: ...you know... Geometry's a hard thing. Algebra leads to it and if you dont get that then-
E: searching for word
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Yeah yeah I guess so. Well, you do what you can.
E: INTERUPTING
C: JOLIE
D: Yea.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Peace out.
C: JOLIE
D: Thanks.
S: EXT. WEST BRANCH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: The bells RINGS. Ethnic murals line some of the walls, others are just the old school red brick.
C: JOLIE
D: My great great grandfather was a famous black face performer.
E: V.O.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Changing classes. Kids of all shapes, sizes and colors. Jolie emerges among them.
C: JOLIE
D: They used to call him the greatest performer of all time. But now. Kids at school have never even heard of him. I mean not even magnet kids in AP history have heard of him.
S: INT. AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM
N: Jolie and his best friend HAROON are in the back. Haroon's a scrawny Afghan boy with glasses. Haroon glances at his bulky calculator watch and raises his hand.
C: HAROON
D: Hey, can I be excused for the Million Man March?
C: JOLIE
D: Hey, can I use the bathroom?
N: The teacher MR. MCCARTY already has the passes raised.
S: INT. YELLOW HALLWAY
N: Empty except Jolie and Haroon.
C: HAROON
D: Dude, don't they post who made the team today?
C: JOLIE
D: Naw, not till Monday they said.
C: HAROON
D: Alright man, have a good day at school.
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah right.
C: HAROON
D: See ya.
N: They smack a secret handshake and Haroon exits. Alone, Jolie looks longingly out the window.
C: JOLIE
D: Lucky bastards.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT
N: Haroon waves good-bye to Jolie. Minority kids are hopping into cars with their march signs, psyched to be getting out of school.
C: JOLIE
D: This sucks. All the minorities get an excused absence for the Million Man March.
E: voice over, whisper
N: An almost white looking kid enters the frame.
C: JOLIE
D: But me, I'm stuck in school like a bama.
E: V.O.
N: Haroon waves a last goodbye from his Nissan Saturn.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
N: Jolie - still looking enviously out the window.
C: JOLIE
D: I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. Fuck.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - DAY
N: Henrietta rocks out to her walk-man while jamming on some homework. Jolie's in his underwear again playing Sonic.
C: JOLIE
D: I'm supposed to tutor Henrietta every Sunday. She's getting an F in math. She knows how to do it though. She's flunking on purpose.
E: V.O.
N: Jolie looks back at Henrietta and smiles to himself.
C: JOLIE
D: She's so gangster.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM - LATER
N: Jolie, clothed, bounds down the steps again, this time two at a time.
S: EXT. TOWN ESTABLISHING SHOTS
N: Suburban homes with large apartments towers in the background. The school is in the more urban part of town.
S: EXT. WESTBRANCH SCHOOL GYM
N: The doors spray-painted "thug life."
S: EXT. WEST BRANCH HS TRACK AND FIELD
N: Jolie and Haroon sit on the hill doing homework.
C: HAROON
D: Hey you heard Fransisco got arrested?
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. BLAIR BLAZER GYM
N: FRANCISCO, bare chested, struggles against a security guard. He looks directly into the camera.
C: FRANSISCO
D: I'm innocent, this is bull shit!
N: BACK TO:
S: EXT. CRUMBLING CONCRETE BLEACHERS - THAT MOMENT
C: HAROON
D: Over some pictures on the Internet.
N: Jolie looks confused.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh you mean like netscape?
E: O.S.
C: HAROON
D: Yea.
E: LAUGHS
N: Haroon gets up to leave.
C: HAROON
D: Yo dont forget I need my computer homework back by Monday.
C: JOLIE
D: I got you. Dont forget to get me my bio homework back.
C: HAROON
D: Yea duh.
N: The walk into the distance.
C: JOLIE
D: My great great grandfather had a song, Hallelujah I'm a Bum. Tupac had a song, I'd Rather Be an N.I.G.G.A., so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day. I always thought they were really similar.
E: voice over, whisper
S: INT. WEST BRANCH BIO CLASS - LATER
N: Haroon and Jolie in identical poses.
C: HAROON
D: Yo. I gotta take a massive dump, will you guard the door while I'm in there.
C: JOLIE
D: Yea.
N: They raise their hands - again in identical positions.
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Haroon in the stall taking a dump. Jolie at the urinal - simultaneously pounding a Sunkist and taking a whiz.
C: HAROON
D: I'm taking the most epic shit. Oh! Dude! Don't they post who made the team today?
N: Jolie looks suddenly worried. It dawns on him. He rushes off.
C: HAROON
D: Don't forget I need my computer homework back? Jolie!?
S: INT. D HALL
N: Jolie rushes toward the camera.
C: JOLIE
D: As a white boy at West Branch I'm just not cool.
E: V.O.
N: He's zeroing in on a wall full of sports posters - at it's center a golden piece of paper labled "THE TEAM."
C: JOLIE
D: But making the team would change my life forever.
E: VO
N: Jolie looks down the list.
C: JOLIE
D: It's my one shot to fit in with the Maple Ave kids. To actually be somebody!
E: V.O.
N: Jolie's face brightens. Jolie walks past it and does a double take. It's the list. CLOSE ON JOLIE'S EYES: pure intensity. He stands motionless, holding his breath, reading. Then leans back, covering his dropped jaw.
C: JOLIE
D: Making the team, felt like the most important thing in my life.
E: voice over, whisper
N: Jolie takes off running down the hall past a mop leaning against the wall.
C: JOLIE
D: As a white boy I just didn't fit in, not in Takoma Park. But now...
E: voice over, whisper
N: Jolie becomes a black silhouette against a row of windows.
C: JOLIE
D: I was practically black.
E: voice over, whisper
S: EXT. SPARSE WOODS - DAY
N: Jolie, in his gold Webber jersey, hops in the woods. He wears large purple ankle weights, and "Jump Soles" (clunky and clumsy looking work out shoes).
C: JOLIE
D: I even ditched class to work on my hops.
E: voice over, whisper
N: Exhausted, Jolie gathers his basketball and backpack and leaves. A metro train roars past in the background.
S: INT. JOLIE'S JUNKY BASEMENT - NO WINDOWS
N: Jolie is bench pressing and Haroon is spotting. A single florescent fixture hangs overhead.
C: HAROON
D: Man, I can't believe you made the team.
N: Jolie finishes his set. Pops up.
C: JOLIE
D: I was the last bama on the list! If Francisco hadn't been arrested I'd still be a loser! I'd be just another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in the Blair High School Magnet.
N: CLOSE ON HAROON: his face slowly falls.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh hey, can your mom give you a ride home later. There's something I gotta do.
C: HAROON
D: Oh... Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
N: They rotate positions - we see that Jolie has only been lifting 5 lb. weights.
C: JOLIE
D: 2.5's right?
C: HAROON
D: Yeah.
N: Jolie leans down on the bar and grins to himself - still on cloud nine.
S: EXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK - DAY
N: A shiny cherry-red '93 Nissan Quest approaches.
C: JOLIE
D: Tupac. Biggie. Snoop Dog. Easy-E. Dr. Dre. Suge Knight. Mr. T.
E: voice over, whispering
N: The Quest pulls to the curb - Jolie and his Dad inside.
C: JOLIE'S DAD
D: Alright bye. No injuries.
N: Jolie hops out in black and red basketball gear - black headband, black Jordans, even black socks.
C: JOLIE
D: Alright, bye Dad.
N: A clunker 90s cell phone rings. Jolie's Dad answers.
C: JOLIE'S DAD
D: Hey, you back from the hill? What happened?
S: EXT. SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS
N: Henrietta sits alone on a stump listening to her Walkman. Jolie bounds down a path startling her.
C: HENRIETTA
D: It smells like dog shit in these woods, Jolie. Why'd you want to meet out here anyway?
N: Jolie chokes up.
C: JOLIE
D: Wow. That is pretty bad. It smells like a dead mouse or something.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You dont want to be seen with me do you? Cus I'm pregnant.
C: JOLIE
D: ...what? No.
N: Henrietta softens.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You wanna make out with me?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea but, I can't. Not no more. We can't be hanging out any more. You understand though right?
C: HENRIETTA
D: ...Why?
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta, I told you. I made the basketball team. I'm a Blazer now.
N: Henrietta looks crest fallen.
C: JOLIE
D: L...
N: Jolie hacks up some spit.
C: JOLIE
D: Look. If I make the NBA I'm gonna take care of you and your baby. We're gonna live in a big house in Potomac. Be rich, have maids. That's the reason I'm doing this. Can't you see that? Can't you be happy for me?
E: CONT'D
N: Henrietta shakes her head in utter disappointment. She drops Jolie's basketball and walks off. Pregnant, her ass might be a little bigger than before. Then she stops and turns. Jolie spins his basketball on one finger.
C: JOLIE
D: Do you need a token for the bus or some junk?
N: Crushed, Henrietta leaves. Jolie watches her descend through a romantic archway of brush - a blacktop and basketball hoop in the distance.
C: JOLIE
D: I felt bad but,
E: VOICE OVER
N: Jolie darts up the hill - basketball in hand.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta had rich white parents. And after I made the team
E: CONT'D VOICE OVER
N: CLOSE ON: his black shoes and socks.
C: JOLIE
D: I realized, compared to me she wasn't thugged out at all. She was just bad at Algebra.
E: CONT'D VOICE OVER
N: Jolie disappears into the woods.
C: JOLIE
D: For a while I was worried her Dad, Mr. Aaronson, would be mad.
E: CONT'D VOICE OVER
N: Jolie runs past a jungle gym with a little boy hanging from the monkey bars.
C: JOLIE
D: But he was cool. He even offered me 20 bucks to mow the lawn. So, everything worked out.
E: CONT'D VOICE OVER
N: Jolie jogs past a pregnant woman.
C: JOLIE
D: I guess.
E: VOICE OVER
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT (BUT NO WINDOWS)
N: The blazers dress after practice, everyone chatting among the many aisles. But Jolie is all alone in an aisle by himself. Jolie slams the locker door.
S: INT. BASKETBALL GYM - NIGHT
N: Jolie is deep on the bench. The acoustics are bad. The semi full bleachers fill the space with echoes. The crowd is various shades of black. A lot of them have their feet kicked up. Classic red versus blue. The action on the court is fast paced. The players are disciplined, setting screens and running concrete plays. WENDEL, a guard, pulls up for a shot - swish. The cheerleaders get excited. The home score flashes red and reappears as 86 to 52. A blow out. The team of Blair Blazers sit together, their heads moving in unison, following the action. At the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie. ARIUS, covered in sweat, is a tall thin, care-free, light-skinned black kid. He has a huge scar on his head, a thick red headband and band- aids over his earrings. Jolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit.
C: ARIUS
D: Now it comes with two free controllers and the game.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh yeah.
E: not paying attention
C: ARIUS
D: Yeah. We were playing that joint at my place and one of the cheerleaders was all confessing how cute she thinks you are.
C: JOLIE
D: Which one?
E: EXCITED
C: ARIUS
D: (points to the cheerleader
C: BENCH)
D: Christine Ortanyez.
N: Jolie focuses in on a particularly cute Panamanian cheerleader - CHRISTINE ORTANYEZ. JOLIE POV: slow motion of Christine - taps her palms and does a leg kick then looks directly at us.
C: COACH DALE
D: Jolie!
N: Jolie flinches. Coach Dale - in afine suit and gold rimmed glasses - glares.
C: COACH DALE
D: Get Pistol.
E: CONT'D
N: Jolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic. The shirt gets stuck over his head, then he trips over his pants. His teammates look on with various expressions of concern and laughter. A cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Unsnap it!
E: O.S.
N: Struggling, Jolie frees himself. Coach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man directly behind him. Their expressions match exactly. The old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over. All the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie.
S: INT. JOLIE'S MESSY ROOM - NIGHT
N: A six foot long poster of a '91 Lamborghini Countach covers the wall. A Nerf basketball hoop hangs on the closed door. Haroon is dressed up as a woman, using a wig, socks as breasts, and a sheet as a skirt.
C: HAROON
D: Come on man, we've gotta nail the Marion Barry skit tomorrow or I'm gonna get a B in English.
C: JOLIE
D: I don't feel like it. I told you.
N: Jolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and they smash against the wall.
C: HAROON
D: Dude, it's was just a preseason game, come on.
C: JOLIE
D: Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play.
N: Jolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down. He picks up a switch blade and looks at his warped reflection.
C: HAROON
D: He tried to put you in the game.
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah, for thirty seconds.
N: There's a knock on the door. Jolie wipes a teary eye and straights up. ELLIOTT, Jolie's oddly old dad - enters with a bright orange Nerf ball off the bedside table.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Three. Two. One.
E: PUMP FAKE
N: Elliott dunks and freezes in mid air. He makes the sounds of a sold out crowd, animatedly, in a comforting way. The kids smile.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Come on, Haroon. Let's get you home.
C: JOLIE
D: Already?
N: Haroon follows him down the steps.
C: HAROON
D: Elliott, will you go over this skit with me. I think you'll really like it and I need to practice or I'm gonna get a B in...
T: There voices fade into silence.
N: Jolie stands alone, grabs a dumb bell and does a few curls. He pushes it up his bicpt with his hand so that it looks bigger.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Jolie climbs in through the window. The only light in the room comes from the Sega on pause.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I knew you'd be back.
C: JOLIE
D: Because you know I love you.
N: Jolie kissed her with lots of tongue.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Whatever.
C: JOLIE
D: What?
N: Jolie smiles.
C: JOLIE
D: You're the best. I love you forever Henrietta.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You promise.
C: JOLIE
D: I promise to God.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Are you gonna help take care of my baby?
C: JOLIE
D: I'd do anything for you.
N: Jolie turns off the TV, and in the near darkness of just a night light quietnly mounts her.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Wait. I want you to know... There's some stuff. I feel like you're the only one I can trust, the only one I can talk too. Like about when I ran away, and let those kids take photos of me. I couldn't tell anyone but you. You know that right?
C: JOLIE
D: I know. They were just photos. Everyone makes mistakes.
N: Henrietta caresses his face and they kiss.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie's stupid. He'll believe anything. But I like him. I've been failing algebra just so he can tutoring me.
E: VOICE OVER
S: EXT. HENRIETTA'S MOONLIT HOME
N: The automatic sprinkler goes off.
C: HENRIETTA
D: The thing is. He's not like other guys. I mean, he's on the team, but he's not really a cool kid. I've always hated the cool kids.
E: CONT'D
N: Jolie steps off the porch and trips on a crack in the sidewalk.
S: INT. DIMLY LIT GIGANTIC AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: The theater class is spread out, bored and chatty. In the distance a girl is practicing dance steps on stage. Christine walks down the aisle and sits next to Jolie.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hey Jolie. Have you seen this article?
N: Jolie is dressed in basketball attire - it's a game day. Christine is in her hot cheerleader uniform.
C: JOLIE
D: What? No. Lemme see.
N: She hands Jolie a newspaper. Their hands touch briefly, they lock eyes - a moment passes between them.
C: JOLIE
D: Wow. I heard Francisco got arrested but I didn't know he made the paper.
C: CHRISTINE
D: I heard he got arrested because him and a bunch of other kids banged that pregnant girl Henrietta for a dollar or something.
N: A REDHEAD dude with an orange hoody turns around with a spnoonful of green Jell-O, eating from his Tupperware bowl.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: A dollar total. Or a dollar each?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Each, I hope.
C: JOLIE
D: That's a rumor, duh. They just took photos.
E: DISTURBED
C: CHRISTINE
D: How do you know? Were you there?
C: JOLIE
D: I heard.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Believe what you want man. That chick got gang banged! Turned out by mad dudes like a straight porno scene.
N: Jolie, lost in thought. The bell rings.
S: INT. HISPANIC HALL
N: Dim. No windows. Hispanic kids line the lockers. Pants sag and Spanish is heard. One black kid from the team, Arius, looks in a locker mirror and puts on cologne. He has a gold cross and greasy hair.
C: ARIUS
D: Jolie. I heard your old girl is a straight chicken-head.
C: JOLIE
D: Who?
C: ARIUS
D: You haven't heard?
C: ARIUS
D: Heard what?
C: ARIUS
D: That Maple Ave shit. You haven't seen the porn video with your girl Henrietta?
C: JOLIE
D: I'm not with that girl man. I just tutor her in Algebra.
C: ARIUS
D: Chill brother. I'm just saying...
N: MR. APPLEBAUM overhears this.
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: What are you boys buzzing about? Maple Ave this.. Maple Ave that..
C: ARIUS
D: You can take the niggas out the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out the niggas.
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Come on Arius. I know you've got somewhere to be.
N: Still stunned by the rumor, Jolie follows the steady flow of kids out a single door to the:
S: EXT. EAST SIDE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY
N: The sun backlights the school. Jolie emerges from the school. Christine catches up to him.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Jolie, aren't you headed to computer class?
C: JOLIE
D: What? Yeah.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Is everything alright? You look kind of stunned or something.
C: JOLIE
D: What? No. I just. The sun was in my eyes.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh.
C: JOLIE
D: What's up?
C: CHRISTINE
D: I am totally struggling with my program this month, do you think I could look at your code?
C: JOLIE
D: My programming skills aren't that good. But we can copy Haroon's code and just change the variable names.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Really?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Cool. Thanks.
N: Christine gives Jolie a hug. Henrietta walks past and gives Jolie an eye. Jolie pretends not to notice. From afar the kids look like ants walking in lines to and from the portables (trailer classrooms). A school bell rings.
S: EXT. CONVENIENT STORE
N: Henrietta approaches the Redhead Grunge Kid. They're both skipping class.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Hey, can I bum a cigarette?
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Aren't you pregnant?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Whatever.
N: Henrietta rolls her eyes and starts to walk away.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Hold up. Here.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Thanks.
N: Henrietta lights up.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Fuck it, right?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yea. I guess so.
S: INT. BACK OF CLASSROOM
N: Working in groups.
C: HAROON
D: Dude, Christine's been jocking your nuts lately. What's up with that?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't know man. I think she's into me.
C: ANYA
D: She's probably just using you for my code.
C: HAROON
D: It happens to me all the time.
C: ANYA
D: You wish.
C: HAROON
D: Even if she does like you dude, you'd have to be loco to get with her.
N: Jolie looks over at Christine on the other side of the classroom. Christine smiles back.
C: HAROON
D: Her last boyfriend Raymond -
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT - SUN SET
N: Raymond, a cool Hispanic boy perched on a metal railing, cranes his head around and we see he's got a black eye and smokes a Camel.
C: HAROON
D: Has been having sex since junior high.
E: O.S., CONT'D
N: Ray hops off the railing, puts his arm around a girl and kicks over a trash can as they walk into the sunset. BACK TO:
S: INT. DIM BASEMENT CLASSROOM - THAT MOMENT
C: VLAD
D: That's nothing. Ray's been suspended three times. They found a gun in his locker. And he has no blood parents. You don't want that kind of sloppy seconds. It's big trouble.
C: JOLIE
D: Hmmm.
C: VLAD
D: You would be the man, though. I'd give you that.
C: HAROON
D: Yea, that's true. You would be the man.
C: ANYA
D: Why? What does that have to do with anything?
N: All the boys roll there eyes. IN SLOW MOTION Jolie turns to look at Christine, this time with his hoody up. Turning back he knocks his notebook off the table - papers scattering, a can of Sour Cream Pringles spilling. Christine notices the commotion, laughs kindly. He smiles back.
S: EXT. DUSTY MULTIPURPOSE FIELD - SUNSET
N: CRACK - the sound of softball being hit. The girls team warming up. Jolie and Christine sit on small metal bleachers.
C: CHRISTINE
D: You guys have the late practice today, huh?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Well Coach Dale asked me to tape the next game - you wanna see the camera we're using? It's in the small gym.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh yeah. All the way past C hall.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Come on. I know a short cut through parenting class.
C: JOLIE
D: Through parenting class? Let's just go the long way.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Come on. Don't be such a goody goody. The teacher doesn't care. Trust me. She's like a hundred years old, she gets it. It's just an excuse to have free baby sitters for all the teen moms. And that's a good thing.
N: She grabs his hand and leads him.
S: INT. PARENTING CLASSROOM
N: Jolie and Christine cut through the chaotic after school `class.' Henrietta is there, looking bored, and playing with a toy toddler. Henrietta gives Jolie a suspicious look. Jolie waves nervously.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Are you friends with her? That's the girl I was telling you about.
C: JOLIE
D: I just tutor her in Algebra. You know how we need community service hours to graduate, well...
S: INT. BLAZER GYMNASIUM
N: A mural of fire emblazons the walls. A second floor balcony - overlooking the court. A space for storing of moldy old trampolines and gymnastic junk.
C: JOLIE
D: It's hot as a mug in here.
N: Christine flips on a giant standing fan.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Stand in front of this. God that feels good.
N: Her hair and cheerleader skirt blowing back. Jolie stands next to her. Christine gracefully gets on her knees. Beat.
C: CHRISTINE
D: The camera's under here. Come on.
N: She crawls under the trampoline, through the glittery tassels hanging around it's edges. Jolie hesitates then follows but we stay behind. A pom-pom and a basketball rest in the foreground.
C: JOLIE
D: The season hadn't even started and my life had changed forever.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Just below the tassels Christine's top lands on the floor.
C: JOLIE
D: I swear, exactly when we kissed someone yelled score.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Kids of all shapes and sizes rush the court below with hockey sticks. Haroon and Vlad and Benjamin and Anya, and the Redhead Grunge Kid and Ray among them.
C: REDHEAD GRUNGE KID
D: Score! Score! Score!
C: RAY
D: Shut your hole!
C: JOLIE
D: It felt like a million bucks.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Haroon pumps his fist yes as someone gets a shot past the goalie in warm ups. Christine fixes her hair and walks out with a VHS camcorder.
C: JOLIE
D: I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but as Tu Pac says, "Only God can judge me."
E: VOICE OVER
N: Jolie stands behind, in the doorway, fixing his belt and getting a touch of wind from the fan.
C: JOLIE
D: I did wonder if Henrietta's Dad, Mr. Aaronson, even knew she was pregnant.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Jolie takes a last glimpse of the intermural floor hockey game below them.
C: JOLIE
D: But for some reason it just never came up.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Jolie ducks into the stairwell. Then all the lights go out. Blackness. Hold. Haroon walks into a small shaft of light that goes unseen until it has his face to land on.
C: HAROON
D: Would someone please stop messing around and put the lights on. This league is for serious players only.
E: OFF CAMERA
N: Haroon puts on his RoboCop goalie mask. BAM! He is body checked to the floor.
C: RAY
D: Boom! Step aside, nigga.
N: Haroon slouched against the wall - blood dripping from his temple.
C: HAROON
D: (cringing in pain, almost
C: CRYING)
D: Oww, man. I think you broke my wrist.
C: RAY
D: Tell your boy Jolie to lay off my girl Christine. Every time he makes a move on her I'm gonna eat your ass for lunch.
C: HAROON
D: What? Why me?
E: beginging to cry
S: INT. HAROON'S HOME - AFTER-SCHOOL DAY
N: Haroon, and Haroon's older brother ZEKE are rummaging the kitchen cabinets for snacks. Haroon's arm is in a cast for the rest of the movie.
C: ZEKE
D: Hey, are there anymore Handi-Snacks or did you take the last one?
N: The doorbell rings.
S: EXT. HAROON'S HOME
N: Jolie and Haroon smack their secret handshake. They cross the lawn with Zeke.
C: HAROON
D: Dude, before I show you this internet stuff at my Mom's place we gotta talk about this Raymond situation. Ray said he's gonna eat my ass for lunch every time you mess with Christine.
N: Haroon grabs a key from under the doormat of the second home.
C: JOLIE
D: Yea he's just afraid to step to me directly because he knows varsity has my back. Don't stress though. He's just a bully.
N: Haroon open the door to:
S: INT. HAROON'S DIMLY LIT SECOND HOME - DAY
N: Thick curtains are drawn, most of the place empty but a small computer station is in the corner.
C: HAROON
D: Don't stress? He broke my arm man. How is anything under control?
C: JOLIE
D: Ray is just a bully. All you have to do is hold your ground a little probably.
N: Jolie fakes like he gonna punch Haroon and Haroon flinches.
C: JOLIE
D: He'll back off.
C: HAROON
D: What? Are you serious? He blind sided me. How am I supposed to hold my ground?
C: JOLIE
D: Come on dude, isn't that why you always carry that Batman figure around?
C: HAROON
D: What?
C: JOLIE
D: Because Batman's the only superhero that is just a regular guy.
C: HAROON
D: Batman is a cartoon. This TOY is for inspiration. We're talking about real life. Are you loco?
C: JOLIE
D: Fine, then just stay close to me and the team will get your back, I swear.
C: HAROON
D: Pinky swear. No leaving me behind at lunch now that you're all tight with the team or nothing.
C: JOLIE
D: Done.
N: Haroon has fires up a video game on the PC.
C: HAROON
D: Cool. Now let's conquor titen again. I think we can break the high score.
C: ZEKE
D: Seriously.
S: INT. RUSTY OLD HIGH SCHOOL WEIGHT ROOM - DAY
N: Every kid on the team but Jolie is wearing light tan, suède Timberland boots.
C: WENDEL
D: What's up?
C: JOLIE
D: Hey.
C: ARIUS
D: What's up Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: What's up?
C: MERLY
D: What's up? What's up with you?
C: JOLIE
D: What's up?
C: CODROY
D: What's up?
C: JOLIE
D: What's up?
C: SURGIO
D: Chillen.
C: WENDEL
D: Peace, nigger.
N: Jolie pauses for a second then half smiles. Haroon's face turns red as a cherry as he "maxes" on the bench.
C: JOLIE
D: See man. Ray can't mess with us now. We're rolling too deep.
N: Haroon looks around, the whole basketball team is working out. MERLY leg presses a massive amount of weight.
C: HAROON
D: (dons his sombrero, spreading a genuine
C: SMILE)
D: Yea. I guess your right. Junior year's actually gonna be cool. And I love spirit week. Merly, did you bring a hat for hat day?
C: MERLY
D: Yea.
N: Merly stops his leg presses - pulls on a black ski-mask.
C: MERLY
D: Hey, Jolie. Want to give us a lift to Taco Bell for lunch?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea. No prob.
C: HAROON
D: Cool man.
S: EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Kids from the team pile into Jolie's Toyota Camry. Six are already in the ride, Haroon tries to squeeze in.
C: MERLY
D: You want my spot?
C: HAROON
D: Ummm. Naw. Naw. I'm cool.
C: MERLY
D: You sure?
C: JOLIE
D: Jump in the trunk dude. It's not far.
C: HAROON
D: You think so?
C: MERLY
D: That's rediculous. Let's just bring you back something? What do you want?
C: HAROON
D: Uh. Just like a couple burritos. Here's a ten?
C: MERLY
D: No worries. I got you.
C: HAROON
D: Oh thanks man.
C: MERLY
D: No prob.
N: Marly closes the door. Haroon stands alone in the parking lot in his sombrero. Jolie waves as they drive off.
C: JOLIE
D: I'll bring you some cinnamon twists too!
N: Haroon looks around and sees Ray staring at him from the top of some steps. Haroon looks scared, tips his sombrero to hide his face.
S: INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - DAY
N: Jolie drives his teammates, all eating Taco Bell. Go-go music blasting. In the rearview mirror a Cop emerges.
C: MERLY
D: The cops just followed us from the left turn only lane.
C: ARIUS
D: I knew it. Did you see his face?
C: MERLY
D: That dude is always messing with us.
S: EXT. STEEP STREET
N: The kids hang out outside the car with one of the cops. Merly with the other Cop by the cop car. The argument between Merly and the Cops escalates. Merly prevents the cops from grabbing his empty looking bookbag. Merly takes off sprinting between two of the houses. The cops hustle after him, their large belts bouncing. Jolie and the other kids stunned.
C: WENDEL
D: He's still dealing nickel bags I bet.
C: ARIUS
D: Naw man. It's because of that video. The Maple Ave thing...the one with Jolie's girl Henrietta.
C: JOLIE
D: She's not my girl.
C: ARIUS
D: That's not what she said before she started sucking everyone's dicks... Don't believe me. Y'all can see the VHS.
N: Arius pulls out his gold cain. Jolie looks intensely shocked by this offer.
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL-- MAIN OFFICE
N: The kids that were out to lunch are waiting in line getting slips for being late. The Administrator returns with PRINCIPAL GANUS, a 350 pound black man who looks like an ex-football player.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Arius. This is your fifth detention this semester. That means in-school suspension for the week. Starting now.
C: ARIUS
D: What!? Did you hear what happened to us? We got harrassed by the cops man!
N: Arius follows Ganus into the bowels of the main office. The Administrator takes another call, and the coast is suddenly clear. Jolie and Wendel scope out an escape route - the security guard no longer at the door.
C: JOLIE
D: Come on man. Coast is clear.
N: They peek into the hallway and see security round a bend. Jolie and Wendel run as quietly as possible in the opposite direction.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Wendel! Get your ass over hear.
C: WENDEL
D: What? What about Jolie?
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: He's in the magnet program. His teacher will handle it.
N: Jolie doesn't dare look back.
C: JOLIE
D: And just like that, with Marley arrested and Arius doing in-school, I might just get some playing time?
E: VOICE OVER
S: INT. TRIG CLASS
N: Haroon enters and sits next to Jolie. Haroon has double fresh black eyes. The teacher and classroom is quite and dont even pay any attention to Jolie entering.
C: HAROON
D: I thought you said Ray wasn't gonna mess with me man?
C: JOLIE
D: Woah. Dude. Are you alright?
C: HAROON
D: Do I look alright?
C: JOLIE
D: I'm sorry man.
C: HAROON
D: That's all you got?
C: JOLIE
D: No. Come on man.
C: HAROON
D: YOu said I just had to hold my ground.
C: JOLIE
D: Well at least you've still got your teeth.
C: HAROON
D: You're an asshole.
C: JOLIE
D: Let me get you back. Come to the movies with me tonight dude. The new Ice Tea flick is out. The tickets on me. Coke, popcorn, the whole nine.
N: Haroon rolls his eyes and shakes his head.
C: HAROON
D: The whole nine? It's a movie.
C: JOLIE
D: It's an Ice Tea flick and it's gonna be tight as a mug.
N: Haroon looks disgusted and offended.
S: INT. DARK GHETTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: Henrietta leans in close to Jolie's ear. They whisper to each OTHER:
C: JOLIE
D: We had an early game today against Paint Branch. And I scored 3 points.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You know I saw you with that Cheerleader.
C: JOLIE
D: Come on. Enough with that. I washed my hands already. So I can please you.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Just tell me yall are hooking up. It's OK if you are. I just want the truth.
C: JOLIE
D: You want the truth. How is this?
N: Jolie reveals a plastic case meant for baseball cards. Out of it he slides a small newspaper cut out. A picture of Francisco getting arrested with the headline `Sex Video Arrest.'
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What about it?
E: ASHAMED
C: JOLIE
D: I thought you said you didn't fuck any of them.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I didn't.
C: JOLIE
D: Did you suck their dicks?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie. It's none of your fucking business.
C: JOLIE
D: Well everyone at school says you did. And now they're saying there's a video and that's why Francisco and Merly got arrested.
C: HENRIETTA
D: They're not arrested. They got questioned and shit and then they got suspended.
C: JOLIE
D: How do you know?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Because I hear all the Maple Ave stuff.
N: Haroon pretends to watch the movie but is obviously uncomfortable.
C: HAROON
D: Shhh. It's getting good you know.
N: Henrietta and Jolie whisper more quietly.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Look, that's all beside the point. Whatever you heard about me at school, they don't know shit. It's a lie. I already told you. I ran away from home. That's it. Now leave me alone.
C: JOLIE
D: Why did you let them take pictures?
C: HENRIETTA
D: I told you. I needed money.
C: JOLIE
D: For what?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Duh, an abortion. Does that make you feel better. But I decided I want this baby Jolie. I want a real family. So I went to Pizza Hut for dinner instead. The one on University Boulevard, do you want a receipt or something?
C: JOLIE
D: Where did you sleep that night?
C: HENRIETTA
D: I told you. I slept at the ATM machine. Now stop it.
N: Henrietta is on the verge of tears and it cracks Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: Dang. I know. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot.
C: HENRIETTA
D: But I love you. I just want to be with you now. And put all that in the past.
C: JOLIE
D: Why didn't you come to me then?
C: HENRIETTA
D: We had just met.
C: JOLIE
D: I know. Damn it. You could have slept on my couch, easy. My parents wouldn't have even cared.
N: We hear a killing on the screen. They kiss. The color cast on them shifts from a blue to a red. Jolie reaches under the starter jacket that lies across her lap.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie. No.
C: JOLIE
D: You lied to me.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I didn't. I would never.
C: JOLIE
D: How do I know?
N: Henrietta guides his hand up between her legs and she closes her eyes, succumbing to his fingers.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Don't you trust me?
N: From behind them they are silhouettes against the Ice-T action pic "Surviving the Game." A baby is crying somewhere in the theater. The red light cast on them begins to flash rapidly. In and out of blackness. Jolie peaks at a boy one seat away. (Jolie's basketball is in the seat between them, with Haroon's Batman toy sitting atop it.) Henrietta breathes hard. Jolie bites his lower lip.
C: ANONOMOUS MAN
D: (O.C. yelling at the
C: SCREEN)
D: Don't mess with his boy? You're gonna get it now! Un-hun!
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
C: JOLIE
D: Haroon and I better get going. We gotta finish our Magnet project for R&E.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie, my Dad is picking us up. I thought you were gonna help me study?
C: JOLIE
D: I would but I can't. This is like the biggest project of the year.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I have a huge test tomorrow and if I don't pass this class I have to go to summer school.
C: JOLIE
D: I know but Mr. Donaldson just assigned a huge thing-
C: HENRIETTA
D: Haroon. Would you mind letting me talk to Jolie in private?
S: EXT. BEHIND THE MALL DUMPSTERS
C: HENRIETTA
D: The only time we go out is to the movies, and you're always late, and it's always the late show.
C: JOLIE
D: What are you talking about?
N: Henrietta rolls her eyes and looks upset.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie. I saw Christine was all over you at school.
C: JOLIE
D: She's just like that. She's a cheerleader.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Tell me something. What do you really want to do with your life?
C: JOLIE
D: What do I want to do?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Why do you repeat everything I say?
C: JOLIE
D: What do I wanna do? I mean, you know that, right?
C: HENRIETTA
D: You're five-eight.
C: JOLIE
D: Spud Web was five seven.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: What?
N: Henrietta's father Mr. Aaronson, rolls up in a VW van and speaks from the window.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: So what's happening kids? Haroon said you guys were talking about important stuff?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad, we're fucking studying here! Do you mind?
C: MR. AARONSON
D: In the parking lot? I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything. I made Rice Krispy treats. They're still hot.
N: He showcases a saran wrapped tray.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad, have you seen how fucking fat I am!?
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Henrietta. Just because you don't want any doesn't mean Jolie doesn't. Tutoring is hard work, after all. I tutored high school kids in Oakland in the 60's, and -
E: TO JOLIE
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad, we all know the story of you saving kids in the ghetto, ok?
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Jolie, are you hungry?
C: JOLIE
D: UH-
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie's bailing, Dad. Come on.
N: Henrietta hops into the Van.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Oh. Well. That's cool. That's cool.
N: Henrietta looks bummed. She cups her stomach and looks at it. Then scowls at Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: I'm really sorry, Mr. Aaronson, but-
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad. Just drive please.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: No worries, Jolie. Catch you later.
N: Mr. Aaronson makes the West coast gang sign as a friendly gesture as a good-bye as he drives off. Jolie and Haroon watch them leave.
S: INT. METRO - NIGHT
N: The train rumbles along.
C: HAROON
D: So you've been tutoring her in Algebra and that's it?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea.
C: HAROON
D: Whatever man.
C: JOLIE
D: What?
C: HAROON
D: I was sitting right there.
C: JOLIE
D: So?
C: HAROON
D: So man. I saw what was going on. I'm not an idiot.
N: Jolie is silent.
C: HAROON
D: You're ridiculous. I gotta jump off.
E: CONT'D
C: JOLIE
D: What? I thought we were gonna play street fighter?
C: HAROON
D: I can play dune at home on my PC.
C: JOLIE
D: What are you scared I'm gonna smoke you like a blunt again?
C: HAROON
D: You wish. You can't touch my skills.
C: JOLIE
D: I'd turn you into a straight dikfor.
C: HAROON
D: What the hell is a dikfor?
C: JOLIE
D: You don't know what a dick's for!? You fucking homo-thug!
N: Jolie jumps on the seat and shoves his crotch in Haroon's face - thrusting hard. Several passengers laugh.
C: HAROON
D: Oww! Dude, you're pealing off my scab. Get off me! You know you've been a real jerk lately.
C: JOLIE
D: Damn, Ray really smashed your face didn't he?
C: HAROON
D: I think you're an asshole for lying to Henrietta and Christine.
C: JOLIE
D: I never lied to them.
N: The metro rumbles to a stop.
C: JOLIE
D: I love them both.
E: CONT
N: Haroon exits. Jolie looks longingly out of the window as the train pulls off.
S: INT. GYMNASIUM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: POST PRACTICE:
C: COACH DALE
D: Kiss! Can anyone tell me what KISS stands for?
N: Coach Dale underlines "KISS" on the blackboard. All the bleachers are pushed in. The team gathered on the floor in practice jerseys. Five starters in white. The rest in red. All downtrodden. Wendel wipes sweat off his chin. Coach Dale eyes them down. Two dishevelled white assistant coaches flank Dale. A fat black man in a sweat-suit also hangs around, an unofficial assistant coach. ASSISTANT #1 wears a gray sweat suit. ASSISTANT #2 sports a wrinkled dress shirt and tie. Both don clip boards and red whistles. No one moves. Jolie hesitantly gestures. Coach Dale nods.
C: JOLIE
D: Uh, Keep it simple stupid.
C: COACH DALE
D: Why are you mumbling? Speak up.
C: JOLIE
D: Keep it simple stupid.
C: COACH DALE
D: That's right. Keep it simple stupid.
N: The team stares blankly.
C: COACH DALE
D: Ya'll screw up and say, "But I thought..." Kiss. Keep it simple. You guys are thinking too much on the court. Stay aggressive and maybe we'll have a chance of beating Springbrook without Francisco and Merly. We're short handed, especially at guard positions, so everyone has to be ready to play, especially you Jolie. You're as good as anybody on this team. I've seen you play great when we scrimmaged with JV. And everyone, no more bringing your stuff in a plastic bag. Get a real bag. Something canvas. Use an old backpack if you have to.
E: BEAT BEAT BEAT
S: EXT. GYMNASIUM - DUSK
N: A few boys from the team and a few girls from the cheerleader squad are hanging around a track and field practice visible in the distance.
C: JOLIE
D: Arius, man. When can I see the VHS tape you mentioned?
C: ARIUS
D: What? Oh, it got erased. Didn't you hear the cops are on to the whole thing?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah, but-
C: ARIUS
D: Man, Francisco is in the papers. You haven't seen? (turns and tugs at a
C: CHEERLEADER)
D: Come here, girl. Sit on my lap.
N: Wendel lights a cig. Jolie lays a towel over his head and turns to Wendel.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta didn't really fuck any of them, did she? I mean she was just posing nude for some photos, right?
C: WENDEL
D: Well, they just paid her to do a little strip tease or whatever but things escalated.
C: JOLIE
D: How can it just escalate?
C: WENDEL
D: How did World War 2 escalate? It just did. Someone pulled out his junk teasing her, and then she started messing around with her tongue on his balls, just laughing and stuff. And it just went from there.
C: JOLIE
D: Dude? If this is a psych, you got me. OK? Just tell me the truth.
C: WENDEL
D: I'm not lying. I'm dead serious. You can see for yourself.
C: JOLIE
D: It got erased I thought.
C: WENDEL
D: The original did. But Arius has a copy.
N: Jolie tugs on his underarm hair, worried. They look over at Arius who is daydreaming.
C: ARIUS
D: Booooom.
E: TO HIMSELF
C: WENDEL
D: Arius!
N: Arius snaps out of it.
C: WENDEL
D: What happened to your head man?
C: ARIUS
D: The doctors said I was crazy so they took a little piece of my brain out.
C: WENDEL
D: No they didn't.
C: ARIUS
D: Yes they did. Look.
N: Arius shows off the top of his head
C: JOLIE
D: Damn.
N: CLOSE ON: Arius's brutal scar in his head. Arius pushes at it with his fingers.
C: ARIUS
D: See how soft it is?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah.
N: Arius laughs. Looks around to make sure no one's listening in.
C: ARIUS
D: Come by Coach Dales office tomorrow at 3 o'clock.
E: MORE
C: ARIUS
D: While he's gone opening up the weight-room I'm showing the tape for five bucks a head. You have never seen anything like this, I promise you.
E: CONT'D
N: A yellow Geo Jeep with 5 very thugged out kids rolls up.
C: ARIUS
D: Arright y'all.
N: Arius gives them the finger from the packed with 6 Jeep as it speeds off (Geo's are equipt with only 4 seats)
S: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Everyone working away - Haroon and Jolie seated in the back with a giant stand alone magnifying glass. The teacher MR. APPLEBAUM puts a paper on Jolie's desk labeled B+, then Haroon's, labeled B-.
C: HAROON
D: B minus!? Are you serious?
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Watch the language Mister Mochtarzada.
C: HAROON
D: Did you even read this shit?
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Thin ice Haroon.
C: HAROON
D: Come on Mr. Applebaum? The whole undercover hooker bust opening in this thing is genius.
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: It's not accurate Haroon. The OJ trial didn't begin until long after the Marion Barry bust.
C: HAROON
D: Duh. Everybody knows that. It's not an Encyclopedia. It's a story.
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Haroon. This is a current events history class. I think you missed the point of the assignment.
C: HAROON
D: I think you missed the point of the story! The events were mixed up because the character is mixed up. You think I don't know -
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Enough !
N: Stunned, Haroon walks back to his desk.
C: HAROON
D: ...fucking idiot...
E: under his breath
C: MR. APPLEBAUM
D: Detention. Today.
N: The bell rings. The clock shows 3 o'clock sharp.
C: HAROON
D: Fucking dick-face man, it's not fair!
N: Haroon brushes his notebook and pencils onto the floor in frustration.
C: JOLIE
D: Shit man. I'm sorry dude. You deserved an A. It was tight as a mug.
C: HAROON
D: Don't placate me asshole. You didn't even read it like you said you would.
N: Haroon holds up his cast.
C: HAROON
D: It's just a broken arm and a couple black eye. Nothing to worry about right? Go hang with your stupid team.
N: Jolie looks at the clock as the room empties. Jolie sheepishly leaves Haroon alone with Mr. Applebaum.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Jolie walks down a packed hallway and ducks into an office door. As Coach Dale leaves his office Arius catches the door. The team slips in one by one. All hanging out nearby.
S: INT. BASKETBALL COACH OFFICE - DAY
N: Pictures and trophies are all over the cramped room, spanning decades. The team and a group of cheerleaders are hanging out waiting for the video. Arius pops the tape in.
C: ARIUS
D: Look, look, look. Look. Right here, I told you.
N: Ad-lib hollers. Some laugh.
C: ARIUS
D: I told you she was turned out.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRISTINE
D: Damn.
E: TO JOLIE
C: JOLIE
D: Aw, man.
C: ARIUS
D: Hold up, I gotta rewind to the funny part.
C: CHRISTINE
D: What a slut! That's that girl you tutor right?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea. ...Henrietta Aaronson.
E: STUNNED
C: ARIUS
D: I told you! I told you! I told you!
N: Jolie looks devastated. The picture in a backwards blur - rewinding, we can make out Henrietta.
C: ARIUS
D: Shhhhhh. Shhhhh. This is it.
N: On the television is Henrietta.
C: GUY BEHIND THE CAMERA
D: What's the password? Lemme see them shits again.
E: BEAT
C: ARIUS
D: When he grabs her tits it looks like he's assessing a race horse. He's like - lemme check out this specimen.
N: Everyone laughs but Jolie.
C: GUY BEHIND THE CAMERA
D: What would your daddy say if he saw this?
C: HENRIETTA
D: He'd knock me out for the rest of my life.
E: affecting a sexy voice
N: The kids in the room break out into ad-lib excitement.
C: ARIUS
D: Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Look. Right there. That's Francisco in the back.
N: In the background of the video is a doorway to a hallway, and crouched on the floor as if waiting for a long time, is Francisco.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Coach Dale is coming. I'm serious. He's coming now.
N: Wendel flips on the Sega Genesis. John Madden '95 appears on the screen. Christine and Wendel each grab a controller. Coach Dale enters.
C: COACH DALE
D: No weightroom today guys, we got some studying to do. This is a copy of last years Springbrook game. Get comfortable, this could be a while.
N: The cheerleaders gather themselves. Coach Dale tries to insert the game tape but the VHS of Henrietta is still inside. He ejects the mystery tape, looks at it, unlabeled, and puts it in his bag.
C: COACH DALE
D: Girls, you are welcome to watch but please keep it down, we have our work cut out for us.
E: cont.
N: The cheerleaders leave, Christine the last to straggle along, grabs Jolie's hand briefly on the way out. Coach Dale turn off the lights and presses play on the game tape. Arius considers swiping the VHS. So does Jolie. But there's no opportunity. The low quality recording of a game plays: one pixilated, long take. The blue team scores. The white team - THE BLAZERS - in-bound the ball, and the camera pans following the action. The video as primitive as it gets. Jolie is in a daze about what has seen with Henrietta. Coach Dale pauses the tape.
C: COACH DALE
D: Now what was wrong with that shot? Jolie?
E: BEAT
C: ARIUS
D: He shot on the first pass of a half court set.
C: COACH DALE
D: Are you Jolie?
C: ARIUS
D: Do I look like white to you?
E: scowling at the coach
N: Beat. Coach Dale assails Arius, wrestling him into a hold on the floor.
C: COACH DALE
D: How does it feel?
C: ARIUS
D: Owwww. My arm.
N: The other players stand back feeling awkward about the semi- abusive coach.
C: COACH DALE
D: How does it feel?
C: ARIUS
D: Ah. Ah. Ah.
C: COACH DALE
D: Look in my eyes. How does it feel?
C: ARIUS
D: Ahhhhhh!
C: COACH DALE
D: If I ever see you back away from a rebound again I'm gonna bench you for the season. You wont play one second the whole year. You got that boy?
N: Arius pinned and cringing squirms, eyes tearing, shirt bunching up and revealing a tatoo on his back for "Maple Ave." While everyone's distracted Jolie eyes the bag with the VHS, inching closer. Just as he's about to make his move the coach release Arius and sits back down. Then he pounces on Arius again and Jolie quickly grab the tape.
C: ARIUS
D: Ahhhhh!
S: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
N: Rain pours. Jolie sits on a stump, drenched and pounding a can of Coca- Cola and holding a basketball. Henrietta comes timidly down the path with an umbrella and flashlight, removing her Walkman headphones.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie, you are soaking wet. What's going on? Why did you want to meet here in the middle of the night?
C: JOLIE
D: This. This tape is going on. I saw it. The whole team saw it.
N: Henrietta is silent.
C: JOLIE
D: You lied to me. Why?
N: Jolie puts the VHS on the stump and smashes it violently with his basketball. Then he pulls the tape out of the VHS cassette and throws it into the air dramatically.
C: JOLIE
D: Don't you have anything to say?! Don't you?!
C: HENRIETTA
D: What the fuck?
N: Silence.
C: JOLIE
D: How could you lie to me like this? How could you make a fool of me like this?
C: HENRIETTA
D: How could I tell you when you never listen?
C: JOLIE
D: Why? Why not? I love you.
N: Jolie hugs her.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Sometimes love is not enough.
N: Jolie just looks at her. Jolie is dumb struck. Henrietta hugs him.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I just couldn't tell you about Maple Ave., Jolie. I just couldn't let you down. Your a Magnet kid. Your smart. Your excellent at computer, math and science. You don't understand where I'm coming from. What's important to me.
N: Henrietta hides her face in his shoulder.
C: JOLIE
D: I think we shouldn't see each other anymore.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I think you're right.
C: JOLIE
D: You do?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yeah. This time I think you're actually right.
E: TEARING UP
C: JOLIE
D: Kiss me one last time.
N: A beautiful silhouette kiss against the dark blue sky in the rain. Jolie's basketball in a glistening puddle. Magnetic tape from the VHS strewn about.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I never meant any of that to happen. Things just got out of control.
C: JOLIE
D: I'll tell your Dad I'm not your tutor anymore.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Thanks. Oh, and here. I want you to have this back.
N: Henrietta ejects her tape from her Walkman.
C: JOLIE
D: What's this?
C: HENRIETTA
D: It's Milkshake. The 95 R&B mix you gave me at our second tutoring session.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh. One of those tracks isn't even out yet though.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yea, I know. And some are older. It's kind of fucked up.
C: JOLIE
D: Just like us I guess.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Just like everyone.
N: Jolie looks at the mixtape and Henrietta leaves him standing alone in the rain in the woods.
T: FADE OUT.
N: BLACKNESS Hold.
S: INT. FOOTLOCKER
N: As Chris Rock would say, Jolie, Christine and Haroon are in the mall `white people used to go to.' Jolie takes a suede Timberland boot off the shelf.
C: JOLIE
D: Dude, I was thinking about getting some Tims.
C: HAROON
D: So what?
C: JOLIE
D: So you haven't noticed all the kids on the team wear them?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Duh.
C: HAROON
D: Man, with sandals you never have to tie your shoes. That's all I'm saying.
N: Jolie sizes up the boot next to his foot and looks in the mirror.
C: JOLIE
D: Do you have these in a size ten. And bring a what - Size 7? Yeah size seven for Haroon.
E: looks to Haroon
N: Footlocker kid nods and goes.
C: HAROON
D: I told you, man, I don't want Tims. I'm a sandals guy. Like Jesus. And Muhammad.
N: Haroon sits down defeated and looks in the mirror.
C: CHRISTINE
D: You'd look good in them, Haroon. You should try them on. Come on. Be cool.
N: Haroon looks at his toes, wiggles them. Christine and Jolie french kiss as the Footlocker Kid returns with three boxes of shoes, stopping short to watch Jolie and Christine make-out. Haroon looks away sheepishly. Begin the make out montage:
S: EXT. BLAZERS GYM PARKING LOT - DUSK
N: Run down gravel plot built to fit fifteen cars. Empty except for Jolie and Christine. Wendel and Arius driving off in a bright yellow Geo jeep packed with 7 other kids. Christine and Jolie are french kissing. Both wearing their Timberland boots.
S: EXT. BEAUTIFUL CEMETERY - NIGHT
N: On the bank of a stream. Jolie unzips Christine's daisy dukes under the moonlight and traces her exposed skin with the tips of his fingers.
S: EXT. EMPTY "SAFEWAY" GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Drizzling. Jolie's Toyota Camry is fogged up, and there are feet in the window.
S: INT. TACO BELL - NIGHT
N: Jolie and Christine are kissing.
C: CASHIER
D: Anything else with that?
N: We see Christine slip Jolie a lot of tongue.
S: EXT. TACO BELL PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Jolie and Christine walk out of the bell.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Jolie.
N: Jolie turns to see Mr. Aaronson and Henrietta in their VW van. Henrietta sits all the way in the back wearing headphones.
C: JOLIE
D: Mr. Aaronson.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: What's up? You kids want anything from the Bell.
C: JOLIE
D: We just ate. But thanks.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: OK, well. We're on for this Sunday right?
C: JOLIE
D: Oh. Uh, Henrietta didn't tell you? I, uh, can't tutor anymore.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: What? Uh, why not? Your Dad hasn't mentioned, uh.-
C: JOLIE
D: No, it's just, the team. Basketball is taking up so much time now is all. Getting ready for the playoffs and everything. Honestly, I'd be so tired I wouldn't even be any good.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Dang, Well are you still gonna mow the lawn at least?
C: JOLIE
D: I could probably recommend someone. My buddy Haroon's older brother maybe.
N: The car behind them in line honks loudly.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: What's his number? Lemme grab a pen. (shuffling through the
C: GLOVE BOX)
D: You sure you don't want a bean burrito or anything?
C: JOLIE
D: No. I'm good. It's-.
N: Honk!
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad!
C: MR. AARONSON
D: I'll get it from your dad.
N: Jolie waves. Henrietta glares at Jolie as they drive off.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Wow. She really hates you or something.
C: JOLIE
D: What do you mean?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Don't pretend like you didn't see that evil eye she gave you.
C: JOLIE
D: What evil eye?
S: INT. TOYOTA CAMRY
N: Parked.
C: CHRISTINE
D: You know their's a rumor going around that you were hooking up with her?
N: The engine roars to life.
C: JOLIE
D: Who? Henrietta?
N: Jolie blasts the AC - blowing their hair back. Christine kills it.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Some people even say you're still hooking up.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta Aaronson?
N: Jolie notches up the AC a touch.
C: JOLIE
D: I tutored her in algebra. Her dad is a long time friend of the family.
N: Jolie leans over and kisses Christine.
C: CHRISTINE
D: I was gonna say. Because she's kinda pregnant.
C: JOLIE
D: I know, right. You'd have to be twisted to get down with that.
N: Jolie bites into a bean burrito, some beans spilling down his cheek.
S: INT. JOLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Redman's Whatever Man is playing. Jolie makes out with Christine.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Do you have a jimmy?
N: Jolie searches through his sloppy dresser drawers.
C: JOLIE
D: I never had to use a condom with Henrietta.
E: VOICE OVER
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hurry up.
C: JOLIE
D: Dang. I don't see one here.
C: CHRISTINE
D: What?
C: JOLIE
D: Well maybe we can just do it a little bit.
C: CHRISTINE
D: No way.
N: Christine rolls over. Jolie is still for a moment.
C: JOLIE
D: I won't even do it. I'll just feel it.
E: WHISPERS
N: Jolie nestles close to her. Beat. The sheets move. Christine lightly moans.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh.
E: BARELY AUDIBLE
N: The covers begin to shuffle CLOSE ON: Jolie's closed eyes.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. FANTASY SMOKE FILLED BASKETBALL COURT
N: A spotlit Jolie dribbling down a seemingly endless court. Faint roars of an unseen sell-out crowd cheer him on.
C: JOLIE
D: In my head I kept thinking about dribbling a basketball down an endless basketball court, playing point guard in the biggest game of the year. The Springbrook game.
E: VOICE OVER
N: A spotlit Christine does a cartwheel followed by a split.
C: JOLIE
D: That kept me focused so I wouldn't bust in about two seconds.
E: VOICE OVER
N: Jolie looks down at his soiled pants, forgetting his basketball that bounces off into darkness.
C: JOLIE
D: I was gonna pull out but...
E: VOICE OVER
N: Three old white referees, also spotlit, are blowing their whistles and pointing furiously at Jolie as they charge closer, revealing they all have the face of Mr. Aaronson. BACK TO:
S: INT. JOLIE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
N: Jolie's face of extreme worry.
C: JOLIE
D: Uh, I better not keep going.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh. Fuck.
E: under her breath
N: Silence. Christine takes a few second to cool off.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Have any music we can listen to?
C: JOLIE
D: Yea.
N: Jolie grabs some sheets around him and walks over to desk with CDs and junk. In a sneeky manor he grabs a tissue and wipes himself clean, then grabs a Handi-Snacks wrapper and throws them in the trash together. Then he pulls out an All Eyes on Me CD. We get a long close up of the cover. The music begins to play. Jolie and Christine cuddle.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Do you ever wish you were Tu Pac?
C: JOLIE
D: No. Do you?
C: CHRISTINE
D: Actually yeah. Sometimes.
C: JOLIE
D: Really? Shit, so do I. All the time.
C: CHRISTINE
D: I can't believe he shot those drunk cops and then the cops' guns turned out to be-
C: JOLIE AND CHRISTINE
D: -stolen.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Yeah. So cool right.
C: JOLIE
D: So SO cool.
N: Jolie and Christine kiss.
S: EXT. TACO HUT AT FOUR CORNERS - DUSK
N: The crossroads. Two huge four lane roads cross to form a massive intersection. Behind it, a Taco Bell parking lot full of cars. A short line at the 'Drive-Thru.' Kids from the team are hanging out by Jolie's Toyota Camry.
C: JOLIE
D: As the season rolled on, the Taco Hut became the spot to be. Some days I would just look around and soak it in. I couldn't believe I was even here.
E: VOICE OVER
C: ARIUS
D: That looks like one of them locks you can just bust with your hands.
N: They eye a girly looking chain that locks a new forest green girls mountain bike to a bike rack.
C: WENDEL
D: I don't think so. The rack thing's not, like, stuck down.
N: Arius contemplates breaking the lock. He sips the last of his huge soda, the cup still heavy from ice, and launches it over a few parked cars. It crashes loudly in a dumpster.
C: ARIUS
D: Arright ch'all.
N: Arius walks away toward the rack. He yanks the new shiny green mountain bike with two arms up toward his chest. The entire bike rack jerks off the ground but the lock doesn't break. Arius walks on like nothing has happened. Disappears among the parked cars - the sun setting behind them.
S: INT. BLAIR BLAZERS HIGH SCHOOL FOYER
N: A large entrance-way with drop ceilings, a black floor, and red trim. The Blazers Emblem is mounted high. A giant copper shield divided into four, like something out of a gladiator movie. It's lunch period and kids from the team are hanging out. Jolie, Haroon, Vlad and Christine are nearby.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Jolie. I have to tell you something. Wanna go outside for a sec?
E: WHISPERING
C: JOLIE
D: Sure.
E: eyes on Ray approaching
N: Ray, walking past, intentionally brushes Haroon with his shoulder. Haroon drops his Handisnacks - his crackers crumbling across the floor.
C: RAY
D: Dead man.
C: ARIUS
D: You're not gonna do shit.
C: RAY
D: This aint about you.
C: ARIUS
D: Man just chill out.
C: RAY
D: Fuck you.
C: ARIUS
D: You're just rude. That's why your Mom beat your ass growing up.
C: RAY
D: Keep talking about my Mom nigga. I'll smash your fucking nigga lips in.
N: In a flash Arius wrenches Ray by the collar, swings him around into the tall windows and they slam into them.
C: ARIUS
D: Say it again.
N: Ray throws a punch and a fight breaks out. Kids come running to watch from different classrooms. Arius gets Ray by the collar again and swing him around into the window but this time they fall through the glass. Ray lands on his back outside. Arius falls forward hanging half out of the window and glass punctures his gut.
C: ARIUS
D: My fucking gut. I'm bleeding all over my fucking Guess. My Guess shit man!
C: RAY
D: Ah fuck man. I'm OK. I think I'm OK.
N: A large crowd has gathered around the blood and broken window in the aftermath of a fight.
C: ARIUS
D: Ah shit, man! Ahhh! My fucking gut is burning!
C: JOLIE
D: Holly shit. You need help. Someone call an ambulance.
C: HAROON
D: Whoa dude. That is a lot of blood. Where is he going?
C: JOLIE
D: I dunno.
N: Arius hobbles around leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum tiles as Principal Ganus and Mr. Applebaum appear on the scene and hold him up.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: An ambulance is on the way.
N: Arius is hobbled out. Ray is shepparded off by Mr. Applebaum.. A trail of small spats of blood across the linoleum floor. Principal Ganus is surveying the scene with a few of the kids who were present.
S: INT. PACKED BLAZER GYM - NIGHT
N: The crowd is filled with energy. Brightly lit. A home game. Everything is red, white, and black. The glossy floor shines like it has just been polished. Go-go music, blasting over the sub-par audio system, fades out. The fifteen Blair Blazers in their red and white warm ups have taken center court for a ritual. Huddled in a pack, hunched over and jumbled together with their arms around each other, swaying back and forth, they get pumped up:
C: WENDEL
D: Who's house?
C: WHOLE TEAM
D: OUR HOUSE!
C: WENDEL
D: Who's house?
C: WHOLE TEAM
D: OUR HOUSE!
C: WENDEL
D: Who's house?
C: WHOLE TEAM
D: OUR HOUSE!
N: Ad-lib hollers in excitement as the huddle breaks and they head for the bench. Players wipe the soles of their shoes on the way over.
C: COACH DALE
D: OK, starting five. Let's go.
N: Five players shed their warm ups and gather on the bench. Jolie is one of the starters.
C: COACH DALE
D: OK, we're gonna come out in a twenty-two going black on made buckets. Wendel and Jolie up front.
N: Everyone puts their hands in together in a circle.
C: COACH DALE
D: Defense on three.
C: WENDEL
D: Defense on three. One! Two! Three!
N: LATER The bench players have formed an entry way for the starters to take the court. On a crappy microphone:
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Starting at point guard. Number twenty two. Joel "Jolie" Jolson.
N: Jolie trots the isle of his teammates. Wendel stoically slaps fives and gives pounds as he takes center floor. He takes in the experience - looking at the huge crowd in the stands around him. All applauding. Jolie's smile fades, and we see he has spotted Henrietta in the crowd, and not far from her - Christine. Whistle!
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. BLAZERS GYM - GAME TIME
N: The noises of the game and crowd are very frantic and everything is fast paced. Coach Dale looks at the clock - 30 second left, Blair is down 1 with the ball.
C: COACH DALE
D: Jolie! Get back in the game! Take Pistol.
N: Jolie barrels toward check-in ripping off his warm-ups (top and bottom), squats at mid court - the buzzer sounds - he taps Pistol an underhand five.
C: JOLIE
D: Who you got?
N: Pistol points at a huge BLOND DUDE who pounds his chest ferociously. A buzzer indicating a substitution. Jolie is passed the ball - he puts a quick move on his man, jab step and cross, slicing through the lane. He fakes a pass behind his back and goes up for a lay up when his shot is blocked and he is slammed violently by a help-side defender. The ref blows his whistle hard and gestures - calls a foul. Jolie is on the ground in pain, holding his hand, wincing.
S: INT. JOLSON'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Jolie still in his basketball attire, looks down over a large bandage on his thumb. The microwave buzzes.
C: ELLIOTT
D: That was a great move you made. You would have been on the line for two if that guy didn't injure you.
N: Jolie pushes his food away.
C: JOLIE
D: Owwwww! My thumb. Sharp pain just shot all the way threw my neck.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Are you alright?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah.
C: ELLIOTT
D: More ravioli or anything. I could microwave some more.
C: JOLIE
D: No, I'm good.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S HOME - DAY -- STAIRWELL
C: HENRIETTA
D: I don't care if I go to Summer School!
N: Crumpled on the steps, Henrietta shrieks again.
C: HENRIETTA
D: This shit is meaningless! Who gives a crap!?
N: A paper on the floor is marked with a big fat red F with a circle around it. A note is paper-clipped to the corner of the page. Henrietta shrieks again - launches her TI-81 Calculator at Mr. Aaronson, who dodges and it breaks a few plates that were on display. Mr. Aaronson acts fast.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: You're gonna break this thing.
E: MUMBLING
N: He checks the calculator and bee lines for the phone.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: (genuinely amazed by her
C: ANGER)
D: Unbelievable.
N: He dials - in the background kitchen Henrietta's STEP-MOM rises and comes to check out the commotion.
C: STEP-MOM
D: Did Henrietta just break my grandmother's China?
E: O.S.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Shhhh.
E: grabbing the phone
N: Henrietta's shriek carries over into:
S: INT. LIVINGROOM
N: Jolie and Elliott eat ice cream - they both look very tired. Jolie lies on the couch, still in uniform. The late nights lurid news plays on a small white television.
C: MALE NEWS ANCHOR
D: They said 'had they known it was Jordan's Dad they never would have done it...'
E: on the television
C: FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
D: If only they had seen the license plate... Airness, they might have known.
N: On the TV: Jordan's Dad's Red Lexus 400, parked, now with a smashed back window as well. The shot zooms into the license plate - AIRNESS. The phone rings. Elliott checks the circa 90's caller ID - a separate box wired to the phone.
C: ELLIOTT
D: The Aaronsons? At this hour? Should I get it?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't know?
C: ELLIOTT
D: Hello.
E: ANSWERS
S: EXT. JOLIE'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Jolie in his uniform and Timberland boots, and his Dad Elliott in boxers, a T-shirt and barefoot, run to the minivan.
C: ELLIOTT
D: They think only you can talk her off the ledge.
N: Jolie looks like a deer in headlights.
C: JOLIE
D: Why me?
C: ELLIOTT
D: That's what she said.
C: JOLIE
D: Really? Dang.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Well she's not literally on a ledge. Figuratively. Do you know what figuratively means?
C: JOLIE
D: Duh. Come on, Dad. Just drive.
N: They hop in the van.
S: EXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK
N: The drive past a sign that symbolizes `Caution, Kids at Play.'
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM
N: Jolie, still in his pajamas, walks up the steps then stops to look down them with frightened hesitation in his eyes. The four parents look up - some give a few encouraging nods.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: You don't have to do this.
C: JOLIE
D: Don't worry, I know how to help Henrietta get her shit together.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: Dad. Come on. You know what I mean.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM
N: Total darkness. No TV. No overhead light. Both kids are wearing white. Henrietta's stands in front of a mirror, face wet and red from crying. Jolie hugs her from behind.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta, your Dad showed me the test. It was bad, but if you get an A on your last exam you'll still pass.
N: He flicks on a soft warm lamp and kisses her neck.
C: JOLIE
D: You just gotta learn to distribute.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRIETTA
D: You really think I don't know how to do that shit?
C: JOLIE
D: What?
C: HENRIETTA
D: That test isn't why I was so mad.
C: JOLIE
D: What is it then? You can talk to me. You can tell me anything.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I wasn't invited with you guys to the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one on pay TV. I heard everyone was going and I just flipped out. I mean what's the deal?
C: JOLIE
D: What? You mean the Bowe fight?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The point is the whole team's going.
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah. It's pretty much just a team thing though.
C: HENRIETTA
D: No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and Codroy are all bringing girls.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why don't I just call you when I figure out what time we're going.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Well the fight is at eight, right?
N: Henrietta puts her hand on his leg.
C: JOLIE
D: Is it?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yeah. And everyone's going to Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at City Place.
N: She slides her hand up.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yeah.
C: JOLIE
D: Well, I don't know. You have a lot of studying.
N: Uneasy with her advances, Jolie plucks a Cliff Livingston basketball card off the wall.
C: JOLIE
D: Cliff Livingston. I forgot about that guy.
N: Henrietta goes for a kiss.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta. Come on? We're not together anymore.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You know Spud Web only gets a roster spot because he's a circus freak. He shouldn't be there, and that's why he sells tickets. Don't you get it. He's not good, he's just a draw. Is that what you want to be, a circus freak?
E: SUDDENLY ANGRY
C: JOLIE
D: He won the dunk contest. The guy's a beast. You're way out of your league.
C: HENRIETTA
D: The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that?
C: JOLIE
D: No he didn't.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen?
N: The news hits Jolie hard.
C: JOLIE
D: That's not true. Where did you hear that?
C: HENRIETTA
D: My Dad talking to your dad on the phone in the kitchen.
N: Jolie looks at his bandaged hand - lost in deep depressing thought. Henrietta leans into Jolie. Strokes his leg. Jolie, defeated, leans into her comforting arms.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I still love you, though. None of that matters to me.
N: Henrietta kisses him. He kisses her back. Henrietta's father knocks.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Dad, we're studying here! Do you mind?
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Sorry. I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything.
E: OFF SCREEN
N: Silence for a moment as the kids are frozen, then we hear him head down stairs. Jolie lies down and Henrietta spoons him. They cuddle.
S: EXT. HENRIETTA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A full moon illuminates: Jolie leaves with his Dad and a big fat rice crispy treat in his mouth. They pass a Black Volvo and an old Red Volkswagen Bug and Golden Retriever sleeping in the yard. They hop into the Minivan. Jolie takes a big bite of the rice crispy treat as they drive past a "speed hump" sign.
C: JOLIE
D: It must have been good for Henrietta too, because afterwords, she didn't mention joining the team to the Bowe fight, she didn't mention Christine, she didnt mention nothing.
E: VOICE OVER
N: As they drive off Jolie looks back at Henrietta's home getting smaller and smaller. A speed hump sign in the foreground, and a basketball hoop set up on the street.
C: JOLIE
D: Still though, I was worried she'd show anyway. If she did, I didn't know what I was gonna do.
E: VOICE OVER
S: EXT. CITY PLACE MALL - NIGHT
N: Wide, dark, empty streets, lit up by pools of light from street lamps. Haroon and Jolie cross to: Muhammad Ali's Chicken, a restaurant with TV's in the windows, and a color scheme of red, black, and white.
C: HAROON
D: So she was just pissed because you didn't invite her to this?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah.
C: HAROON
D: But it sounds like she was really freaking out. I mean you said she smashed their PC.
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah, when I first got there she didn't even have any clothes on.
E: MORE
C: JOLIE
D: She threw her pajamas into the fireplace. I swear to God.
E: CONT'D
C: HAROON
D: I don't know. I mean maybe something more is going on?
N: They pass a BLIND BLACK MAN in a black suit poking around a seeing-eye stick, trying to orient himself.
C: HAROON
D: I mean, she's pregnant and it sounds like she's keeping the baby. Like she's fulfilling some need or something.
E: CONT'D
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah - the need for something.
N: They cackle.
C: HAROON
D: You wear a condom right?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't have to. She's pregnant.
N: They laugh harder.
C: HAROON
D: Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy.
S: INT. CITY PLACE MALL
N: They enter and their demeanors shift - they both affect bravado.
C: HAROON
D: Have you ever been here?
E: SOFTLY
C: JOLIE
D: Not for a fight?
E: SOFTLY
S: INT. MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHICKEN
N: Haroon and Jolie walk threw looking for their friends; we take in the setting as they do. An old dude finishes a coke through a straw; we hear the loud bubbling noise. The giant plastic cup has a picture of Muhammad Ali in his prime. B & W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls. Ali stands in glory over his unconscious opponents, or lays blows to their faces, sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies. The food is laid out cafeteria style. The tables and booths are a step above any fast food joint. Televisions hang from every angle, some even face the streets to attract pedestrians. On every television, without exception: a boxing match. Bowe versus a large white guy, Golota. Watching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all ages, mostly male, packing the restaurant. The crowd subdued by the early rounds. Jolie finds his friends from the team and their girlfriends lining the shinny metal railing that guides people along the buffet style assortment of chicken and biscuits. Jolie is the only white person in the whole spot.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Hey.
C: JOLIE
D: Hey.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Did you see those guys who killed Jordan's Dad got life?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah. I did.
C: CHRISTINE
D: They said, if only they had seen the license plate, Airness. They --
C: JOLIE AND CHRISTINE
D: Never would have done it.
C: HAROON
D: Dude, my dad just 911-ed me.
C: JOLIE
D: When did you get a pager?! That is tight, dude.
C: HAROON
D: Last week. You just haven't been around that much.
N: Haroon peels off as the crowd ad-libs excitement. Jolie looks to the match. We see the fight itself, close up on the television: Bowe has Golota cornered. A couple of blows are deflected and Golota, the lug, clinches Bowe in a bear hug. Disappointment from the crowd.
C: WENDEL
D: A sucker move.
N: The crowd roars again, but this time they rush to the windows - jostle for a view of the street where:
S: INT/EXT. MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHICKEN
N: Two black kids wrestle on the sidewalk. We see Haroon behind them on the pay-phone, watching. The kids fighting have jeans that are falling off and one of them has lost a gym shoe. In the windows everyone cheers them on, pounding the Plexiglas. Including Jolie and Christine. Above them in the windows are two televisions of the fight, that face the street. In the TV, the boxers and the referee shuffle aimlessly around the ring. The kids on the sidewalk are scrappy; they grab and stretch at shirts; neither can escape the others' grasp. They reach a stalemate, knotted awkwardly and exhausted; fury replaced by heavy breathing; one has a bloody nose and a huge scratch on the cheek FIGHT KID 1 You ripped my Polo shit, motherfucker! You ripped my Polo shit! FIGHT KID 2 You scratched my face, nigger! The crowd watches the stalemate and the cheering and pounding mellows, slowly they bore, returning to their seats. Suddenly on the television there is a whirlwind of action and punches are chaotically thrown by both fighters. The crowd erupts at the televisions. The kids on the sidewalk remain tangled, breathing hard. On television Golota throws a combo of blows below the belt and Bowe tumbles to the mat. The referee jumps and waves furiously at the penalty which he reports to the judges in a series of arm waves and animated hand signals. We see the people in the front rows at the boxing match, almost all white, and wearing glamorous suits and dresses. The patrons go berserk. Extreme close-up on the replay: Golota pounding Bowe in the nuts; Bowe's face distorted in pain. Ad-lib excitement from everyone but Jolie who is looking over at the entrance.
C: JOLIE
D: Strangely Henrietta never showed. I should have been relieved, but instead I felt awful. It was like yesterday we were in love and today she didn't even care I was with Christine.
E: VOICE OVER
N: They all look at the TV - Golota has won - his arm is raised, he's the new champion of the boxing world.
S: EXT. BLAIR BLAZERS GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: The little gravel parking lot is filled to the brim. Kids of all shapes and sizes are gathering. Some carry signs. Most are wearing red and white. The opposing school kids wear blue.
C: COACH DALE
D: This is what it all comes down to.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. NEARBY SUBURBAN STREETS
N: The streets lined with cars. Kids and parents walk in droves.
C: COACH DALE
D: This is where we find out what we're made of.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. TICKET BOOTH WINDOW IN GYMNASIUM
N: The line spirals around the corner and down the steps.
C: COACH DALE
D: What we have trained for, not just this season, but for you seniors, the last four years.
E: O.S.
N: CLOSE ON: A ticket torn at the door. One in a long line.
S: INT. BLAZERS WEIGHT ROOM
N: Coach Dale is directly in front of a stand alone chalk board.
C: COACH DALE
D: Is it unfair that we drew Springbrook in the first round? Yes. Random seeding is only because the sorry white schools complained to the school board about always losing in the first round. When I was younger the regular season meant something around here.
E: O.S.
N: Coach Dale begins diagraming the board.
C: COACH DALE
D: But that means nothing now. We gotta go out and play no matter what. We're gonna open in a one- twenty-two. Wendel on the ball, Pistol on the two. Falling back into the half court, we go one- twenty FIVE. Forcing left. Trap and take the throwback. Where's Jolie?
E: CONT'D SUDDENLY DISTURBED
C: ASSISTANT COACH
D: He's such a goof ball, man. This is the playoffs. Where is he at?! Who's seen Jolie?!
S: INT. LOCKERROOM SHOWERS
N: Three Cheerleaders drag Jolie, with his bandaged thumb, to the showers. Jolie looks genuinely scared.
C: JOLIE
D: Ms. Bart. I know you're the cheerleading coach and all, but this really better be important. I'm supposed to be in the weight- room by now.
C: CHEERLEADING COACH
D: You're injured. And like I said, this is more important than any basketball game. This is life or death Jolie.
N: They arrive at the last shower stall - Christine on her knees in tears.
C: JOLIE
D: Christine?
N: Jolie steps into the shower. The Coach leaves them alone.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Jolie. I haven't had my period in three months.
N: She sobs. Jolie gets on his knees.
C: JOLIE
D: Well, maybe you should get one of those things and check it out.
C: CHRISTINE
D: A pregnancy test?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah.
C: CHRISTINE
D: I did. I'm pregnant with your baby.
E: SHE CRIES
N: She cries and shivers. Beat.
C: JOLIE
D: No worries. My Dad will let me put it on his credit card. Trust me.
N: She cries. Suddenly Jolie has a face of determination. He unwraps his bandaged thumb and throws it on the floor.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Oh God. I'm sorry.
C: JOLIE
D: No. It's not your fault. I gotta run though. Let's talk about this after the game, OK? The team needs me.
N: Christine nods but clearly wants to refuse.
C: CHRISTINE
D: What for? You're injured anyway.
C: JOLIE
D: I'm ok though. I can play through it. do you understand. I just gotta do this?
C: CHRISTINE
D: What? I just told you I'm pregnant with your baby. Doesn't that mean anything.
C: JOLIE
D: Tonight I'm gonna play for you and our baby.
N: Jolie kisses her and runs off.
S: INT. WEIGHTROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jolie sneaks in. Coach Dale notices.
C: ASSISTANT COACH
D: Jolie! Where the hell have you been!?
C: JOLIE
D: I got stuck with no toilet paper, coach.
C: ASSISTANT COACH
D: Damn man. This is the biggest game of the year.
C: JOLIE
D: I know. It wasn't my fault. I gotta be light on my feet.
C: ASSISTANT COACH
D: You make me sick.
C: COACH DALE
D: Bring it in.
C: JOLIE
D: My hand is all better. Look.
N: Jolie takes a ball from an assistant coach and pounds it showing no sign of pain. Then palms it in his bad hand. Dale stares at him like he's a fool.
C: WENDEL
D: Let's go baby! Bring it in.
N: The coaches exit, and the players quiet down for a quick prayer.
C: TEAMMATES
D: Hail Mary Full of Grace, the lord is with you, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
C: ARIUS
D: Domination baby! Domination!
N: The team snaps into game mode forming a single file line. The two assistant coaches scramble in with game balls and hand them off to the first and second players in line. Jolie ditches his practice ball and files in. The players start clapping in rhythm. One. One, two. One. One, two.
C: JOLIE
D: That night. I never played. None of us did. Because there never was a game. Before the opening tip even kicked it off a fight between schools broke out in the crowd. Some fired a gun twice, and all hell broke loose.
E: VOICE OVER
S: EXT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
N: All of Wayne Avenue fills with police cars. Mobs of kids and parents and players flee the scene. Among them are all the characters we know. WENDEL and WENDELS MOM duck into their old Buick. Christine's and CHRISTINE'S MOM run for their Lexus. Mr. Aaronson and Henrietta run for their VW van. HAROON'S DAD and ZEKE and Haroon sneaks him off to the gold 80's Nissan hatchback. Jolie and Elliott run and duck behind the red Nissan Quest mini van.
C: ELLIOTT
D: Jolie, are you OK?
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah. Was that gun shots?
C: ELLIOTT
D: I don't know. Stay down just in case.
N: From the van, Jolie and Elliott see Francisco, Arius and Hunio all running into the woods among the chaos.
S: INT. MAIN OFFICE
N: Lined with windows, yields a view to an empty hall. Jolie sits, waiting...sees Christine and a couple other cheerleaders, no longer in uniform, pass by. Jolie waves and Christine holds up both hands as if to say "come on" and continues walking... Suddenly a group of black girls come barreling down the hallway like they are possessed. They are followed in droves by other minorities. Black girls bounce up and down and cry and paw at each other. Black boys and kids of other races, not quite as ecstatic but still amazed join the celebration. A couple of kids are slammed loudly against the window in the excitement. Through the glass Jolie can hear:
C: BLACK GIRL
D: We won! We won! We won!
N: SUPERIMPOSE in the top left corner in white letters: OJ Simpson was just found not guilty. The hallway is growing into total commotion and chaos. Jolie walks through the doorway into the hall and the camera
T: follows without a cut.
N: Jolie looks out of place as he takes it all in. The wild scene rages. Jolie looks back into the main office. Ray comes out of Principal Ganus's door. His eyes red from tears, he curses to himself. Principal Ganus emerges, acknowledges the commotion in the hallway.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: What the hell is going on out there?
C: JOLIE
D: OJ Simpson....not guilt.
N: Principal Ganus is stone faced. He gestures Jolie into his office. Ray brushes shoulders with Jolie.
C: RAY
D: You're dead.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A little white boy?
N: Ray blows it off.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Jolie. Come with me.
E: BEAT
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Look. I'm not proud of what happened in that gym.
N: Surrounded by proud school ornaments and paraphernalia. Jolie sits alone in a chair, an empty chair adjacent him.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Everyone who was caught fighting is being suspended for a minimum of three days. And that includes most of the team. But a suspension for you would only tarnish the reputation of the Magnet program. So...
N: Principal Ganus thumbs through a manila envelope.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: You're going to do this school a favor, at the international math meet.
E: BEAT
N: He hands Jolie a form.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: You were great your freshman year. Your calculus teacher tells me your still great, but for some reason you quit.
C: JOLIE
D: I made JV that year.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Well, there's going to be no rematch of the Springbrook playoff game. Both teams are forfeiting. So now you've got plenty of time, that's for damn sure.
C: JOLIE
D: They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: The math team needs you Jolie. We're on the verge of nationals.
E: MORE
N: PRINCIPAL GANUS (cont'd) This year we settles for nothing less than number one, second to none. (BEAT) In whole numbers. The principal laughs at his own joke.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: You can go now.
N: Stunned, Jolie grabs his bag and heads for the door.
C: PRINCIPAL GANUS
D: Oh, one more thing. You will also join the team for an additional 40 hours of community service, as part of the new "Adopt a Highway" Program. It's part of the team punishment.
S: INT. BALZERS HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
C: JOLIE
D: It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet.
C: HAROON
D: Wake up dude. Life's not fair. Who ever said it was.
C: JOLIE
D: Are you sure you wanna do that? We're in the middle of C hall.
C: HAROON
D: I told you. I don't give a fuck.
C: JOLIE
D: Really? On Mr. Applebaum's door? Yall have been warring. He's gonna know it was you.
C: HAROON
D: So what?
N: Haroon pulls out a spray-paint can and writes the words 'Thugg Life' over Mr. Applebaum's classroom door and wall.
C: JOLIE
D: Jesus Christ, man.
E: SOFT MORE
C: JOLIE
D: You just sprayed painted `thugg life' on Mr. Applebaum's door.
E: CONT'D
C: HAROON
D: I know. Duh.
N: They admire the work for a moment. Then run for cover. They burst through an exit and out into the blinding light.
S: EXT. SCHOOL ZONE
N: Haroon and Jolie run into the teachers' parking lot ducking between cars as they catch their breath.
C: JOLIE
D: You could get suspended for that.
C: HAROON
D: Who cares? What does school even matter?
C: JOLIE
D: What's gotten into you?
C: HAROON
D: I don't know. Maybe my parents are getting divorced and you don't even know about it.
E: BEAT
C: JOLIE
D: Are you serious?
N: Haroon draws the spray can like he's about to go to work on the cars, but Jolie fights him for it.
C: HAROON
D: Gimmie my spray-paint! Owww. Fuck you.
C: JOLIE
D: It's for your own good. This car belongs to Principal Ganus.
N: They stair each other down.
C: HAROON
D: I swear, of all the things you have to worry about.
C: JOLIE
D: What's that supposed to mean.
C: HAROON
D: Come on dude.
C: JOLIE
D: Come on what?
C: HAROON
D: Are you numb? The whole school knows Christine is pregnant with your baby.
C: JOLIE
D: Dude. It's not like that. She's gonna get an abortion. She comes from a wealthy family.
C: HAROON
D: So what if she does. Doesn't it mean anything to you?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't know. I don't know what it means. It just happened.
N: Jolie ponders the situation. Haroon shakes his head. Jolie pulls out a magic marker and begins to write on the car.
C: HAROON
D: Magic marker? That is so lame. Don't get me started.
N: Haroon pops the top of his spray can and begins to shake it.
S: INT. JOLIE'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Lit by a TV, the room could be it's own apartment. Wendel sleeps with a Super Nintendo controllers in his laps, on a futon. Arius, Codroy and a few kids from the team are asleep all around the room.
C: JOLIE
D: Once everyone heard that I got Christine pregnant, it was like I was the coolest kid in school.
E: V.O. MORE
C: JOLIE
D: All the kids from the team wanted to hang at my place while my parents were gone. And even some cheerleaders came too.
E: CONT'D
N: Christine and Jolie make-out, lying on the floor/power pad.
C: JOLIE
D: I told them all it was Haroon who spray-painted `Free Mike Tyson,' and even he was cool too.
E: V.O., cont.
N: Haroon, half asleep, sparking the tail end of a blunt.
C: JOLIE
D: We even smoked a blunt. It was our first time gettng blazed and drunk.
E: V.O., cont.
N: Soda cans, crumbs, bags of chips, and other treats and wrappers are scattered around. On the television: the audience laughs wildly at a Monkey doing sign language on the Carson show.
C: JOHNNY CARSON
D: What's he saying now? What's he signing?
E: ON TELEVISION
N: The guest interprets.
C: GUEST
D: He wants to say he loves you all, and he wishes he could hang onto these people a little longer, connect with them a little deeper, before it's all over.
E: ON TELEVISION
N: The Carson crowd laughs wildly. Jolie's hand slides up Christine's skirt.
C: CHRISTINE
D: Jolie! No way. Not until you know what.
E: WHISPERING
C: JOLIE
D: Don't worry.
E: WHISPERING
C: CHRISTINE
D: When? You've been saying you're gonna get your Dad's credit card for like a month. Time is of the essence here, duh.
E: WHISPERING
C: JOLIE
D: I told you I'm on it. First thing when my parents get back. But this is the best time to do it because we dont have to wear a condom. Come on, let's go upstairs. Trust me.
E: WHISPERING
N: He reaches back up her skirt.
C: CHRISTINE
D: No means no, Jolie.
E: WHISPERING
N: Christine pushes him away. Haroon comes out of the bathroom.
C: HAROON
D: Dude. I am blazed out of my mind right now, but I think someone's hiding in your shower?
E: WHISPERING
C: JOLIE
D: Forreal?
E: WHISPERING
C: HAROON
D: Yeah, dude. Check it.
E: WHISPERING
N: Jolie grabs a portable phone, bracing himself for battle.
S: INT. BATHROOM
C: JOLIE
D: Who's there?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie.
C: JOLIE
D: Damn Henrietta. You scared the shit out of me.
C: HENRIETTA
D: How could you?
N: She opens the curtains.
C: JOLIE
D: What? What are you doing in my basement bathroom?
C: HENRIETTA
D: I'm catching you cheating with Christine! You asshole!
C: JOLIE
D: Shhh. People are sleeping.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Don't lie to me. You think I dont know shit. She's pregnant with your baby.
C: JOLIE
D: Whao.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You think the Maple Ave. kids don't hear mad junk about the Magnet kids.
C: JOLIE
D: Henrietta, relax.
C: HENRIETTA
D: I know about all that stuff, how y'all hooked up during floor hockey intramurals under the trampoline. Everything. You think I don't have friends? I have friends!
N: Henrietta starts crying.
C: JOLIE
D: Come on, I know you have friends Henrietta.
C: HENRIETTA
D: You think I'm a fool? I watched you make out with her on the Power-pad two second ago!
N: Crying, Henrietta exits. The basketball team and cheerleaders have woken up from the argument, and are now enraptured by the drama. Jolie and Haroon looks like dear in headlights.
C: CHRISTINE
D: All this time you've been hooking up with some pregnant girl failing out of school. I am so fucking humiliated right now. Don't you ever, ever, ever so much as speak to me again. Come on girls.
N: Christine and three other cheerleaders leave the party.
C: WENDEL
D: Damn Jolie, all the girls just bounced.
C: ARIUS
D: Yea, let's get out of here.
N: The kids from the team leave and Jolie and Haroon stand alone.
C: HAROON
D: Damn man. I better go too. This shit is too fucked up right now.
N: Jolie stands all alone.
S: EXT. MAPLE AVE - NIGHT
N: The street sign reads Maple Ave. It is lined with tall apartment buildings. Government housing. Bus stops. And cheap liquor stores and sub shops. Jolie walks down the street.
C: JOLIE
D: The next day I found out Christine had the abortion on her own. She said she asked the doctor to see the fetus.
E: V.O.
N: Jolie approached one of the apartment buildings.
C: JOLIE
D: The doctor said she wasn't supposed to showed it, but did anyway.
E: V.O., cont.
N: Jolie buzzes up to an apartment.
S: INT. MAPLE AVE APARTMENTS - NIGHT
N: ELEVATOR Jolie rises.
C: JOLIE
D: Christine said the dead fetus looked like a baby squirrel. Like the ones that fall out of the nest and are on the sidewalk dead with no fur yet. I guess it went well though.
E: V.O., cont.
N: ARIUS'S APARTMENT The living room of a small dim one bedroom. Sensual R&B tunes play softly from a small radio.
C: JOLIE
D: After that Arius said not to worry about anything. That Christine would be cool, and Henrietta was just fucked up anyway.
E: V.O., cont.
N: A gold cross hangs on the fake wood paneling with some framed family photos at a summer bar-b-que, a wedding, and the beach.
C: JOLIE
D: He even invited me back to his place. It was the first time I had ever been to Maple ave.
E: V.O., cont.
N: Four kids from the team are playing cards around a coffee table for one dollar bills siting mostly on a puffy floral patterned couch covered in shinny plastic.
C: JOLIE
D: Everybody played this ghetto version of Jin Rummy called `Tunk.'
E: V.O., cont.
N: They all wear Addidas flip flops with socks and name brand sweatpants (Hillfiger, Nautica, Polo, etc.). Some of the kids have on athletic shorts on under their sweatpants, In the background, Jolie has a gray ratty hoody on, and is hunched over and old PC computer with Arius, a beer-bellied, balding black dude who is smoking a cigarette and has no shirt on.
C: WENDEL
D: Jolie, you want in?
N: Everyone else, other than Jolie, is also shirtless. The kids have exquisite ABS, the kind you see on television.
C: JOLIE
D: Naw. I gotta see this.
C: ARIUS
D: Ok. Here it goes.
N: CLOSE ON: An arrow clicks on the play button, but the image stays frozen: a low res picture of a bare ass black man mounted miliary style on a black girl. The image moves for a brief moment. We hear a grown with half a thrust, and the image freezes again. Then it reverts to the beginning image.
C: JOLIE
D: Wow.
C: ARIUS
D: Yeah. This is the future right here.
C: JOLIE
D: Why wont it go play or whatever?
C: ARIUS
D: Bandwidth.
C: JOLIE
D: Oh yea.
E: CONFUSED
N: Jolie tokes a blunt. Arius takes a last puff and puts it out. A little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with a sheet of paper and pencil.
T: CUTE GIRL
N: Arius. Who was the first president of the United States?
C: ARIUS
D: Uh, George Washington.
N: She runs back into the bedroom.
C: ARIUS
D: So. That's what it's all about. I'm a capital venturist man. Internet porn is the future of sexual healing. Henrietta was just the first of many. It's big business. Dollar bills man.
N: Jolie looks on, stoned. Not sure what to make of it all.
S: EXT. THE BELTWAY - DAWN
N: A six lane highway banks a sharp curve. It's raining lightly. On the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair Basketball team picking up trash with pokers. They are spread out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend clear around the curve and out of sight. Jolie pokes a Coke can. Jolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt'em." There is a picture of Hammer on the cover. The coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on, parked in the shoulder. He sips hot coffee, watching. Jolie looks closely at the tape insert. It's a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his eyes with a pen. And the poker has put a hole through his face.
C: JOLIE
D: I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late.
E: VOICE OVER
N: CLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a blurry pixilated square of colors.
C: JOLIE
D: After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape.
E: VOICE OVER
N: The picture of a couple materializes: hopeful parents and their profile.
S: INT. HAROON'S SECOND HOME - DAY
C: HAROON
D: This couple looks good.
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta.
C: HAROON
D: Are you guys still on good terms?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now.
N: Adreseis enters.
C: ADRESEIS
D: We got the trampoline set-up. Come on.
N: They make their way to the back yard.
S: EXT. HAROON'S BACKYARD - DAY
N: Haroon's brothers have set up a trampoline to dunk on an adjustable rim lowered to 8 ft. The younger brothers do an awesome array of dunks. Jolie and Haroon sit on the side.
C: JOLIE
D: It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore.
E: BUMMED
C: HAROON
D: Really? What do you care about then?
C: JOLIE
D: I don't know.
N: Haroon's youngest brother runs, bounces, and does a 360 jam. Haroon's Dad emerges from the house.
C: HAROON'S DAD
D: Good one, Adreseis!!
N: Haroon turns.
C: HAROON'S DAD
D: I've made some grill cheeses! Come and get it!
C: HAROON
D: Sweet! Now that Mom moved out we always eat American. You wanna eat with us?
C: JOLIE
D: I do but there's something I gotta do.
C: HAROON
D: Oh yeah. That's right. Well, good luck with it all.
S: INT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Henrietta lies on the bed studying. Mr. Aaronson enter.
C: MR. AARONSON
D: Hey Henrietta. Jolie is here. He brought over a gift.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Oh yeah. Let him in.
C: JOLIE
D: Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over my Super Nintendo. I thought the baby might want it.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Did Jaguar 64 finally come out?
C: JOLIE
D: No. Come on. I'm just trying to show you I actually care.
N: Mr. Aaronson smiles and leaves, closing the door lightly behind him. Jolie hands over the Nintendo.
C: JOLIE
D: And I brought this too.
N: Jolie pulls a jersey out of a paper bag.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Your practice Jersey!
C: JOLIE
D: Yeah. I'm not gonna need it anymore so.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Really? Why not?
C: JOLIE
D: I'm not playing next year. I want to focus on my studies.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie. Thank you. It smells like you. Someday little Benny will wear it. That's what I've decided to name him, Benny.
E: SMELLS IT
C: JOLIE
D: Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name him, I was kinda thinking maybe we could discuss, uh,
C: HENRIETTA
D: What?
C: JOLIE
D: Well,
E: Jolie sits next to her MORE
C: JOLIE
D: I was also thinking maybe we could talk about the possibility of you giving up your baby for adoption?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie. How could you even say that? I've wanted a family of my own, a real family, since as long as I can remember. There is no way I could ever give little Benny away. Ever. In a million years. Do you understand that?
C: JOLIE
D: Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the same time, it just doesn't seem like the smartest thing. I've already found a really wealthy, well educated, good meaning couple who'd like to meet up with you about it.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Never. No way Jolie. End of discussion.
C: JOLIE
D: Don't you even want to think it over for a few days? I mean, look how lucky your parents are to have you. You'd be making some couple just as happy. And your child would have more opportunities. I mean you're still in High School, know what I mean?
C: HENRIETTA
D: Jolie, I can't even believe you're suggesting that? Dont you see how racist that is?
C: JOLIE
D: What?
N: Jolie is silent.
C: HENRIETTA
D: Now do something to cheer me up. I am totally offended you wanted to give away my baby.
N: Jolie sits in silence for a moment, pondering his situation. He stands up and heads to the door, demoralized. Then he turns and looks at Henrietta on the bed. Jolie looks at her bulging belly, much of it exposed. BLACKNESS HOLD Credits roll to Micheal Jackson's Billy Jean.
