M: ANDY DODD (V.O.)
M: Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail
M: Nanjiani!
M: KUMAIL (V.O.)
M: Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
M: are always asking me, what was that like?
M: Really not that different from here. I
M: mean we played cricket, which is just a
M: spicier version of baseball. And we
M: prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
M: times a day. And we marry someone our
M: parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
M: you know. For me, it was probably that we
M: got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
M: later. And by a little bit later, I mean
M: we just got episode two. But other than
M: that, it was exactly the same.

S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
N: Kumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.
C: CHRIS
D: There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad comedians.
C: KUMAIL
D: You complain about the crowd like all the time.
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.
C: KUMAIL
D: So like ninety percent of the time, they're really bad?
C: CHRIS
D: Will you just watch and give me notes tonight? If we both give each other notes, I think it would be helpful.
C: KUMAIL
D: Your notes are just to add more "fucks" into the bit.
C: CHRIS
D: Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and it's hard on the end.
N: Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to CJ.
C: MARY
D: That was truly horrible.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, that was great.
C: MARY
D: No, he didn't even crack a smile. I thought I was gonna puke.
C: CHRIS
D: Who?
C: MARY
D: Bob Dalavan.
C: CHRIS
D: Who's Bob Dalaban?
C: CJ
D: Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof. Don't you want to get noticed? Move to LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.
N: ANDY DODD, the coked-up emcee, appears out of the bathroom.
C: DODD
D: No one's on stage?
C: MARY
D: No!
N: Dodd rushes on stage.
C: KUMAIL
D: He might have been doing cocaine.
C: CJ
D: Was he doing cocaine recreationally?
C: MARY
D: A true cokehead.
N: Dodd jumps up on stage.
C: DODD
D: Now before I bring up the next guy, you guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what happens after eight Jell-o shots. We urinate all over ourselves and puke. Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next comic. You know this man.
E: O.S.
N: Chris slaps his own face.
C: CHRIS
D: Confidence. Poise. Smile.
N: Dodd (O.S.) Give it up for Mister Chris Jones! Chris walks on stage.
C: KUMAIL
D: He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker.
C: CJ
D: He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he sucks.
C: CHRIS
D: Just bought a laser printer. Printed out like six lasers so far.
N: CJ, Kumail, and Mary watching Chris' set. Andy Dodd saunters backstage.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd tonight. Could I do ten?
C: DODD
D: No. Five minutes. You put out chairs, you get five minutes. You know the deal.
C: KUMAIL
D: C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.
C: DODD
D: No.
N: Dodd walks back into the bathroom.
C: KUMAIL
D: What are you gonna do in there?
C: DODD
D: I'm making up next week's schedule.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay. Cool.
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
N: CJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from the wings.
C: CJ
D: I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we are on one little rock orbiting a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe full of a billion galaxies, so I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit? You are cosmically over reacting to this. Honestly you are being super selfish. You're right, but you're selfish.
N: Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
N: Kumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and starts his set.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? I saw these news reports so I looked up what cheese is and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM and heroin. So really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin, it's very powerful. You already have heroin.
N: Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.
C: KUMAIL
D: Is Pakistan in the house?!
E: CONT'D pushing through
N: O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.
C: KUMAIL
D: You're not from Pakistan. I would have noticed you.
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles. Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary and CJ hang out at the bar.
C: CHRIS
D: He just gave you Montreal? Like you don't have to showcase or audition or anything?
C: CJ
D: It was too easy. Like I wanted to struggle. I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows and instead, like, you guys don't know how hard it is not to struggle. It's a struggle succeeding effortlessly.
C: MARY
D: Did he say anything about me?
C: CJ
D: Sure.
C: CHRIS
D: What about me?
C: CJ
D: Both of you. He said, those guys performed...
C: MARY
D: I truly hate you, actually.
C: CHRIS
D: We all hate you.
N: Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks loud over the music.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hi.
C: EMILY
D: Hi.
C: KUMAIL
D: Um, my name is Kumail.
C: EMILY
D: Yeah. We know.
C: JESSIE
D: We saw you perform.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of the way, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it threw me off. You really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude.
C: EMILY
D: I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed you. It was supportive.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, that's a common misconception. Yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative.
C: EMILY
D: So if I yelled out "You're amazing in bed," that would be a heckle?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.
C: JESSIE
D: Wow. Goodbye!
N: Jessie walks away.
C: EMILY
D: Don't go! You scared my friend off now.
C: KUMAIL
D: What's your name?
C: EMILY
D: Emily.
N: Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin.
C: KUMAIL
D: I want to show you something, Emily. This is your name in Urdu.
N: Emily picks up the napkin, looks at it.
C: EMILY
D: Whoa. Does this move work?
C: KUMAIL
D: I've had some minor success with it.
C: EMILY
D: Bullshit.
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER
N: Emily and Kumail are still at the bar.
C: KUMAIL
D: So you came to a comedy show with your friends?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, we're all grad students at U of C.
C: KUMAIL
D: What are you studying at grad school?
C: EMILY
D: I study psychology. I'm going to be a therapist.
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and ask people, "how did that make you feel?"
C: EMILY
D: Eventually. Right now I'm doing field work with a group of guys convicted of domestic violence.
C: KUMAIL
D: Jesus.
C: EMILY
D: Cheers to that.
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To you becoming a therapist.
C: EMILY
D: Great. To me getting my masters. We'll start there and then we'll go to the rest of it.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Kumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere, no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch watching TV.
C: KUMAIL
D: So my roommate Chris is probably on the couch. He's going to try and start a conversation. So no matter what- do not engage. Okay? Let's go.
C: CHRIS
D: Hi!
N: Emily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact. Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.
C: CHRIS
D: Good for him.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS
N: Kumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are clothes everywhere.
C: KUMAIL
D: Do you want to watch a movie?
C: EMILY
D: Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down? Or...
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what, go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year.
N: Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty clothes.
C: EMILY
D: Should I take my shoes off or is this a shoes on bed?
C: KUMAIL
D: No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict rules.
N: Emily crawls onto the air mattress.
C: EMILY
D: Oh wow. That's totally an inflated mattress.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat inflatable mattress?
C: EMILY
D: I did think it might be an actual mattress.
C: KUMAIL
D: Well air mattresses are actual mattresses. You're being bigoted towards air based comfort items.
N: Kumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of the Living Dead is playing.
C: KUMAIL
D: Night of The Living Dead?
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, so basically the dead start rising. And the good guys, um...
N: They eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and kiss.

N: Chris hits the Siri button again.
C: SIRI
D: What do you want to say to-
C: CHRIS
D: You up? Period. Send.
C: SIRI
D: That may be beyond my abilities at the moment.
C: CHRIS
D: Fuck.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Kumail and Emily post-coital.
C: EMILY
D: What are these scars?
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.
C: EMILY
D: I thought only old people had those.
C: KUMAIL
D: Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still fighting some battles you guys have already won.
C: EMILY
D: What were you like in high school? Were you like, super funny? Were you really smart?
C: KUMAIL
D: I was very shy. They called me chashmullee.
C: EMILY
D: What is that?
C: KUMAIL
D: It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll show you a picture.
N: Kumail flips through his phone and produces his old high school photo, shows it to her.
C: EMILY
D: Of you in high school? Oh my god!
C: KUMAIL
D: Boom.
C: EMILY
D: No.
C: KUMAIL
D: And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now.
C: EMILY
D: What inspired this hair cut?
C: KUMAIL
D: Hugh Grant.
C: EMILY
D: Oh no. And you're so serious.
C: KUMAIL
D: I read in an interview with Hugh Grant, he said he doesn't smile because it makes his face look fat. So I didn't smile in pictures for many years. What were you like in high school? Were you voted... Most Sexy?
C: EMILY
D: No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."
C: KUMAIL
D: That's good.
C: EMILY
D: No. It's really not good. I had acne, and I was a Goth and I had this terrible perm. The kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, it's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home.
N: Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress.
C: KUMAIL
D: Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.
N: She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it.
C: EMILY
D: No. No. I'm really not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on a first date. Plus a hand job.
C: KUMAIL
D: Well I haven't had that yet!
N: Emily laughs.
C: EMILY
D: You don't get that because you made fun of me.
C: KUMAIL
D: What is happening right now? What are you doing?
C: EMILY
D: I'm changing under this blanket.
C: KUMAIL
D: I've seen everything. Do you remember, we were just having sex?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, but you were in the throes of passion then. Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna call an Uber and go home.
N: Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone makes a noise. They exchange a look.
C: KUMAIL
D: Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants.
C: EMILY
D: Were you available for rides while we were fucking?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, but I only looked a couple of times.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER
N: Kumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back.
C: KUMAIL
D: So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club sometime and we can grab a drink?
C: EMILY
D: I'm not really - I know this sounds like a line - but I'm not really dating right now. I have a lot of school and work and just a lot on my plate.
C: KUMAIL
D: That's perfect because I'm not really dating right now either. I actually have a pretty strict two-day rule where I can't see someone more than two days in a row. So since we hung out for two days, if I were to see you again, which I won't because you're not dating, I'm not dating, I wouldn't be able to see you until Monday.
C: EMILY
D: We haven't hung out for two days. We've hung out for about five hours. Just to like, be totally clear.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yesterday and today. Cause it's after midnight, today is actually tomorrow. Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two days.
C: EMILY
D: You see, I don't date time nerds, so that really takes you off the table.
C: KUMAIL
D: That works out, because I am a hard core time nerd.
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, I can tell.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm like, very strict about AM/PM stuff.
C: EMILY
D: So wait, just to establish, what did we just decide?
C: KUMAIL
D: We decided we aren't ever going to see each other again.
C: EMILY
D: Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCH
N: Kumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his mother SHARMEEN, his brother, NAVEED, and his sister-in- law, FATIMA. Azmat Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from Citizens of Humanity, that's the brand's name. Touch them. They're so soft.
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't want to touch your jeans.
C: AZMAT
D: They're like sweatpants. You should be stylish like your father. It's not very difficult. Just observe me.
C: NAVEED
D: Get some Daddy Style.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not like Naveed's, just a small one.
C: AZMAT
D: Maybe like mine, small and stylish.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why you don't enroll for LSAT now?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet. I like that you bring it up as though you've never brought it up before.
C: NAVEED
D: How's the stand-up coming Bhai?
C: KUMAIL
D: It's going fine.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Since when are you someone to stand-up? You know who I think should stand up is Malala. She has something to say.
C: NAVEED
D: Ma-la-la.
C: KUMAIL
D: She does open mics and she crushes. Lot of ethnic material, which I think is a crutch, and that one story gets a lot of play, but -
C: FATIMA
D: You should be on that show Saturday Night Live!
C: NAVEED
D: SNL!
C: KUMAIL
D: That's a great idea. I should e-mail them, I don't know why I hadn't thought of that.
C: AZMAT
D: You know, I hacked into your Cousin Rehan's Facebook account-
C: KUMAIL
D: You hacked into it?
C: AZMAT
D: Yeah, they were not accepting my friend request so I had to hack into it and I discovered he and that white woman he is living with are having a baby -
C: KUMAIL
D: They're married.
C: AZMAT
D: Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into Tumblr and I discovered that they named him Davé. Can you imagine?
C: KUMAIL
D: Dave. It's probably Dave.
C: ALL
D: Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Very, very, very sad. No one is going to visit that baby. That baby, mark my words, will grow up without a family.
C: FATIMA
D: It's like he's dead. Or worse.
C: SHARMEEN
D: It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is downstairs.

C: AZMAT
D: No, no-
N: DOORBELL RINGS.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Oh. I wonder who that could be?
N: Sharmeen goes to the door.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm guessing it's a young, single Pakistani woman who just happened to be driving by our house, which is in a cul- de-sac and I'm also guessing that the phrase "dropped in" will be said in the next ten seconds.
C: AZMAT/NAVEED/FATIMA
D: Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven -
N: Sharmeen enters with a dressed up, pretty Pakistani girl ZUBEIDA, 20's.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just dropped in.
C: ZUBEIDA
D: Salaam.
C: ALL
D: Wa alaikum salaam.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Please, sit.
N: Zubeida sits next to Kumail and hands him a HEADSHOT.
C: ZUBEIDA
D: Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X- Files. Because that's your favorite show, huh?
C: KUMAIL
D: Thank you so much.

D: Ha. Ha. Ha.
C: KUMAIL
D: You brought your A-game with Naveed, but then with me, you're kind of just phoning it in a little bit.
C: SHARMEN
D: Again with the comedy, the comedy. All the time with the comedy. Be serious!
C: KUMAIL

C: EMILY

S: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER

C: KUMAIL
D: Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a string of failures. So, it turns to its most bankable star, Vincent Price.
C: EMILY
D: Is this your compatibility test? Like, the way people are with Vonnegut or The Big Lebowski?
C: KUMAIL
D: No! Just watch the movie. And take it seriously.
C: EMILY
D: I'm going to love it. I love it when men test me on my taste.
C: KUMAIL
D: I just want to share this movie with you, so I don't know why you're reading into-
C: EMILY
D: How many women have you shown this movie to?
C: KUMAIL
D: Zero.
C: EMILY
D: How many women have you shown a B Horror movie to on like, a third date.
C: KUMAIL
D: This is not a B horror movie.
N: Emily laughs.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes cause when the menu comes up, there's some spoilers in the menu.

D: I just have that weird yawning thing that happens, when you're watching a really boring film.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in. The plot kicks in really soon.

S: EXT. EMILY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
N: Kumail walks Emily to her front door.
C: EMILY

N: Chris hands out WHITE SUGARY CHALKY CUBES from a tray.

C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah?
C: EMILY
D: I never knew that Pakistan had the world's largest irrigation system.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. Something like 14 million hectares are being irrigated. As soon as I read that I was like "oh, that's going in the show."
N: CJ and Mary appear behind them.
C: CJ
D: Hey, that was... You were in the zone, man. That was the best one we've seen.

C: EMILY
D: Is that diner around the corner open?
C: KUMAIL
D: It's 24 hours. Why? You want an old lemon meringue pie?
C: EMILY
D: You're so funny! Actually, no, I just...I really need to get a cup of coffee.
C: KUMAIL
D: I can make you coffee.
C: EMILY
D: I love diner coffee. That burnt taste.
C: KUMAIL
D: All right, I'll come with you.
C: EMILY
D: No, no! Why would you do that?
C: KUMAIL
D: It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own.
C: EMILY
D: Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's the most misogynist thing I've ever heard.
C: KUMAIL
D: Why are you being so weird?
C: EMILY
D: Fuck you, I'm not being weird.
C: KUMAIL
D: You're being so weird.
C: EMILY
D: Fuck you. You're being weird! You're being so weird!
C: KUMAIL
D: How am I weird? I want to sleep while it's sleep time.
C: EMILY

C: KUMAIL
D: Are you okay?
C: EMILY
D: Everything is not okay. Everything is not okay.
C: KUMAIL
D: You can tell me anything, you know that right? You can tell me anything.
C: EMILY
D: I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge fucking dookie. I can't take a poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin! And Chris is right out there.
N: Kumail starts laughing.

D: Please stop laughing! Please, please.
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, I have an idea.
S: EXT. KUMAIL'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

S: INT. BATTING CAGES - DAY
N: Naveed fully geared up: batting helmet, gloves, elbow pad, eye-black. Kumail behind the backstop, watching.
C: NAVEED
D: Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting weight and torque.
N: A BALL ZINGS at Naveed, he misses completely.
C: NAVEED
D: Oh Christ!
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh.
N: Another ball zings. Misses again.
C: KUMAIL
D: You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.

C: KUMAIL
D: These cookies are really good.
C: NAVEED
D: They're biscuits! Listen to yourself. You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"? You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. You're such a burger.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm not a burger.
C: NAVEED
D: Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually a British term.
C: NAVEED
D: Well thank you for that information that no one gives a shit about and you should listen to mom and grow a beard.
C: KUMAIL
D: It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's all patchy.
C: NAVEED
D: Try being a man and conditioning like I do.
C: KUMAIL
D: What's the whole thing with Muslims growing beards anyway? It's such an arbitrary thing. Like who decided that? Oh, we have to have beards.
C: NAVEED
D: Yeah. There are a billion of us and you are the only one with the truth. Is that right? The sun is just shining down on you right now. It's just parting like "ahh".
C: KUMAIL
D: You know, I have to tell you something, Bhai.
C: NAVEED
D: Here we go. Yeah?
C: KUMAIL
D: I've been dating this girl.
C: NAVEED
D: Acha.
N: KUMAIL She's white.
C: NAVEED
D: I thought you were going to say you were involved in a hit and run or you got caught forging some checks. But a WHITE GIRL? Such a cliche.
N: A white family stares in their direction.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's okay! We hate terrorists!
C: NAVEED
D: Listen. I understand. You're in America. You wanna mow a few lawns and see what it's like. But eventually you have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I hung out with other girls. But then I married Fatima. We hardly spoke two words to each other the first few months! But now, Kumi, she's like my best friend. You have to break up with her immediately.
C: KUMAIL
D: If I find someone who's as good for me as Fatima is for you, Mom would understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't love me less?
C: NAVEED
D: She would definitely love you less. Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the word when guys stop returning girls' calls?
C: KUMAIL
D: Ghosting?
C: NAVEED
D: Yes. You have to end it now or Mom will fucking ghost you.
E: dead serious
N: Naveed gets up.
C: NAVEED
D: Now come on.
E: CONT'D
N: He exits, leaving Kumail alone at the table.
S: INT. GRAD PARTY - LATER
N: Kumail and Emily are sipping wine out of plastic cups.
C: EMILY
D: I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd say it's very fruit forward.
C: KUMAIL
D: Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice that's gone bad. How do you know so much about wine?
C: EMILY
D: Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my first marriage and I drank a lot and one way to cover drinking is to know a lot about wine.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry wait, what did you say?
C: EMILY
D: That knowing a lot about wine sort of covers for drinking a lot.
C: KUMAIL
D: No, the huge piece of information you're trying to blow right past.
C: EMILY
D: Yeah. I was married.
C: KUMAIL
D: You were married?
C: EMILY
D: I was. I was married. Do you want to talk about something else?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, cause I don't really have any questions other than...when did you get married? When did you get divorced? What's his name? How tall is he? Did you love him? I guess I have a couple of questions.
C: EMILY
D: Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in college. Everyone I knew was getting married super young, so we did. And one day I was at a restaurant and I saw this couple making out and I thought "I don't think about my husband like that, but I guess that's okay" and then another part of my brain was like "NO IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE". I feel like this is freaking you out. Does this freak you out?
C: KUMAIL
D: It's not freaking me out.
C: EMILY
D: I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I know it's only been a few months.
E: MORE
C: EMILY
D: But I just wanted to tell you that I am completely overwhelmed by you. It's the last thing I was expecting.
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: This is also the last thing I was expecting and I also feel completely overwhelmed by you.
C: EMILY
D: That's a weird thing to say.
C: KUMAIL
D: Why? I just said what you said. Exactly what you said.
C: EMILY

C: EMILY
D: Okay. Well, I would love to meet your parents. They live in the city, right?
C: KUMAIL

D: Are you okay? What happened?
C: EMILY
D: Totally fine.
C: KUMAIL

C: KUMAIL
D: You should get it looked at. Do you want ice?
C: EMILY
D: Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine.
C: KUMAIL

E: CONT'D
N: Emily opens the cigar box and sees the headshots of the women. She flips through them.
C: KUMAIL
D: Did you know in the UK it's pronounced "Crayg". Which is good because that's actually how it's written, right? He's a "Crate" guy.

C: KUMAIL
D: I was going to tell you about that.
E: CONT'D sees her with the box
C: EMILY

C: KUMAIL
D: They're not in Pakistan.
C: EMILY
D: You've met these women?
C: KUMAIL
D: Just with my parents. We haven't like -

D: You lie to me. You lie to your parents. And those are just the people you like! Is there someone that you're not lying to? I'd love to meet them, cause then I could tell them what a fucking liar you are!
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: You didn't tell me about your being divorced until recently. You were hiding fucking something too!
C: EMILY
D: My divorce does not mean our future is impossible. It actually means the direct opposite. I'm not hiding anything from you. Okay? I'm an open fucking book. You wanna know what's in my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and stamps.
C: KUMAIL
D: Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you supposed to be good at handling these types of things.
C: EMILY
D: Where are my fucking shoes?
C: KUMAIL

S: INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She grabs her shoes.
C: KUMAIL
D: You know what we call "arranged marriage" in my culture, Emily? Marriage! Okay? We just call it marriage. There's another type of marriage that's called "love marriage" and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married an Irish woman and he was kicked out of the family! And nobody is allowed to talk to him.
C: EMILY
D: Why didn't you tell me any of this?
C: KUMAIL
D: Because I didn't think you'd fucking understand and I was fucking right!
C: EMILY
D: You don't think I could fathom your life in any fucking way?
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year old culture! You were ugly in high school! There's a big fucking difference! I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.
E: a beat

N: Kumail sits with CJ backstage.
C: CJ
D: I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a good person, I'm not saying she's not. All I'm saying is this is the universe telling you: seize your moment. Be a little selfish and pursue your career. Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on Thursday. If you book the Montreal Comedy Festival, it would change things for you. You don't wanna get stuck in Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the "people say Sam" bit since '03.
N: They look at Sam on stage.
C: SAM
D: People say, Sam...

I'm going to be the first guy to die. I die so the other characters get to find out something weird is going on. I go off alone to find the cat.
N: Kumail sees Bob Dalavan at a table with CJ. Dalavan listens to Kumail's set and seems into it.

S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM
N: Kumail, freaked out, stares at Emily, hooked up to various wires on her arms and chest. He sees her purse and digs out her iPhone. It's locked. He looks over at Emily.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry.
N: He puts her finger on the phone. It unlocks.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Kumail scrolls down to PARENTS on Emily's phone and dials. A WOMAN'S VOICE picks up, "Hello?"...
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail, Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be calling you so late. Emily's fine. Just want to get that taken care of. She's fine. She is at City View Hospital in Chicago in a medically induced coma. But the doctors say that- - Yes I did say coma.
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - LATER
N: Kumail sits in a chair looking at Emily who is hooked up to a breathing machine. He dozes off.
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM- NEXT MORNING
N: Kumail sleeps. He wakes up to a COUPLE sitting by Emily's bed. TERRY, 50's, rumpled, BETH, 50's, put- together.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey. I'm Kumail.
C: BETH
D: We know who you are Kumail.
N: They're clearly tired, terrified. Nurse Judy enters.
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would like to see you now.
C: BETH
D: Be right back.
E: whispers, to Emily
N: They leave. Kumail awkwardly follows them.
S: INT. BEREAVEMENT ROOM- MOMENTS LATER (SUNDAY MORNING)
N: Kumail, Terry, Beth sit. A waterfall coos. Meditations on the wall: "Darkest Nights Produce The Brightest Stars"; "Grief is love's unwillingness to let go", etc.
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Listen, the doctor will be here any minute. She's just running a little late. Don't read anything into this being in the bereavement room. It was the only room we had available.
C: TERRY
D: Okay. Thank you.
N: She exits. Terry nervously taps on his knees, annoying Beth.
C: BETH
D: Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.
C: TERRY
D: I know, I know. But it makes me feel better.
N: The doctor walks in.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Hello.
N: Beth and Terry stand to greet her.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's attending. I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: "All the doctors"? How many are there?
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Five.
C: BETH
D: Five? Why so many? Is that normal?
N: Dr. CUNNINGHAM Yes, it's standard with patients in the ICU. We come at it from different angles-- When we cut back it is a different person now. DR. LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors change.
C: DR. LEWIN
D: We immediately initiated orotracheal intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected her heart at this point.
T: CUT TO:
C: DR. WHELAN
D: We don't know the exact nature of the infection yet, but we've got her on a broad spectrum of antibiotics.
T: CUT TO:
C: DR. PLATT
D: ...critical infections centering around the costodiaphragmatic--
T: CUT TO:
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
C: TERRY
D: Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f" or a "ph"?
E: taking NOTES
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: Ph.
N: MONTAGE of doctors babbling unintelligibly as Beth and Terry visibly panic.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER
N: Terry, Beth, and Kumail sit, surrounded by: KIDS WITH COLORING BOOKS, ADULTS WITH MAGAZINES, various CHARGERS plugged into the wall. These are the PEOPLE WHO WAIT.
C: KUMAIL
D: That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas. And the kind that they put her in, the medically induced ones, are definitely the good kind of coma.
E: MORE
C: KUMAIL
D: Like you know how there are good and bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good or bad.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle things from here. You've been very helpful. Thank you. For signing the thing-
C: KUMAIL
D: My pleasure
C: TERRY
D: But you can go now.
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the Mideast.
N: He picks up his backpack and exits.
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT
N: Kumail, Mary, Chris, CJ, & Sam sit with notebooks open.
C: CHRIS
D: What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport get a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs?
C: CJ
D: That's good. What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never did comedy ever again?
C: CHRIS
D: Fuck you. It's a good bit.
C: CJ
D: Just for the sake of the public. So they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words.
N: Kumail interjects.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's okay that I'm not there, right? Like, I don't need to be there, right?
C: SAM
D: What happened?
C: CHRIS
D: He put his girlfriend in a coma. You know, the way you do.
C: MARY
D: He signed a paper that allowed doctors to put her--
C: CJ
D: He suggested it.
C: KUMAIL
D: She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically induced coma. This is their specialty.
C: MARY
D: Maybe.
C: CHRIS
D: It might be a good thing. She might wake up with a new skill. Like my cousin blacked out once and when he came to, he thought he knew a different language.
C: CJ
D: Did he?
C: CHRIS
D: No, it was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage.
N: CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out.
C: SAM
D: I got another Taco Bell one...
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING
N: Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's. Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them.
C: BETH
D: Did you forget something?
C: KUMAIL
D: Is she up yet?
C: TERRY
D: No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning.
C: KUMAIL
D: I know you guys said you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just going to wait anyway.
C: BETH
D: You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's more complicated than that--
C: BETH
D: Is it? Because I know about the two-day rule, I know about the headshots and the secrets. She tells us everything. You really don't have to stay Kumail. You have already done a lot.
E: beat, then
N: Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet--
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat- ?
N: Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she throws her sewing on it and turns away. Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down, facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next to him.
C: KUMAIL
D: Is that lady still looking at me?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- LATER
N: Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different table. Terry waves at him. Kumail heads over to them.
C: TERRY
D: No reason you should eat there by yourself. Right, hon?
C: BETH
D: It's a free country.
E: barely looks up
N: Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward.
C: KUMAIL
D: How's your sandwich?
C: BETH
D: Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.
C: TERRY
D: Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble. You know, we're not by the water. Well, we are by the water, but it's a lake. There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever. I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I guess. Whatever the good dice number is.
N: More silence.
C: TERRY
D: So, uh, 9/11?
E: CONT'D
N: Blank looks from Kumail and Beth.
C: TERRY
D: No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a conversation about it with...people.
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: You've never talked to people about 9/11?
C: TERRY
D: No, uh, what's your stance?
C: KUMAIL
D: What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm... Anti. It was a tragedy. I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.
E: a beat
C: BETH
D: Huh?
C: KUMAIL
D: That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it.
N: Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly gather up their things and get up to leave.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, can I come?
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY BETH
D: Yeah. No.
N: Terry gestures for Kumail to get up and follow them.
C: BETH
D: Whatever.
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER
N: Kumail, Beth, Terry, and Dr. Cunningham.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: I know this isn't the news you were hoping for but we aren't ready to bring Emily out of the coma yet.
C: BETH
D: Oh. I-
C: TERRY
D: What happened?
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: The antibiotics aren't doing exactly what we'd hoped they would, and we don't want to mess around. So we're going to perform surgery tomorrow morning to remove the infection.
C: BETH
D: Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. He didn't say anything at all about surgery.
C: TERRY
D: What does that mean? What kind of surgery?
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: It's called thoracentesis, it's a very common procedure. We're going to go in between the ribs and remove the infection.
C: TERRY
D: How do you spell that please? Thora- ? What's the last part?
E: scribbling in his notebook
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: -Centesis.
C: BETH
D: And where is the infection?
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: On the lung.
C: BETH
D: What's the risk?
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Low. My advice to you is that you go home, you get something to eat, and try to relax.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT

N: They enter. Beth and Terry begin looking around.
C: TERRY
D: She left the lights on, eh?
C: BETH
D: My favorite sweater.
N: Terry looks at Emily's bookshelf and pulls out a BOOK. Beth puts the sweater on and takes her laptop out, sits on the couch.
C: BETH
D: I'm gonna do some research.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Oh hey, that's the book I gave her.
C: BETH
D: No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctors?
N: Terry hands her the notebook.
C: TERRY
D: No, this is the book I gave her.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms real quick.
C: BETH
D: I remember. I met her at the falafel place and then we went to that book store that's hardly ever open and I bought it for her.
C: TERRY
D: You're not the only one who gives her things.
C: BETH
D: What's up with you?
C: TERRY
D: I'm just tired of you thinking that you're the only one who gives her things. I gave her that book.
C: BETH
D: Look at the inscription.
C: TERRY
D: No. That's stupid.
N: Beth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at the inscription, frowns, puts it back.
S: INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- SAME
N: Kumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling. He begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her closet. He notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily.
C: TERRY
D: Kumail.
E: O.S.
N: Kumail, a bit startled, turns.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey.
C: TERRY
D: Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I was just wondering if we wanna do anything. Got any parlor games...
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't-what are parlor games?
C: TERRY
D: Card games, word games. You play any word games?
C: KUMAIL
D: No, I've never played-
C: TERRY
D: You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?
C: KUMAIL
D: How does that go?
C: TERRY
D: It's basically where you try to find a word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme.
C: KUMAIL
D: Ok, Stonehenge.
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a winner.
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't play board games. I play video games.
C: TERRY
D: That's the thing. Everybody now needs Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a piece of chalk and a pavement, that's your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you go, three games right there.
C: KUMAIL
D: Jimmy was a real guy?
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy, whoever got hit with the chalk, he was the Jimmy.
N: Kumail gets a call from Naveed on his phone. He ignores it.

S: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Kumail and Terry walk back in. Beth is on her laptop.
C: KUMAIL

C: TERRY
D: Really?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy festival audition coming up, and I'm actually headlining tonight.
C: TERRY
D: Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to comedy show since the 80's - Rita Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that, hon?
C: BETH
D: Christ. Pleural effusion and empyema, --
C: TERRY
D: Maybe we should go to Kumail's show. What do you think? Wouldn't that be fun?
E: nervous
C: BETH
D: Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.
C: TERRY
D: Okay listen, why don't we go to the comedy club with him? It'll take our mind off of things right now.
C: BETH
D: I don't want to get my mind off it, Terry. Our daughter's having surgery tomorrow.
C: TERRY
D: Please. I need the distraction.
C: BETH
D: Well then why don't you go?
C: TERRY
D: No, I want you to come with me. I don't wanna be alone.
C: BETH
D: All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.
C: KUMAIL
D: Ah it's sold out. I should've said it before you guys had the whole discussion. It sold out super quickly. They were shocked at how quickly it sold out.
C: TERRY
D: But you can get us in? You're the headliner, right? That's what you said. I mean, if you're the headliner, you can get two more in, right?
N: Kumail looks pained.
C: KUMAIL
D: That's a good point.
C: TERRY
D: We'll sit in the back. They got food there?
C: KUMAIL
D: They've got waffle fries and um-
N: Kumail turns and begins to head out the door.
C: TERRY

C: SHARMEEN

E: to heckler
C: HECKLER
D: I said, he should go back to ISIS.

D: No I was saying that to him because...
C: BETH
D: Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS recruiter here.
N: The crowd laughs.
C: KUMAIL

N: The crowd reacts.
C: KUMAIL
D: Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for you to find out, but he's right. I actually am a terrorist. I just do stand-up comedy on the side to keep a low profile.
C: HECKLER
D: Fuck you.

C: TERRY
D: Here's a joke.
C: BETH
D: No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral.
C: TERRY
D: This is funny, this is a funny one. A giraffe walks into a bar and he says to the bartender, "Highballs on me." You get it, right?
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh that was the end of the joke?
C: TERRY
D: Yes.
C: KUMAIL
D: That was the whole joke?
C: TERRY
D: That's the joke. That's the beauty of it, boom.
C: KUMAIL
D: I thought there was more.
C: TERRY
D: He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would stand to reason his testicles are high and a highball is a type of drink, and you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny first.
N: He gives up and eats. Kumail chuckles.
C: KUMAIL

E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Well that didn't work.
C: KUMAIL
D: Also, I think I screwed up with your daughter.
C: BETH
D: Yeah, you did. I don't know how people do it when their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he got cancer, then he had a stroke, then a heart attack, then he had a recurrence of the cancer. But you know what killed him?
E: then
C: KUMAIL
D: Cancer?
C: BETH
D: Car accident. We think maybe it was a heart attack while he was driving. And he did still have cancer too. And you know what? He ate sprouts his whole fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30 years. I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight.

N: She claps and Terry shifts, but doesn't wake up.
C: KUMAIL
D: How did you and Terry meet?
C: BETH
D: I was going to East Carolina University and I was waiting tables. We met at this coffee shop, I was waiting on him. I liked his hair. He was a teacher already. Thick New York accent like nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My family could not stand him. We're all military people, army pilots. All my brothers played football. Terry couldn't even change a tire. My father got so mad he broke every dinner plate we had. Now back then, you go to the gas station, you fill up your tank, you get a dinner plate. But just one at a time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of fill-ups to get the whole set back. And Terry just stuck around. Eventually they just all got over it.
C: KUMAIL
D: They just got over it. How?
C: BETH
D: Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your parents meet, Kumail?
C: KUMAIL
D: So we have arranged marriage as you know. A big group got together to see a movie, but really it was just a set up so my mom and dad could meet.
C: BETH
D: What movie did they see?
C: KUMAIL
D: I have no idea. I never asked.
N: They look back at the GOTH PHOTOS of Emily.
C: BETH
D: She's great, you know?
C: KUMAIL
D: I know.
C: BETH
D: I feel good about this surgery.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. These doctors know what they're doing.
C: BETH
D: No they don't. They're just winging it like everybody else.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Kumail gets into his car and checks his phone. Seventeen missed calls from his mom and ten voicemails.
C: KUMAIL
D: Fuck.
N: Then he notices an old voicemail from Emily. He hits play on the message.
C: EMILY'S VOICE
D: Hey it's me. So I tried making some Pakistani food to surprise you. And either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!
N: He hasn't heard her voice in a while. He listens to another old voicemail.
C: EMILY'S VOICE
D: Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!
N: He listens to another.
C: EMILY'S VOICE
D: Hey it's me. So did you want to meet at the gallery, or - Oh my god! Oh my god, a bird just hit me in the head. Oh my god I'm not kidding. I'll call you right back. Oh my god, is it okay?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM
N: Emily lies unconscious in her hospital bed.
S: INT. BEREAVEMENT ROOM - DAY
N: Dr. Spellman sits with Kumail, Terry and Beth.
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: The infection around the lungs was removed. We should be able to pull her out soon.
C: TERRY
D: Oh boy.
C: BETH
D: How soon?
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: She should be up by tomorrow morning at the latest. We'll also test the pleural fluid from the thoracentesis so we can create a more targeted antibiotic strategy.
C: BETH
D: So this is good news?
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: It's very good news. We'll just hold onto her for a few more days and then you can have her back.
C: TERRY
D: She's a fighter, right?
C: DR. SPELLMAN
D: Yes.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Kumail eating with his family.
C: SHARMEEN
D: I was so worried. We saw on the news that a train derailed and we thought that you were on the train and you had died.
C: KUMAIL
D: Nobody died on that train, Ma.
C: SHARMEEN
D: But did they look under the train?
C: AZMAT
D: So, where were you last night? What were you doing?
C: KUMAIL
D: Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Kumail.
C: KUMAIL
D: Alright, I'll tell you. I was... studying for the LSAT.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Really?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm gonna go to law school, become a lawyer, and do law.
N: The doorbell rings. Sharmeen gets up.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Oh, let me see who that could be.
N: She exits.
C: KUMAIL
D: Really, Dad? You said that nobody was gonna come. That it was gonna be just us.
C: NAVEED
D: Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, I know.
C: FATIMA
D: He should be on Saturday Night Live.
C: NAVEED
D: SNL.
N: Sharmeen returns with Khadija.
C: SHARMEEN
D: Everybody remember Khadija? She just dropped in. She was just in the neighborhood.
N: Khadija waves awkwardly, and her parents, FARHAN and TINA appear.
C: SHARMEEN
D: And these are her parents, Farhan and Tina. They also just dropped in.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Tina holds forth in Urdu. The grown-ups laugh. Khadija tries to lock eyes with Kumail.
S: EXT. KHADIJA'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Kumail walks Khadija to her door.
C: KHADIJA
D: I've just been through so many of these appointments and I never have anything in common with the guys. You know when girls at work complain about dating, I just want to body slam them. They have no idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm becoming the bruised apple at the bottom of the apple bucket.
C: KUMAIL
D: No, no. You're not.
C: KHADIJA
D: I am.
C: KUMAIL
D: You're not.
C: KHADIJA
D: So do you want to hangout sometime? Like without our parents? Have you been to the cat cafe? The cats just come up to you and nestle in your lap and you just pet them.
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't think that's a good idea.
C: KHADIJA
D: You don't like cats?
C: KUMAIL
D: I mean I don't think it's a good idea for us to hangout again. It's not you. You're fantastic. I just can't do this arranged marriage thing -- with anybody.
C: KHADIJA
D: So why did you meet me?
C: KUMAIL
D: It wasn't my idea.
C: KHADIJA
D: I'm just really tired. Do you ever want to just be in a relationship so you can finally relax?
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.
C: KHADIJA
D: People are always telling me what I deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.
N: Khadija starts walking to her front door, then stops and turns back to Kumail.
C: KHADIJA
D: And you know what? I watched the X-Files, like three whole episodes, and it's a bad show.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Beth, Terry, and Kumail sit. Beth and Terry with their laptops, Kumail with his iPhone. Each diligently typing. We see they're each looking things up on WebMD.
C: TERRY
D: Wow, they should call this website, "Everything is Cancer Dot Com". Everything you put in, it could be cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on. You take the fun out of hiccups now.
C: BETH
D: Do you know this is the 17th best hospital in Chicago?
C: TERRY
D: Really? Out of how many?
C: BETH
D: I don't know, but Northwestern's number one.
C: TERRY
D: Well how do they rate it? What's their methodology?
C: BETH
D: I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.
C: TERRY
D: It's not great, unless the sample size is, you know, that all depends.
C: KUMAIL
D: Here, look at the comments.
C: TERRY
D: This is why I don't want to go online cause it's never good. You go online, they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best movie ever.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER
N: Terry talks on his cellphone and paces. Dr. Cunningham tracks him down.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Terry - Hi. Can we talk?
C: TERRY
D: Yeah.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: We got the biopsy results. They are unfortunately inconclusive. We are concerned-
N: Music drowns out the rest of their conversation as Terry looks increasingly distraught.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER
N: Terry speaks with Beth and Kumail.
C: TERRY
D: They couldn't find out what the disease was, or where the virus came from or the bacteria or whatever.
C: KUMAIL
D: But they took out the infection so it shouldn't matter?
C: TERRY
D: I know, that's what I said but her vitals didn't normalize. And now they say that the infection is continuing to spread, it's in her kidneys.
C: KUMAIL
D: But the kidneys are so far from the lungs.
C: TERRY
D: I know, it's an aggressive infection and they said what they gotta do now is figure out what this mystery disease actually is.
C: BETH
D: I'm calling Northwestern.
C: TERRY
D: Just hold on, hold on.
C: BETH
D: Terry! Goddammit!
C: KUMAIL
D: I think we should talk about this--
C: BETH
D: --You shut up! I'm sick of this shit, Terry. We're getting her out of here!
C: TERRY
D: They're in the middle of the whole process of elimination.
C: BETH
D: So you're saying Northwestern can't take that information and continue the search? This place is a shithole.
N: She looks towards the other people in the waiting room.
C: BETH
D: I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?
E: CONT'D
N: She takes her bag from Anna.
C: TERRY
D: Will you just stop for a second? They're the doctors. You act like you know what you're talking about. You don't.
N: Beth searches in her bag.
C: BETH
D: I can't find my cellphone. You got a phone?
C: TERRY
D: Don't give her a phone. You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now.
N: Kumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts fiddling with it.
C: TERRY
D: They're doing it. They're the experts here, and I trust them.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can you unlock that thing?
N: Beth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands it back.
C: BETH
D: There's a reason why they're #17 and Northwestern's #1. And it's not because people trust them!
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Oh - you think that you're smarter than me because you say big sentences. Well you're not!
N: Kumail is trying to give them space, unsure what to do.
C: BETH
D: I don't think I'm smarter than you! You just don't think you're as smart as I am! That's not my fault!
C: TERRY
D: Right. It's never your fault. Everything's my fault.
C: BETH
D: Oh there are some things that are definitely just your fault.
C: TERRY
D: Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop freaking out and calm down.
C: BETH
D: And you need to stop being a coward.
C: TERRY
D: Greatest hits, coming back. You can stop, I'll replay the rest of this from memory.
N: Kumail slips away.
S: INT. GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kumail looking at gift items.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER
N: Kumail walks with a giant STUFFED GIRAFFE.
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kumail puts the STUFFED GIRAFFE by her bed. Nurse Judy smiles.
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.
C: KUMAIL
D: It was the biggest thing they had. I don't even know if she likes giraffes. We never talked about giraffes. Hey, do they know what they're doing? Cause they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme Disease? You know the girl on The Real World had it? Did you guys look for that?
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Yes, we did.
C: KUMAIL
D: Did you know she gets hurt all the time? She messed up her ankle recently - could that be Lupus?
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Kumail. We're looking into everything. We're not holding anything back from you. We're still just eliminating possibilities.
C: KUMAIL
D: Cause Beth wants to move her to Northwestern.
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we.
N: Kumail looks frightened.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Terry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits up.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey Terry. I was just talking to the nurse - You okay?
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, of course. Totally fine.
N: Terry's eyes are very puffy and red.
C: TERRY
D: Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait here until they kick me out. Keep an eye on her.
E: CONT'D
N: Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another.
C: KUMAIL
D: Do you wanna crash at my place?
C: TERRY
D: You got the golf channel?
C: KUMAIL
D: No.
C: TERRY
D: That wasn't funny, right?
C: KUMAIL
D: I thought that was a serious question.
C: TERRY
D: Let's get the fuck out of here.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Kumail and Terry walk in.
C: KUMAIL
D: So this is the place.
C: TERRY
D: Wow...this place is terrible.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATER
N: Kumail and Terry lay on separate air mattresses.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was saying that moving Emily could be a bad idea.
C: TERRY
D: Really?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.
N: Terry listens but doesn't respond.
C: KUMAIL
D: Like...
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything to trade places with Emily. Being a parent, it's a nightmare. Loving somebody this much sucks.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah.
N: Kumail's not sure what to say.
C: TERRY
D: And I guess you've noticed some tension between Beth and me.
C: KUMAIL
D: Not really. That's none of my business.
C: TERRY
D: Yeah well, it's there. Big time.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's getting really late. We should go to sleep.
N: Kumail turns off the light. A beat of quiet in the dark.
C: TERRY
D: I cheated on her.
C: KUMAIL
D: Fuuuuck.
C: TERRY
D: I did. It was just a one night stand.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay.
C: TERRY
D: We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They have these teacher conferences. Who goes to a math conference to get laid?
C: KUMAIL
D: Math teachers?
C: TERRY
D: Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's what it was.
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-
C: TERRY
D: She just smelled so good. It was horrible too. As soon as I was finished. As soon as I'd finished, I was like, what did you fucking do?! What did you just do?!
E: MORE
C: TERRY
D: What did you do?! You know that moment of clarity you get right after an orgasm?
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: Yup.
C: TERRY
D: I told Beth right away. I had to. She was devastated. Now she hates me.
C: KUMAIL
D: She might be mad at you, but she doesn't hate you. You should've heard the way she was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you something? Why did you tell her?
C: TERRY
D: Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.
C: KUMAIL
D: Do you guys talk about it?
C: TERRY
D: Not anymore. She said she forgave me, but no. She hasn't. Let me give you some advice Kumail. You're going to know the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with when you cheat on her. When you cheat on her and you just feel like shit.
C: KUMAIL
D: So, to fully know I love someone, I have to cheat on them?
C: TERRY
D: Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's terrible advice.
N: Terry is clearly fraught.
C: TERRY
D: Love isn't easy. That's why they call it love.
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't really get that either.
C: TERRY
D: I know. I thought I could just start saying something and something smart would come out.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Kumail wakes up. Terry is gone. There is a note. "Headed to the hospital. See you there - Terry."
S: INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT
N: Kumail pulls on his shoes as Chris exits the bathroom.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey did you see Terry?
C: CHRIS
D: No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm going to Sevies. You want anything?
C: KUMAIL
D: No, I'm good, thank you.
C: CHRIS
D: You don't want a hot dog or nothing?
C: KUMAIL
D: Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.
C: CHRIS
D: Okay, no hot dog.
N: Chris opens the door to leave as Azmat and Sharmeen enter.
C: SHARMEEN
D: We just spoke to Khadija's parents.
C: KUMAIL
D: What are you doing here?
C: SHARMEEN
D: What is wrong with you, Kumi?
C: KUMAIL
D: Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-
C: SHARMEEN
D: Sorry? That's all you have to say?
C: KUMAIL
D: I wasn't that into her.
C: SHARMEEN
D: "Into her"? Do you know how difficult it is to get an appointment with her? She is in very high demand.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay. So?
C: SHARMEEN
D: So?
C: KUMAIL
D: Can we please talk about this another time?
C: SHARMEEN
D: No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this now. We have sacrificed everything for you.
C: KUMAIL
D: I know, okay?
C: SHARMEEN
D: We have left our family. We have left our home. I have missed the birth of my sister's daughter. I have not seen my mother for fifteen years. Your father, he had to do his graduate school. Again. He had to give exams. Again.
C: AZMAT
D: I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s. They used to call me Father Time!
C: KUMAIL
D: I know that. I really appreciate everything you did for me, but can we talk about this another time?
C: SHARMEEN
D: Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer, fine. If you want to do the stand-up comedy and embarrass us as a family, fine. There is only one thing that we have ever asked from you: that you be a good Muslim and that you marry a Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!
C: KUMAIL
D: Can I ask you something that has never made sense to me? Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life?
E: MORE
C: KUMAIL
D: We come here but we pretend like we're still back there? That's so stupid!
E: CONT'D
C: AZMAT
D: Don't you talk to your mother like that!
C: KUMAIL
D: You don't care what I think. You just want me to follow the rules. But the rules don't make sense to me. I don't pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in years. I just go down there and I play video games.
C: AZMAT
D: You don't believe in Allah?
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't know what I believe, Dad! I don't know. And I can't marry someone you find for me.
C: SHARMEEN
D: And why not?
C: KUMAIL
D: Because I'm in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick but I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, it has made you good people, but I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own.
C: SHARMEEN
D: You're not my son.
N: Sharmeen turns her back on Kumail and heads towards the door.
C: AZMAT
D: Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not thinking about us. You're not thinking about Khadija. In fact you're not even thinking about that girl that you are in love with. You think American Dream is just about doing whatever you want and not thinking about other people?
E: MORE
C: AZMAT
D: You're wrong! You are wrong!
E: CONT'D
N: Sharmeen and Azmat leave. Chris comes back in.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey... I never went to the store. I was just listening at the door. My mom kicked me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I get it man.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER
N: Kumail walks in. He's had a rough morning. Terry and Beth are signing forms. Kumail approaches Terry.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth about what we talked about?
C: TERRY
D: We're gonna move her.
C: KUMAIL
D: What? What are you talking about? You fucking caved?
C: TERRY
D: I didn't cave. I don't cave.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're great. But we talked about this last night.
C: TERRY
D: I know. We're moving her. She's right.
N: Terry walks towards Beth as Kumail follows.
C: KUMAIL
D: What? No. I told you what the nurse said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that moving Emily could be a very bad idea.
C: BETH
D: Well Northwestern told us it could be very good.
C: KUMAIL
D: Well, they don't see her. This nurse sees her and she told me herself.
C: TERRY
D: It's okay. They don't need to see her.
N: Beth and Terry gather their things to leave, and Kumail grabs a form out of Terry's hand to stop him.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's not okay. There. I got it!
C: TERRY
D: That's a map of the garage.
N: Beth and Terry begin to walk down the hall.
C: KUMAIL
D: Wait, wait! Do you want to be responsible? She could die!
N: Beth stops.
C: BETH
D: Kumail, we're responsible for her no matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm sorry, we're moving her.
N: They head off.
S: EXT. QUICK'N HOT DRIVE THROUGH - LATER
N: Kumail pulls up in his car & talks to the DRIVE THRU box.
C: STU

C: KUMAIL
D: Just put 4 slices of cheese on a burger.
C: STU
D: We can't do that. There's no button -
C: KUMAIL
D: Who the fuck is this "we", man? Who the fuck is this "we"? It's me and you. We're just people. Fucking listen to me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING BURGER.
N: Silence.
C: STU
D: We can't do that.
C: KUMAIL
D: What the fuck, you fucking idiot?
N: Kumail gets out of the car, runs to the pick up window.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human being. You're a human being. Look at me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck me! Look at me. PLEASE!
E: CONT'D
C: STU
D: Today's my first day.
C: KUMAIL
D: Fuck you!
N: Kumail turns to the garbage can nearby and just starts pulling garbage out. He locks eyes with Stu.
C: STU
D: I'll just ring you up for four burgers.
N: STU looks down and starts typing.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry.
C: STU
D: Do you want any fries or drink with that?
E: un-emotional
C: KUMAIL
D: I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.
N: Kumail begins to put the trash back in the trash can.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Parked, Kumail sits scarfing down burgers and fries. He gets a text from Chris: "Where are you? You're up in 20!"
C: KUMAIL
D: Fuck!
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - SHOWROOM
N: Kumail enters. Big crowd. Mary's on stage. Chris runs up.
C: CHRIS
D: Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh wait, are you getting all dark and moody before your set? Yeah, punish yourself like a nasty little baby.
C: KUMAIL
D: I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?
C: CHRIS

N: Kumail walks towards CJ and Sam.
C: CHRIS
D: I'll get you all in the mood.
E: CONT'D to everyone
C: CJ
D: You all right?
C: KUMAIL
D: Why does everybody say the same fucking thing? Yeah, I'm doing great.
C: CJ
D: Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking.
N: Dodd runs up to Kumail.
C: DODD
D: The fuck've you been, man? You're on next!
N: Dodd runs off. On stage, Mary is doing well. Kumail's phone rings. It's Terry. Kumail hesitates. Then answers. We see Kumail's face. He doesn't say anything. On stage - Mary finishes her act. We hear Terry's voice on the call.
C: TERRY
D: Kumail, it's Terry. Listen, we're not moving here. The doctors, they said..
E: O.S.
N: We don't hear the rest of the call.
C: DODD
D: This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani!
N: Kumail is dazed. We see Bob Dalavan in the audience.
S: INT. TRIPLE DOOR - CONTINUOUS
N: Kumail slowly walks up to the stage. He stands there silently, looking at the audience. Then, finally...
C: KUMAIL
D: Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? Like that's the name of it, it's called cheese. I saw all these news reports, and they were like, there's a new drug, it's called cheese. Everyone's doing it in the Midwest, kids are doing it.
N: Titters. Barely anything. Bob Dalavan not laughing.
C: KUMAIL
D: It's just really hard to do stand-up comedy when your girlfriend is in a coma.
E: CONT'D
N: The audience laughs nervously.
C: KUMAIL
D: Not quite sure what part you're laughing at. They say she's fighting, but she doesn't look like she's fighting. She looks like she's just laying there. I said horrible things to her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like she gets excited every time she sees a bird. She's like, look at this, it's a bird. And I'm always like, yeah, they're all over the place, they're birds. But she likes that bird. Every bird she sees, she sees it.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
C: KUMAIL
D: Her dad just called and said that they can't transfer her because the infection has reached her heart. Which means... She could die.
E: CONT'D realizing for the 1st time

N: It's darker, less clinical-feeling at night in Emily's room. She's still the same, the beeping is the same, but there's something almost holy feeling in the room at night. Kumail sits quietly talking to her.
C: KUMAIL
D: I don't know if you can hear me or not, but it would be really good if you pulled through. If you have to go, you can go, but it would be really great if you stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I did -
N: Kumail continues to quietly talk to her.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - MORNING
N: Kumail wakes up in his filthy car the next morning to a text from Terry: "Please come right away".
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- DAY
N: Kumail walks through the hallway.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE EMILY'S ROOM - SAME
N: He looks inside the room. Emily is awake, surrounded by her parents and some doctors. Kumail watches through the window. Emily is groggy. The respirator is gone. Beth and Terry talk to her. She seems upset, can't talk. Kumail wants to go in but doesn't.
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM- DAY
N: Beth sits on Emily's bed. Terry, Dr. Cunningham, and Nurse Judy stand to the side.
C: EMILY
D: Mom. You're getting your tears all over me. When am I gonna be able to feel my face?
C: TERRY
D: You gave us quite a scare there, Scout.
C: EMILY
D: Scout?
C: TERRY
D: Come on. I call you that all the time.
C: EMILY
D: No. Not since I was a grown up.
C: TERRY
D: I've called you that your whole life!
N: Nurse Judy holds up a CUP for Emily to sip from. Emily spits out the liquid.
C: NURSE JUDY
D: Sorry hon.
C: EMILY
D: What is that crap?
C: NURSE JUDY
D: We have to thicken your liquids for a bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough to swallow yet.
C: EMILY
D: That shit tastes like semen.
C: TERRY
D: That's nice for a father to hear.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: She won't have any social inhibitions until the anesthetic wears off.
N: Nurse Judy holds the cup for Emily again, and she sips.
C: EMILY
D: It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try this.
N: Emily tries to grab the cup herself.
C: BETH
D: Oh wait a minute, honey!
N: Emily drops the cup. She's very upset. Beth comforts her.
C: TERRY
D: Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us forty eight dollars for it, don't worry about it.
N: Kumail walks in.
C: EMILY
D: Why are you here?
C: KUMAIL
D: I haven't heard her voice in a while.
E: to Beth and Terry
C: BETH
D: He's been here the whole time.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Could I speak with you both outside?
E: to Beth and Terry
N: Dr Cunningham motions for them to join her in the hall.
C: BETH
D: Honey, we'll be right outside.
E: to Emily
N: Terry and Beth and leave with Dr. Cunningham. Kumail approaches Emily.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey.
S: EXT. HALLWAY - SAME
N: Cunningham speaks with Terry and Beth.
C: DR. CUNNINGHAM
D: Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding.
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, yeah.
C: DR CUNNINGHAM
D: We gave her anti-inflammatories and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover but she'll be fine.
C: TERRY
D: Wow.
S: INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - SAME
N: Kumail speaks with Emily.
C: EMILY
D: What are you doing here?
C: KUMAIL
D: I was visiting someone down the hall and I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi to Emily.
C: EMILY
D: Oh.
C: KUMAIL
D: No, I'm joking, I was here for you.
C: EMILY
D: You're an asshole and I don't like you.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.
C: EMILY
D: No, you're an asshole.
C: KUMAIL
D: You have a lot of drugs in you so you're not thinking as clearly.
C: EMILY
D: Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny to me. You just make me sad. You make me sad inside of my heart, and it makes me sad to look at you. So I think you should probably go. Just go and tell my mom I want her.
N: Kumail doesn't know what to say.
C: EMILY
D: Will you please get my mom?
E: CONT'D
N: Kumail nods and heads out to the hallway.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Kumail goes up to Beth and Terry.
C: KUMAIL
D: Emily wants to see you.
N: Beth goes back inside Emily's room.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm gonna head out. I don't think I should be here.
E: CONT'D
C: TERRY
D: Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your living condition is a potential health risk and you're not that funny. But.... you're probably not suited to do anything else either so that's troublesome--
C: KUMAIL
D: You really made it sound like you were going to say something positive there.
C: TERRY
D: I guess I did, didn't I? You know I know the good stuff. You know how I feel. I gotta get in there.
N: Terry heads back inside.
S: INT. EMILY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Terry walks in. Beth sits on Emily's bed as Kumail watches through the window. Beth notices Kumail.
S: EXT. EMILY'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Beth comes outside into the hallway.
C: KUMAIL
D: So you gonna hang around Chicago for a while?
C: BETH
D: Yeah. She's got physical therapy.
C: KUMAIL
D: Did you ever think you'd be excited to have your daughter go through physical therapy? It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just never see each other again.
E: beat
N: Beth puts her hands on Kumail's face. She looks at him.
C: BETH
D: Maybe. But I hope not.
N: They smile. Kumail walks out of the hospital.
S: INT. COMEDY CLUB - A DIFFERENT NIGHT
N: Kumail backstage with other comics. Chris is on-stage. Kumail sits on a chair going over his notes. CJ and Mary walk up to him.
C: MARY
D: Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have something to tell you. We are moving to New York. And we want you to come with us.
C: KUMAIL
D: Are you serious?
C: CJ
D: You gotta do it. It's going to suck at first but we'll have each other and maybe eventually get paid to write jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on dude.
C: MARY
D: You have to come. I know you did not get Montreal and that is only because you did one of the worst sets I've ever seen in my goddamn life.
C: CJ
D: It was nonsense.
C: MARY
D: A living disgrace.
C: CJ
D: I would call it shit, but I would be worried that I'd be insulting actual shit.
C: MARY
D: Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I thought a ghost had passed right through me.
C: KUMAIL
D: We don't have to keep going over how bad the set was. I saw their faces and the noises they didn't make.
C: MARY
D: I felt one of my eggs die.
C: KUMAIL
D: Doesn't that happen every month?
C: MARY
D: It happens every month, Kumail, but I don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And that's what you made me do. I'm packing my things up and I'm moving to New York, and guess what, baby? You're coming with me.
C: KUMAIL
D: What about Chris?
N: Chris performs on stage.
C: MARY
D: He will be fine.
C: CJ
D: There's not enough room in the car, probably. We leave in a week, all right? And I already called shotgun Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this up.
C: MARY
D: Your destiny awaits!
C: CJ
D: This will be the biggest move of your life. Other than the one from Pakistan.
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- DAY
N: A "WELCOME HOME" banner hangs. Balloons. Beth, Terry, and EMILY'S FRIENDS are chatting. Emily sits on the couch chatting, a CANE by her side. Terry taps on a cup.
C: TERRY
D: Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody for coming. I just wanted to say a couple of words here.
N: Emily clocks Kumail as he WALKS IN holding a large bag.
C: EMILY
D: Why is Kumail here?
E: leans over to Beth
C: BETH
D: Cause he was there the whole time. I invited the nurses, I invited him.
C: TERRY
D: Emily, come on up here. I wanna say something.
N: Emily stands up and makes her way to Terry.
C: TERRY
D: Emily successfully peeled an orange this morning.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: TERRY
D: It was a clementine, full disclosure, it's those little ones that a baby monkey could peel, but she did it. And that's all, thank you everybody.
E: CONT'D
N: Kumail finally approaches Emily.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey. I like your cane. I've heard pimpin' ain't easy.
C: EMILY
D: Right.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey, can we talk for a second?
C: EMILY
D: Sure.
S: INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS
N: They walk in. Lots of jackets on the bed.
C: KUMAIL
D: So, I've been collecting some things that are important to me and I wanted to show them to you. I call this my bag of devotion.
N: Kumail presents the BIG BAG and starts to take items out. He holds up a bunch of HOSPITAL PASSES.
C: KUMAIL
D: This is all the visitor passes from when I visited you when you were in the-
E: CONT'D
N: He holds up some TICKET STUBS.
C: KUMAIL
D: These are the ticket stubs from when your parents came to see me perform and I realized how great they are, and how great you are, and how great honesty is.
E: CONT'D
N: He holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES.
C: EMILY
D: What did you do? Did you cremate someone?
C: KUMAIL
D: These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women - not the women - the pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, but it feels a little stupid.
N: Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily.
C: KUMAIL
D: I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But I've changed. And I am the person you need me to be. I really am. So, will you take me back?
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: Kumail, I'm really glad that you went through this experience, but you have to understand that all that happened while I was asleep. Like you felt one way a few weeks ago and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look at all of this, and I just think, I can't do it again. I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand?
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay.
N: Kumail packs up his bag of devotion. SONG PLAYS... "GET SHIT TOGETHER" MONTAGE -- Kumail drives a passenger around. -- Kumail cleans his room. -- Sharmeen, Azmat, Naveed, and Fatima have a family dinner. Kumail's not there. -- Emily does physical therapy with Beth and Terry. -- Kumail drives passengers around. -- Emily, Beth, and Terry eat take out together. -- Kumail at the theater works on his one-man show. -- Emily in bed with Beth sleeping next to her. Terry by himself on the sofa. -- Kumail and CJ put up fliers for Kumail's one man show. -- Kumail makes a Facebook page for his one man show.
S: INT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Kumail enters the dining room without knocking on the door. Azmat, Sharmeen, Naveed, and Fatima are eating dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE BAG.
C: KUMAIL
D: Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I am a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous. Standard parliamentary procedure. So all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand.
N: Kumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently.
C: KUMAIL
D: Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the family, denied. So you guys can just talk to me.
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone is silent.
C: KUMAIL
D: Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was going to happen. I have a solution.
E: CONT'D
N: Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them.
C: KUMAIL
D: "Hi. How are you?" It's just a real basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical. "Always with the comedy." Mom, made that one specially for you. "Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother Naveed?"
E: CONT'D
C: NAVEED
D: Bullshit.
N: Naveed and Azmat exchange a look.
C: KUMAIL
D: I admit this one is designed to stir up some controversy. "It's interesting how you can't really kick someone out of your family because they'll always be your family." I agree with that one. It's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you.
N: Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry I lied about the girls and the LSAT and all of that. That was wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving to New York to pursue stand-up, but I am not leaving this family.
E: CONT'D
N: Kumail leaves. Eye contact around the table.
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT
N: Emily on her bed. She impulsively Googles Kumail and finds his MONTREAL AUDITION, which is described as "WORST BOMB IN HISTORY!!!" She plugs her headphones in and watches a beat.
C: KUMAIL
D: My parents want me to get arrange married. Or as it's called in Pakistan, romance! Earlier today, I told them everything. I told them about my life. I told them about Emily. They kicked me out of the family. I may never talk to them again. So that happened -
E: V.O.
N: KNOCK on the door.
C: EMILY
D: What is it?
C: BETH
D: Can I come in?
E: O.S.
C: EMILY
D: Okay.
N: Beth enters. Emily closes her laptop.
C: EMILY
D: I swear you and Dad are just like my freshman year roommate, but instead of boning random dudes, you're just parenting all the time. All over the place. In every room of the house. Including right next to me.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: We gotta go.
C: EMILY
D: Home?
N: Beth nods.
C: EMILY
D: No.
E: CONT'D
C: BETH
D: Yeah, it's time.
C: EMILY
D: I'm not ready.
C: BETH
D: Yeah, you know what? You're strong and you are.
S: EXT. PLAYGROUND THEATER - NIGHT
N: The marquee says "KUMAIL NANJIANI: CITIZEN". People filing into the theater.
S: INT. PLAYGROUND STAGE - NIGHT
N: Mid-show.
C: KUMAIL
D: And we'd go to the mosque and hear graphic details of religious people being killed 1400 years ago. I mean like Tarantino-esque details. And everyone would be crying, like competing to see who could cry the hardest. And I could never cry. And I was like, what is wrong with me? Am I broken?
E: MORE
C: KUMAIL
D: The only time I've cried that much is when I watched the first 15 minutes of Up. This is a picture of me and my mother. I'm seven years old.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Beth is in the bathroom while Terry stands in the kitchen drinking a glass of water.
C: TERRY
D: You know people talk about New York water but Chicago water is very underrated, I think. It's good.
N: Emily comes into the living room.
C: EMILY
D: Hey guys, I think I might just pop out for a bit.
C: TERRY
D: By yourself?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe get some frozen yogurt.
C: TERRY
D: Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk by yourself?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, Dad.
C: BETH
D: Have fun.
C: TERRY
D: If you feel a coma coming on, call us.
C: EMILY
D: Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see you in the morning.
C: TERRY
D: Love you, bye.
C: BETH
D: Have fun.
C: EMILY
D: I will.
C: TERRY
D: Got your phone?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah.
S: INT. PLAYGROUND THEATRE - LATER
N: Kumail is with Naveed in the empty theatre. Naveed wears sunglasses.
C: KUMAIL
D: But you liked it, huh?
C: NAVEED
D: Yeah. I mean, yeah.
N: Emily enters hesitantly.
C: KUMAIL
D: Hey!
C: EMILY
D: Hi...
C: KUMAIL
D: What are you doing here?
C: EMILY
D: I was in the neighborhood and I saw that you were gonna be here so I thought I'd come say hi.
C: KUMAIL
D: You look great. How's your blood oxygen level?
C: EMILY
D: Oh, well within range.
C: KUMAIL
D: Nice.
N: They stand there. It's tense.
C: KUMAIL
D: Uh, this is my brother, Naveed.
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: Hi, I'm Emily.
C: NAVEED
D: I've heard lots about you.
C: EMILY
D: It's so good to finally meet you. There's actually something I wanted to tell you.
E: to Kumail
N: Naveed clocks the tension between them.
C: NAVEED
D: Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye.
N: Naveed slips out as Emily and Kumail stare at each other.
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - SAME
N: Terry lies on the pull out sofa. Just before Beth gets to Emily's room she stops.
C: BETH
D: Are you warm enough?
C: TERRY
D: Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of socks on.
N: She smiles, walks into Emily's bedroom. Terry gets under the covers. Beth reemerges and approaches his couch-bed.
C: BETH
D: Do you mind?
C: TERRY
D: No... no...
N: Beth gets under the covers with him. They snuggle.
C: BETH
D: I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.
C: TERRY
D: Me too. See? I should have brushed my teeth.
C: BETH
D: I like it.
S: INT. PLAYGROUND THEATRE - LATER
N: Kumail and Emily sit on the bed from his show together.
C: EMILY
D: When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're going to have this completely new lease on life and feel totally different about everything. Like cherish every sunrise. And for the most part I just feel like, ugh I can't get up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. Are you doing a lot of stand-up?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy Festival audition, like horrifically.
C: EMILY
D: I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great.
C: KUMAIL
D: I know.
C: EMILY
D: But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I liked.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm moving to New York.
C: EMILY
D: Really?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna drive out. We have a place already.
C: EMILY
D: When do you leave?
C: KUMAIL
D: Next weekend.
N: This kinda hits them both like a ton of bricks.
C: EMILY
D: I'm so excited for you. That is great. I think you are going to do so great in New York.
C: KUMAIL
D: What were you going to say?
C: EMILY
D: What?
C: KUMAIL
D: You said you were going to say something to me. What was it?
C: EMILY
D: Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My parents told me everything you did for me and I feel like the last time we spoke I didn't properly thank you so-
C: KUMAIL
D: Oh yeah. Totally fine.
C: EMILY
D: I should probably go.
C: KUMAIL
D: Do you wanna call an Uber?
C: EMILY
D: No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has been really great. Okay, bye.
N: They smile at each other.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: CJ, Mary, Kumail, and Chris are packing BOXES into a car.
C: CHRIS
D: The scene is gonna be so different with you guys gone.
C: KUMAIL
D: You should... come out...
C: CHRIS
D: Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm gonna miss you.
N: Kumail and Chris hug.
C: CHRIS
D: Get out of here, you assholes.
C: MARY
D: Come here, you big dummy.
N: Chris hugs Mary. Kumail is distracted as a CAR pulls up nearby. Kumail stares at it. After a beat, Kumail's dad Azmat pops out and walks up to Kumail.
C: AZMAT
D: You are still kicked out of the family, but because we did not get a proper chance to say bye to you... Your mother is so angry with you. She is not going to get out of the car. She's not even going to look at you. And I don't believe you kept so much secret from me, your father.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'm sorry.
C: AZMAT
D: Here. She asked me to give this to you.
N: Azmat hands Kumail a TUPPERWARE CONTAINER.
C: AZMAT
D: Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite. She made it herself specially for you with extra potatoes.
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: Thank you Ma.
N: Kumail looks to the car. Sharmeen is in the backseat. She averts her gaze when she sees him looking at her.
C: KUMAIL
D: Is she okay?
E: CONT'D
C: AZMAT
D: Right now? No.
C: KUMAIL
D: I'll miss you.
C: AZMAT
D: I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye forever. And do me a favor, when you reach New York, just text us and tell us that you've reached safely, okay?
N: Kumail nods.
C: KUMAIL
D: Dad, can I ask you something? When you and Mom went on your first date, what movie did you see?
C: AZMAT
D: Satte pe Satta.
E: thinks, then
N: Azmat hums a snippet of a song from the movie.
C: AZMAT
D: Her favorite song. Why are you asking?
E: CONT'D
C: KUMAIL
D: Just curious.
N: Azmat nods and heads back to the car. He gets in and drives off. Kumail gets in the car with CJ and Mary and they drive off.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT - WEEKS LATER
N: Shots of NYC.
S: INT. UNION HALL - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
N: Kumail performs comedy in front of a room full of NEW YORK HIPSTERS. He's killing. CJ and Mary are there too. Kumail takes a sip of water.
C: KUMAIL
D: So the first time I came to America, I was fourteen and I was just visiting my uncle in New York and it just happened to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in America, my uncle took me to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like, this is every day in America! As advertised. Every day they have a party celebrating Garfield. No day has lived up to that day. So I was lying to my parents, I was telling them I was gonna be a lawyer. And they're very disappointed cause they wanted me to be a doctor. And you guys are like, why didn't you just tell them that you wanted to be a doctor?
E: MORE
C: KUMAIL
D: It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it has to be believable. If I told them I want to be a doctor, they'd be like, "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause there's a strict hierarchy: doctor, engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs, ISIS, then comedian.
E: CONT'D
N: A very loud WHOOOOO emanates from the crowd. Kumail looks out to the crowd to see Emily, beaming at him. He is taken aback.
C: KUMAIL
D: Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to heckle comedians.
E: CONT'D stumbling
C: EMILY
D: Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of woo-hooed you.
C: KUMAIL
D: Well see that's a common misconception. Heckling doesn't have to be negative.
C: EMILY
D: So if I was like, oh my god, you're amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?
C: KUMAIL
D: Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs than me, and I don't like that. Do you want to come up, do my job? Are you from out of town, m'am?
C: EMILY
D: Chicago.
C: KUMAIL
D: Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to New York?
C: EMILY
D: I'm here to see someone.
C: KUMAIL
D: And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I don't know what your deal is.
C: EMILY
D: Yeah, I've seen him.
N: They smile at each other. THE END
