N: "... the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing. The trick... is to see it." IN BLACK... ... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of BOOGIE-WOOGIE. Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up. THEN... ... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard: "GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!" Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain. In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and- footprints in the wet cement. Another postcard: "I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!" In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at the Brown Derby. Or Ciro's. Or the Coconut Grove... More postcards. Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and I know today. These are palaces. Temples. Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian. The Carthay Circle. The Paramount, the Million Dollar. From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall. The ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat. The popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.
T: CUT TO:
N: THE PILE OF POSTCARDS a wild jumble. Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top of the pile. It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN. We PUSH INTO THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE... ... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer, until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and behind it until we're looking down at...
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT
N: SUPER TITLE: 1951 A gigantic aerial shot. Postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come. Darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town, a swath of garishly bright concrete called HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is. This is what it's like. I'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town.
E: V.O.
N: Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the street to GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: Born and raised here, thank you very much. Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else. But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload. To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing "The African Queen."
E: V.O.
N: And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE AFRICAN QUEEN." Still the same shot, buses disgorge TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater. The MEN doff their hats and mop their brows. The WOMEN pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to THE THEATER ENTRANCE, where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their tickets.
C: DOORMAN
D: Newsreel's just starting, folks.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: That's me and my girlfriend. Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland. She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing. The first picture I ever wrote, a little potboiler called "Sand Pirates of the Sahara." Okay, it ain't "Citizen Kane," but you gotta start somewhere.
E: V.O.
N: MOVING INTO THE LOBBY an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light. We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect USHERS and we move into THE DARKENED THEATER. As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the same shot -- we see the screen... A NEWSREEL. As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:
C: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
D: Bringing the news of the world to you!
N: Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!"
C: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
D: Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood.
N: We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.
C: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
D: Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them. Well, come after them they did! And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper!
N: Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.
C: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
D: And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress! This should give you fellas something to write about now! A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood!
N: In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh. As the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we WHEEL AROUND AND... ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR. Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet pretty girl in her mid-20s. As she rummages in her purse, Pete watches the newsreel.
C: SANDRA
D: Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
C: PETE
D: You bet, honey.
N: Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on his face.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: We were young, we were in love, and we were working in pictures. Life... was good.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNING
N: Pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow convertible Plymouth. The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him. Pete lights up a cigarette. We get a better sense of him now. Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast talker.
C: PETE
D: Mornin', Ray. Whaddya know whaddya say? Me and Sandra caught "The African Queen" at the Chinese last night. Great picture, great picture.
E: very chipper
N: Ray is nonplussed. Tips his hat. Regards Pete suspiciously.
C: RAY
D: Mr. Appleton.
C: PETE
D: What's with this "Mr. Appleton" crap? Your boss hiding in there?
C: RAY
D: You're clear to go in.
C: PETE
D: What's that mean?
N: Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head.
C: RAY
D: Have a pleasant day.
N: Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
S: EXT. UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNING
N: Pete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks around and goes inside.
S: INT. WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING
N: Pete comes down the hall a few steps, stops. Something's wrong. It's awfully quiet. He pokes his head into the door marked "TYPING POOL."
S: INT. TYPING POOL - MORNING
N: A sea of black Underwoods -- all silent. The lights in the room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in through the windows. One typists, LOUISE, is going from machine to machine, pulling covers over them.
C: PETE
D: Louise... what gives?
N: She looks up, startled.
C: LOUISE
D: Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave everybody the day off... while they sort things out.
C: PETE
D: Sort what out? Are my pages done?
C: LOUISE
D: They took 'em.
C: PETE
D: They took 'em? Who took 'em? Louise, what's going on...
C: LOUISE
D: Pete, I'm not even supposed to be talking to you...
N: She rushes past him. Pete doesn't quite know what to think.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Good morning, Peter.
E: O.S.
N: Pete turns. The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY, a rotund man in his fifties. He wears a perfectly tailored silk suit.
C: PETE
D: Leo... what's going on?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STUDIO STREET - DAY
N: FROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the Writer's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all done up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary. As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side, it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been told. PETE AND LEO
C: LEO
D: Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
C: PETE
D: I... I don't believe this.
C: LEO
D: Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
C: PETE
D: Who the hell is this "they?"
C: LEO
D: Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings?
E: deliberately
C: PETE
D: No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
E: on the spot
C: LEO
D: So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
C: PETE
D: Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
C: LEO
D: You should watch what you say.
C: PETE
D: I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
C: LEO
D: Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
C: PETE
D: What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
E: frustrated
C: LEO
D: They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.
C: PETE
D: Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!
C: LEO
D: Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
C: PETE
D: I was decorated.
C: LEO
D: I know. A Purple Heart.
C: PETE
D: Exactly.
C: LEO
D: You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
C: PETE
D: At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
C: LEO
D: You can't testify.
C: PETE
D: Why not?
N: Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself.
C: LEO
D: Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible. What can I say? I like you.
N: Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own. Puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder.
C: LEO
D: They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
C: PETE
D: Yeah, well, that's enough.
E: under his breath
C: LEO
D: Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
C: PETE
D: "Ashes To Ashes?"
C: LEO
D: That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
C: PETE
D: So, it is a blacklist.
C: LEO
D: Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
E: defensive calm
C: PETE
D: Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
E: sullenly then, pissed
N: Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.
C: LEO
D: Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point.
E: hand on Pete's shoulder
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" poster. Pete reaches up and takes it down. He leans it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair. He swivels around to see A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD standing by the door. He's watching Pete's every move. Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's belongings. Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer. He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk. He looks at the cover of the first one: "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951 Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one:
C: "ASHES TO ASHES"
D: By Peter Appleton
N: He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box, which contains somewhat more personal items. A ragged gold pillow with tassels. Legal pads of notes. An old tin-toy fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn. He turns it around in his hands.
C: PETE
D: Huh. Red...
E: musing
N: Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.
C: SANDRA
D: Pete? Pete...?
E: O.S.
N: Sandra appears in the doorway. She's in costume -- a Louis XIV courtier. She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and embraces him.
C: SANDRA
D: Oh, Pete...
N: They kiss. The Guard watches their every move.
C: SANDRA
D: What happened?
C: PETE
D: What exactly did you hear?
C: SANDRA
D: That you got let go.
C: PETE
D: I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
C: SANDRA
D: He was, but he got sick. We got a new director today. Why?
C: PETE
D: Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
C: SANDRA
D: You mean, he was... let go, too?
C: PETE
D: They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
E: sotto, an appeal
N: During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling away from Pete.
C: PETE
D: A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be! Right?
N: Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.
C: SANDRA
D: Of course, but I... I don't know how I... how much help I can be to you. This is the sort of thing... someone saying you're a communist... it can ruin your career.
E: nervously
N: Pete sees where this is going. She's edging toward the door.
C: PETE
D: Will you help me, Sandy?
C: SANDRA
D: I'll have to think about this. I have to get back... I should go...
N: And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye. Pete looks at the Guard.
C: PETE
D: So nice to be a pariah.
N: The Guard turns away. Pete moves back toward the boxes. Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels with barely one swig left. He regards the bottle for a moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't), pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it. He looks at it thoughtfully as we
T: CUT TO:
N: A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop. WIDER
S: INT. THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT
N: The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly getting stewed. The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive, dimly lit and full of character and characters. It's a quiet night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar. Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.
C: JERRY
D: Pete. You think maybe you've had enough?
C: PETE
D: Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
E: raises the shot
N: He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.
C: PETE
D: Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
E: trying to light a smoke
C: JERRY
D: What.
C: PETE
D: You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
C: JERRY
D: The G-man?
E: helps Pete light his cigarette
C: PETE
D: Zackly.
E: thickly
C: JERRY
D: Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
C: PETE
D: Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
C: JERRY
D: You should watch what you say. You don't know who's listening.
E: glancing around
C: PETE
D: You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
C: JERRY
D: Sure, I suppose. That why you're on a bender?
C: PETE
D: This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
N: Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar. He watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it. Pete reaches for the bottle, but Jerry is faster.
C: JERRY
D: Pete... go home. Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
C: PETE
D: Sandra Sinclair.
E: laughs
C: JERRY
D: Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
C: PETE
D: Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
C: JERRY
D: I wanna close up soon. C'mon, let's call her.
N: Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills on the bar and grabs his hat.
C: PETE
D: Nope. Can't. We're through.
C: JERRY
D: Then I'll call you a cab.
C: PETE
D: I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
E: beat
N: Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his condition.
C: PETE
D: 'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
C: JERRY
D: Pete...
N: And he's out the door.
S: EXT. FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath, then totters briskly towards his car. He hauls the door open and sits inside heavily.
S: INT./ EXT. PETE'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably be a good idea.
C: PETE
D: Drive. Drive. Bad idea. Too drunk to drive.
E: mumbling
N: He looks at his watch.
C: PETE
D: One-thirty. Huh! Early. Can't go home yet.
N: He turns the key and hits the starter. The engine hums to life. Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze and puts the car in gear. The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt and stalls.
C: PETE
D: Oops.
N: He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and down the deserted boulevard.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT
N: The full moon is low over the ocean. Pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away. The ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight. Pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring. The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.
C: PETE
D: Huh? Whatsa...
N: Instantly, he grabs his head.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: I had no idea how I got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea. I don't think I could've faced the headache I had alone in my apartment. At least I had the ocean air.
E: V.O.
N: Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing. He gets out his cigarettes and lights up. He takes a puff and glances at his watch.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: Three forty-five. I had only been there for a couple of hours at most. Truth be told, I was still fairly drunk.
E: V.O.
N: He starts the car and heads for the highway.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: I'd head north until the sun came up or I ran out of gas, whichever came first.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop. Waves crash to the shore below the roadway.
S: INT./ EXT. PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
N: Pete is finally relaxed. He takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat. He takes a deep breath -- with the wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace. He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the fuel gauge. INSERT - FUEL GAUGE Pinning on "empty."
C: PETE
D: Shit.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: Guess which came first.
E: V.O.
N: He scans the road ahead -- nothing. Glances to his right. PETE'S POV The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance. Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights. He passes a hand-painted sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT
N: Pete's car rolls up and stops. There's a light on the sign and another in the station's window, but the place is deserted.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: I should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like I had a lot of choices.
E: V.O.
N: Pete looks ahead toward the town. Its few lights twinkle in the distance.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: What the hell. At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours. I'd get some pie and coffee, and then I could worry about the gas.
E: V.O.
N: Pete pulls out onto the road.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted roadside sign which reads:
C: SLOW!
D: NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL USE CAUTION!
S: INT./ EXT. PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
N: Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading "LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge. Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge... HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD ... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless possum... Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the edge...
S: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
N: ... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly-moving water below!
S: EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT
N: The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is intense. Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat (thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the windshield. But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle. Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
S: EXT. THE WASH - NIGHT
N: Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air. His fight isn't over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. He swims with all his might toward the far bank.
S: EXT. FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT
N: Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to his feet.
C: PETE
D: Oh my god! I don't believe... oh my god...
E: gasping
N: He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel hits a rock... Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow on another rock. He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and lands face down in the mud.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: IN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing sound -- the sound of a dog...
T: FADE IN:
N: ON A DOG'S FACE A yellow labrador, full frame. It takes a couple more sniffs, then starts licking furiously.
C: OLD MAN'S VOICE
D: Maggie, whatcha got there? Huh, girl? Whatcha find?
E: O.S.
S: EXT. FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN
N: Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently licked in the face by the dog. ON THE OLD MAN A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an old railroad cap. He comes down to Pete, and using his walking stick, pokes him in the side.
C: OLD MAN
D: Mister, who are ya? my dog likes you, but that don't mean much, she likes skunks, too. Sweet n'stupid, that's why I keep her.
N: Pete blinks up at the Old Man, his mouth gaping open.
C: OLD MAN
D: Mister, you okay? You look wet. You in an accident or somethin'?
C: PETE
D: I... I don't know.
N: He sits up, and the Old Man gets a look at his head, which is caked with mud and blood on one side.
C: OLD MAN
D: You best come with me. Can ya walk?
C: PETE
D: I... yes, I think so.
N: He stands up shakily. The Old Man gives Pete a hand.
C: OLD MAN
D: Come on, we'll have the Doc look you over.
C: PETE
D: My head hurts.
C: OLD MAN
D: I shouldn't be surprises. You smell like that was quite a night before you had there. Maggie! Let's go now!
E: to the dog
N: And they head toward the road to town. BOOMING UP, we SEE them pass a roadside sign: ON THE SIGN:
C: WELCOME TO LAWSON, CALIFORNIA
D: EST. 1869 ELEV. 275 POP. 1755
C: THE TOWN
D: THAT GAVE ITS ALL
C: OLD MAN
D: Name's Stanton Lawson. My ancestors founded this town.
E: STANTON
C: PETE
D: Ancestors?
C: STANTON
D: Actually, my grandpap. But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it? Here.
E: hands Pete a handkerchief
N: Pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the blood off his face.
C: PETE
D: I suppose. Thanks.
C: STANTON
D: You look familiar, fella. What's your name?
N: Pete stops, thinks for a moment.
C: PETE
D: I'm... I... I honestly don't know.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON, CALIFORNIA - DAY
N: Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag through the center of the small town. Lawson is a bit run down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit. Despite that, there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar All-American feel. Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.
C: PETE
D: They all know you?
C: STANTON
D: 'Course they all know me. And I know all them. Town's got my name, don't it?
N: They pass the window of the drug store, COLE'S PHARMACY. Pete looks down and sees
T: TWO FADED GOLD STARS
N: in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered black crepe. Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off to war and didn't come back. Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.
C: STANTON
D: Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor. Lost both his boys in the war. Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
C: PETE
D: The war...
E: thinking
C: STANTON
D: Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max. Okinawa, I believe.
E: points across the street
N: ANGLE - MABEL'S DINER A typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star prominent in the window. CLOSER On MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s. She stares vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing a coffee refill.
C: STANTON
D: All told, this little town gave sixty-two of its finest to the war. Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. More'n its share, I should say. Got us a letter from President Truman. City council commissioned a war memorial. Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years. Town never had the heart to put it up. Place just hasn't been the same since the war.
N: STANTON AND PETE Pete looks longingly toward the diner. Stanton takes note.
C: STANTON
D: You hungry, son?
C: PETE
D: Yes. Very.
C: STANTON
D: Got any money?
N: Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three quarters.
C: STANTON
D: Six bits. More'n enough to buy some breakfast. C'mon.
N: And they head across the street.
T: CUT TO:
N: A PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE A fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices. WIDER
S: INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAY
N: Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only to wash it down with gulps of coffee. MABEL stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed in record time. Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS, for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy. He stops in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely. He smiles at Mabel.
C: PETE
D: Pie's... good.
E: mouth full
C: MABEL
D: Like you could tell. Where'd you find him?
E: wryly to Stanton
C: STANTON
D: Down by the wash.
C: MABEL
D: We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed. Three people have died there, Mister. You're lucky to be alive.
E: to Pete
C: PETE
D: Thanks. More coffee?
E: draining the coffee cup
N: Mabel obliges. As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete.
C: MABEL
D: You know, you look familiar. You ever been in here before?
N: Pete shakes his head.
C: STANTON
D: He don't remember who he is, Mabel. Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in.
C: MABEL
D: Doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute... You sure you never been in here?
E: distractedly to Pete
N: Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly.
C: PETE
D: I'd remember this pie.
N: Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete.
C: MABEL
D: I'll just get you another piece.
E: patting his hand
S: EXT. COMMERCE STREET - DAY
N: A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner. There's a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about. After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s. He comes up behind Harry and claps him on the back.
C: LARDNER
D: 'Mornin' Harry. Fine day, isn't it?
C: HARRY
D: Morning, Doc. Yes, yes it looks just fine.
C: LARDNER
D: Plenty to do today?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, yes, plenty. Plenty.
E: vaguely
N: They're at the door of the diner. Doc opens it for Harry.
C: LARDNER
D: After you.
S: INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAY
N: Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup of coffee and bags him a bear claw.
C: LARDNER
D: Mornin' Mabel, Stan.
C: MABEL
D: Mornin' Doc. Got some new business for you today.
N: Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the bump on his head.
C: LARDNER
D: Hello, son. How'd that happen?
C: STANTON
D: He don't know. And he don't know his name, neither. Found him down by the wash.
C: LARDNER
D: You'd better come with me, son. On my tab?
E: to Mabel, indicating the coffee and danish
C: MABEL
D: You bet.
N: Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door. Pete turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel.
C: PETE
D: Thanks. Great pie.
C: MABEL
D: You're welcome. Come again.
E: blushing
N: ON HARRY seated at the opposite end of the counter. He glances up at Pete. HARRY'S POV as Pete smiles at Mabel and turns to go. ON HARRY His mouth falls open, his hand moves to cover it. He's just seen a ghost... HARRY'S POV - SLOW MOTION... ... as the three men pass by the diner's window. CLOSE - HARRY
C: HARRY
D: Sweet Jesus...
E: wide eyed
T: CUT TO:
N: A FINGER -- moving left-to-right, right-to-left through space.
C: LARDNER'S VOICE
D: Follow my finger. Just use your eyes. That's it. Good.
N: WIDER
S: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
N: Doc Lardner is checking Pete's eyes. Pete sits on an examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged. Stanton lurks in the corner, Maggie curled at his feet.
C: STANTON
D: He was passed out cold. Maggie woke 'im.
C: LARDNER
D: Uh-huh. He looks familiar. Open your mouth. Say "ah."
E: to Pete
N: Pete does. Lardner has a look as Stanton pulls out a pocket watch.
C: STANTON
D: Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
E: looks at his watch
C: PETE
D: Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
C: STANTON
D: Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
N: Stanton and Maggie exit. Lardner checks Pete's ears.
C: LARDNER
D: Any idea how you got here, son?
C: PETE
D: No, sir.
N: Lardner sniffs him.
C: LARDNER
D: Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
C: PETE
D: I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
E: smacks his lips and frowns
C: LARDNER
D: Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
C: PETE
D: I guess I did.
C: LARDNER
D: Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
N: Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete.
C: LARDNER
D: Here, one of mine.
C: PETE
D: Thanks.
N: Pete puts on the shirt.
C: LARDNER
D: Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
C: PETE
D: It's possible. I just don't remember.
C: LARDNER
D: And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
C: PETE
D: I... no, I... I just can't...
E: frustrated
C: LARDNER
D: It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
E: gently
N: Pete stifles a laugh.
C: LARDNER
D: What is it?
C: PETE
D: Call me... Ishmael?
C: LARDNER
D: Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw. Pete is standing, nosing around the office -- diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks. He zeros in on one photo in particular. ON THE PHOTO one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN. They've been fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch than Lardner.
C: LARDNER
D: Stanton found him by the wash. Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is. We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him. You bet. He'll be here.
E: into phone
N: Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures.
C: LARDNER
D: That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy. Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
C: PETE
D: She's very pretty.
C: LARDNER
D: Thanks. Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
N: Lardner stares at him. Pete takes note, turns toward him.
C: LARDNER
D: ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
C: PETE
D: Wish I could say the same thing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out. As he gets a few steps from the door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him.
C: HARRY
D: Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
E: excited
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
E: startled
C: HARRY
D: Listen to me! The young man in there...
N: Eldridge keeps moving to the door.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just...
E: interrupting
N: Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders.
C: HARRY
D: Cecil, listen to me!
N: The sheriff stops.
C: HARRY
D: It's Luke.
E: breathless
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete. He's staring at him intently. Silence.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: No wallet, huh?
C: LARDNER
D: No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
E: beat
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right?
E: to Pete
C: PETE
D: Yes.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
C: PETE
D: No. But...
C: ELDRIDGE
D: But what?
C: PETE
D: Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: What's that?
C: PETE
D: "It's a Wonderful Life."
C: ELDRIDGE
D: The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh?
C: PETE
D: "It's a Wonderful Life?"
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Or the Bijou. Either one.
C: PETE
D: I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
N: The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
C: LARDNER
D: By all means.
N: Eldridge opens the door.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Harry, why don't you come on in here.
E: to someone offscreen
N: Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair. He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete. He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe. PETE looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face... HARRY has tears forming in his eyes. A smile turns up the corners of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face.
C: LARDNER
D: Are you saying that he's...
E: softly, to Eldridge
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Shhhhhh.
E: smiling broadly
N: Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing.
C: HARRY
D: I knew all along. I knew you were alive! Oh, Luke...
N: Pete doesn't quite know what to think. He clearly has no idea who this old man is.
C: LARDNER
D: Mother o'god...
E: mouth agape in disbelief
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Give the man a hug, boy! That's your father!
E: to Pete
N: Pete looks at Harry. It's not so much that he remembers anything -- he's swept up in the moment.
C: PETE
D: My father...?
N: Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly, glancing over at ELDRIDGE AND LARDNER who look on goofily, fighting back tears. They smile at Pete, who smiles back tentatively.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
C: PETE
D: The Bijou?
C: LARDNER
D: That's where you live.
C: PETE
D: We live in a theater?
C: HARRY
D: Only one in town. Get in, son.
E: he opens the car door for Pete
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Ben, when's Delly due back?
E: sotto, to Lardner
C: LARDNER
D: Tomorrow afternoon... ... oh my god...
E: sotto seized by a thought
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Exactly. Break it to her gently.
E: sotto
N: Eldridge and Harry get in the car. Lardner comes over to Pete's back seat window.
C: LARDNER
D: Get plenty of rest, Luke. You took a pretty big wallop there.
N: He turns to move away, then turns back.
C: LARDNER
D: Good to have you back.
N: Eldridge starts the car and they drive away. (NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE." It'll be easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling him Luke, anyway. Trust me.)
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY
N: Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat all to himself. He leans forward toward the front seat and taps Harry on the shoulder.
C: LUKE
D: Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
C: HARRY
D: Harry, son. Harry.
C: LUKE
D: And... what's my name again?
C: HARRY
D: Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
C: LUKE
D: Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
E: taking it for a spin
N: Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street. HIS POV Shops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going about their lives. A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes by.
C: LUKE
D: How long have I been gone?
N: Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead.
C: LUKE
D: How long?
N: Pause. The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. He turns around in his seat and faces Luke.
C: HARRY
D: You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
E: gently
C: LUKE
D: When did I leave?
C: HARRY
D: You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
N: Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in.
C: HARRY
D: Nine and-a-half years ago.
C: LUKE
D: Nine and-a-half years...
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.
S: EXT. IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY
N: Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Here we are.
C: HARRY
D: Well, son, you're home!
N: Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open... HIS POV - THE BIJOU. The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building styles. It's as though the architect took random parts of a Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result. As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was "The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message " HE B J U" was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet. And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B J U" sign becomes apparent. Train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle. As we watch, a TRAIN ROARS BY. Everything shakes. It's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake. The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers. LUKE stares at the monstrosity. His face is ashen. His heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees. The Bijou. Harry jumps out of the car excitedly.
C: HARRY
D: Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Don't mention it. Welcome home, Luke.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks.
E: faint smile
N: Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out. Harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.
C: HARRY
D: Wait'll you see the inside!
C: LUKE
D: Can't wait.
E: deadpan
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
N: The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior. Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls. It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect. Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater -- A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER. Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions. TILT DOWN TO REVEAL Luke and Harry standing below. Luke is lost in a gulf somewhere between surprise and disgust.
C: HARRY
D: We've been closed for a while.
C: LUKE
D: Ah.
E: smiling wanly
N: Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one open.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front. THE SCREEN is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery. In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano. Luke walks a few steps down the aisle. He picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits. As he does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage. Harry comes over and sits behind him.
C: LUKE
D: Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
E: turning to Harry
C: HARRY
D: Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
C: LUKE
D: Why?
C: HARRY
D: Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
E: deep breath
C: LUKE
D: Didn't you have any help?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
E: brightening rises, grabs Luke's arm
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY
N: The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater. It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room. A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS. One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke. It's a Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He has one arm around Harry and the other around his mother. (And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)
C: HARRY
D: The day you shipped out. That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her. Last time I saw you.
N: He smiles.
C: HARRY
D: Till today.
N: Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine looking woman. It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from the 30's.
C: HARRY
D: That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
C: LUKE
D: Mother. She's beautiful.
E: repeating to Harry
C: HARRY
D: Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
E: coming over
N: He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently replaces it on the table. Luke goes over to the sofa and sits.
C: HARRY
D: Can I get you anything? I can put some coffee on or some...
E: brightly
N: Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep on the sofa. He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts them onto the sofa. Removes his shoes, sets them on the floor.
T: CUT TO:
N: A BLANKET being drawn up Luke's chest. HARRY stands, looks down warmly at his son. Then, suddenly, he's seized by a thought. He turns and crosses to the window. CLOSE - THE WINDOW There's a small picture frame in the window. Harry reaches down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around. ON THE FRAME It's a single, faded gold star. One war casualty. Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping Luke and smiles.
C: HARRY
D: When I woke up this morning, my son was dead. Now, I have my boy again. I have my boy again.
E: softly closes his eyes
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. BIJOU APARTMENT - MORNING
N: It's early morning. Luke is sound asleep, still in his clothes. In the distance, a train sounds its HORN. Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed. Something's strange, though. He frowns. The train is GETTING CLOSER. Luke's eyes POP OPEN. LUKE'S POV As the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.
C: HARRY
D: 'Morning, Son.
E: smiling
C: ELDERLY WOMAN
D: Good morning, Luke.
E: smiling
C: ELDERLY BLACK MAN
D: 'Mornin'.
E: no expression
C: HARRY
D: Sleep well?
N: Luke is speechless. It he dreaming this?
C: HARRY
D: They couldn't wait to see you.
C: LUKE
D: Who... are they?
C: HARRY
D: This is the staff of the Bijou.
C: LUKE
D: Oh. What... what time is it?
C: HARRY
D: Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
N: Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more awake. He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.
C: HARRY
D: Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced. Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.
N: Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand. She's tiny, seventy if she's a day. She smiles and curtsies slightly. Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Head cashier and refreshments clerk. So glad to have you back, my boy! Much more handsome than I remember him.
E: to Harry
C: HARRY
D: And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian. Luke, meet Old Tim. You remember Luke, don't you?
E: to Old Tim
N: OLT TIM is -- well, old. His clothes are a tad shabby, but well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly frame. He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly removes as he shakes Luke's hand. He's a man of few words, his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles.
C: LUKE
D: Is there a young Tim?
C: OLD TIM
D: No.
C: LUKE
D: Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
N: Pause.
C: OLD TIM
D: I'm old.
N: Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm.
C: HARRY
D: Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Luke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen. Old Time lags a few steps behind. At the orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit. The screen is a sea of repair patches. Harry pats it. Dust flies.
C: HARRY
D: 'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway.
C: OLD TIM
D: I n-need me a new uniform.
N: Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry.
C: HARRY
D: I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
E: to Luke to Old Tim
C: LUKE
D: You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
N: Silence from the group.
C: LUKE
D: I thought so.
N: Beat. Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up the aisle.
C: HARRY
D: Anyone want to see the projector?
T: CUT TO:
N: TWO CARBON ARCS are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan motor. A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT. A metal door is closed over the arcs.
S: INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY
N: Harry dances around to the other side of the projector and adjusts the focus on the beam of light. The others look on as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window.
C: HARRY
D: Beautiful. Bright and even from edge to edge. See for yourself.
N: The carbons sputter and die. The light flickers out. Harry is crestfallen, turns off the motor.
C: HARRY
D: She's always been a bit tricky.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
N: Mrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a ragged feather duster, a hopeless task. Old Tim is on a rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the ladder. Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath. Mrs. Terwilliger sneezes.
C: OLD TIM
D: Bless.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Thank you, Timothy.
N: They both stop their work and glance warily at the door marked "OFFICE."
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER

C: LUKE
D: Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
C: HARRY
D: No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
C: LUKE
D: Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
N: He scans down a page.
C: LUKE
D: "February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
E: reading

D: Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
E: appreciatively
C: LUKE
D: "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
E: reading
N: He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Yes?
C: LUKE
D: "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
C: HARRY
D: Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
C: HARRY
D: I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
E: rhapsodically
N: Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs.
C: HARRY
D: ... you were in a palace. It was like a dream. It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too.
N: Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm.
C: HARRY
D: Come with me!
N: He drags him out of the office and into the lobby.
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
N: Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke through the lobby.
C: HARRY
D: Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore. In here, you were safe. Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful.
E: smiling
N: Harry leads Luke into the auditorium. The car follows, but Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen.
C: HARRY
D: Charlie Chaplin. Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson. And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger.
E: exuberant
N: He turns to Luke.
C: HARRY
D: They... were... like... gods!
E: emphatically
N: He points to the screen.
C: HARRY
D: And that... was the altar. Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them? This television thing. Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient? Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that "entertainment," all alone in your living room? Where are the other people? Where's the audience?
E: sadly
N: Harry comes over to Luke.
C: HARRY
D: Where's the magic?
E: emphatically
N: He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear.
C: HARRY
D: I'll tell you. In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time. Everywhere. In every thing.
N: He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye.
C: HARRY
D: The trick... is to see it.
N: Pause.
C: LUKE
D: But I...
C: HARRY
D: Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.
N: Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby. Luke walks down the aisle. At the edge of the orchestra pit, he stands looking up at the screen. The orange tabby cat MEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the edge of the screen. They exchange looks as we

S: INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
N: Doc Lardner is seated in an easy chair, his feet up, reading Life magazine. The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing "The Tennessee Waltz." There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up. In the entrance hall, the front door opens. ADELE "DELLY" LARDNER enters. She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s. She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades down.
C: ADELE
D: Dad?
C: LARDNER
D: Delly? In here.
N: Lardner rises as Adele comes into the living room. They embrace warmly.
C: LARDNER
D: How'd it go?
C: ADELE
D: Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
C: LARDNER
D: That's my girl! Did you...?
E: kisses her forehead he hugs her again
C: ADELE
D: No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? "Your honor, I object!"
E: "serious" lawyer voice hic! hic!
N: They laugh.
C: LARDNER
D: I always told you, baby... ... it's all up here.
E: taps her head
N: Lardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto her just a bit too long. Adele detects something amiss.
C: ADELE
D: Dad? What is it?
N: Beat.
C: LARDNER
D: Well, it's...
N: Adele breaks away from him.
C: ADELE
D: Oh my god... who died?
E: extreme concern
T: CUT TO:
N: A GLASS OF WATER on a kitchen table. Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP. Then another. Adele's hand reaches into frame. WIDER
S: INT. LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING
N: Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table, holding the glass of water.
C: LARDNER
D: Drink slowly.
N: She raises the glass to her lips.
C: LARDNER
D: From the other side of the glass.
N: It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water, but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb. She waits for a moment -- then hiccups again.
C: ADELE
D: I think it's worse now.
E: hic! hic!
C: LARDNER
D: That always used to work.
C: ADELE
D: Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
E: hic! hic! hic!
C: LARDNER
D: Well...
E: hedging
C: ADELE
D: Dad...
E: hic! hic!
N: Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand.
C: LARDNER
D: He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
C: ADELE
D: ... including me. Right?
E: hic!
C: LARDNER
D: I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst.
C: ADELE
D: You mean, me?
E: hic!
C: LARDNER
D: It's possible.
N: Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we

S: EXT. COMMERCE STREET - EVENING
N: Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce Street, heading for Mabel's. It's still light out, and a soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk.
C: HARRY
D: I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death.
N: ERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry and Luke.
C: ERNIE
D: Harry! Hold on a second!
N: Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands before Luke, staring. Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who taps Ernie on the shoulder.
C: HARRY
D: It's really him, Ernie.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, I'll be...
E: agape
N: He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it. Ernie pumps it enthusiastically.
C: ERNIE
D: By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again.
C: LUKE
D: Uh, thanks. Good to see you again, too, uh...
E: uncertain
C: HARRY
D: Ernie.
C: LUKE
D: ... Ernie.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, I'll be...
E: still at a lose
C: HARRY
D: We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us?
C: ERNIE
D: Would I ever!
N: The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two steps, they hear:
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Is that Luke Trumbo?
N: They turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s, rushing toward them. She rushes right into a very surprised Luke's arms and hugs him tightly.
C: KATIE
D: Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back!
C: HARRY
D: Katie, would you like to join us for dinner? The more, the merrier.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT
N: The diner is packed. In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more are standing, even hanging out the door. At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the counter. Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while Luke is working on a steak. A young man seated at the opposite side of the counter is speaking. He's CARL LEFFERT, 30s.
C: CARL
D: Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head?
E: eagerly
N: A few people shake their heads, smile and laugh.
C: LUKE
D: Uh, no. What happened?
C: CARL
D: Well... um, all the hair got singed offa my head. It was pretty funny.
E: deflated
N: A couple of TITTERS are heard.
C: LUKE
D: Oh.
C: CARL
D: Even my eyebrows. But they grew back.
N: Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken.
C: HARRY
D: Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
C: LUKE
D: Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
E: sincerely
C: CARL
D: Oh, heck, that's all right. It's just good to have you back. Isn't that right, Bob? Hey, Luke, you remember my brother Bob? You two joined up the same day.
E: brightening
N: Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl. BOB LEFFERT is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl. His face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on his forehead. He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes. Brings his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up. Except there's no hand there -- it's a hook.
C: LUKE
D: Hey, Bob. Good to meet you.
E: quietly
N: Bob doesn't react. He glances away, and for a moment, his eyes meet Mabel's. She smiles warmly. He turns away. Ernie Cole pipes up.
C: ERNIE
D: Luke, I know there's a question that's on everybody's mind.
C: LUKE
D: What's that?
C: ERNIE
D: Well, now that you're back, what're your plans?
N: All eyes on Luke. He freezes, having just taken a forkful of food in his mouth. Harry jumps in.
C: HARRY
D: Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.
N: A MURMUR goes through the crowd. Stanton Lawson, standing behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder.
C: STANTON
D: That true?
C: LUKE
D: Well... we're gonna try.
E: on the spot
C: ERNIE
D: That's a lot of work, son. Place's been closed, what, three, four years now. Gonna be tough.
C: HARRY
D: If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.
N: Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear, hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement.
C: ERNIE
D: Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?
C: SPENCER'S VOICE
D: Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, come on out here so's we can see you.
N: SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd near the door. He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled kid, no more than 19 or 20. Painfully shy, he clutches a clarinet case to his chest. He timidly smiles and waves at Luke, who smiles and nods back.
C: SPENCER
D: Hey, Luke.
C: LUKE
D: Hi, Spencer.
C: ERNIE
D: Spence, that band of yours -- you think they're ready to play? Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band.
E: to Luke
C: SPENCER
D: We've been practicing... uh, sure, I guess.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, how about tomorrow night, eight p.m., in city hall square? What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome Home Luke" celebration.
N: Vociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is quickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door. The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing in the doorway. ADELE She locks eyes with Luke. Her hand goes to her mouth and her eyes well up. Slowly, she moves around the counter, the crowd moving aside for her. She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her. Her eyes moist, she looks up at him.
C: ADELE
D: Do you... remember me?
C: LUKE
D: I've seen you before. Your picture...
N: Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie.
C: MABEL
D: Look!
E: sotto
C: LUKE
D: ... but I don't think I remember you.
N: Adele leans up and kisses him softly. He looks at her.
C: LUKE
D: But I'll sure try.
N: As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT
N: Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side. She looks at him for a long moment.
C: LUKE
D: What.
C: ADELE
D: No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
C: LUKE
D: Me too.
C: ADELE
D: You look... different.
C: LUKE
D: I do?
C: ADELE
D: Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
C: LUKE
D: I did? Huh!
N: Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it. From behind them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND. Adele turns... ADELE'S POV Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is following them. Adele turns and addresses the crowd.
C: ADELE
D: You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
E: to the group
C: LUKE
D: Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
N: Harry comes over.
C: LUKE
D: I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
C: HARRY
D: You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
C: LUKE
D: You bet.
C: HARRY
D: Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
E: tips his hat
N: And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the pair goodnight. Luke and Adele watch them disperse.
C: LUKE
D: There. We're alone.
N: They turn and start walking.
C: ADELE
D: Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
C: LUKE
D: Well... where can we go?
N: Adele brightens.
C: ADELE
D: I know a place. Come on!
N: She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square.
S: EXT. LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT
N: Adele and Luke stand by the front steps.
C: LUKE
D: City hall?
C: ADELE
D: You must not remember anything. Come on.
N: She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building.
S: EXT. SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT
N: Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the ground. She looks around. Certain the coast is clear, she pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops up and open. She looks at Luke.
C: ADELE
D: You first.
C: LUKE
D: Why me?
C: ADELE
D: Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.
N: AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE
T: CUT TO:
N: A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT. Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave. We slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue...
S: INT. CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
C: ADELE
D: When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time.
E: O.S.
N: ON ADELE AND LUKE looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window. The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.
C: ADELE
D: Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
C: LUKE
D: How'd they get it inside?
E: looks at the door
C: ADELE
D: Through the door. It comes apart.
N: She moves to the memorial. Squinting, she examines its base.
C: ADELE
D: Your name's on here. See?
N: Luke comes over. ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME
C: ADELE
D: Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.
C: LUKE
D: It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
C: ADELE
D: After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
N: He looks at her for a long moment. There's an electricity between them, and they both feel it.
C: LUKE
D: So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
C: ADELE
D: And why not?
E: suddenly defensive
C: LUKE
D: Whoa.
C: ADELE
D: Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
E: smiling
C: LUKE
D: Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
C: ADELE
D: You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
C: LUKE
D: What did... what did I want to be?
C: ADELE
D: Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
E: gently
N: He turns away, rubs his head.
C: LUKE
D: I just wish I could remember some of this.
N: He turns back to her.
C: LUKE
D: You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
C: ADELE
D: Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
C: LUKE
D: I'm sorry.
C: ADELE
D: No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
C: LUKE
D: No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
E: moving toward her
C: ADELE
D: Yeah...
E: smiling
N: Pause.
C: LUKE
D: We were in love... weren't we?
C: ADELE
D: Yes. Hic!
E: quietly then:
N: She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good. She has the hiccups again.
C: LUKE
D: What was that?
C: ADELE
D: Nothing.
E: hic!
C: LUKE
D: Do you have the...
C: ADELE
D: I'm fine. Really.
E: hic! hic!
N: Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to not struggle against the hiccups. She has them, and that's just the way it is.
C: LUKE
D: Were we going to get married?
C: ADELE
D: Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...
E: hic! hic!
N: He looks at her. She's strikingly beautiful at this particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and all. He moves closer to her. She moves closer to him.
C: ADELE
D: ... but you had to go... serve your country...
E: breathless hic!
N: They kiss passionately. She reaches up and puts her arms around him. He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
C: ADELE
D: Hey... it worked.
N: And as she smiles and kisses him again we
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. THE BIJOU - NIGHT
N: Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door. He has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys and enters.
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
N: It's very dark. Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door, when he looks down and sees THE ORANGE TABBY CAT shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor. It looks at Luke, and PURRS. Luke closes the door and moves to the cat. He crouches down and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.
C: LUKE
D: Hey, fella. So you live here, too, huh? How come Harry didn't mention that?
N: The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at Luke. Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.
S: INT. BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: In the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp" with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day." The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway. Luke, following the cat, comes around the same corner and looks at THE DOOR. Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." Luke moves to the door and knocks.
C: LUKE
D: Um, Old Tim? Sorry, it's late. It's Luke. Can I come in?
N: The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur.
C: OLD TIM
D: Found me.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.
N: Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow him.
S: INT. OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot, which is perfectly made, military-style.
C: OLD TIM
D: Not used to visitors. Sit.
E: gesturing
N: Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox. Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing him. Silence. Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau. ON THE PHOTO It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform. The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke. He rubs against his legs, purring. Luke leans down to pet him.
C: LUKE
D: So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
C: OLD TIM
D: Cat.
C: LUKE
D: Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
E: pets Cat
C: OLD TIM
D: We thought you was dead, you know. It's okay that I live here?
E: sudden change-of-subject another new thought
C: LUKE
D: Of course.
N: Pause, then suddenly.
C: OLD TIM
D: Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform?
N: Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words.
C: LUKE
D: I'll do everything I can.
N: Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.
C: OLD TIM
D: T-t-thank you. Thank you. I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army. They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital. I forget things sometimes. Since the w-w-war.
C: LUKE
D: Yeah... me too.

S: INT. PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY
N: It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment. The "SAND PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair. Pete's two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top. There's an insistent KNOCK at the door.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton? You in there? This is the Super, I have the master key and I'm coming in!
E: O.S.
N: We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open, revealing the building SUPER, 50s. Behind him is Leo Kubelsky. They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air.
C: LEO
D: You smell gas?
C: SUPER
D: Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
C: LEO
D: Jesus.
C: SUPER
D: Hey, it's the best way to tell.
N: Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them. He picks up the empty bottle, examines it.
C: SUPER
D: You think he's drunk somewhere?
C: LEO
D: Wouldn't blame him if he was.
E: under his breath
C: SUPER
D: Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
C: LEO
D: What's his rent?
E: holding out his folding money
C: SUPER
D: Thirty a month.
N: Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill.
C: LEO
D: Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
C: SUPER
D: Huh?
E: examining the bill
C: LEO
D: Take a hike. Am-scray.
C: SUPER
D: Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave.
N: The Super exits and Leo crosses to the phone and dials "O."
C: LEO
D: Police department. I want to report a missing person.
E: into phone

S: INT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
N: ON A DOOR It reads: "OFFICE OF THE MAJORITY COUNSEL - MR. ELVIN CLYDE" AGENT WALTER SAUNDERS and AGENT STEVEN BRETT, both 30s and G- men to the core, hustle into the office.
S: INT. ELVIN CLYDE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: ELVIN CLYDE is 35, a small, thin-lipped, reptilian man in the Roy Cohn mold. He's on the phone at the moment.
C: CLYDE
D: You say you know nothing about it. You say this, yet you offer no proof. How am I supposed to believe you?
E: into phone
N: Clyde's SECRETARY knocks on the door, sticks her head in.
C: SECRETARY
D: Mr. Clyde? Agents Saunders and Brett need to see you.
C: CLYDE
D: You do see that I'm busy, do you not?
E: covering the phone
C: SECRETARY
D: It's about Appleton.
N: Clyde's eyes brighten.
C: CLYDE
D: Tell them to come in. I'll have to call you back. I love you too, Mother.
E: into phone
N: Saunders and Brett stride into the office.
C: SAUNDERS
D: We've got a situation developing...
C: CLYDE
D: Will you take those goddamn hats off?
E: interrupting
N: They stop, shuck off their hats. Saunders starts over again.
C: SAUNDERS
D: We've got a situation developing out on the coast. Appleton's just been reported missing.
N: Clyde grins darkly.
C: CLYDE
D: This is good. This is very good.
C: BRETT
D: Los Angeles Police Department investigated. His car's missing. No signs of forced entry or struggle at his apartment.
N: Clyde considers this for a beat, then:
C: CLYDE
D: You two are on this as of now. Tell the LAPD their investigation has been federalized on my order. You find me this Appleton. I want to see what this one has to say.
E: leans back, smiling

S: INT. BIJOU OFFICE - DAY
N: Luke is sitting at the desk, making notes and adding up some figures. He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes, then looks up at HARRY AND OLD TIM who are sitting on the floor, going through piles of lobby cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with their baseball cards. He shifts his gaze to MRS. TERWILLIGER who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or three file cabinets in the corner of the office. As she works, she hums an old song, occasionally breaking into the lyrics:
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: "The object of my affection, Can change my complexion, From white to rosy red..."
E: sings
N: Luke takes a breath:
C: LUKE
D: Well...
C: HARRY
D: Yes?
C: LUKE
D: Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Oh, my.
C: HARRY
D: Nine hundred...
E: taken aback
C: LUKE
D: And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
C: HARRY
D: They're...
E: glances at Old Tim
C: OLD TIM
D: That's my r-r-rent.
C: LUKE
D: Oh.
C: HARRY
D: It's all my fault. I was neglectful and this is the price of that.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Don't say that.
C: HARRY
D: Well, it's true. Wanting to open this place back up. It's folly, Irene, pure and simple. Might as well just call it what it is.
N: Off everyone's worried looks, we

N: A TV SCREEN It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow. WIDER
S: INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show of Shows." He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back -- and is successful. SID CAESAR And IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and Lardner fairly roars with laughter. He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire. He returns to the spot in front of the TV, and the picture is perfect again. The DOORBELL RINGS. He's torn -- if he moves, the picture will break up. The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's voice from upstairs:
C: ADELE
D: Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
E: O.S.
C: LARDNER
D: Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
N: There's a KNOCK at the door.
C: LARDNER
D: Oh, hell...
E: giving in
N: He moves from his spot. The reception goes bad, and he marches to the door. He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out-of-date coat and tie.
C: LARDNER
D: Evening, Luke.
C: LUKE
D: Evening, Doctor Lardner.
N: Lardner freezes, staring at Luke.
C: LUKE
D: What's wrong?
C: LARDNER
D: Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
E: shaken from his reverie
C: LUKE
D: Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.
N: Adele comes down the stairs. Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
C: ADELE
D: Oh...
N: Awkward pause. Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
C: LUKE
D: I shouldn't have worn the suit.
N: Adele comes down the stairs.
C: ADELE
D: No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
C: LUKE
D: Oh...
C: ADELE
D: ... and It's just... well, deja vu.
C: LARDNER
D: That's it. Deja vu.
N: Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. Lardner breaks it.
C: LARDNER
D: You kids off to the dance?
C: LUKE
D: Aren't you coming?
C: LARDNER
D: No, I'm not much of a dancer.
C: ADELE
D: Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
E: chidingly
C: LARDNER
D: I had it, a minute ago...
N: He glances at the TV set. The picture is suddenly crystal clear.
C: LARDNER
D: ... ooooh, It's back. Well, you kids have fun now...
E: encouraging them toward the door
N: Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room. S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV carefully all the while. The reception is staying perfect. Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to. He stifles his urge, and heads for his chair. Gingerly, he sits. Still perfect. Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. The picture goes completely haywire again.
C: LARDNER
D: Aw, crap.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm.
C: ADELE
D: This is strange. Do you feel it?
C: LUKE
D: What?
C: ADELE
D: We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
C: LUKE
D: Oh.
N: Pause.
C: ADELE
D: You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
C: LUKE
D: It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
E: interrupting
C: ADELE
D: Nine hundred...
E: shocked
C: LUKE
D: Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
C: ADELE
D: What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
C: LUKE
D: A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
C: ADELE
D: Well, there's got to be a way...
C: LUKE
D: Have you got a cigarette?
E: suddenly
N: Adele stops.
C: ADELE
D: When did you start smoking?
C: LUKE
D: I don't smoke?
C: ADELE
D: You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
C: LUKE
D: Oh.
N: Adele glances curiously at Luke as we
T: CUT TO:
N: A CLARINET launching into the opening bars of "Don't Be That Way," an old Benny Goodman tune.
S: EXT. CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY
N: Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer, AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad. Though no Gene Krupa, he pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly as his son plays clarinet and leads the band. Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice, hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights. ON LUKE AND ADELE dancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES.
C: LUKE
D: They're not bad.
E: nodding toward the band
C: ADELE
D: No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
C: LUKE
D: My what?
C: ADELE
D: Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
C: LUKE
D: Huh. That was nice of me.
C: ADELE
D: You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
C: LUKE
D: ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
C: ADELE
D: Exactly. And he got good.
C: LUKE
D: No kidding.
N: They dance a bit.
C: ADELE
D: Now, did you remember that, or...
C: LUKE
D: Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
C: ADELE
D: Oh. Okay.
N: And as they dance away, we
T: CUT TO:
N: THE SAME - LATER ON THE REFRESHMENTS TABLE Luke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers, ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s.
C: ALEX
D: You're the luckiest guy in town, Luke. Delly's 'bout the prettiest thing ever come outta Lawson.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks, Charlie.
E: to Alex
C: ALEX
D: I'm Alex. He's Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm Charlie.
C: ALEX
D: Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing we ever seen, ain't that right, Charlie?
C: CHARLIE
D: You bet.
C: ADELE
D: Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.
E: ala Mae West
N: The brothers laugh goofily.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, she's doin' that movie star, what's her name...?
C: ALEX
D: Hey, Delly, what was that test you was outta town takin'?
E: ignoring his brother
C: ADELE
D: It's called the State Bar Exam.
C: CHARLIE
D: Shoot!
C: ALEX
D: Imagine that, Charlie! A lady bartender!
T: CUT TO:
N: THE SAME - LATER Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory."
C: LUKE
D: How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
C: ADELE
D: Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
C: LUKE
D: That's... pretty frightening.
N: They laugh and dance a bit more.
C: ADELE
D: Your dancing's very good.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks.
C: ADELE
D: It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
C: LUKE
D: Guess I must've learned.
N: Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on her face. The band finishes the song, and everyone enthusiastically APPLAUDS. Spencer bows shyly, blushing slightly. He nods to the band, and they bow before he motions for the crowd's attention.
C: SPENCER
D: Thanks, folks. Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before?
E: nervously
N: The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc.
C: SPENCER
D: Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke. I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this.
N: He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees Luke.
C: SPENCER
D: When you didn't come back, I learned how to play this so I could remember you. And now that you're back, well, I'll never forget you. Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us.
E: to Luke to the crowd
N: The crowd APPLAUDS warmly.
C: SPENCER
D: Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!
N: The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser. He turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums.
C: ERNIE
D: Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?
N: Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six times to register his reaction. ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF."
C: ERNIE
D: Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him.
N: APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle. As soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.
C: ERNIE
D: You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country. A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered. And we never forgot.
N: Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion. He clears his throat and continues.
C: ERNIE
D: We never forgot. And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle. Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again. I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive. But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too. God bless you, son.
N: The crowd APPLAUDS. Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.
C: ERNIE
D: All right, enough a'that. This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there! All right, take it away, Spencer!
N: And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THE SAME - LATER Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger, standing at the periphery. Old Tim stands a few feet back.
C: LUKE
D: Why don't you two get out there and dance?
C: HARRY
D: Oh, no, I...
N: Mrs. Terwilliger blushes.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
C: LUKE
D: When was that?
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Nineteen-oh-nine.
N: Harry touches Luke's arm.
C: HARRY
D: Son, we're gonna go. You two kids have a lovely time.
N: Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves. Alex McKenna comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder.
C: ALEX
D: Delly, can I have a dance?
C: ADELE
D: Sure.
N: Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a little "help me!" look. Luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd. After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his hand.
C: FITTS
D: Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
C: LUKE
D: Good to meet you. Again.
E: shakes his hand
C: FITTS
D: Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks.
C: FITTS
D: And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
C: LUKE
D: We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
C: FITTS
D: I can only imagine. You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands. I don't think he gave it very much thought.
C: LUKE
D: Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
C: FITTS
D: Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point. I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it. And that's just for the property, mind you. If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds. I just want the land.
C: LUKE
D: That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
E: taken aback
C: FITTS
D: The days of the storefront grocery are numbered. I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
C: LUKE
D: A super market. Huh.
E: it's an alien word
C: FITTS
D: You think it over. No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
N: Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.
C: FITTS
D: Good to have you back, Luke.
N: As Luke watches Fitts walk off, we
T: CUT TO:
N: THE SAME - LATER ON SPENCER
C: SPENCER
D: Last dance, folks!
N: The crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into "Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy. ON ADELE AND LUKE As they hold each other close and dance. Adele rests her head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed. Luke strokes her hair and sways her gently to the music. Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor. LUKE'S POV Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band. Mabel comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. She's asking him if he would like to dance. Bob looks down at the ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there. As Luke watches and the MUSIC CONTINUES OVER, WE
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: MONTAGE: Luke and Adele dancing... ... walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her walk to her door... ... kissing passionately on her doorstep... ... Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to take their eyes off the other... ... Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling beatifically...
T: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. THE BIJOU - NIGHT
N: Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door. He pulls out his keys and enters.
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
N: Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees CAT MEOWING at him from the sidewalk. He holds the door open, and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the auditorium. Luke closes the door... and stops. He HEARS something, and so do we. Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby. Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the auditorium. The piano continues, building slightly in volume. He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively pushes one open.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
N: Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering, reflected light of THE SCREEN. The movie is "The Big Parade." The old, decomposing nitrate print is badly scratched and stained. A young, beautiful Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War. Luke stares at the screen. The look on his face is one of bewilderment -- and awe. ANGLE - THE PIANO The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune. But it really doesn't matter. CLOSER Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately. She never takes her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered screen, except to close them when she is overcome with emotion. Even so, she never misses a beat. HER HANDS fairly dance upon the keys. Stiff and wrinkled as they are, they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity that the old piano can muster. Luke is moved by what he's witnessing. This is the magic... WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old Tim. Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief. He doesn't notice LUKE who looks up towards the projection booth.
T: CUT TO:
N: A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT, filling the frame. We're looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector. PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the booth. We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector. WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen. He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time. The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES, signaling the end of the reel. Harry moves away from the window.
S: INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
N: Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap! falp! falps! out of the projector. He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies. It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have. Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up. This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly. He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down. He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone. He looks over the projector to see LUKE, standing there. Their eyes meet. Someone should say something -- both men search for words. Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual. Harry senses this. Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly.
C: HARRY
D: Beautiful, wasn't it?
C: LUKE
D: Yes.
E: softly
C: HARRY
D: Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
C: LUKE
D: Dad, I...
C: HARRY
D: Ha!
E: a tiny laugh
C: LUKE
D: ... what?
C: HARRY
D: You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
N: Father and son look at each other for a long moment -- searching each other's eyes. Harry smiles a sort-of half- smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench. Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel. Slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film. He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not there. ANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth. ONE LUKE As he closes his eyes...
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
N: ON HARRY In bed, sound asleep, snoring. A HAND reaches into frame and shakes him awake.
C: LUKE'S VOICE
D: Harry. Dad, wake up. Wake up.
N: Harry opens his eyes and looks up.

S: INT. CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY
N: A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor Cole presiding. Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts. VERA DWIGHT, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting.
C: VERA
D: Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention.
N: As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry, Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches.
C: ERNIE
D: Thanks, Vera.
N: Ernie notices Luke and the trio.
C: ERNIE
D: Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff. Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings. G'moring, folks.
N: LUKE & THE TRIO Good morning.
C: ERNIE
D: I'm just guessing, but I bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here.
N: Luke stands.
C: LUKE
D: Well, no... I wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home. But I... we're... actually here on business of a sort...
E: clears his throat
N: DALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order."
C: DALEY
D: Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this comes under the heading "New Business," and this is not the time...
C: ERNIE
D: I think we can make an exception here, Daley.
C: DALEY
D: It'll need to be moved and seconded.
N: Ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without inflection:
C: ERNIE
D: All right, motion to hear the speaker out of order.
C: WYATT
D: Seconded.
C: ERNIE
D: Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
C: ALL
D: Aye.
C: ERNIE
D: Opposed? Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried.
N: Pause. Ernie turns to Luke and smiles.
C: ERNIE
D: Go ahead, son.
C: LUKE
D: Thanks. Well, I'll make this short and sweet. The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all. So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.
C: WYATT
D: What kinds of things are you talking about?
C: LUKE
D: Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease.
N: Fitts leans forward.
C: FITTS
D: So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
C: LUKE
D: Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
N: He looks at Harry and smiles.
C: LUKE
D: ... but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.
N: The council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then:
C: WYATT
D: Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can...
E: eagerly
C: DALEY
D: ... short of the allocation of city funds...
E: a subtle reminder
C: WYATT
D: ... short of allocation of city funds.
E: agreeing
C: DALEY
D: Seconded!
E: enthusiastically
C: ERNIE
D: Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
E: brightly
C: ALL
D: AYE!
C: ERNIE
D: Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried! Congratulations, Luke, you got yourself a town to help you out!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY
N: As the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin covering it. Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in his arms. Ernie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument. Ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the base of the monument.
C: ERNIE
D: You know, this really ought to be out where people can see it.
E: slowly
N: Luke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the muslin taut between his outstretched arms...
T: CUT TO:
N: MONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER... ANGLE - THE SCREEN Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS, watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe. Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen drops down on Luke's head. Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!! He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris. The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to Harry and grabs his end. It's Carl Leffert. A second later, someone else grabs Old Tim's end. BOB LEFFERT has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook. He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow. Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.
S: INT. BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
N: Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls. Then, as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes. Immediately, they all set to work painting.
S: EXT. THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY
N: Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby. He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork. For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU." But not for long. Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater. Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U." Luke winces.
S: EXT. CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY
N: Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square...
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin. It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen! Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically.
S: INT. ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY
N: As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano. She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys. She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music. Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt. Before long, all eyes are on her. Everyone's listening. Transported. After a moment, she stops. Overcome. Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.
C: LUKE
D: That was beautiful.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: I taught you that.
C: LUKE
D: I can play the piano?
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Oh dear, yes. You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. You loved Chopin. You used to call it "heaven music." "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
E: all fluttery
N: She sits at the piano.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Sit. Play with me.
C: LUKE

C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Some of it might come back to you.
N: Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left. As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: That's good... that's good...
N: But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing. He's just plunking bass notes. But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat. Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: Really, Luke! That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin!
N: She stands and moves away. Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it! After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line. OLD TIM is tapping his foot to the beat. He turns to Adele and says:
C: OLD TIM
D: I taught him that.
N: Off Adele cracking up. THE MONTAGE CONTINUES...

N: Luke and all the letters up again. He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by. This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a jaunty angle. Luke smiles.
S: INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAY
N: Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy. Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks. At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert. She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup. Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading. INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying headline: BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved?

He finishes his remarks, then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons. He holds them up, high above his head. ON THE CROWD One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones. Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform... LUKE'S POV It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in his dress greens. He brings his hook-hand up and salutes smartly. Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she blinks back tears. Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses him on the forehead.

ON THE DRUM MAJOR, a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white uniform with "LHS" emblazoned across the chest. ON LUKE He has an idea.

Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter, ready to sell tickets and refreshments. Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby. Luke checks his watch. It's time. He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old Tim, who swings the door open... ON THE DOOR Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater. Luke exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside. OUTSIDE THE THEATER Luke comes out and looks down the block.

Luke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing BOB LEFFERT AND MABEL. Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly dancing with life. He plunks down his admission, and Luke hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand. Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move away, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s.

N: Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks. Old Tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan. Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter. All is well. Luke goes to the lobby's poster case. He opens it, and unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" -- the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case. As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter. The door stays open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
N: ON THE SCREEN - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA" The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's programmer. It's nighttime in the desert. A huge full moon hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain. Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.

C: HARRY
D: You're a good girl. No matter what I say.
N: As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left arm. Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a chair, and sits heavily. He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a hacking, choking COUGH. He tries to stand, but drops to his knees, clutching his left arm harder than before.

D: Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.

C: HARRY
D: Oh, so... much... lighter...
E: softly

Then, as everyone surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance. Adele watches Luke depart... ANOTHER ANGLE ... and she's not alone.

He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't know what to say. He wishes one of them would talk to him, just say something, anything. But no one does. Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete.

Lottie's barking gets LOUDER and angrier. Suddenly, a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road.

D: However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
C: PETE
D: And I won't be a communist anymore.
C: LEO
D: Exactly.
C: PETE
D: So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
N: Leo stands and walks to the window.
C: LEO
D: Kid, don't get philosophical with me. This is a game, but it's not your game. You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you. And they have the power to do it.
C: ADELE
D: Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?
N: Leo turns to her and smiles. His tone is charmingly matter- of-factly, not condescending in the least.
C: LEO
D: Darling, don't kid yourself. We don't have a "democracy" in this country. The Declaration of Independence? The Constitution? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em. And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is? It's a contract. And you know what a contract is? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time. It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re- negotiating the contract this time around.
N: Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it.
C: LEO
D: Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it.
C: PETE
D: That's not the country Luke fought for.
C: LEO
D: Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
C: PETE
D: It's wrong, Leo.
C: LEO
D: Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
N: Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to Pete.
C: LEO
D: Here. When you're called, read this to them. Just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives.
N: There's a knock at the door. Leo opens it. Standing there is a small MAN wearing a serious suit and an even more serious fedora.
C: THE MAN
D: Peter Appleton?
C: PETE
D: You found him.
E: standing
N: The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue backed folded document, which he hands to Pete. As he does, a FLASH lights the room. At the door, a pair of PHOTOGRAPHERS and a NEWSREEL CAMERAMAN are jockeying for position. Pete rolls his eyes.
C: THE MAN
D: Peter Appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. You are to appear in Los Angeles, California, at the Biltmore Hotel, at the date and time specified herein.
N: Pete takes the subpoena. There's an awkward moment, as the newsreel camera is still rolling. Pete cradles the subpoena like an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens.
C: PETE
D: This is a great honor. I'll treasure this always. Thank you.
E: "on"

S: INT. PETE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Pete is sitting in a chair, reading the statement Leo gave him.
C: PETE
D: "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done..."
E: softly
N: He scans down the page. It's a long list.
C: PETE
D: Jesus...
N: He HEARS a "meow!" And turns to look. CAT is standing in the bedroom doorway. He folds up and pockets the list.
C: PETE
D: Old Tim?
N: After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing his knit cap in his hands.
C: OLD TIM
D: Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
C: PETE
D: Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
N: Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on the bed.
C: PETE
D: Please, sit.
C: OLD TIM
D: Thanks.
N: He sits. Pause.
C: OLD TIM
D: They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
C: PETE
D: The customers? I don't know...
C: OLD TIM
D: They will. They w-w-will.
N: Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye.
C: PETE
D: Tim, I have to tell you something.
C: OLD TIM
D: Oh.
C: PETE
D: It's about me.
C: OLD TIM
D: Oh.
N: Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words.
C: PETE
D: I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
C: OLD TIM
D: Oh...
C: PETE
D: My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
N: Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete. Pause.
C: OLD TIM
D: Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
C: PETE
D: I thought you...
E: taken aback
C: OLD TIM
D: I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here.
N: He leans down to Pete.
C: OLD TIM
D: You hafta give us back the B-B- Bijou.
N: Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete. Then, silently, he picks up Cat and exits.

S: EXT. LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY
N: Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the waiting train.
C: ADELE
D: You've got everything?
C: PETE
D: Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
C: ADELE
D: You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.
C: PETE
D: I wish you were coming with me.
C: ADELE
D: And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
C: PETE
D: Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
N: They both smile as the train's HORN blows.
C: CONDUCTOR
D: Board!
N: Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger compartment.
C: ADELE
D: Did you bring along something to read?
C: PETE
D: Damn...
N: Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her purse and hands it to Pete.
C: ADELE
D: I didn't think so. Here. This is mine, you can borrow it.
N: INSERT - THE BOOK Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear: CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANNOTATED EDITION Pete looks at the book, then at Adele.
C: ADELE
D: Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
C: PETE
D: Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.
E: clearly touched
C: ADELE
D: Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
C: PETE
D: Okay. What's the second thing?
N: She thinks for a moment. She needs the right words.
C: ADELE
D: I'll be here... if you come back.

S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
N: The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and the joint is packed to the rafters. Members of the AUDIENCE crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the witnesses will be entering. The COMMITTEE MEMBERS are seated at their dais, brightly lit by the dozens of newsreel and TV lights. Elvin Clyde is seated at the far right. Dead center of the dais is the Chairman, CONGRESSMAN T. JOHNSTON DOYLE of Wisconsin, a husky man in his late 50s. He SLAMS his gavel down several times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the cameras start whirring.
S: INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the TV set. Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching attentively. Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft.
C: ADELE
D: That's perfect, Dad.
C: DOYLE
D: The committee and the chamber will come to order.
E: ON TV
N: Lardner forces a smile at Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim.
C: LARDNER
D: This television's a grand little invention, isn't it?
E: sweating and wincing
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
C: DOYLE
D: The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and I'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed. I'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press. I hope that's clear.
N: Beat. Doyle scans the room. He clearly means business.
C: DOYLE
D: Call Peter Appleton.
N: All eyes and cameras swing toward the door. ON PETE As he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as every eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat. As he sits, he glances behind him. PETE'S POV Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators. He smiles and nods at Pete. Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back.
C: DOYLE
D: The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.
N: Pete does as instructed.
C: DOYLE
D: Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
C: PETE
D: I do.
C: DOYLE
D: Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
C: PETE
D: Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
C: DOYLE
D: The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton. We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
C: PETE
D: I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
E: faint smile
C: DOYLE
D: Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
C: PETE
D: A statement?
E: innocently
N: Doyle and Clyde exchange glances.
C: DOYLE
D: Yes. A prepared statement.
C: PETE
D: Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
N: Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo. Leo rolls his eyes and shakes his head.

N: Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
C: MRS. TERWILLIGER
D: I think he's doing very well, so far.
C: ADELE
D: They haven't called out the dogs yet.
C: DOYLE
D: Very well then, the questions will be asked by the Majority Counsel, Mr. Clyde.
E: ON TV
N: The TV shot swings to see Elvin Clyde. He puts on his glasses and fixes Pete with an oily grin.
C: ADELE
D: I spoke too soon.
C: CLYDE
D: Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Appleton, for appearing today.
E: ON TV
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California. But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California?
C: PETE
D: Sir, that is true.
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
C: PETE
D: Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
C: CLYDE
D: Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
C: PETE
D: Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
C: CLYDE
D: Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
E: referring to notes
C: PETE
D: Yes, sir.
C: CLYDE
D: Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
N: A few spectators titter.
S: INT. MABEL'S DINER - DAY
N: Mabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed diner.
C: CLYDE
D: Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
E: ON RADIO
C: PETE
D: Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
E: ON RADIO
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
N: Clyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page.
C: CLYDE
D: Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
C: PETE
D: Yes.
C: CLYDE
D: And what is the state of your memory now?
N: Beat. Pete smiles.
C: PETE
D: I'm sorry, what was the question?
N: The audience LAUGHS. Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight smile.
C: CLYDE
D: We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention. That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton?
E: back to business
S: INT. WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY
N: Avery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio. Spencer comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. He moves to the radio and listens solemnly.
C: PETE
D: Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
E: ON RADIO
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
C: CLYDE
D: I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
E: impatient
C: PETE
D: Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
E: smiling
C: CLYDE
D: Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
E: holds up a piece of paper
N: Pete looks on the table and finds the roster. He's surprised to see it.
C: PETE
D: Yes... yes, I do.
C: CLYDE
D: Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
C: PETE
D: Yes it does.
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
C: PETE
D: Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?
C: CLYDE
D: Start with what you knew then.
C: PETE
D: Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
C: CLYDE
D: We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
C: PETE
D: Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.
C: CLYDE
D: Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
E: grinning
C: PETE
D: Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
E: slyly
N: The audience LAUGHS. Doyle BANGS his gavel.
C: PETE
D: You asked for the truth. That's the truth. I had no idea what the meeting was about. I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.
N: The audience LAUGHS. Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS his gavel.
C: DOYLE
D: Chamber will come to order.
N: Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.
C: CLYDE
D: All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
C: PETE
D: Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
E: takes a deep breath
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
N: A few members of the audience APPLAUD. As Pete speaks, their numbers grow.
C: PETE
D: I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am! I know that I...
E: passionately
N: Doyle BANGS his gavel several times. Pete stops and the room falls quiet.
C: DOYLE
D: Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear? Continue, Mr. Clyde.
E: emphatically he lets this sink in, then
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Appleton...
E: looking down at his desk
N: Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete.
C: CLYDE
D: Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
C: PETE
D: No, sir.
C: CLYDE
D: Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
E: holding up the roster
C: PETE
D: I'm not refuting anything.
C: CLYDE
D: Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
C: PETE
D: That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
C: CLYDE
D: Well, then, as what did you go?
N: Beat. Pete smiles.
C: PETE
D: I'm a little hesitant to say.
C: DOYLE
D: The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
N: Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone.
C: PETE
D: Well, I went as... a horny young man.
N: The chamber erupts in LAUGHTER. Even the other COMMITTEE MEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS his gavel vigorously.
S: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Sheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on the radio. They are both laughing at Pete's last comment.
C: ELDRIDGE
D: Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys. They'll eat him alive.
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
N: The room settles. Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete.
C: DOYLE
D: Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
E: angry
C: PETE
D: I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
E: matter-of-factly
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, the witness is making another speech. I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished...
E: interrupting
C: DOYLE
D: Mr. Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but I'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee.
E: indifferent
S: INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Adele moves to within inches of the TV screen.
C: ADELE
D: Tell them Pete. Tell them...
C: PETE
D: Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
E: ON TV wrestling with this
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Chairman...
E: ON TV
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
N: Clyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off.
C: DOYLE
D: Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what is your intention?
N: Pete's sweating under the lights. He's bluffed his last bluff, and he's on the ropes. He reaches into his pocket... and takes out the prepared statement.
S: INT. LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: PETE
D: I... Mr. Chairman, I have a prepared statement I'd like to read...
E: ON TV
N: ADELE Her hand goes to her mouth.
C: ADELE
D: Oh, Pete. No...
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
C: DOYLE
D: Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.
C: PETE
D: "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."
E: slowly reading
N: He stops suddenly. Pause.
C: DOYLE
D: Mr. Appleton? Mr. Appleton?
C: PETE
D: I... I need a drink of water.
C: DOYLE
D: Go ahead, son.
N: Pete fills a glass from the pitcher. Nervously, he spills a bit, and is splashes onto his coat. As some of the spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off. He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the constitution. The cover is wet. He wipes it off and sets it down on the table. He takes a sip of water. Looks at the book. Picks it up. Pete's terrified, but in control. He speaks slowly -- he's making this up and thinking it out as he goes.
C: PETE
D: Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
C: DOYLE
D: Mr. Appleton, you will...
N: He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.
C: PETE
D: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
N: Pause. Silence in the room. ADELE She's smiling at the TV. Her eyes are filled with tears. PETE He looks up at Chairman Doyle. Now fully confident.
C: PETE
D: That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman. It's the backbone of this nation. It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential. It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear. It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country. And even though this contract... ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation. Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever.
E: he holds up the book
N: Pin-drop silence in the room. Pete scans the faces of the panel. All betray anger. ON LEO He can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.
C: PETE
D: And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee. Good morning.
N: And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and walks toward the door. The cameras swing with him, and FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns. Doyle BANGS his gavel insistently.
C: DOYLE
D: The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?! You are not excused, Mr. Appleton!
N: And then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits.
C: CLYDE
D: Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman...!
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY
N: As Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS have him completely surrounded. FLASHBULBS pop. He's taken aback, flustered.
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: There he is!
E: seeing Pete
C: SECOND REPORTER
D: Pete! Are you going back to writing pictures?
C: PETE
D: I don't know...
C: THIRD REPORTER
D: You a commie, Pete?
C: PETE
D: No, of course not...
C: SECOND REPORTER
D: What about the girl, Pete? You gonna marry her? Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you...
C: PETE
D: Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say...
N: Pete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his shoulder. LEO spins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the curb.
C: LEO
D: Come on, kid.
N: At the curb is a black Cadillac limousine. Leo hauls open the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself. The limo drives away, as the reporters give chase.
S: INT. LIMO (MOVING) - DAY
N: Leo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment. Leo breaks it.
C: LEO
D: That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
C: PETE
D: I'm not sorry for what I said.
C: LEO
D: No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.
N: They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he opens and offers to Pete.
C: LEO
D: Cigarette?
C: PETE
D: No thanks.
N: Leo takes one for himself and lights up. Pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head.
C: LEO
D: When'd you quit smoking?
C: PETE
D: Luke didn't smoke.
C: LEO
D: Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
C: PETE
D: Not any more.
E: laughs
C: LEO
D: Why not?
C: PETE
D: Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
C: LEO
D: Not at all.
E: with a smile
C: PETE
D: Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
C: LEO
D: What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
E: snickering
N: But before Pete can answer...
C: LEO
D: Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
C: PETE
D: What do you mean?
C: LEO
D: Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
C: PETE
D: Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
C: LEO
D: What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
N: Pete freezes. He slowly turns to Leo.
C: PETE
D: Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
E: warily
C: LEO
D: Well, that's not what they think.
C: PETE
D: Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
C: LEO
D: You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
E: takes a puff
C: PETE
D: Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
E: realization dawning
C: LEO
D: So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
C: PETE
D: Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
C: LEO
D: Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
E: dismissive off his look
N: Pete is dumbstruck. He slumps in his seat, ashen.
C: LEO
D: All of which means... "Ashes To Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back. Congratulations, kid.
E: he couldn't be happier takes a puff
N: Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or screaming -- or both.
S: EXT. PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door. Pete vacantly grabs his suitcase and gets out. Leo shuts the door and calls after him, waving Pete's hat.
C: LEO
D: Peter! Your hat!
N: Pete comes back and takes his hat. Leo grabs his hand.
C: LEO
D: I was lookin' out for you all the time, kid. You did good. I'm real proud of you. Okay, let's go. Get some rest, kid!

S: INT. PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY
N: The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat. He sets them down and goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.
C: SUPER
D: Here's a new key for ya. That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month. You got one swell friend there.
E: handing him a key
N: The Super moves to the door and turns back.
C: SUPER
D: Good to have you back, Pete.
N: He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin-toy fire truck. Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late:
C: PETE
D: Thanks...
N: He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat. As he does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor. Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye:
C: TO DELLY,
D: THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS. LOVE, LUKE
N: Pete closes the book. He thinks for a moment, then glances over at the phone. He picks it up and dials "0."
C: PETE
D: Western Union, please.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY
N: Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara. Looking into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring out at the passing scenery.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: Dear Adele, on my way back to Lawson STOP. That is, if they'll have me STOP. Train arrives four p.m. STOP. Hope you can be there STOP. Pete.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The train is just pulling in to Lawson. As it SHUDDERS to a halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open... HIS POV The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out. They're all there, smiling broadly. A large, hand-lettered banner reads:
C: WELCOME HOME PETE!
D: LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON
N: A CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence. Pete descends from the train and moves into the throng. The first two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling as they shake hands vigorously.
C: BOB
D: Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.
N: Mabel's mouth drops open.
C: PETE
D: Bob, congratulations! When'd you ask her?
C: MABEL
D: Holy moley! Just now! Yes, Bob! Yes!
E: to Bob
N: As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back. ADELE is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss. Another CHEER goes up.
C: PETE
D: I see you got the telegram.
C: ADELE
D: Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
C: PETE
D: Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
E: grabs her shoulders
C: ADELE
D: And I love you, Pete!
E: tears in her eyes hic!
N: They kiss again. Pete pulls away and looks at his watch.
C: PETE
D: C'mon, Dell, we gotta go. Showtime in fifteen minutes.
E: smiling
N: The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the station.
C: PETE'S NARRATION
D: "Happily ever after" is a relative term, folks. My world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were. But I have something now that I never had before: I have the magic. And it's for sale at the Bijou, every day of the year. All you need is the price of a ticket.
E: V.O.
N: We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd. Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's marquee. The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the sign, which reads: THE END Then, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING. We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign... ... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater... ... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread... ... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...
T: CUT TO BLACK.
