S: INT. BEDROOM
N: WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star. From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny, ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face. It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo off.

You're a reject, a wrong-un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror that I inherited from your mother, but she ain't with us no more, so now it's just you and me. In one week you go back to school, the best fuckin school in the country I might add, then you'll be gone for another term. In the mean time, show me some gratitude and keep the fuckin music down.

C: JOHNNY STORY
D: You will notice that one of your personalities is seduced by the illusions of grandeur. A "gold" packet of "king" size and with a "regal" insignia. An attractive implication toward glamour and wealth, a subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your "royal" and loyal friends. And that Pete,...is a lie. Your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion. Written in boring, bold, black and white is the statement, that these neat little soldiers of death, are in fact, trying to "kill you." And that Pete,...is the truth. Beauty is a beguiling call to death and I am addicted to the sweet siren of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you and I love the crack, and that is also why I can not,.. give that painting back.

N: Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.
C: MUMBLES
D: There's another case, grab it.
N: One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1. As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the car by CHECHNYAN 2.

N: With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting go. The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting go.

C: MUMBLES
D: I've got 'em.
N: As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1 is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two is attached to his arm.

N: One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down the tracks. ROCKNROLLA WHITE Revision - 6-6-07 70. The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2 is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming. One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit." This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.
S: EXT. STREET
N: We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.
