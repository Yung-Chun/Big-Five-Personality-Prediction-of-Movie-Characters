S: EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY
N: BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating. QUICK IMAGES: We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool. Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head. There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes it off. A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked. Beer is around.

S: INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY
N: In a living room of the house the guys have created an office for their web site. There are a few large tables, several computers which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on them. Ben and his friends are holding a meeting. They each have a note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint and drink beers.

C: MARTIN
D: Thanks for the free money, bitch.
C: JONAH
D: Hey, Martin, was it weird when you joined the Taliban, being American and everything like that? Like when you see a woman driving a car, do you just get pissed?
C: JASON
D: Just watch your back, Serpico. You never know who your friends are.
C: MARTIN
D: You guy can't make fun of the me the whole time.

C: JAY
D: That's the whole point. You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.
C: BEN
D: Your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles.
C: MARTIN
D: You guys aren't allowed to make fun of me. It's not part of the rules.
C: JASON
D: Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when I was explaining the rules? You just looked at me with that blank stare of yours. It was like talking to a wax statue.
C: BEN
D: Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will customers be able to find exactly how long into what movies their favorite stars are exposed."
C: JASON

C: RYAN SEACREST
D: If she's going to be in hair and makeup for three hours. I can't do it. I'm not going to be here. I got to do "American Idol." It's live. I got to do it. I got to be there. What are we going to interview her about?
C: ALISON
D: Nothing personal.
C: RYAN SEACREST
D: No personal questions.
C: ALISON
D: No personal questions. Don't ask her about her sister and her nose job.
C: RYAN SEACREST
D: No plastic surgery questions.
C: ALISON
D: She doesn't want to talk about her boobs or her father's comments about her boobs.
C: RYAN SEACREST
D: Great. We'll talk about the Middle East and maybe an idea of an exit strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch. Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe? I don't understand the young talent in this town! It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway! No one stands up. No one has the balls to sit them down and say, "Look, just cut the shit."But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the shit." And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating.
C: ALISON
D: You know what? You want us to just come and get you when she gets here? You want to head to the green room for a minute? Just chill out?
C: RYAN SEACREST
D: That's a good idea.

C: JILL
D: Jack and I need to see you in his office.
S: INT. JACK'S OFFICE, E! ENTERTAINMENT - DAY
N: Allison's boss, JACK, early forties, is at his desk. Alison and Jill sit in the office.
C: JACK
D: Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you.
C: ALISON

C: JACK
D: About the work, most immediately, there's going to be some things that you're going to be able to get that other people in the office don't get. One of them: Gym membership.
C: ALISON
D: You want me to lose weight?
C: JACK
D: I don't want you to lose weight.
C: JILL
D: We can't legally ask you to do that.
C: JACK
D: We didn't say lose weight.
C: JILL
D: No.
C: JACK
D: I might say "tighten."
C: ALISON
D: "Tight."
C: JACK
D: A little...tighter?
C: JILL
D: Just like toned and smaller.
C: JACK
D: Don't make everything smaller. I don't want to generalize that way. Tighter.
C: JILL
D: We don't want you to lose weight. We just want you to be healthy.
N: KNOCKED UP - 10.
C: ALISON
D: Okay.
C: JILL
D: You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty.
C: ALISON
D: Twenty.
C: JILL
D: And then weigh that much.
C: JACK
D: Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.

D: That's cool.
C: BEN
D: From Vancouver. I live here illegally, actually. Don't tell anyone. But it works out in my advantage, ultimately, `cause I don't have to pay any taxes. So financially that's helpful `cause I don't have a lot of money. I'm not poor or anything but I eat a lot of spaghetti.

C: ALISON
D: I did not tell you not to wear a condom.
C: BEN
D: Here's what happened, okay? I will give you a play-by-play of my memory. I almost had the condom on my dick. It was on the cusp and then you said, "Just do it, already."
C: ALISON
D: I didn't mean do it without a condom. I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like "get fucking going!"
C: BEN
D: Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch, or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin' butterfly clips or something like that.
C: ALISON
D: What the hell is a dental dam?
C: BEN
D: It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting, okay? But I thought you had one. Why the fuck didn't you stop me once we started?
C: ALISON
D: Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't tell that you didn't have one on! Obviously, I was drunk!
C: BEN
D: Was your vagina drunk? Did you think it's the thinnest condom on earth I have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed out a penis and put it on? What the fuck?!
C: ALISON
D: You are unbelievable.
C: BEN
D: Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've reacted unfavorably. So what happens now? I don't know how this works.
N: KNOCKED UP - 41.
C: ALISON
D: I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist.
C: BEN
D: So you haven't seen him, though?
C: ALISON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: So you don't know if you're pregnant.
C: ALISON
D: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

C: JONAH
D: I can't believe you did this. You fucked everything up.
C: JASON
D: Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity.
C: JONAH
D: Everyone knows that.
C: JASON
D: What goes up must come down.
C: JAY
D: I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man. Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again.

C: HARRIS
D: An earthquake is a disaster. Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster. This is a good thing. This is a blessing.
C: BEN
D: I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.

D: Well you remember what I told you? When you were a teenager?
C: BEN
D: What did you say?
C: HARRIS
D: I said, "No pill, no powders."
C: BEN
D: That's right, that's right.
C: HARRIS
D: Right. If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.
C: BEN
D: I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time.
C: HARRIS
D: Not the whole time. Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much.
C: BEN
D: Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know?
C: HARRIS
D: Absolutely not. I love you totally and completely. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

N: (TO BEN) Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my lynching rope.
C: DEBBIE

D: I don't take it lightly. I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can you baby sit?"
C: DEBBIE
D: If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more.
N: KNOCKED UP - 66.
C: PETE
D: You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water. Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC" can you watch?
C: DEBBIE
D: I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time. I'm struggling with it right now.

C: PETE
D: That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
C: BEN
D: You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
C: PETE
D: Probably. I'd hide you.
C: BEN
D: How much do wedding rings cost?
C: PETE
D: It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring.

D: That'll be easy. I don't make any money.

D: Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
N: KNOCKED UP - 71.

N: Alison sits on the bed while Ben kneels in front of her.
C: BEN
D: Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you.
C: ALISON
D: I love you too.
C: BEN
D: Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.
C: ALISON
D: But here's the thing.
N: KNOCKED UP - 73.
C: BEN
D: There's a thing?
C: ALISON
D: I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks.
C: BEN
D: Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts. Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.
C: ALISON
D: I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have.
C: BEN
D: That makes sense.
C: ALISON
D: I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?
C: BEN
D: No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally cool.
C: ALISON
D: I really do love you.

D: Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve.
C: DEBBIE
D: The box was empty?
C: ALISON
D: He can't afford a ring.
N: KNOCKED UP - 74.
C: DEBBIE
D: So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?
C: ALISON
D: Yes.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm sorry.
C: ALISON
D: Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried.
C: DEBBIE
D: You need to train him. Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws.
C: ALISON
D: I thought you should love people for who they are.
C: DEBBIE
D: You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change.
C: ALISON
D: You don't think that's naggy?
C: DEBBIE
D: In the end, they thank you for it.
N: I/E DEBBIE'S CAR - DAY Debbie drives Alison and the girls in her car.
C: DEBBIE
D: You can't commit to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after ten years. I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable.
C: ALISON
D: Why do you say that?
C: DEBBIE
D: I think he's cheating on me. He's always going to business meetings at odd hours. Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.
C: ALISON
D: Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that.
C: DEBBIE
D: There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

E: back as Pete
C: DEBBIE

C: PETE
D: No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it.
C: DEBBIE
D: You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously.
C: PETE
D: Do you want to go to India?
C: DEBBIE
D: No. You can go.

C: BEN
D: ...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that. Alison stares at Ben.
E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: It was a flash!
E: CONT'D
C: ALISON
D: What do you mean?
C: BEN
D: Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash?
C: ALISON
D: No. What are you talking about?
C: PETE
D: "Where we're going, we don't need roads."
N: KNOCKED UP - 77.
C: BEN
D: You wouldn't do that?

C: BEN
D: Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine.
C: PETE
D: Everyone has a time machine image.
C: DEBBIE
D: I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other?
C: PETE
D: Who needs a time machine? Ben holds up his drink.
C: BEN
D: This is my time machine!
N: PETE (TO BEN) I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88. BEN (TO PETE) You are a funny motherfucker, man. (TO DEBBIE) How can you fight with him? I just want to kiss his face. He's cute. PETE (TO BEN) I like the way you move.

D: This was a bad kick.
C: ALISON
D: It's fine! It's fine!
C: BEN
D: Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see.
C: ALISON
D: What are you talking about?
C: BEN
D: It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird.

N: ALISON (TO BEN) Where were you?
C: BEN
D: Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay?
C: ALISON
D: Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high?
C: BEN
D: You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the cops. A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS on the payment.

D: Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
C: ALISON
D: Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little?
S: INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner.
C: PETE
D: I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance.
C: BEN
D: Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls.
C: PETE
D: They're incredible.
N: KNOCKED UP - 85.
C: BEN
D: They really aren't good, man.
C: PETE
D: Old Steely Dan.
C: BEN
D: If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP.
C: PETE
D: I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there.
C: BEN
D: That's true.
C: PETE
D: And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.
C: DEBBIE
D: Okay. Have fun. Ben exits.
C: BEN
D: You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious.
S: EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with Alison and Ben. BEN (TO ALISON) She doesn't have a gun, does she?
C: ALISON

C: BEN
D: Oh, great.
S: INT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE
N: Debbie tries the front door, it's unlocked. They enter.
C: BEN
D: Looks like no one's home.
C: DEBBIE
D: Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.
N: KNOCKED UP - 86.
C: BEN
D: I just feel bad for Pete.
C: ALISON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
C: ALISON
D: Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating.
C: BEN
D: Pete!
E: through a fake cough
C: ALISON
D: Stop it.
C: BEN
D: I coughed. What do you want from me? Debbie checks upstairs.
C: DEBBIE
D: There's nobody up there.
C: BEN
D: Thank you.
C: DEBBIE
D: I guess I was wrong.
C: BEN
D: I told you. Can we get out of here, please?
C: ALISON
D: Yeah, come on. Let's go. A MURMUR comes from a far room.
C: DEBBIE
D: Did you hear that?
C: ALISON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: I didn't hear anything.
C: ALISON
D: Come on. Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS dressed in baseball clothing.
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 Ten seconds. KNOCKED UP - 87.
C: PETE
D: Carlos Delgado.
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Excellent choice. Too bad I got him three rounds ago. FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 You're still on the clock.
C: PETE
D: Oh shit!
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 You gotta do something. We need a name here.
C: PETE
D: Hideki Matsui.
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1 Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.
C: PETE
D: Sorry, Charlie.
C: DEBBIE
D: What is this?
C: PETE
D: Debbie.
C: DEBBIE
D: What the fuck is this?
C: PETE
D: It's our fantasy baseball draft.
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 We said no wives.
C: DEBBIE
D: Your fantasy what?
C: PETE
D: It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball. I told you all about this. Got Matsui. Debbie turns and walks out of the room.
C: PETE
D: Aw, shit.
E: CONT'D
N: FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2 Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out! Come on, who's going?
S: EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE
N: Pete and Debbie are in the driveway while Alison and Ben watch from the street. KNOCKED UP - 88.
C: PETE
D: I should have told you.
C: DEBBIE
D: What else have you been lying about?
C: PETE
D: Nothing.
N: BEN (TO ALISON) That guy said, "Don't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out."
C: DEBBIE
D: Where were you on Wednesday?
C: PETE
D: I'm going to be honest with you.
N: ALISON (TO BEN) Yeah, I heard him. BEN (TO ALISON) That was hilarious.
C: DEBBIE
D: That would be a good idea.
C: PETE
D: You've been mad because I've been working so much and I didn't want to upset you.
C: DEBBIE
D: I wouldn't be mad.
C: PETE
D: You would be.
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't get mad.
C: PETE
D: It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not cheating or anything.
C: DEBBIE
D: No, this is worse.
C: PETE
D: How is this worse?
C: DEBBIE
D: This is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family.
C: PETE
D: Look, the reason I make that up is because if I told you what I was really doing, you would just get mad. So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.
N: KNOCKED UP - 89.
C: DEBBIE
D: Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a band?
C: PETE
D: I went to the movies.
C: DEBBIE
D: With who?
C: PETE
D: By myself.
C: DEBBIE
D: What'd you see?
C: PETE
D: "Spiderman Three."
C: DEBBIE
D: Why do you want to go by yourself? Why didn't you ask me to go?
C: PETE
D: Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself.
C: DEBBIE
D: I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears.
C: DEBBIE
D: You're not the only one.
E: CONT'D
C: PETE
D: It's not that big of a deal.
N: DEBBIE (THROUGH TEARS) I like Spiderman.
C: PETE
D: Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week.
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't want to go see it now.
C: PETE
D: Well...
C: DEBBIE
D: I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own.
C: PETE
D: What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do?
N: KNOCKED UP - 90.
C: DEBBIE
D: You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean.
C: PETE
D: I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest.
N: JUST--
C: DEBBIE
D: No, you're not. You're lying.
C: PETE
D: I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.
C: DEBBIE
D: You know what? I don't want you at the house anymore. Okay?
C: PETE
D: Come on. Debbie heads for the car.
C: BEN
D: Oh, shit, she's coming back.
N: I/E ALISON CAR - DAY Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben.
C: BEN
D: How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has.
C: ALISON
D: I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is.
C: BEN
D: That's a little strong, I would say.
C: ALISON
D: Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed.
C: BEN
D: It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny.
C: ALISON
D: What's funny about it?
C: BEN
D: Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.
N: (MORE) KNOCKED UP - 91.
C: BEN
D: We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh.
E: CONT'D
C: ALISON
D: Is that what you think?
C: BEN
D: Yeah.
C: ALISON
D: Is that what you want to do, Ben?
C: BEN
D: I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from.
C: ALISON
D: Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man.
C: BEN
D: Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?
C: ALISON
D: You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong!
C: BEN
D: So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
C: ALISON
D: Yes!
C: BEN
D: I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
C: ALISON
D: Oh, that's helpful. You have to do nothing!
C: BEN
D: I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!
C: ALISON
D: You are just fucking sitting there! You haven't sacrificed anything!
N: KNOCKED UP - 92.
C: BEN
D: I have.
C: ALISON
D: I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina!
C: BEN
D: You've sacrificed your vagina?
C: ALISON
D: Yes! It will never look the same after this!
C: BEN
D: Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery.
C: ALISON
D: You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti.
C: BEN
D: You're right. Fine!
C: ALISON
D: You know what? Get out of the car.
C: BEN
D: Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?!
C: ALISON
D: You should just get out of the fucking car.
C: BEN
D: I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No!
C: ALISON
D: Get out of the car.
C: BEN
D: No!
C: ALISON
D: I own this car! Get out of my car!
C: BEN
D: No.
C: ALISON
D: Get out of my car!
C: BEN
D: No.
N: ALISON (YELLING) Get out of my fucking car! Ben gets out of the car and immediately KNOCKS on the window. KNOCKED UP - 93.
C: BEN
D: Can you let me back in the car, please? Have you calmed down? Did you take a breath? I have no clue where we are! Alison just glares at him.
C: BEN
D: Fine. Go. Great. Alison drives off.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DR. HOWARD'S OFFICE - LATER
N: Alison stands on a scale while DR. HOWARD'S NURSE weighs her.
C: ALISON
D: You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge.
C: DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
D: Don't worry about gaining weight. Your baby wants you to gain a whole mess of weight. Ben walks into the room, winded.
N: ALISON (TO BEN) Are you fucking kidding me?
C: BEN
D: Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't they?
C: ALISON
D: Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little. The Nurse leaves.
C: ALISON
D: Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books.
C: BEN
D: I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?!
N: (MORE) KNOCKED UP - 94.
C: BEN
D: That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved "What to Expect When You're Expecting" on the pyramid walls! I forgot about that! Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?!
E: CONT'D
C: ALISON
D: It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me!
C: BEN
D: Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to me!
C: ALISON
D: If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. Alison holds back tears.
C: ALISON
D: But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.
E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: You know what? I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, "Fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!
C: ALISON
D: Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
C: BEN
D: I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for once. Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away. Dr. Howard's Nurse returns.
C: DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
D: Are you ready?
C: ALISON
D: I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate.
C: DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
D: That's okay. It happens all the time here. It's fine.
N: KNOCKED UP - 95.
C: ALISON
D: I don't feel so stupid, then.

S: INT. DEL'S SALOON
N: Ben and Pete drink at the bar.
C: BEN
D: I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No.
C: PETE
D: Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's... Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever.
C: BEN
D: Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.
C: PETE
D: Let's do it.

C: ALISON
D: Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.
C: DEBBIE
D: We're going to be positive.
C: ALISON
D: How many Red Bulls have you had?
C: DEBBIE
D: I've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes. And I feel fabulous! We're going to create a new life and it's going to be awesome! Let's go!
S: EXT. BEN'S HOUSE
N: Ben and Pete KNOCK on the front door.

C: JASON
D: Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry.
C: BEN
D: Holy crap! What happened?
C: JONAH
D: We got pink eye.
C: BEN
D: What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something?
C: JASON
D: Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
N: KNOCKED UP - 97.
C: JAY
D: Hey, Ben.
C: BEN
D: Yo.
C: JAY
D: How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere.
C: PETE
D: You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow?
C: JONAH
D: Totally.
C: PETE
D: That's awesome.
C: JONAH
D: Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed. Martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst.
C: BEN
D: Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye?
C: MARTIN
D: No. No pink eye for me. I'm just really...high.
C: BEN
D: Well stay back, guys. I got to get my suit. Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub their faces on him. Pete stays outside.
N: JASON (TO PETE) Are you Debbie's husband?
C: PETE
D: Yeah. Jason shuts the door on Pete.
N: I/E. PETE'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT Pete drives with Ben to Vegas. They are wearing suits.

C: BEN
D: We make a good team, man.
C: PETE
D: Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you.
C: BEN
D: She thinks she could train me?
C: PETE
D: Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown.
C: BEN
D: She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off.
C: PETE
D: That's right.
C: BEN
D: In front of a crowd, baby.
C: PETE
D: This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around. Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms.
C: BEN
D: Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?
C: PETE
D: I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes.
C: BEN
D: I'm eating them.

N: Ben and Pete receive lap dances from topless strippers.
C: BEN
D: I love Vegas, man.
C: PETE
D: This is the greatest place on earth.
C: BEN
D: It's really amazing here. The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so that he face is pulled against her butt.
C: PETE
D: Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.
C: BEN
D: Now that's how you get pink eye.

D: What's up? End of the line, please.
C: DEBBIE
D: Really?
C: DOORMAN
D: Yeah.
C: DEBBIE
D: Oh, come on.
C: DOORMAN
D: Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll let some people in when it clears out a little. You'll get right in if you go back to the end of the line.
N: KNOCKED UP - 100.
C: DEBBIE
D: We come here all the time. It's not a big deal. It doesn't really look that crowded in there.
C: DOORMAN
D: Hey, look, I don't make the rules.
C: DEBBIE
D: Please?
C: DOORMAN
D: No. TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.
C: DOORMAN
D: Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get out. Take care of yourself.
E: CONT'D
C: DEBBIE
D: What was that? What the fuck was that?
C: DOORMAN
D: It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you step to the back, please?
N: ALISON (TO DEBBIE) You know what? Maybe we should just go.
C: DEBBIE
D: You don't need to call me sweetie.
C: DOORMAN
D: Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend.
C: DEBBIE
D: No, you don't need to call me sweetie.
C: DOORMAN
D: All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm not going to go to the end of the fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls! What, am I not skanky enough for you?! You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your problem?! I'm not going anywhere! You're just some `roided out freak with a fucking clipboard. And your stupid little fucking rope! You may have power now, but you're not God. You're a doorman! Okay? You're a doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves.
N: KNOCKED UP - 101. The Doorman grabs Debbie and takes her aside.
C: DOORMAN
D: Come here, come on. The Doorman takes Debbie aside.
N: DOORMAN (WHISPERING) I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I fucking hate this job. I don't want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in. This shit makes me sick to my stomach. I get the runs from the stress. It's not because you're not hot. I would love to tap that ass. I would tear that ass up. I can't let you in because you're old as fuck...for this club, not, you know, for the earth.
C: DEBBIE
D: What?
C: DOORMAN
D: You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that. Five percent. That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.
C: DEBBIE
D: Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.
C: DOORMAN
D: Why y'all want to be in here anyway? Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something.
N: (REGARDING ALISON) What the fuck is she doing at the club? That's not even good parenting right there. Your old ass should know better than that.

D: This was a great idea, man.
C: PETE
D: This is the best idea I've ever had in my life. Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each other.
C: BEN
D: What are they going to do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. (imitating one of the

D: What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted my brother. The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.

C: ALISON
D: So dance.
C: DEBBIE
D: I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.
C: ALISON
D: I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and--
C: DEBBIE
D: You look beautiful. You're young and you're tall and you got the good lips and boobs. I'm going to be alone.
C: ALISON
D: Debbie, no, you're not.
C: DEBBIE
D: Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I get worse looking and he gets better looking, and it's so fucking unfair. Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve. She's such a pissy little high- school cunt.
S: INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. A scene from "CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" plays on the television. Steve Martin juggles all of his children. STEVE MARTIN (ON TV) Let's move, gang! Come on, come on, come on! Jessica, can you get these plates and put them on the table, please?! KNOCKED UP - 104.
C: BEN
D: This isn't funny. That guy has twelve kids. It's not funny. This is sick. This is a sick movie. That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. That's not funny. I got to turn this off. It's freaking me out. Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.
C: PETE
D: There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.
C: BEN
D: Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here?
C: PETE
D: These are five different types of chair.
C: BEN
D: Get them out of here, man. This is too many chairs for one room.

E: CONT'D
C: BEN
D: The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. I don't like them. Pete switches to another chair.
C: PETE
D: Oh, wow!
C: BEN
D: It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them. Pete switched to another tall chair.

D: I'm up high! I'm really high up.

C: BEN
D: All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me.
C: PETE

E: CONT'D

C: BEN
D: Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man. Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.
E: CONT'D
C: PETE
D: Tastes like a rainbow.
C: BEN
D: You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home.

C: BEN
D: We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
C: ALISON
D: You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie.
C: BEN
D: But Debbie's happy.
C: ALISON
D: She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
N: KNOCKED UP - 110.
C: BEN
D: I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
C: ALISON
D: And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and...
C: BEN
D: I'm not that guy anymore.
C: ALISON
D: We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be.
C: BEN
D: If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con-- Debbie approaches.

D: He did. We'll take good care of you. Samuel?
C: SAMUEL
D: Yeah?
C: FEMALE NURSE
D: This is Alison Scott. Please admit her into room 307.
C: SAMUEL
D: All right. Hi.
C: BEN
D: You're our nurse?
C: SAMUEL
D: That's why I'm holding the clipboard. So, uh, what else is up with you guys?
N: KNOCKED UP - 125. Ben and Alison stare at Samuel.
C: SAMUEL
D: I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV.
C: SAMUEL
D: So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein. That little guy really didn't want me to find him.
C: ALISON
D: Is that the baby on that one right there? Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.
C: SAMUEL
D: Yeah. That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing.
C: ALISON
D: Okay. A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.
C: BEN
D: We really, really appreciate you coming, man.
C: DR. KUNI
D: What else do I have to do, I mean, besides sleep? I was only kidding. What happened to your doctor?
C: BEN
D: He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Nice.
C: BEN
D: Yeah.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish friends.
C: ALISON
D: Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Let's just take a look and see what happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is good. Samuel, where are we?
N: KNOCKED UP - 126.
C: SAMUEL
D: Four centimeters.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Four centimeters what?
C: SAMUEL
D: Dilated.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?
S: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM
N: Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room.

D: What?
C: JONAH
D: I just want to get the fuck out of here.
C: JAY
D: Just relax, man, just relax.
C: JONAH
D: I don't fucking like hospitals.
C: JAY
D: Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby.
C: JONAH
D: I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face?
C: JAY
D: Jesus.
C: JONAH
D: Fucking shit.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: Ben massages Alison's back.
C: BEN
D: Is that good?
N: KNOCKED UP - 127.
C: ALISON
D: Oh, yeah, get in there.
C: BEN
D: I could do this all day. The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.
C: ALISON
D: What was that?
C: BEN
D: What the hell was that? Samuel hurries in to check the monitor.
C: BEN
D: What's that, what's happening? Dr. Kuni enters.
E: CONT'D
C: DR. KUNI
D: Well, boy and girls, what seems to be the problem?
C: SAMUEL
D: Decels.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to turn on your back now, okay? The baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?
C: BEN
D: It's going to be okay. Is it going to be fine? Alison turns onto her back.
E: to Dr. Kuni
C: DR. KUNI
D: It's going to be fine. Okay?
N: (TO ALISON) You're going to feel a little bit of a push. Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby.
C: BEN
D: What are you doing?
C: DR. KUNI
D: I'm turning the baby so I can take the pressure off the cord.
C: ALISON
D: Oh, my God. The monitors stops beeping.
N: KNOCKED UP - 128.
C: DR. KUNI
D: We're good. The heartbeat's stronger, but we're not out of the woods. We need to get things going now. I think the cord is wrapped around the neck. Okay?
C: BEN
D: What?
C: DR. KUNI
D: So I'm going to give you some medicine, pop the bag and get things going, okay? I don't want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain.
C: ALISON
D: No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Now, things change. We don't have time to debate this.
C: ALISON
D: What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable with that. I'm not.
C: BEN
D: No. Would you please just listen to her?
C: DR. KUNI
D: Fine. Do what you want to do.
C: BEN
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
C: DR. KUNI
D: Should I leave? Do you want to be the doctor? Because I really don't need to be here.
C: BEN
D: No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want.
C: DR. KUNI
D: No. You mean you want to take a second to tell me how to do my job. My job is to get that baby out safely. Or I can go home! You just let me know. You be the doctor.
C: BEN
D: Can we talk outside in the hall for a second?
S: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
N: Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway. KNOCKED UP - 129.
C: DR. KUNI
D: That woman is a control freak, and she needs to let go and let me do my job.
C: BEN
D: Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Okay. if you want a special experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet concert. We have a new birth plan: Get the baby out safely.
C: BEN
D: Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her. Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Are you okay?
C: BEN
D: I think so.
C: DR. KUNI
D: I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.
C: BEN
D: Thank you, man.
C: DR. KUNI
D: This is healthy. This is good. I think we're bonding.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Alison, I apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up. Because once the bag is broken, I don't want there to be an infection.
C: ALISON
D: Whatever. Do what you have to do. Dr. Kuni exits.
C: ALISON
D: Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is.
E: CONT'D whispering to Ben
N: KNOCKED UP - 130.
C: BEN
D: I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now.
C: ALISON
D: I'm so sorry I broke up with you.
C: BEN
D: You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?
C: ALISON
D: I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat.
C: BEN
D: No, no.
C: ALISON
D: It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me.
C: BEN
D: Me neither.
C: ALISON
D: I guess he is.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
N: Martin and Jonah wheel around the corner in wheelchairs.

N: JONAH (IMPERSONATING STEPHEN
C: HAWKING)
D: I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock.
N: (STOPS IMPERSONATION) All right. Let's murderball. Come here! I'm going to murderball you! Jonah kicks Martin's wheelchair over.

D: Hi. I can't believe I go out of town and this happens.
C: ALISON
D: I know.
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.
C: ALISON
D: Screw Legoland.
C: PETE
D: All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles.
C: ALISON
D: No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great.
N: DEBBIE (TO BEN) Well, thank you. I've got it from here.
C: ALISON
D: Debbie.
N: BEN (TO DEBBIE) Can I talk to you in the hall for a second?
C: DEBBIE
D: Why?
S: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
N: Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone.
C: BEN
D: I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you.
C: DEBBIE
D: Okay. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you.
N: KNOCKED UP - 132.
C: BEN
D: Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM
N: Debbie sits down in a seat next to Pete.
C: PETE
D: What are you doing here?
C: DEBBIE
D: He just kicked me out. He told me to leave. But I guess it's good, right? He said he's going to take care of her. He really seems on his game. I think he's going to be a good dad. I think I like him. Thank God.
C: PETE
D: I wish I'd gotten that on tape.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: Alison is in labor. She is PANTING.

D: I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural!
C: BEN
D: Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay?
C: ALISON
D: Okay?
C: BEN
D: Give it to her now.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Alison, we're past the point of an epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.
N: KNOCKED UP - 133.
C: ALISON
D: No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time!
C: DR. KUNI
D: We can't give you the epidural.
C: ALISON
D: Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.
C: BEN
D: We have time.
C: ALISON
D: I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!
C: BEN
D: Just do it, please!
C: DR. KUNI
D: I'm sorry. We have no time. We're going to just have to do this the all natural way, okay? The way you wanted to do it. Okay? Ready?
C: ALISON
D: Okay.
C: DR. KUNI
D: Here comes another contraction, okay? I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good, good, good.
C: ALISON
D: I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening.
C: SAMUEL
D: Maybe we can take it down just a little. I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women.
C: ALISON
D: Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me?
S: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM
N: Alison's SHRIEKING is heard in the waiting room.
C: JAY
D: Jesus.
C: JONAH
D: Oh. This is messed up. Something's wrong in there.
C: JASON
D: No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb?
N: KNOCKED UP - 134.
C: DEBBIE
D: Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone. Everyone goes through this.
C: JAY
D: No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do. Jay goes to Alison's room.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
N: Alison is in agony. Ben, Dr. Kuni and nurses are hunched around her.
C: DR. KUNI
D: It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!
C: ALISON
D: Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben? Been peers down between Alison's legs. We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being pushed out of Alison's vagina.
C: BEN
D: Oh, God.
C: ALISON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: You don't want to see it. You don't
N: WANT--
C: ALISON
D: No, I want to see it!
C: BEN
D: It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.

D: Me go in there? That's the last fucking place I want to go. Like I'm going to go in there. Try getting a boner now. Jason beams at Debbie.

S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
N: Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby. Everyone else has gone home.
C: BEN
D: And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already," which was very confusing to Daddy. So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already. What would you do? Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here. Isn't that nice? I think it is.
E: to the baby
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

C: I/E ALISON'S CAR
D: Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.
C: ALISON
D: I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us.
C: BEN
D: It definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
C: ALISON
D: Well, I look good in red.
N: KNOCKED UP - 139.
C: BEN
D: I look good in blue. The fighting continues. We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings.
C: ALISON
D: Yeah.
C: BEN
D: We both look good in gold.
C: ALISON
D: Good choice. I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
C: BEN
D: No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than twelve. It might take us around three hours to get home, though. The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting behind them.
T: FADE OUT.
