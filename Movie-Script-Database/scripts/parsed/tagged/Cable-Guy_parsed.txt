N: Shooting Script October 31, 1995 (White) Revised Pages November 13, 1995 (Blue) Revised Pages November 14, 1995 (Pink) 1 FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly image. The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch television. The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote control. The hand changes channels frantically. The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception. Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up.
C: STEVE
D: Jesus, where's the cable guy already?
E: looks at watch
N: END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE
S: 1A INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just moved in. The phone rings.
C: STEVEN
D: Hello.
E: into the phone
N: 2 NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television set. ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."
C: RICK
D: How's the move going?
S: 3 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.
C: STEVEN
D: Horrible. The cable guy is missing in action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death.
C: RICK
D: You haven't called Robin have you? Please tell me you didn't call her.
C: STEVEN
D: No, I'm giving her space. I can't believe she's doing this.
E: sarcastically beat
C: RICK
D: You never should have asked her to marry you. You're the mad smotherer.
C: STEVEN
D: All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger.
C: RICK
D: You forced her to evaluate the relationship. If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was.
C: STEVE
D: I don't want to talk about it. So what time are you going to come by?
C: RICK
D: I can't. I'm working double shifts the rest of the week.
C: STEVEN
D: It's my first night here. Don't do this to me.
C: RICK
D: The other camera guy pulled out his back. Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn't that enough?
C: STEVEN
D: Fine, fine.
C: RICK
D: One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty ones.
C: STEVEN
D: I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot.
C: RICK
D: None of them say no, believe me. I'll talk to you later.
N: Steven hangs up, and waits.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 4 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it back in the box.
S: 4A EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
N: Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck pulls into a gated side garage.

S: 6 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still nothing. He pulls it off frustrated.
S: 7 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable to fill his day without cable.
C: STEVEN
D: Where the hell is he?

N: Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently. CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.
S: 9 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He picks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.

E: to himself
N: He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.
S: 11 INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.
C: THE DOORBELL RINGS STEVEN
D: Oh great.
E: annoyed
N: THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.
C: STEVEN
D: Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!
S: 12 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Steven runs to the door.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hello! Cable Guy!
E: OS
N: Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole. P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE The CABLE GUY is walking away.
S: INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
N: Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, wait!
N: The Cable Guy turns back.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Well, look who decided to show up. I was just gonna go collect my retirement pension.
N: The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.
C: STEVEN
D: You were supposed to be here four hours ago.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to know.
C: STEVEN
D: Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath place, but now it's closed. CABLE GUY
N: (turns to leave) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk off! (turns back smiling) I'm just joking. Let's do this. (looks around) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here.
C: STEVEN
D: What happened?
C: CABLE GUY
D: They had a lot of cats.
E: long beat
N: They walk into Steven's living room.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a comment card.
N: He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Please mail it in when I am done.
C: STEVEN
D: These go to your boss?
C: CABLE GUY
D: No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss perfectioniss perfectioniss t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with.
E: he strains to lose his lisp
N: The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me baby. Tell me where you like it. That's it baby.
N: He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Here's your sweet spot.
N: He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So your lady kicked you out.
C: STEVEN
D: What?
C: CABLE GUY
D: In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.
C: STEVEN
D: I really don't want to talk about it with you. Could you please just install my cable? I'm going to get dressed.
C: CABLE GUY
D: No sweat.
N: Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you.
C: STEVEN
D: Okay, whatever.
N: Steven walks toward his bedroom.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be channel surfing in no time.
N: The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.
S: 13 INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.
C: RIKKI KLIEMAN
D: So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four.
E: to camera
N: A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.
C: RIKKI KLIEMAN
D: Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy."
E: to camera
N: ANGLE ON Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.
C: STEVEN
D: How's it going?
N: The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard.
N: Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible.
C: STEVEN
D: What happened?
E: looks around
C: CABLE GUY
D: The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool?
E: jumps to his feet
C: STEVEN
E: non-confrontational
C: I
D: guess so.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You programmed? Then let me slave your remotes.
E: off of Steven's look
N: He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone.
C: STEVEN
D: So after this I'll only need one remote for everything?
C: CABLE GUY
D: You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself. Now let me check your levels.
E: he finishes
N: With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.
C: CABLE GUY
D: All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here.
N: Steven does.
C: CABLE GUY
D: That gave me power of attorney over you. Joking.
E: beat
N: Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm about finished here. Okay. I feel good about this.
E: beat
N: Cable Guy walks to the door.
C: STEVEN
D: One thing.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Yeah!
E: turns back immediately
C: STEVEN I
D: uh I have this friend and he said he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you ever heard of anything like that?
C: CABLE GUY
D: You mean illegal cable?
E: deadly serious
C: STEVEN
D: Uh yes.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Who told you that? I want his name.
C: STEVEN
D: Forget it.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You're offering me a bribe? What you have just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional facility.
C: STEVEN
D: Please that was dumb. I was just making conversation 
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All it is is a push of a button.
E: laughs
N: He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh, great. How much?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a solid.
C: STEVEN
D: That is so nice.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or something. Here is my personal beeper number. It's just for my preferred customers. Never call the company, they'll just put you on hold.
E: hands him a card
C: STEVEN
D: Thanks. Really. You're gonna get some good marks here.
E: holds up comment card - jokes
C: CABLE GUY
D: Maybe some day I'll take you out to the satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It's really incredible.
C: STEVEN
D: Sure. We should do that one day.
C: CABLE GUY
D: How 'bout tomorrow?
C: STEVEN
D: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.
C: CABLE GUY
D: What are you going to do, sit home and stew about your ex?
C: STEVEN
D: No.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line. Sorry.
E: insulted
C: STEVEN
D: You didn't cross the line.
E: guilty
C: CABLE GUY
D: No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty. On the flip side.
N: The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into that. (End Revision - Pink)
S: 14 INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks impressed. Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.
C: STEVEN
D: There are twenty-four classrooms; each can be converted into a 1400 square foot home. The facility has two tennis courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents decide they want to perform "Oklahoma."
N: Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.
C: STEVEN
D: The kitsch appeal of living in an old schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this thing.
N: There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.
C: MR. DANIELS
D: Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling good?
C: STEVE
D: Yeah.
C: MR. DANIELS
D: Did I hear something about you having some troubles at home?
C: STEVE
D: Robin and I have been having a difficult time. I moved out, but I really think it's only temporary.
C: MR. DANIELS
D: Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a big mother. Know what I mean? If it fails, corporate's going to have my ass. I've got confidence in you, but you hear where I'm coming from, bro?
C: STEVEN
D: Absolutely. Now I've got more time than ever. It's a good thing. I know I can pull this thing off.
E: laughs
C: MR. DANIELS
D: Then what are you doing talking to me? You've got a lot of work to do. Get to it!
E: playfully
C: STEVEN
D: Thank you. I will.
N: Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, JOAN.
C: STEVEN
D: I'll be right back.
S: 14A INT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY
N: Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office. 15 OMITTED
S: 16 INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY
N: ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has written. Steven peeks his head in her door.
C: STEVEN
D: Hello.
N: Robin's face drops.
C: ROBIN
D: Steven, what are you doing here?
C: STEVEN
D: I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush article come out?
N: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
C: ROBIN
D: They liked it. I thought we agreed we weren't going to see each other for a month.
E: beat
C: STEVEN
D: I know, it's just Daniels accepted my proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.
C: ROBIN
D: That's wonderful, congratulations.
C: STEVEN
D: I know I'm breaking the rules, but come have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.
C: ROBIN
D: I don't think we should.
C: STEVEN
D: Come on, this is the biggest day of my career.
C: ROBIN
D: Don't put me in this position.
C: STEVEN
D: What position? I want to share this with you.
C: ROBIN
D: I love you, but I need to take some time on my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean this is exactly why we broke up, because you never listen to me.
E: feeling pressured
C: STEVE
D: What? Now we're broken up? What happened to 'trial separation?'
C: ROBIN
D: I can't get into this now. If you haven't noticed, I'm at work.
C: STEVE
D: Sorry to disturb you.
N: He turns to leave. (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
C: ROBIN
D: Steven. Congratulations. I know how much this means to you. You deserve it.
E: sincerely
C: STEVEN
D: Thanks.
N: He leaves. 17 OMITTED
S: 17A INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.
N: Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never stopping for more than a second. He hears a horn honking outside.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!
E: OS
N: ON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant. Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in his window honking the horn.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Steven!!!! Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!
E: waves
N: Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the television. ON THE TV - The local news.
C: REPORTER
D: Coming up next a special report, "Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."
N: Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come down.
C: STEVEN
D: What the hell.
E: begins walking to the door
S: 18 EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
N: Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The Cable Company - Get Wired Today."
C: STEVEN
D: How's it going?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Howdy partner. Climb aboard.
N: Steven gets in.
S: 19 INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
N: The van drives onto the main boulevard.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Thanks for coming out. You know most people think cable is just a simple co-ax that comes out of the wall. They never take the time to understand how it works.
C: STEVEN
D: Where exactly are we goin?
C: CABLE GUY
D: We're going to take a ride on the information superhighway.
S: 20 EXT. CITY - DUSK
N: Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.
C: CABLE GUY
D: It all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod Electronics, created the first cable television system.
N: The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, overlooking the entire city.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.
S: 21 EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK
N: Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I come here to think sometimes. To clear my head.
N: They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's controls are located.
C: CABLE GUY
D: There she is. Right now she's sending entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens.
C: STEVEN
D: That's pretty impressive.
C: CABLE GUY
D: See, I knew the moment I met you that you would appreciate this.
N: The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.
C: CABLE GUY
D: The future is now. Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities. Come on up! What are you waiting for?!
E: with wonder waves to Steven
S: 22 INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT
N: The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that there are billions of bits of information surging through me.
C: STEVEN
D: I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess I've always taken it for granted.
C: CABLE GUY
D: When I was a kid my mom worked nights. Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me.
C: STEVEN
D: I know what you mean. My dad was there, but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town.
C: CABLE GUY
D: That's tough. You must have a lot of abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, right?
E: moved
C: STEVEN
D: You know my brother's a speech therapist.
E: tentative
N: The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So?
N: There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.
C: STEVEN
D: Never mind.
N: The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So, you're pretty love struck about your lady, huh?
E: beat
C: STEVEN
D: I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she asked me to move out.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I hate that.
C: STEVEN
D: She said she felt pressured. Can you believe that?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I don't think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is. All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly giving, it will come back to you ten-fold.
C: STEVEN
D: You're right. That is remarkably insightful.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final thought on Friday's show.
S: 23 EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
N: The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You know what? Women are suckers for "Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this month. That's your bait right there.
C: STEVEN
D: Robin loves that movie.
C: CABLE GUY
D: They all do. Next time you talk to her tell her you're cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself. Sound like you're happier than a pig in shit. She'll come running. Betcha. Then just play it cool.
C: STEVEN
D: Maybe I will.
N: Steven gets out of the car.
C: STEVEN
D: Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't know your name. What is it?
C: CABLE GUY
D: You really want to know my name? You do? Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my friends call me Chip.
E: touched
C: STEVEN
D: I'll see ya' Chip.
N: Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Let's just remember right now. You know some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true friend. I guess we're the lucky ones.
E: long pause
N: (End Revised - Pink) STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.
C: STEVEN
D: Uh good-bye.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the flip side.
N: Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.
S: 24 INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY
N: Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.
C: STEVEN
D: I don't listen to you. I pretend to understand but I'm really just saying what I think you want to hear. So from now on I'm going to try my best to listen more because I do love you and am interested in learning about every detail about the complicated splendor that is you.
N: Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.
C: ROBIN
D: Oh.
C: STEVEN
D: I want us to get back together, but I can see why taking this time might be good for us. So, I'm not mad.
N: After a long beat, Robin smiles.
C: ROBIN
D: Sometimes time apart is healthy.
C: STEVEN
D: You're right. Well, that's what I came here to say. Look, I've got to get back to the office.
N: He starts getting up.
C: ROBIN
D: So, are you doing anything tomorrow?
C: STEVEN
D: I'm just going to cook myself dinner and watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is on cable.
C: ROBIN
D: Really?
C: STEVEN
D: If you're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment.
C: ROBIN
D: Okay, maybe I will.
N: He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case. ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news update.
C: TABITHA SOREN
D: Today in the Sam Sweet case the prosecution played the 911 call that Sam Sweet made the night he murdered his brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one month later.
N: The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen. SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE (crying and babbling) Hello, please send help. My twin brother has been shot. 911 OPERATOR Slow down sir. What happened?
C: SAM SWEET
D: Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun four times. I mean I think it was a shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I think it was an Asian gang or something. They were speaking some other language.
N: Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.
C: TABITHA SOREN
D: Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare interview with Michael Jackson's zoo- keeper.
S: 25 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
N: Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.
C: STEVEN
D: Here, here, here.
N: A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.
C: RICK
D: Shit! My fault! My fault!
E: to himself
C: STEVEN
D: Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There is no stopping me today.
N: Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd run the court for a couple of innings.
C: RICK
D: Great. We need another man.
E: gestures to injured player
C: STEVEN
D: This is Chip Douglas my cable guy.
N: Rick smiles in recognition.
C: CABLE GUY
D: We met about a week ago during a routine installation, but I feel like I've known him my whole life.
N: Steven can't believe this is happening.
C: RICK
D: Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.
C: CABLE GUY
D: No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm skins.
N: The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is scary.
C: JEFF
D: I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just play.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.
N: The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone stares at him until he finishes.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Let's get it on!
C: STEVEN
D: Are you any good?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Feed me under the boards and you'll find out.
N: Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Traveling! That's traveling!
E: doing the traveling hand signal
C: RICK
D: Yeah, whatever you say Chip.
N: Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: All right, so we're playing that type of game. Prison rules. I get it.
N: Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss crosses all over the court.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm open!
N: Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the process. The ball goes in.
C: CABLE GUY
D: And one! That's definitely a foul! You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants.
E: does the foul hand signal to Jeff
C: STEVEN
D: What are you doing?
E: to Cable Guy
C: CABLE GUY
D: Don't play from fear Steven. We can take these guys.
N: MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V. a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it down. b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including Rick. c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders with Rick. d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down hard.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Take it to the hole!
N: Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, are you okay?
N: He pulls Steven up.
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah. I'm fine.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.
N: The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.
C: RICK
D: What the hell was that? That's it. I've had enough.
E: enraged
N: Everyone begins to exit the court.
C: JEFF
D: Thanks for bringing your "friend".
N: The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Good game. You were tough out there. Your play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that.
E: slaps Rick on the butt
C: RICK
D: Yeah.
E: dismissive
N: He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.
C: STEVEN
D: What are you doing?
C: CABLE GUY
D: It was payback time. I was protecting you.
N: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)
C: STEVEN
D: You ruined the game.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I don't appreciate your tone Steven. That's not the way friends speak to each other.
C: STEVEN
D: What are you talking about? I don't even know you!
C: CABLE GUY
D: Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a Heineken?
C: STEVEN
D: No, I'm going home.
N: Steven turns to leave.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've got to go shower up and do some stuff. I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you call me or something.
N: The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.
C: CABLE GUY
D: And down low.
N: Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Too slow. Have a good one.
E: pulls his hand away so Steven misses it
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah, have a good one.
E: as he walks away
S: 26 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT
N: Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion. (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
C: MESSAGE VOICE
D: You have eleven messages.
C: STEVEN'S MOTHER
D: Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm still your mother.

C: CABLE GUY
D: Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when you get in. I'll be here pretty much all night. Bye. Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a call when you get a chance. I was just taking a whiz, thought you might have called. Okay later. Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you. All right, bye.
E: ON THE MACHINE beep beep tone beep tone beep tone
N: Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls.
C: CABLE GUY
D: We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here. You're it! I was just blow drying my hair and I thought I heard the phone ringing. you're a tough man to reach. I guess you're too busy to call your friends.
E: fast forwards fast forwards fast forwards fast forwards
N: (Revision Ends - Blue) Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then 
C: CABLE GUY
D: Shit.
E: ON THE MACHINE long beat - then quiet and distant
N: The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed casually, but looks beautiful.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, good to see you.
N: There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.
C: STEVEN
D: Come on in. What do you think of the place?
N: She looks at the odd placement of furniture.
C: ROBIN
D: You made some interesting choices laying out the room.
C: STEVEN
D: That's actually where the movers put the furniture. I'm gonna change it, very soon.
E: embarrassed
C: ROBIN
D: No, I like it.
S: 27 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.
C: ROBIN
D: So how's work?
C: STEVEN
D: Work's good.
C: ROBIN
D: How's Hal?
C: STEVEN
D: Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless.
C: ROBIN
D: It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up.
C: STEVEN
D: I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done.
C: ROBIN
D: It's nice to see you doing so well.
C: STEVEN
D: Well, it's nice just to see you. Hey, it should be starting.
E: looks at his watch
N: They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.
C: STEVEN
D: Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.
C: ROBIN
D: It's alright. We can watch it another night.
C: STEVEN
D: No, no. We really should see it now. Now's a good time.
N: He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.
C: STEVEN
D: Wait, wait. I know what to do.
N: He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials it, then presses the number in.
C: STEVEN
D: The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll just page him. We'll have this fixed in no time.
N: (Revised 11/14/95 - Pink) Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing  THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.
C: STEVEN
D: That was fast.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Is there a problem with your service?
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah my cable went out.
N: Steven pushes him out into the hall.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Really?
N: The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So you called me. Interesting how you call when you need something. Is that how you treat people?
C: STEVEN
D: I've been really busy. You've got to get my cable going, Robin is here. This is really important.
N: He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back out.
C: CABLE GUY
D: But calling me back isn't?
C: STEVEN
D: I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Why should I help you? I gave you free cable. What have you ever done for me?
C: STEVEN
D: Anything you want. Name it  quickly.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Tomorrow night, we hang out.
C: STEVEN
D: Fine, whatever you want.
C: CABLE GUY
D: God bless you. You're too good to me.
N: The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.
C: CABLE GUY
D: All set.
E: loud-normally
C: STEVEN
D: So what's with the cut cord?
C: CABLE GUY
D: That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow Steven. She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't even touch her. Fight the urge at all costs. It will pay off later with
E: nonchalantly conspiratorially
N: He makes a motion which implies sex.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Enjoy the flick.
N: The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.
C: ROBIN
D: Who was that?
C: STEVEN
D: Nobody.
N: Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy. 28 ON THE TV A scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle." The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van  alone. We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we can tell that he lives there. 29 (SCENE 29 OMITTED)
S: 30 EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK
N: The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of a weird mood. How'd things go with you? Keep 'em closed.
C: STEVEN
D: Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the other night. I didn't appreciate you --
C: CABLE GUY
D: Don't peek. I want this to be a surprise.
C: STEVEN
D: I really don't need to be surprised. Where are we going?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Only the best restaurant in town.
N: They walk around a corner.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Okay, here we are. Open sesame.
N: Steven opens his eyes. The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."
C: STEVEN
D: Medieval Times?
C: CABLE GUY
D: I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I'm buying.
S: 31 INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER
N: The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc. (Revision Ends - Pink)
C: STEVEN
D: Funny. I never thought I would ever come here.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I love this place. I come here twice a week.
N: A Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Oh man, that's my look. I love big butts. Ow, that hurts.
N: He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.
C: CABLE GUY
D: There oughta be a law. Man she is hot. It's just not fair.
C: STEVEN
D: Please don't.
E: gestures to him squeezing his crotch
C: CABLE GUY
D: You know what I need right now? Pooooon tang. And I'm not talking about the place in Vietnam.
C: STEVEN
D: Good to know.
N: They sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not enthusiastic about her job.
C: WAITRESS
D: Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is Melinda. I'll be your serving wench. May I get you something from the bar keep?
E: flatly
C: CABLE GUY
D: Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King's thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust.
E: too into it
C: WAITRESS
D: I'll be right back my lord.
E: uninspired
N: The Cable Guy puts something together.
C: CABLE GUY
D: There you go.
N: He hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on.
C: STEVEN
D: Thanks for the help.
N: The Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Steven, don't turn around, but there is a woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn't eaten in a week.
N: Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.
C: STEVEN
D: Really? What does she look like?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total robo-babe.
C: STEVEN
D: Are you serious?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Don't look.
C: STEVEN
D: I've got to look.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like you are looking for the waitress.
N: Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the cable Guy, annoyed.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind. But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief.
C: STEVEN
D: You got me.
E: not laughing
C: CABLE GUY
D: So what did you want to rap about?
N: The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hold that thought. Show's on.
N: The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena. 32 ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN "ROBIN HOOD" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD
C: HOST
D: Welcome to a magnificent journey into the past. This is Medieval Times!
N: The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds.
C: HOST
D: Are you prepapred for a night of feasting and sport the likes of which ye will never forget?!
N: The audience applauds.
C: HOST
D: I charge you to stand up on your feet and cheer for your section's knight!
N: ON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Let the games begin! The Red Knight rules! Blue Knight! You're going down! Going down!
N: An embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down.
S: 33 INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER
N: ON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on horseback. ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands while watching the show.
C: STEVEN
D: Could I get a knife and fork?
E: to the Watiress
C: WAITRESS
D: There were no utensils in Medieval Times, so there are no utensils at 'Medieval Times.' Do you want a refill on that Pepsi?
C: STEVEN
D: There were no utensils, but there was Pepsi?
C: WAITRESS
D: Look, I have a lot of tables to get to.
N: The waitress exits.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no mercy!
E: stands up - yells to the competitors
N: The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins. The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Come on, get into it, we won!
E: to Steven
N: Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds.
C: STEVEN
D: Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing. Good work.
E: halfheartedly
N: Steven and the Cable Guy sit down.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So, what were you saying before?
C: STEVEN
D: How do I put this? I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but...
E: tentatively
C: CABLE GUY
D: That's why I became a cable guy. To make friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there was something there. I just knew it.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh lord. I want you to know --
E: sotto tries to get back on track
N: The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting Steven.
C: HOST
D: We have reached the climax of our competition good people! Now, two noble men from our audience will battle to the death to resolve a grievance. Will a Master... Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie Douglas make you way to the fighting pit!
E: looks at his clipboard
N: A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.
C: STEVEN
D: What's going on?
C: CABLE GUY
D: We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.
C: STEVEN
D: Is this a normal part of the show?
C: CABLE GUY
D: No, but I give all the Knights free cable. They said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little while.
N: Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.
C: STEVEN
D: Is this safe?
C: CABLE GUY
D: That's what the armor's for.
S: 34 INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER
N: Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not be happier. Steven is freaked out.
C: STEVEN
D: What are we supposed to do? We've got to be careful we don't hurt each other.
N: The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I cannot listen to any of your instructions for you are my sworn enemy, and are about to meet your demise.
N: Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.
C: HOST
D: Let the battle begin. Come now people, let me hear your voices!
N: The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to the center of the pit. The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven mirrors him, not sure of what to do.
C: STEVEN
D: Just take it easy.
N: The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his shield.
C: STEVEN
D: What are you doing?!
E: enraged
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm trying to kill you.
E: matter of fact
N: The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, watch it!
N: The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the ground.
C: CABLE GUY
D: This is just like when Spock had to fight Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced to do battle.
N: Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.
C: CABLE GUY
D: That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good show.
N: Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground. By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.
C: CABLE GUY
D: So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough.
N: The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground. The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar weapon, and then begin to circle each other.
C: STEVEN
D: Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop it!
C: CABLE GUY
D: The name is Spock. If we don't battle to the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye Jim.
N: He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek Battle Music" as they fight.
C: STEVEN
D: This isn't 'Star Trek!'
N: MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle. Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection.
C: STEVEN
D: Jesus.
E: looking down
N: The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting stick. The show's host runs up to Steven.
C: HOST
D: Quickly, muster a top your steed. Get on the god damn horse! I don't think he's kidding!
E: Steven doesn't move - the host drops character
N: Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
C: STEVEN
D: Don't do this!
C: CABLE GUY
D: Jim, we have no choice!
C: STEVEN
D: Oh my god.
N: They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick. The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet.
C: STEVEN
D: Are you okay?
E: concerned
N: The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Well done good sir. You are the victor, but we shall meet again.
N: The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms in triumph, and smiles.

N: They are walking up the stairs.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You've got a real warrior's instinct.
C: STEVEN
D: I've got to admit there's a real feeling of power holding that jousting stick.
C: CABLE GUY
D: If Robin saw you tonight, she would be begging you to take her back. I'm telling you these knights get laid all the time.

N: Steven turns on the lights.
C: CABLE GUY
D: What do you think?
N: Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.
C: STEVEN
D: What is this?
C: CABLE GUY
D: I took the liberty of updating your in home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants.
C: STEVEN
D: You went in my house when I wasn't home?
C: CABLE GUY
D: How else was I supposed to get the stuff in here? Magic?
C: STEVEN
D: How much did this cost?
C: CABLE GUY
D: Practically nothing. I have a connection. Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up.
C: STEVEN
D: Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't feel right.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Yes but you give me something so much more valuable friendship.
C: STEVEN
D: And you've given me friendship, so we're even. Really, don't take it personally, but you've got to take it back.

D: Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday?

D: Sure, no problem. And don't get me wrong. I really appreciate the gesture.
E: guilty
C: CABLE GUY
D: Mm-hmm. Staple gun?
E: beat
C: STEVEN

C: CABLE GUY
D: I wish I had friends like that.
C: STEVEN
D: Get out of my house!
C: CABLE GUY
D: Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able to get a freebie.
C: STEVEN
D: Out, now! I don't ever want to see you again. Robin is never going to forgive me.
E: to himself
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't tell her. You want to get her back, I'll help you get her back.
C: STEVEN
D: I don't want your help. I want you to leave. And take that stuff out of here.

C: RAY
D: So, Gail told me you're just coming off a relationship.

C: CABLE GUY
D: My pleasure.
N: The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're dry. The man is aghast.
C: CABLE GUY

N: The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't it?

D: If you need anything, just let me know. Anything at all.
E: OS
C: RAY
D: I think I can handle it.
E: getting annoyed
N: Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm here to serve you.
C: RAY
D: Jesus! Get out of here!
C: CABLE GUY
D: Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services, for instance 
N: The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is so very important.
N: He pulls his face out.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Then once you're done I have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger.
N: The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.
C: CABLE GUY
D: This lotion is superb at removing liver spots.
N: He slaps it onto Ray's face.
C: CABLE GUY
D: This one is an excellent moisturizer.
N: The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's about to put it on Ray's face.
C: CABLE GUY
D: And one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne.
N: The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Mm High Karate. And now a touch of powder.

C: CABLE GUY
D: You're on a big date, you'll need fresh breath.
N: He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.
N: The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Looking good, now let's dry you off.
N: He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable Guy puts his face right up next to the air.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Now suck it. Suck the air!
N: Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut experiencing heavy G-Force.
C: CABLE GUY
D: from this angle you look just like Neil Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the "right stuff."
N: The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.
C: CABLE GUY

C: ROBIN
D: Well, it's a little complicated.
C: CABLE GUY

N: His secretary, JOAN, answers the phone.
C: JOAN
D: Sorry Robin. He's in a meeting.
S: 58 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: A dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven listens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.
C: SALES MANAGER
D: The response to our initial offering has been remarkable. A local investment group has decided to buy the entire complex and turn them into rentals. In retrospect I must admit we made one big mistake.
N: Everyone hangs on his every word.
C: SALES MANAGER
D: We should have asked for more money.
N: The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.
C: MR. DANIELS
D: I just want to put this out there, Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your cajones, and mine, out on the table, and you slam dunked it. Way to go. Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs ahead of me. All right, in other business
E: nervously jokes
N: As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.
C: JOAN
D: Pssst. Steven.
E: quietly
N: Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.
C: JOAN
D: I really need to speak with you.
E: more urgently-quietly
N: Some people are beginning to notice this exchange.
C: STEVEN
D: It can wait.
E: curtly
N: Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking concerned.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Is there a Steven Bartowsky here?
C: STEVEN
D: Uh I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going on?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: You are under arrest.
C: MR. DANIELS
D: On what charge?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Receipt of stolen merchandise.
C: STEVEN
D: What? I never 
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Please put our hands on the table.
N: Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Please follow my instructions. Hands on the table.
N: Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of everyone. It is pure humiliation.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Hands behind your back.
N: The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around. POLICE OFFICER #2 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand?
C: STEVE
D: This is all a mistake. I didn't accept any stolen goods.
N: Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.
C: CABLE GUY
D: you're getting THX quality sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants  cream in his pants.
E: V.O. with echo
N: He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He tries to break the tension with a joke.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to jail.
N: Nobody laughs. He exits.
S: 59 EXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
N: Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside. We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.
S: 60 INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
N: Steven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his LAWYER.
C: EARL
D: I can't believe you did this.
C: STEVEN
D: I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave me all that stuff as a present.
C: EARL
D: A stereo system and a big screen TV as a present? You expect me to believe that? You know you're killing your mother with this.
C: STEVEN
D: I swear it's true.

D: Why would you accept such extravagant gifts?
N: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

C: STEVEN
D: That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this is not happening.
E: falling apart
C: EARL
D: Yes it is, and it's killing your mother. Did you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on Monday, Steven?
C: STEVEN
D: Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan. When can you get me out of here?
E: to the lawyer
C: LAWYER

N: Steven is now wearing prison blues. He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the long corridor to his cell. Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at Steven, and taunt him as he walks by. It is a nightmare. PRISONER #1 New meat! Look at the pretty boy! PRISONER #2 Nobody touches him, he's mine! You touch him, you're dead! PRISONER #3 Is baby scared? Don't cry baby! They all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell. A guard opens the door.

D: I taught you a lesson. I can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. I hope you'll choose the latter I mean, the former. You know what I mean.
C: STEVEN
D: I'll never be your friend. You need help.
N: The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Right now I think you're the one who needs help. I'm here to give you comfort.
N: The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Come on, touch it.
N: Steven just stares at him.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Come on. You need human contact. Touch it.
C: STEVEN

N: The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt.
C: STEVEN
D: What are you doing? Stop it.
N: Steven looks around frantically.
C: CABLE GUY

N: Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey, this is the guy who framed me!
N: The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun when it's Free Per View.

C: CABLE GUY

C: ROBIN
D: You know his lawyer said that nobody named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company.
E: tentatively
C: CABLE GUY
D: Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work under a pseudonym so the customers won't harass me at home. Kind of like a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate.
E: chuckles
C: ROBIN
D: And he's saying he received all the stereo equipment from you.
C: CABLE GUY
D: (I know, and I'm not mad. He's been cornered, so he's telling some wives tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.
C: ROBIN
D: I just feel like I triggered this with him. It's not that I don't want to get married, it's just I felt like he wanted to get married just to get married. I don't deal well with pressure.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Hey, welcome to the human race. We're not perfect. We all think we have to look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a break.

C: ROBIN
D: Sounds familiar.
C: STEVEN
D: You know he was the one who beat up your date at that restaurant. That's right. And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't me.
C: ROBIN
D: But you took the credit for it?
C: STEVEN
D: That's what he wanted. He was manipulating me. It feels so good to be honest about this. We're finally communicating. I've been wanting to tell you for so long, but he's been blackmailing me.

D: Of what?

C: ROBIN
D: He didn't have sex with a whore. You did.
C: STEVEN
D: Robin you don't --

Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse." BACK TO SCENE Steven walks over to Joan.

N: Steven walks to his office.
S: 81A INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He clicks a button and a message comes on the screen. ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE." Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before they watched "Sleepless in Seattle."
C: STEVEN
D: Work's good.
C: ROBIN
D: How's Hal?
C: STEVEN
D: Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless.
C: ROBIN
D: It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up.
C: STEVEN
D: I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done.
N: The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this. 81B OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down. STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office. BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can.

N: Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and sees Steven.
C: HAL

N: Steven knows what's coming. 82 OMITTED 82A OMITTED 82B OMITTED
S: 82C INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER
N: Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear.
C: STEVEN
D: Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are you?!!!
N: Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through the garage. Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar of the luggage rack. Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him. As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control of the car.
C: STEVEN
D: Leave me alone! I have no job, no girlfriend, no family anymore! It's over! You won!
N: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
C: CABLE GUY
D: Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin' started.
E: menacingly
N: He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, scampering like a supernatural bug. 83-94 OMITTED 95 OMITTED

N: Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone.

S: 97A INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Quick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows.
C: RICK

E: VO
S: 98 INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Steven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake. ON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking.
T: PROSECUTOR (ON TV)
N: Don't let your memories of these cute twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and said he was killed by an Asian gang. There was no laugh-track on that night. The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep. 99 ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP HE SLOWLY WAKES UP. The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar. ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We reveal that it is the Cable Guy.
C: CABLE GUY
D: This man killed his own brother. Some people don't even have a brother...
N: The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera.
C: CABLE GUY
D: ...do they Steven? Are you listening to me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --
N: ON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room.
S: 100 INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: The entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the living room and sees Rick.
C: RICK
D: Why do you keep icing me man?
S: 100A INT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the door.
S: 100B INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he sees Robin's bedroom.
S: 100C INT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Robin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door.
S: 100D INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: He hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You owe me!
N: Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole. 101 P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the door.
S: 102 INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him. Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks back another time and the Cable Guy is gone. He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I just want to hang out. No big deal.
N: Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room. 103 OMITTED
S: 104 INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Steven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do. He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Steven, you're just like me. We're cut from the same cloth. We're one and the same!
N: Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television.
S: 105 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Steven wakes up in a cold sweat.
C: STEVEN
D: Oh my god. She's right. I am a smotherer. I'm just like him.
E: panting
N: The phone rings.

C: STEVEN
D: I swear to God, if you touch --
E: VO
C: CABLE GUY
D: Could you hold on a second, I've got call waiting. It'll just be a sec.

E: losing it
C: STEVEN
D: Let's talk in person. Where are you?
N: (Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm close. So very close.
N: The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his face. He never acknowledges it.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You know, I don't think you're right for Robin. She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs. Someone who understands her soul.
C: STEVEN
D: You stay away from her.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Aren't we the control freak. Looks like you're starting to sweat.
C: STEVEN
D: I got the camera. You can't see me.
N: Steven begins to pick his face.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your face?
N: Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking for the camera. He smashes his TV. JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You're getting closer.
N: Steven overturns a CD rack.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know sometimes the answer is right under your nose.
N: Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out. He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears
T: the Cable Guy scuttle away.
N: Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace. There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it. Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.

D: Be home! Be home!
C: FEMALE NEIGHBOOR

C: RICK
D: Steven? Steven?
N: In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.
C: STEVEN
D: Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear what you found out about this nut.
C: RICK
D: I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply troubled. Only child. His mother was arrested for prostitution, and phone solicitation. Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer.
C: STEVEN
D: No way.
C: RICK
D: And get this, he was discharged from the Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two using a Radio Shack computer. And that's not the half of it.
N: As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).
C: CABLE GUY
D: Really? Tell me more.
N: Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm very interested in learning everything I can about that wacked out cable installer.
N: He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy. The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not see Rick yelp, and fall.
C: CABLE GUY
D: It sounds like he might hurt somebody.
S: 110A INT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT

S: 113 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Steven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his rear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious. Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and sees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an antenna. Inside the TV is the word "RING."
C: STEVE
D: Ring?
E: perplexed
N: The phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.

E: VO
N: (Revision Ends - Blue)
C: STEVEN
D: You're not going to get away with this.

S: 117 EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: The chase continues. Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.
S: 117A EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

S: 122 EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
N: Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs. The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.

C: CABLE GUY
D: Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!

N: (Revision Ends - Blue) This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.
C: STEVEN
D: Where's Robin?!
C: CABLE GUY
D: This isn't about Robin, this is about you and me.
N: Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy.
C: STEVEN
D: Where's Robin?!!!
N: Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.
C: STEVEN
D: Tell me!
C: CABLE GUY
D: I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?
E: nonchalantly
N: Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams into the ground.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Steven you've changed. I like it.
E: beat - then impressed
N: The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him. They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of his belt and turns it on.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I think it's time to make you cable ready.
N: He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large branch and bats the Cable Guy off him. The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Last time we fought I let you win! Best two out of three!
N: MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.
C: CABLE GUY

C: ROBIN
D: Steven.
E: in the distance
N: He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.
S: 123 EXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled with several feet of rain water. Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the center of where those wires meet. Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.
C: ROBIN
D: Help me Steven!
N: In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.
C: ROBIN
D: Steven! Look out!
C: CABLE GUY
D: Yeah Steven. Look out!
E: mimics her
N: The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the water.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I've missed you.
E: sweetly, like a girl
N: The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and speaks right into his face.
C: CABLE GUY
D: "Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it." Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't know what the fuss was about, the movie ruled, I saw it six times.
E: dramatically
N: He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in this position?
N: He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.
C: CABLE GUY
D: Who would have thunk it?
N: Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have knocked his jaw out of alignment.
C: CABLE GUY
D: You're gonna have to do better than that Steven. Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.
E: without any lisp realizing his lisp is gone
N: Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.

C: ROBIN
D: Steven!
N: Steven runs to her.
S: 124 EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER
N: He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance several times.
C: STEVEN
D: Hang on.
N: CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I know what your saying. Who does this guy think he is, Jason?
E: laughs maniacally
C: STEVEN
D: Stay away from her!
N: Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.
C: CABLE GUY
D: I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of the Rich and Famous." He still looks terrific.
N: Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging there. The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.
C: CABLE GUY
D: And the race is on.
N: He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed. Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and joins him. The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.
C: CABLE GUY
D: This is such an anti-climactic way to end this.
E: knows he's about to fall

D: I love you too. You're right. We shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of problems to work out which have absolutely nothing to do with you.
