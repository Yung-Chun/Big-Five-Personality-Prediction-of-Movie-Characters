T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
N: A fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER.
S: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
N: A SERBIAN MAN captains the wheel. SERB 2 scans the horizon with binoculars. He checks the GPS system, then his watch, then speaks into his throat mic. All italics are Serbian w/ subtitles: SERB 2 Fifteen minutes to delivery.
S: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
N: The JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio.
S: INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS
N: The HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in.
C: PILOT
D: All clear from above.
S: EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
N: The camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath the surface.
S: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
N: The droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam from the boat and skis bubbles. Calm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE- BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels. JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water. The LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above. From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES. A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away -- BOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat.
S: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
N: A SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control panel. SPARKS fly. The two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS.
S: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane slips inside the hull, through the new hole.
S: INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS
N: The chopper slows to a hover. The Pilot looks below.
C: PILOT
D: What's happening?
S: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
N: The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice.
S: INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS
N: The shaken Serbs climb to their feet. SERBIAN 2 What happened? They look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1 pushes on the throttle... nothing. SERBIAN 1 We've been hit. We're taking on water. Suddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the cabin door. They spring into action! SERBIAN 1 (CONT'D) Grab the professor, quick!
S: EXT. DECK - CONTINUOUS
N: Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals). SERBIAN 1 Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot! The Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2 rushes below deck.
S: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
N: PROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged, tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water.
S: INT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS
N: Serb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced back by a three foot wall of water.
S: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
N: Professor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose, over his head.... He's gone. Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances.
C: SHANE
D: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy? Where's the briefcase?
E: Plummer nods, terrified.
N: The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his own waist. As the water rises, to the roof.
C: PLUMMER
D: How did you know where I...
N: Shane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving him his oxygen.
S: EXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS
N: The Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN:
C: SEAL
D: KEEP SHOOTING!
N: The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.
C: SEAL
D: Give it a second, they're almost out of ammo.
E: CONT'D
N: The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more!" They do, until there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns.
C: SEAL
D: Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS
N: Just before the water envelopes him and Plummer...
C: SHANE
D: I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
E: into his mic
N: Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water.
S: EXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the belly of the helicopter above him.
C: SHANE
D: Hold on.
S: INT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER
N: Shane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor. Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN.
C: SHANE
D: You know how to swim?
N: The Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out. Shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls, pulling the Professor in behind him. ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS The SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper, then disappear gracefully back into the water.
S: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor takes out his mouth piece.
C: PLUMMER
D: Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible...
N: Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors' mouth, shutting him up.
C: SHANE
D: Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point.
C: PLUMMER
D: Why? Poison gas?
E: through the mouth piece
C: SHANE
D: No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
E: re: the oxygen
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN CLEARING - A LITTLE LATER
N: A Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly, waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream. Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane.
C: CHARLES
D: Lieutenant, thank you. You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay?
E: He pats his briefcase
C: SHANE
D: Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely.
C: CHARLES
D: I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead. Don't you have a family?
E: then
C: SHANE
D: Make it quick.
E: this gets him:
N: Charles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to his mouth and whispers into it:
C: CHARLES
D: Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
N: The briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled.
C: CHARLES
D: My kids. It's voice activated. Designed it myself. I do security, that's my specialty. Those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days -- couldn't crack it. And you should see what happens to you if open it without the code. I have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it?
E: CONT'D gestures back:
C: SHANE
D: Negative.
N: Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing
C: CHARLES
D: Battery's dead...
N: Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone. Charles dials, and talks...
C: CHARLES
D: Honey, I'm alive...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PAVE HAWK - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane climbs in the Hawk and approaches the cockpit. The PILOT sits, back to him.
C: SHANE
D: We're almost ready. Just gives us a -
N: The Pilot slumps forward... DEAD. Shane turns-
C: SHANE
D: Professor, RUN!!!
E: CONT'D
N: WHAM. Shane drops, knocked unconscious. All goes black.
S: EXT. PAVE HAWK - MOMENTS LATER
N: The helicopter is on fire. Wolf lies facedown in the stream. He looks around, barely conscious. SHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase. There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites. Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious. ADE TO BLACK: EST. HOSPITAL - DAY TITLE CARD: 1 Month Later
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. His arm and face bandaged. Shane's Captain enters: BILL FAWCETT (35) -- friendly, unassuming. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Shane salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway.
C: SHANE
D: Captain, sir.
C: BILL
D: As you were Lieutenant.
N: Bill sits down beside the bed. He takes a long look at Shane. He holds a REPORT in his hand.
C: BILL
D: We've been through a lot together Shane. You're the best man I ever trained. And a good friend.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: ... I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure.
C: BILL
D: Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?
C: SHANE
D: He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir.
N: Bill shakes his head, disappointed. He pulls up a chair, and sits opposite Shane.
C: BILL
D: ... Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S inside the briefcase.
C: SHANE
D: The case was empty sir, as I stated in my report.
N: Bill considers this. Then...
C: BILL
D: Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there, which is why I'm going to give you another shot.
E: Bill smiles:
N: Shane sits up. He can't believe his good fortune.
C: SHANE
D: Sir. Thank you. I... appreciate your confidence.
N: Invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an IV, and starts to rise.
C: SHANE
D: I'll need to put a team together. I'm gonna need the mini sub, I need access to an EP3 aries 2 spy plane...
E: CONT'D
C: BILL
D: Negative. It's not that kind of mission.
E: interrupting:
N: Shane listens, intrigued.
C: BILL
D: Two days ago, I got a call from the professor's wife... Widow. She told me someone had broken into her home. Searched the place, top to bottom.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: BILL
D: She's scared. The family's scared. Whoever killed the professor must think G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Either way, I need someone to stay at that house, and protect them. And while you're there -- find out if the program is in there.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: That's it? Why would you want me for that, sir.
C: BILL
D: The professor's wife requested you.
N: Shane is surprised... Bill pulls a tiny tape recorder from his pocket, presses play, we hear PROFESSOR PLUMMER'S voice.
C: CHARLES
D: Honey, I'm alive. Listen: A lot can happen between here and home -- if anything happens to me, call Lt. Shane Wolfe. He's a good man... anyway, I should go. I'll call you in an hour. I love you.
E: O.S.
N: Shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice.
C: BILL
D: ... You gotta problem with this mission?
C: SHANE
D: Sirnosir. It's just that... I've never been very good with kids, sir. Not even when I was a kid sir.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SHANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Shane packs his duffel bag. He opens a drawer: There's five t-shirts, identical to the one he wears. He opens another drawer: Five khaki pants, also identical to the one he wears. He opens the closet: There's a massive fur- collared coat. Hm. He rejects it. Shane packs his duffel with military gear: GPS compass, night vision goggles, camouflage vest, machete... they all go in. Shane heads to the door, then goes back to his chest of drawers. He reaches in, and pulls out a small, old MEDAL: the ribbon is faded and frayed. He looks at it for a moment, then unzips his suit and pins it to the inside, like it's a lucky rabbit's foot.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON
N: A taxi door opens. Shane looks like a bad ass, ready for anything. He steps from the taxi onto an adorable TROLL doll on the sidewalk. It SQUEAKS. Shane's P.O.V.: Julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys all over the lawn, and a "BLESS THIS MESS" welcome mat. Shane double-checks the address. The sprinklers go off. Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of those long cheerful doorbells). WE hear TINY FEET approach -- then the door swings open, Shane looks down -- and sees LULU, 8, peering up at him. Shane eyes Lulu. Lulu eyes Shane, then:
C: LULU
D: Mom! There's some weird bald guy at the door!
N: SLAM. Lulu shuts the door in Shane's face. Shane frowns. WE hear heavier footsteps approaching. EMALE VOICE (o.s.) (before she sees Shane:) Look, if you're with the Hare Krishnas, we're not interested... The door opens revealing JULIE PLUMMER. Julie holds NAKED baby PETER, 2. She sees Shane, and stops, a little startled by his size...
C: SHANE
D: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for duty.
E: salutes:
C: JULIE
D: Of course. I'm so sorry. Thank you for coming.
N: She hugs him. He's not quite sure what to do -- he's a rock, he doesn't flinch.
C: JULIE
D: Come in and meet the rest of the gang.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - DAY
N: It's warm and quiet. Petite Julie SCREAMS up the stairs-
C: JULIE
D: KIIIDDS!!!
N: Shane startles, covers his ears.
C: JULIE
D: Get your butts down here and say "hello!"
E: CONT'D
N: And then three pairs of feet come down the stairs. Lulu, ZOE, 15, and TODD, 14 line up like the perfect family portrait. Todd's hair hangs in his face. He wears a Sid Vicious shirt and a long trench coat.
C: JULIE
D: You've already met Lulu. This is Peter, Zoe and Todd. Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe. He's the man who is going to be staying with us for a while.
E: CONT'D
N: All the kids except for Todd-
C: KIDS
D: Hi.
N: Shane nods, stern. On the stairs, a Romanian MAID walks by, carrying a BABY.
C: JULIE
D: And this is Helga and Tyler.
N: Shane nods hello to them.
C: SHANE
D: Ma'am... Baby.
E: official:
C: JULIE
D: Kids, go finish your homework. And I'll be checking.
N: Zoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs. Julie leads Shane into...
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Julie sits, Shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look "at ease" at all).
C: SHANE
D: You have a pleasant family, ma'am.
C: JULIE
D: Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.
C: SHANE
D: Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could...
C: JULIE
D: Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here. Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.
E: beat
C: SHANE
D: Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much...
N: Suddenly from behind Shane's head a DUCK appears and NIBBLES his ear. Shane spins in full fight stance. He sees the Duck... and relaxes. Sort of.
C: JULIE
D: That's Gary. He was Charles'.
N: The duck QUACKS angrily. Confused, Shane returns to "at ease," keeping one eye on the duck.
C: SHANE
D: Mrs. Plummer-
C: JULIE
D: Call me Julie.
N: Beat.
C: SHANE
D: ... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the perimeter.
C: JULIE
D: I'm glad you're here-
N: But Shane is already gone.
T: CUT TO:
N: MONTAGE. MILITARY MUSIC PLAYS: Shane secures the area. He paces off the yard. He mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves. He attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows. Shane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and TAPS the phones. Shane, now wearing an EAR TRANSMITTER, crawls through the shrubs, hiding electric eyes. Nighttime -- the family eats dinner. We slowly pull out... through the kitchen window... and reveal Shane with night vision goggles on scoping the property. The phone RINGS inside. Through the window, Julie casually answers it. Shane touches his ear transmitter and LISTENS as he walks into the house. BILL (o.s.) Julie, it's Bill Fawcett. I have some potentially good news.
C: JULIE
D: What is it?
N: BILL (o.s.) A safety deposit box under Charles' name was just found in Switzerland. I think it could contain GHOST.
C: JULIE
D: That's wonderful. This could all be over!
N: BILL (o.s.) There's a catch. Swiss law says only his family can access it. I'm going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Shane, listening to the conversation, enters-
C: JULIE
D: I'll be there.
N: Julie and Shane share a look.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - MORNING
N: Julie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand in the doorway. Zoe listens to her I-Pod ignoring the hug Julie gives her.
C: JULIE
D: Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything. But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door...
E: Worried:
C: ZOE
D: Mom -- we'll be fine, chill.
C: JULIE
D: I know, it's just... I am a mom, it's my job to worry. ... I love you guys. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours. And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do... do it. Okay? ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble.
E: a little choked up:
C: JULIE
D: Lieutenant, I don't want you to worry about anything except the safety of my children. Helga will take care of everything else.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: Don't worry. They'll be safe with me.
C: HELGA
D: Everything will be fine, Mrs. Plummer.
N: Julie gets in the car and it drives away. Shane turns back to the kids who loom in the doorway.
C: HELGA
D: Tell me, are you licensed to kill?
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: ... No.
C: HELGA
D: Too bad.
E: she frowns
N: Helga trudges up the path and in.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Shane, on a short ladder, screws in a surveillance camera into the corner of a wall when he hears: MALE VOICE (o.s.) Prepare to be annihilated! Lulu SCREAMS. The sound of MACHINE GUN FIRING. Immediately, Shane leaps off the ladder and bounds down the stairs two at a time and into the...
S: INT. HOUSE/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
N: hane rushes in -- and finds Lulu screaming and giggling in front of a VIDEO GAME. Shane shakes his head.
C: SHANE
D: Could you turn that dow-
N: And Shane spies half of Todd's face peeking around a corner staring at him...
C: SHANE
D: Hey-
E: CONT'D
N: Todd disappears. WAAAAA!! WAAAAA!! Shane spins, looks around for the CRYING BABY... can't find him.
C: SHANE
D: ... Where's the baby?
E: CONT'D
N: Without looking Lulu points. A diapered Peter stands in the half full AQUARIUM, pouring in Cheerios. Helga enters holding the wailing Tyler. Gary suddenly FLIES by - - WHRRP! Shane ducks. Shane scowls at Helga:
C: SHANE
D: You run a very loose ship.
E: CONT'D
C: HELGA
D: You don't like it? You're the SEAL. You do something. I make bottle.
N: elga stomps out. Shane heads down the hall, when in the corner of his eye -- he sees A FIGURE SCURRY ACROSS THE BACK LAWN. Shane turns off the light. He shuts off the window alarm and sneaks out silently.
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
N: The yard is littered with toys. In the middle is a TRAMPOLINE. He spots the Figure climbing the TRELLIS. Shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline. He flies in the air and latches onto the figure. They both tumble to the ground. Shane yanks off the DARK FIGURE's hood, revealing SCOTT (16) a nervous teenager. He's dazed, but alright, wearing SHARPER IMAGE night vision goggles.
C: SCOTT
D: ... Zoe?
N: Zoe runs out the door, setting off the PIERCING ALARM.
C: ZOE
D: He's my boyfriend, tool.
C: SHANE
D: So you're the one who broke in. Zoe -- go back inside.
C: ZOE
D: Okay, fine... come on Scott.
N: Shane grabs Scott by the scruff of the neck.
C: SHANE
D: Not with this kid. You -- Gimme twenty!
E: to Todd:
N: Freaked, Scott fumbles for his wallet and gives Shane a twenty dollar BILL.
C: SHANE
D: I meant PUSH-UPS!
E: CONT'D
N: Befuddled, Scott starts to do lame push-ups. Shane grabs the back of Scott's shirt, LIFTING him in the air, spinning him away from the house like a marionette. Scott runs off, calling out from across the street.
C: COTT
D: ... I'll call you, Zoe!
N: Zoe storms inside. Shane stands there, fuming. The Alarm's still blaring. The window of the house next door opens: a Korean couple, THE CHUNS, pop their heads out. They're arguing with each other in Korean. Shane addresses them, IN PERFECT KOREAN with subtitles:
C: SHANE
D: My apologies. We had an intruder. A simple misunderstanding.
C: MR. CHUN
D: We speak English, Kojak.
E: perfect English, no accent
C: SHANE
D: Oh. Sorry.
C: MRS. CHUN
D: ... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff... we own a bakery, so we're up kind of early. Would you mind?
C: SHANE
D: Sorry.
N: Shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks it. The alarm stops.
C: MR. CHUN
D: Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter?
N: Mr. Chun tosses him the TROLL DOLL and slam their window shut. Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the Chun's car in their driveway.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT
N: hane marches Zoe up the stairs. Loud, angry rock music blares from Todd's room.
C: SHANE
D: Your mother thought you were in real danger. You should have told her the truth.
C: ZOE
D: Who do you think you are -- my dad?
N: Zoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries kicking him in the CROTCH. But Shane catches her foot -- and whirls her away. She has to hop on one foot, to not fall over. He "hops" her down the hall to her room.
C: ZOE
D: Let me go! It's Saturday night. I have plans!
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe's back to her door, Shane flips her foot in the air. Zoe falls backwards into the room. Shane shuts her door.
C: SHANE
D: Not anymore.
N: Shane marches back down the hall, bangs on Todd's door-
C: SHANE
D: Lights out.
E: CONT'D
N: TODD (o.s.) Bite me! Shane frowns, continues down the hall. He passes the NURSERY (Peter and Tyler's room), where Helga is singing a lullaby: (as annoying Has something Barney might sing).
C: ELGA
D: When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you feel like you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times like a kangaroo --
N: She does a little "dance" that goes with the lullaby: She hops forwards three times, then "crab-walks" sideways.
C: HELGA
D: Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. Three steps forward, one step back.
E: CONT'D
N: She does. The Children, in bed -- laugh and laugh.
C: HELGA
D: Then quick like a turtle lie on your back! riggle like a snake `til you can't no more.
E: CONT'D
N: he wriggles on the floor. Then jumps up, to their beds. Shane shakes his head, keeps walking-
C: SHANE
D: This family's in for a rude awakening.
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - DAWN
N: The sun rises over the neighborhood, warm orange light.
S: INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Everyone is asleep. In the bedrooms, a SERIES OF SHOTS: Tyler snores in his crib. Peter in his bed. ulu is surrounded by stuffed animals. odd is out cold, motionless. oe is wrapped in blankets. Until A TRUMPET BLARES "REVEILLE"! Zoe jumps, like she's been electrocuted.
C: OE
D: Huh? Wha--?!
S: INT. TODD'S ROOM - MORNING
N: Todd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's happening. The Whistle GETS LOUDER. Suddenly his door flies open -- and Shane strides in with a BOOM BOX. Todd blinks groggily.
C: TODD
D: W-what are you doing??!
C: SHANE
D: You're burning daylight. Move. Move.
C: ODD
D: It's Sunday...! And it's six a.m. You're insane.
E: he squints at a clock
N: Todd pulls the blanket over his head. Shane flips the mattress over spilling Todd to the floor.
C: SHANE
D: Now move it!
N: Todd scrambles to his feet and out the door.
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: All the little kids are CRYING. Covering their ears. Helga runs through in hair curlers, half-asleep and angry, carrying the crying baby.
C: HELGA
E: She curses in Romanian
C: SHANE
D: Hey. Not in front of the kids. he gives him a look of disbelief.
C: HELGA
D: What's it matter? Nobody speaks Romanian.
C: SHANE
D: Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata!
N: Helga narrows her eyes, shocked.
C: HELGA
E: She curses Again, in Romanian.
N: Shane's jaw drops.
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
N: The children are assembled, lined up tallest to shortest. At the end on the floor is Baby Tyler, sucking on a bottle. Shane firmly starts his Patton speech:
C: SHANE
D: Listen up, ladies. Your behavior is unacceptable. In order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain a state of discipline and order. I've only got one rule: Everything is done my way. No highway option. Do you copy?
C: LULU
D: Do you copy?
C: SHANE
D: What? I said -- do you...
C: LULU
D: What? I said -- do you...
E: "copying" him
C: SHANE
D: Do not copy me!
C: ULU
D: Make up your mind.
N: Shane starts to speak then thinks better, he's furious. Everyone stares blankly -- a tense silence. It's broken by the sound of a large AIR BUBBLE from the aquarium.
C: ULU
D: eter farted.
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone cracks up. Shane tries to maintain decorum. He reaches into his bag and unpacks a set of small high-tech SECURITY BRACELETS with a red light and a covered button. He straps one to each Kid's wrist.
C: SHANE
D: Tracking devices. Now that I know I can't trust you... Never take them off. The panic button is only for emergencies. Touch that -- you better be dying, or you're dead.
C: ZOE
D: I am not wearing that. Just because my mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to take orders from you.
N: He yells at her, Marine sergeant style:
C: SHANE
D: Let me explain how the chain of command works. I tell you what to do -- and you do it. End of chain. Now I'm not gonna have time to learn your names. So you are -- Red 1, Red 2, Red Leader, Red baby... wait, where's the older male? There were five.
E: pointing
C: HELGA
D: He walks like Dracula, with footsteps silent like death --
E: mysterious
N: Shane looks to Zoe for translation.
C: ZOE
D: He's in his room.
N: Angry, Shane bounds up the stairs.
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME
N: hane marches to Todd's shut door. He tries the knob, but it's locked. Shane bangs hard on it.
C: SHANE
D: Red 4! Open this door!
N: No answer. Shane turns away from the door and DONKEY KICKS it...SMASH! The wood CRACKS, then CRASHES inward. The entire frame collapses.
S: INT. TODD'S ROOM
N: hane charges in-
C: SHANE
D: It didn't have to go down like-
N: Todd isn't there. Down the hall -- a FLUSH. Oops.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back. He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall...
C: SHANE
D: All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this.
N: A piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head.
C: TODD
D: Can I get by?
N: Embarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters-
C: SHANE
D: Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened.
N: Shane SNAPS it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall, patrolling. Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. She stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane.
C: ZOE
D: He has to go.
N: Todd nods in agreement.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - LATER
N: hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer. His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the rumble of a car approaching. He rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and opens it, just as -- WHACK -- the MORNING PAPER connects with his face, hard. From off-screen we hear a PAPERBOY.
C: PAPERBOY
D: SORRY DUDE!
E: O.S.
N: Shane rubs his nose. Lulu screams at the top of her lungs. Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her, wearing a towel as a sheet. He pretends to be a ghost.
C: PETER
D: Whhhoooooo!
C: LULU
D: Stop it, Peter!
N: Lulu hides behind Shane. Peter Booos again. Lulu screams.
C: SHANE
D: Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything.
C: LULU
D: This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost.
N: And then it hits Shane. His eyes light up.
C: SHANE
D: Really? And where is this ghost?
C: ULU
D: I don't know. I've never seen it.
S: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
N: Shane walks slowly down the hall. As he walks he glides his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the ceiling. Searching.
S: INT. STAIRWAY - SAME TIME
N: Todd and Zoe kneel on the stairs. They surreptitiously pour COOKING OIL all over the wood. Then -- a creak. Zoe whispers.
C: ZOE
D: Here he comes...!
N: Zoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch. Shane strides to the top step and RAPS on the wall. He RAPS again, listening for hollow spaces. Nothing. Shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down... When he hears an alert from his laptop. He goes back to the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop. MR. Chun's photo appears next to a VEHICLE REGISTRATION. Shane scans it... Todd and Zoe's faces fall. The footsteps again-
C: TODD
D: He's coming back-
N: But Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes a step onto the stairs --
C: HELGA
D: AHHH!!!
N: BUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs, BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down. inally, BAM! Helga HITS the bottom with a mighty crash. She screams, as laundry flutters down from above. IGHT - ZOE AND TODD They gulp, terrified.
C: ZOE
D: Uh-oh.
S: EXT. SWISS BANK - DAY
N: Establishing.
S: INT. SWISS BANK - DAY
N: Bill and Julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk from a SWISS BANKER. He seems to be about 100 years old. He's reading a HUGE stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass, mouthing along in FRENCH. It's taking him a LONG time. They wait patiently -- til their patience runs out.
C: BILL
D: As we discussed, this is an urgent matter.
N: The Banker puts up a finger to "shush" him. Then looks back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the page. He licks his finger again, but can't get the page to turn. He feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a WATER COOLER. He fills a paper cup with water and shuffles back to his desk. He dips his finger in the water to turn the page.
C: JULIE
D: Can't you call somebody? Do something to get us around all this paperwork?
C: BILL
D: Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can't.
N: Bill can't stand it anymore. He jumps to his feet.
C: BILL
D: This is absurd. If we can't get some faster service, we're going to have to file a complaint.
E: CONT'D
N: The Banker looks at him blankly.
C: BANKER

D: Red Leader, remain calm --
C: HELGA
D: I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm!
C: SHANE

N: Suddenly, RING! Amid the chaos, Shane moves for the phone. Helga takes the opening and runs for the door. He grabs her suitcase. As she tries to wrestle it away, Shane picks up the receiver.
C: SHANE
D: Hello--- Don't even think about it.
E: CONT'D sees Helga crawling away
N: The suitcase handle breaks off, and Helga dashes for the door. Shane dives, grabbing her foot. He DRAGS her back.

E: CONT'D SCREAMING
N: As the cab pulls away, in the rear window, Helga glares back, then does an obscene Romanian hand gesture. ANGLE - SHANE His jaw drops in disbelief. He drops his head, defeated. Then -- he slowly glances up. ACROSS THE STREET The Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded.

D: Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back.
N: ANGLE - SHANE Rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside.
S: INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

C: LULU
D: When is she coming back?
E: worried
C: SHANE

C: SHANE
D: Hey. HEY!
E: CONT'D
N: Nobody will help. Even Peter runs, holding his nose. CLOSE-UP - SHANE He gulps.
S: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane enters, holding out the Baby at full arm's length. He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath, then pulls out PLIERS and a SCREWDRIVER. Using the tools as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper... And then -- it flops open. SShane GROANS, repelled.
C: SHANE
D: The things I do for my country.
N: Shane tries approaching -- he can't do it. Aghast, he looks around for a solution. Then: Shane picks up the Baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then FLUSHES, over and over and over.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Shane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and windows are locked. Lulu is in her pj's. A hand tugs on Shane's shirt, he looks down to see Lulu.
C: LULU
D: Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think you're cute.
C: SHANE
D: Thank you.
E: unsure how to respond...
N: Lulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts making Shane uncomfortable.
C: LULU
D: Do you know Kung Fu?
C: SHANE
D: Affirmative.
C: LULU
D: Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off?
N: hane walks away from Lulu. She follows. Shane is again twirling the MEDAL in his fingers. Lulu follows at his heels, like a puppy.
C: LULU
D: What's that medal for?
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: None of your business.
C: LULU
D: I'll trade you a SpongeBob button for it.
N: Shane walks room to room, pulling down the shades on every window.
C: LULU
D: Is that so people can't hurt us?
E: CONT'D
N: He bends down to her level, and tries to sound sweet:
C: SHANE
D: I think -- it's time for you take a nappy- poo, in beddibye land, little girl.
N: Lulu looks at him, like he's an idiot.
C: LULU
D: Do I look like I'm five to you?
N: Lulu sulks off to bed, and shuts off her light. All the lights are out, all the kids asleep. Shane breathes a sigh of relief, and patrols.
S: INT. KITCHEN - BREAKFAST - MORNING
N: The Kids are dressed for school. On the table in front of each place is a tan BAG. The kids sit down at their designated spots, confused by the MRE's (MEALS READY TO EAT) in front of them.
C: SHANE
D: What are you waiting for? Dig in.
N: Todd, Lulu and Zoe all tear open their bags. Todd pulls out a bag of CORN BEEF HASH and a Snickers bar. Zoe pulls out a bag of FETTUCCINE ALFREDO and some matches. Lulu takes out a bag of turkey slices and a coffee packet. Shane smiles, proud of his accomplishment. The Kids stare at "breakfast," dubious.
C: SHANE
D: Don't worry, I can get lots more of those. And I've survived off this stuff for months.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: Like I'm really gonna eat all those carbs.
N: Shane turns to address them:
C: SHANE
D: Okay, ladies. Your mama -- is not here to take care of you now. So -- here's how it's gonna be. We're gonna pull together, all for one, one for all. If I say in, you stay in, if I say out, you go out...
N: Peter stands in his chair, dancing...
C: PETER
D: Ba ba do the hokie pokey...
C: SHANE
D: I did not say at ease!
N: Peter's eyes fill with tears.
C: ZOE
D: He's only two, he doesn't have any idea what you're talking about. I don't have any idea what you're talking about...
N: Shane sighs. Lulu asks Shane:
C: LULU
D: Can you kill a man with your bare hands?
C: SHANE
D: You play too many video games. Yes.
E: then:
C: LULU
D: ... I can cross my eyes. Wanna see?
C: SHANE
D: Negative.
N: Lulu crosses her eyes at Shane, then at Tyler -- who SCREAMS at the top of his lungs. Shane turns to Lulu.
C: LULU
D: Tyler hates it when I do that...
N: Peter starts bawling, too. He runs away, crying. The table cloth is yanked to the floor. And the phone rings. Shane answers, trying to hear over the screaming.
C: SHANE
D: Plummer residence... yes, I know it's Monday. Oh. Thank you, sir.
N: He hangs up. Zoe smiles at him, innocently.
C: ZOE
D: Who was that?
C: SHANE
D: Your vice principal. He said if you're late again, you and Todd are expelled. He wants to see you in his office. With your ... legal guardian.
S: INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The garage door opens, dramatically unveiling Shane. He's wearing Tyler in a SNUGGLE. Across his chest, he's got a bandoleer of baby-bottles and juice boxes. Shane can't hide his contempt as he sees: Julie's WHITE MINIVAN. A bumper sticker declares "World's Greatest Mom." Shane puts Tyler in a CAR SEAT. Its interlocking buckle connects FOUR WAYS. Shane fumbles with it for a while. It just doesn't add up...
C: LULU
D: We're gonna be late.
C: SHANE
D: Not on my watch.
N: Shane TIES the buckles in a fancy knot.
S: EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: CLOSE UP ON: a stopwatch. It hits ZERO, and at that moment, the SCHOOL'S BELL RINGS. Holding the stopwatch is the VICE PRINCIPAL MURNEY (50's). He's HUGE and mean.
C: MURNEY
D: I always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally listened.
N: He glares at Shane, and the Kids: Shane sits with Tyler in a Snuggle, holding Peter on a harness, as he plays on the floor. The Kids are seated around him, mortified.
C: MURNEY
D: What's your name, son?
E: CONT'D To Shane
C: SHANE
D: Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge of watching these kids for... a few days.

E: CONT'D
C: OMAN'S VOICE
D: Your school?
N: Murney grimaces as PRINCIPAL CLAIRE NELSON (early 30's) enters. She's attractive, assured, tough. He withers.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney?
C: MURNEY
D: I was explaining, that as vice principal, I am in charge of....
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?
C: MURNEY
D: I'm got some leads. My informant's about to crack.
E: then, confidential:
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here.

C: SHANE
D: Red 1, Red 2. Get moving.
N: The teens hustle off to their classes. Shane checks his TRACKER -- two little red DOTS move away. Good. Principal Claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down, as he casually holds the three kids.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: So. You're the new baby-sitter?
C: SHANE
D: Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed -
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you.
N: She notices NAVY SEAL tattoo on his upper arm. Claire sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Lieutenant, huh? You with "The Teams?" Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service.
E: CONT'D Shane nods.
C: SHANE
D: ... You're kidding?
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Four years at Naval base Coronado. The Service paid for my college.
N: Shane stares not sure whether to believe. On the spot, Claire looks nervously around. She lifts her pants leg... revealing a tiny ANCHOR TATTOO on her ankle.
C: SHANE
D: "Honor, Courage...
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Commitment". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school.
C: SHANE
D: Can't be too careful. So. Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids?
N: She smiles.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children.
C: SHANE
D: No one will even notice I'm here.
T: JUMP CUT TO:
S: EXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - MID-MORNING
N: Shane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see- saw in the school's playground. Peter rides on the other side with a group of KIDS, to balance Shane. Shane types on his laptop: CLAIRE NELSON. A picture of Claire in a Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats...
C: SHANE
D: Clean as a whistle.
N: Shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars. BINOCULARS P.O.V. as Shane goes from window to window of the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from her seat in a class. Todd, sitting in the back row of a class, yanks his hood over his head. Lulu waves from 2nd Grade, delighted. Along line of FIRST GRADERS wait for the seesaw.
C: SHANE
D: Back off. Official Business.
E: CONT'D
N: ON THE PLAYGROUND: Shane stands with his Baby snuggle. Peter is running in circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball. He checks his tracking device...
S: INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME
N: BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Five hundred students eat at long tables. Zoe, with a group of HIP FRIENDS, turns her back to him embarrassed. Todd, in line to get lunch, does the same. Lulu sees Shane and waves. Shane puts down his binoculars. He turns to the person in front of him, with stern intensity.
C: SHANE
D: Give up now. Save us both a world of pain. Now -- last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in.
N: Reveal: Shane is talking to Tyler, in his safety seat -- trying to get him to eat. Beside Shane, Peter is destroying a sandwich with animal crackers.
C: SHANE
D: Open in T minus three, two, one...
E: CONT'D
N: Tyler gurgles, ignoring him. Shane sighs. Principal Claire sits next to Shane with her lunch tray.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr. Wolfe?
C: SHANE
D: Show no weakness.
C: RINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: I'll drink to that. Shane... Can I call you Shane?
E: she toasts, with milk.
C: SHANE
D: ... Sure.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: So. When you agreed to serve your country, I bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh?
N: Shane gives her a look. Principal Claire smiles.
C: SHANE
D: Hey -- I out rank you, you know.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Not here, you don't. You're on dry land, lieutenant. Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I guess.
E: she looks at his chair
N: Shane sees that Tyler is pouring his juice Box all over Shane's pants. He yanks Tyler away from him.
C: SHANE
D: Oh, man...
N: Tyler starts to cry -- but Shane stops him from crying by making a funny face. Tyler laughs. Claire smiles.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm impressed. A whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble. That's... unusual.
N: Suddenly there's a huge crash around the corner, and the sound of Students in an uproar. Shane hands Tyler off to the Principal and leaps over the table...
S: INT. LUNCH-LINE - CONTINUOUS
N: Students are in a ring, cheering, as four STUDENTS in Wrestling Jackets hold Todd. One reaches down and gives Todd a "wedgy" then another WRESTLER punches him. Todd slips out of their hold and decks the Wrestler. VP Murney is watching, but not stopping it. Zoe, in the crowd, cheers Todd on:
C: ZOE
D: Kick his butt, Todd!
N: Shane and Claire push through the Students. As soon as they see the Principal, the crowd freezes.
C: RINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Who started this?
N: Silence. Then vice principal Murney steps forward.
C: MURNEY
D: He did.
E: Todd
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Todd started a fight with five students at once?
N: Shane turns to Todd, and "punches fists" with him, impressed.
C: MURNEY
D: The kid's mixed up. Look at him.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it.
N: Murney smirks, and gives her a "I'll handle it" wink.
C: MURNEY
D: You heard the lady. Any more fighting and there'll be no more wrestling. Personally I think that's a little harsh. Boys'll be boys. `Scept for Plummer here.
E: low, to Todd:
N: Todd lunges at him. Shane effortlessly grabs Todd and Judo FLIPS HIM -- Todd lands on his feet, sticking the landing. No one is more Ssurprised than Todd and Shane.
C: SHANE
D: ... Nice moves, man.
N: The Bell rings, the crowd breaks up. Murney approaches Shane.
C: MURNEY
D: Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team.
N: Murney makes a loud Kung Fu CRY and throws a punch, stopping an inch from Shane's head. Shane doesn't flinch.
C: MURNEY
D: See -- total control. Maybe you could stop by practice, we'd show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you say? Come on, promise I'll go easy on you.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: ... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty.
C: MURNEY
D: Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then.
N: Shane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder. Todd shakes him off and heads to class. Murney snickers to Claire:
C: MURNEY
D: Looks like pretty boy there's all bark and no bite.
E: CONT'D
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: ... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - 2:55
N: Shane looks exhausted. Peter is asleep in his shoulder, Tyler is crying, as he keeps watch. The Principal strolls up.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him?
C: SHANE
D: I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: That's not what I mean, Lt.
N: Then Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is full. Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a grenade.
C: SHANE
D: Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh...
N: Panicked, he pushes Tyler towards the Principal.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Sirnosir. Not my job.
C: SHANE
D: But...
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun.

N: 2ND GRADERS are sitting on the floor. Lulu is in front of the class, with the Panic Button in her hand. The board reads: SHOW AND TELL. Shane lands in fight stance -- the Class applauds. Next to Lulu is a very upstaged LITTLE BOY with a FROG. Lulu sticks her tongue out at him.
C: LULU
D: See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt.
N: Shane is furious, but the FINAL BELL rings. At that moment, his Tracker Alarm sounds again. He looks: CLOSE-UP ON THE TRACKER SCREEN: Two DOTS labeled RED 1 and RED 2, are heading away from the school fast.

N: Two BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire section, and charges through.
C: CONSTRUCTION WORKER

C: SHANE
D: Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live!
C: CONSTRUCTION WORKER
D: Buddy, you're about to get a beat down.
N: Three Workers rush him. Shane easily takes them out. The remaining Workers give Shane a scared look -- then RUN. ANGLE - SHANE He's alone. He catches his breath, then checks his tracker.

S: INT. SEWER - SAME TIME
N: Shane lands shoulder deep in DISGUSTING SLUDGE. He winces, then checks the tracker -- the DOTS are CLOSE, feet away. Shane trudges through the river of muck.
C: SHANE
D: Red 1? Red 2?
N: It's horrific. The DOTS BEEP LOUDER. He's almost there! He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the blinking lights below the surface. He takes a deep breath and dives under. He comes up for air with ZOE and TODD'S HOMING BEACONS. A note is tied to them: "Ha! Ha!"
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Principal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room. From outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of OMINOUS, SQUISHY footsteps. Then the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them.
T: CUTE COP
N: 14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old female. Ditto. (into his radio:) Cancel that a.p.b.. The Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk.
T: CUTE COP (CONT'D)
N: In the future, use our nonemergency number. That's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'. The Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes...
C: CLAIRE
D: Shane are you okay?
C: SHANE
D: Just fine, thank you.
E: eerily calm:
N: Covering her nose. The smell is BAD.
C: CLAIRE
D: I should probably get going then. If you need anymore help... Call.
N: She practically GAGS as she passes him. Shane looks around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture.
S: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
N: Shane is in the shower. He pours an entire bottle of SHAMPOO over himself.
S: INT. BACK YARD - DAY
N: Shane BURNS his clothes in the barbecue.
S: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
N: Tyler is in a high-chair, Peter rocks in a cradle-swing. Shane enters, in just a towel. He sees on the fridge; Helga'S SHOPPING LIST -- all junk food. He looks at it, cringing in disgust, before he notices: Sitting around the table are Lulu's entire BROWNIE TROOP - - a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at him. The Brownies applaud, and whistle.
C: BROWNIE
D: oo hoo! Hubba hubba!
N: Shane covers up and leaps into the Family Room, pulling Lulu after him.
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: SHANE
D: Who are those people?
C: LULU
D: It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights.
C: SHANE
D: Get rid of them.
E: O.S.
C: LULU
D: I can't. Everybody's parents go out on troop nights. They won't be home `til ten. Mom's our den mother.
N: Lulu starts to sniffle, close to tears.
C: LULU
D: Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission.
C: LULU
D: We have to. If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree. Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I'm a loser. And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight...
E: whispers:
N: Lulu's about to burst into tears. Shane sighs.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane, back in "uniform," paces in front of the Brownie Troop. They are assembled, at attention, Indian Style.
C: SHANE
D: Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den -- commander. That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?
N: The Brownies stare art him in stunned silence.
C: BROWNIE
D: Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you.
C: SHANE
D: Good. Now -- wait here.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATE
N: The Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of cookies, getting ready to go. Zoe's on the phone.
C: ZOE
D: ... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something...
N: Shane blows passed her, revving a cordless POWER DRILL. VARIOUS SHOTS: As Shane uses the drill to seal every window and door. He's not just locking them -- he's SCREWING THEM SHUT WITH DRYWALL SCREWS.
S: INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane's finishing up the last window.
C: ZOE
D: This is totally cruel and unusual! You can't do this -- we could run out of air!
N: Shane lifts her window so it's open a HALF INCH, then drills it into place. Shane ushers the Troop out the door, then loads Peter and Tyler into TWO SNUGGLES -- one attached to his front, the other to his back. Shane closes the front door and attaches a "Club" lock to it.
S: EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan. As the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera CRANES up to... ZOE'S WINDOW: Inside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial.
C: ZOE
D: .. he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz -- HBO Oz. Hm... I dunno if that's a good idea, Scott...
E: she listens:
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
N: Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot -- the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall at the top of their lungs.
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card table to display their cookies.
C: SHANE
D: I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens...
C: LULU
D: I know.
E: flashing her bracelet
S: INT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane watches the Brownies on the store's CLOSED CIRCUIT monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. He looks around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs... NOTHING looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food. He sees: a huge, 100 pack VALUE CASE of SPAM. He smiles. Tyler looks at him -- "what are you, nuts?"
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: The Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're very shy. SHOPPERS blow passed them without even noticing them. One of the Brownies spots something...
C: BROWNIE
D: Oh no... they're back.
N: SLOW MOTION: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They're headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly.
C: UGLY CUB SCOUT
D: Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats `til you flush `em?
E: to another Scout
C: 2ND SCOUT
D: Brownies?
N: The Scouts cackle. The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies away from Lulu. He rips it open, dumping the cookies on the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot.
C: UGLY CUB SCOUT
D: This is Troop 16 territory. How are we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky cookies?
C: 2ND SCOUT
D: BEAT IT, before I get my face punching badge on you.
N: The Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. One of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't get away. Finally, the Cub Scout takes her SCARF. He laughs, and lets her go. The Cub Scouts high-five.
S: EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts.
C: SHANE
D: Where are my troops?
C: UGLY CUB SCOUT
D: ... I haven't seen anybody, you Skeever?
C: 2ND SCOUT
D: Nope. You wanna buy a raffle ticket? We're trying to win .22's.
N: Around his neck, Shane's monitor starts beeping. Shane takes off running in the direction of the signal.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - SECONDS LATER
N: Shane runs up to the minivan. The Brownies are huddled behind it, trembling.
C: SHANE
D: What happened? Well?
E: No one answers
C: LULU
D: Those boys over there broke our cookies.
N: Shane eyes the Cub Scouts. Dead serious:
C: SHANE
D: Well then -- I'm afraid I have to eliminate them. If I don't come back -- avenge my death.
N: He heads toward the Scouts. The Brownies scream.
C: BROWNIES
D: No!
N: Shane stops. He bends down, and points at Lulu's Panic button. He firmly tells Lulu, who's close to tears:
C: SHANE
D: This is not a toy. I'm here to protect you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're going home.
C: BROWNIE
D: You can't take us home yet, you're supposed to take us to dinner.
C: SHANE
D: Where?
S: INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY
N: An extreme CU of the Chuck E. Cheese MANAGER. He wears braces and head-gear, which causes him to lisp.
C: MANAGER
D: Welcome to Chuck E. Cheese!
N: Wider reveals...CHAOS. SCREAMING CHILDREN everywhere. On stage, the Chuck E. Cheese automaton band JAMS.
C: SHANE
D: I wish I were in Chechnya.
N: A LITTLE LATER: Brownies are running around, playing video games and skee ball. Shane's watching Peter, in the PLASTIC BALL POOL, while he holds Tyler in the Snuggle. The Manager approaches Shane.
C: MANAGER
D: Anything elsh I can do for you?
C: SHANE
D: In a big glass This much ice... this much cyanide.
E: he shows him
N: The Manager laughs, but the headgear seems to hurt his face when he smiles.
C: MANAGER
D: How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of Mischer Pibb?
C: SHANE
D: What?
C: MANAGER
D: Pischer of Mischer Pibb? Mischer Pibb?
E: gesturing:
N: Frustrated, the Manager picks up a pitcher and exits. Lulu approaches, she grabs Shane by the sleeve and drags him over to the stand up Mortal Kombat game.
C: LULU
D: Let's fight!
C: SHANE
D: I'm watching your brother...
C: LULU
D: I pressed two player. I thought you liked combat. Unless you're scared.
N: Shane doesn't like the sound of that. He steps up to the machine. He cracks his knuckles, stretches. Then he takes a joy stick. He checks over his shoulder -- Peter's happily splashing about in the plastic balls. ON THE SCREEN: they each select a fighter. Lulu picks a small female character. Shane picks a man who looks LIKE SHANE. They begin, Lulu screams out with her fighter, in unison:
C: VIDEO GAME/LULU
D: Prepare to be annihilated!
N: She leaps over Shane in a somersault and throws a DOZEN throwing stars. Then kicks him in the head repeatedly.
C: SHANE
D: That's not fair. Nobody can jump thirty feet.
C: LULU
D: The Hulk can.
C: SHANE
D: That wasn't a documentary.
N: The second round starts, Brownies have gathered around to watch. Lulu's fighter does a series of kicks. Shane can't even get one punch in -- she pins him to the ground, kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face. Shane is taking it really seriously. He's really mad.
C: SHANE
D: This isn't fair. My joystick's broken.
E: CONT'D
C: LULU
D: You wanna switch?
N: They switch sides. Round three starts. Lulu's fighter picks up Shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her in half over his knee... and then a kick in the face.
C: SHANE
D: You don't have a baby on your chest...
E: re: the Snuggle
N: Lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing... Shane's really fuming.
C: LULU
D: You're not even trying...
C: SHANE
D: I AM TOO TRYING.
C: LULU
D: Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss...
N: She keeps dancing. It's really annoying. Shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her. He is KO'd. She does a very obnoxious VICTORY DANCE.
C: LULU
D: In your face! I am the greatest hand-to- hand combat champion in the entire world!
E: CONT'D
N: Shane screams and RIPS THE JOYSTICK OFF THE MACHINE. Sparks fly. Shane looks around to see if the staff noticed. He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe's on the phone, the Zhouse is quiet.
C: ZOE
D: Mom -- stop worrying.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: JULIE
D: I'm a mom, it's my job to worry.
E: ON THE PHONE
C: ZOE
D: Seriously, everything's cool. The guy's just a control freak.
C: JULIE
D: It's only a few more days. I hate leaving you, but you know I have to do this. I love you.
C: ZOE
D: I know. Don't worry, we're okay. Tonight I'm just doing homework -- in my cell.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: As Zoe hangs up, we WIDEN OUT: The house is PACKED with TEENAGERS: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up. Zoe looks around at the mess. She turns to Scott, who doesn't seem concerned at all.
C: ZOE
D: Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people?
C: SCOTT
D: Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my BLOG.
N: Zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a WEIRD SWEATY KID, who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying SQUISH.
C: ZOE
D: Dude, not cool...
N: VARIOUS SHOTS - The Plummer House: - Its a huge party: the place is JAMMED, kids everywhere. - Teenagers come and go through the kitchen's DOGGY DOOR.
S: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines:
C: SHANE
D: Move, move, move! Go go!
S: EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles... again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it.
S: INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - LATER - DUSK
N: Shane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow. We see what he forgot: PETER, still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls. The Manager is watching him.
C: MANAGER
D: I figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do.
C: SHANE
D: Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that...
C: MANAGER
D: Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning --
N: Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which is fine, except that he's MISSING HIS DIAPER.
C: MANAGER
D: WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the ball pool -- not okay.
E: CONT'D
N: Shane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. He disappears under the balls -- for a long time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look. He's still down there. Silence.
C: LULU
D: Should we send someone in after him?
N: He surfaces, gasping. He's holding the diaper, out away from him. He charges across the room with the diaper.
C: SHANE
D: Clear out! GO GO GO!
N: And he bursts out the other doors, at a full run.
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the Minivan. He gets out -- and groans in disbelief. It's insanity: HIP HOP blasts, gyrating TEENAGERS everywhere, chugging drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing footballs. Reeling, Shane takes Lulu, Peter and Tyler up the path. He protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a football suddenly WHIZZES by. Outraged, Shane snatches it mid-air -- then CRUSHES the ball. POP! hane gives a blood-curdling stare.
C: SHANE
D: Party's over.
N: The jocks flinch, scared, then RUN. Shane unlocks the CLUB lock off the door.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Inside is worse, a total wreck. Zoe's dancing with Scott. Shane drags the needle across a record at the D.J.'s turntables. Everyone recoils from the horrible sound.
C: SHANE
D: No one leaves until this house is spotless! I want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able to eat in the kitchen!!
N: Nervous glances -- then everybody suddenly RUNS for the back! Shane is confused, trying to understand... then he intuitively dashes past them! He's scoping the surroundings... windows... vents... AH! The doggy door! Scott is halfway through the doggy door when Shane grabs his ankles and yanks him back in. Shane holds Scott upsidedown by his ankles.
C: SHANE
D: Oh no you don't. Now, we're gonna do this my way -- no highway option.
E: CONT'D
N: Just then: A MUSTARD SOAKED BALONEY SLICE drops from the ceiling, sticking to the TOP of Shane's head. PLOP. Shane's eyes narrow, he takes it off, trying to maintain his dignity. He fumes...
C: SHANE
D: Start swabbing, ladies.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands Scott the mop. Scott gulps - and starts mopping.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLEANING THE HOUSE. Miserable TEENS scrub. In a bathroom, Scott and Zoe, in Playtex gloves, furiously clean. Scott scrubs the toilet with Pinesol as the Duck swims in the top of the toilet.
C: SCOTT
D: This is officially the worst party ever.
C: ZOE
D: It was YOUR idea! I don't even know most of these losers.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT
N: Shane inspects the house, as kids clean. Shane wipes a finger down the sofa. Clean. He lifts the sofa, and rubs his finger UNDER IT. He holds it up to a KID... residue. The Kid quickly starts cleaning again. A GIRL reorganizes a stack of CD'S. Shane goes over them, straightening -- then he notices something. He pulls out a CD: It is a home-burned disk, labeled with a Sharpie. It reads: GHOST. Oh my god...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
N: Two DARK CLAD FIGURES watch, through binoculars. They see Shane find the CD, and walk out of sight.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/STUDY - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane quickly tucks the CD into his pocket.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - ALMOST DAWN
N: A long line of exhausted party-goers files out. Scott's the last one to leave.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - VARIOUS
N: Shane works his way through the house. It's SPOTLESS: counter tops glisten, furniture polished. It looks like Better Homes and Gardens. He heads upstairs. Zoe blows past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up. Shane sits down, outside the bathroom door.
C: ZOE
D: ... Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never come here again.
C: SHANE
D: Those people aren't your friends. They show no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for yourself.
C: ZOE
D: I do too respect myself.
N: ueasy, she pukes again. Shane hands her a handkerchief.
C: SHANE
D: You got barf on your tank top. Company, downstairs!
E: Announces:
N: He walks down the hall, Zpounding on doors.
C: ZOE
D: You're not my dad!
N: Shane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face.
C: ZOE
D: We hate you, you hate us. You're like a robot. Why don't you just leave us alone?
E: CONT'D
N: Silence. Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up. Shane stands, helpless. After a beat...
C: SHANE
D: You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job.
C: LULU
D: Shane --!
C: SHANE
D: In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone.
N: Suddenly -- the power goes out.
C: SHANE
D: Now what?
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: It's Scott...
E: sighs, tired
C: SHANE
D: Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms.
N: Suddenly, TWO NINJAS, all in black BURST in through the window. Shane spins in fight-stance.
C: SHANE
D: Go!
E: CONT'D to the kids:
N: Terrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall. The Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast. Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas knock Shane backwards down the stairs...
C: NINJA
D: GHOST -- hand it over!
N: They leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs, knocking him into...
S: INT. PLAYROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: There are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R- US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT, and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back...
C: SHANE
D: Okay -- who wants some?
N: Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow. Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo.
C: FARMER JOHN GAME
D: The rooster goes...
N: WHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit the floor. They echo the fight:
C: FURBIES
D: Ow! Ow!
N: Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos and Jacks dig into their feet.
C: NINJA/FURBIES
D: Ow! Ow ow! Crap!
N: The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos, Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him. Shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, KICKING a Ninja in the chest. The Ninja CRASHES through the window! he other Ninja looks up, fearful. Suddenly he grabs a bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face... POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE. ANGLE - SHANE He squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window. OUTSIDE: The Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill, disappointed to have lost them.
S: INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER
N: Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door. He quietly knocks.
C: SHANE
D: Kids. It's safe. You can open up.
N: A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do... Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them.
C: LULU
D: Please don't leave us Shane.
C: SHANE
D: I'm not going anywhere.
N: He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane.
C: ZOE
D: I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
C: SHANE
D: Shhh... It's okay.
C: TODD
D: Who were they? What did they want...?
C: SHANE
D: They're looking for a program, that your father invented.
C: ZOE
D: So Mom's not paranoid? There really are people out to get us.
N: He takes out the CD labeled GHOST.
C: SHANE
D: They're not after you. They want this. But nothing's gonna happen to you, as long as I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere.
N: The kids shudder, relieved. They hug him tighter. He looks Zoe, eye to eye. He dries her tears:
C: SHANE
D: But I can't do this without your help, okay? We need a little more cooperation here. Tell you what -- let's start over. From now on, you listen to me, and do what I say. And I... I'll listen to you too. Deal? Truce -- okay?
E: CONT'D the Kids nod to Zoe and Todd:
N: Zoe and Todd nod. Shane offers his hand to shake. They shake -- then they hug him, too.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane and the Kids sit around Shane's computer. Shane slips the Ghost CD in the disc drive, pushes play --
C: SHANE
D: C'mon c'mon c'mon...
N: CLOSE-UP - COMPUTER MONITOR The SOUND comes on: it's MUSIC. "Unchained Melody." And then, PICTURE: Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze at a pottery wheel. Shane is furious -- a long pause. Then... Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night. Then, the other kids join in. Soon, even Shane is laughing too: the telephone RINGS -- they all jump, startled. Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play it cool and not frighten her mother:
C: ZOE
D: Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing happened you should worry about. Nope.
N: Shane takes the phone.
C: SHANE
D: Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into the house tonight.
T: WE INTERCUT:
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: JULIE
D: Oh my god!
C: SHANE
D: No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn't find it. You have any luck?
C: JULIE
D: Well, yes and no. We found something in the box... But we're not sure what it is. Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It looks like some kind of "key". We just don't know what its for.
N: She holds up the strange, metal two pronged KEY.
C: JULIE
D: The good news is I'll be home in two days, as soon as the customs paperwork clears.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: ...So soon? We were just starting to have fun. Don't worry -- we'll be just fine.
E: very genuine
S: EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING
N: Early morning, students run in to school. The minivan pulls up, and Shane emerges with the five kids.
C: SHANE
D: I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm gonna be sticking even closer.
S: INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: The TEACHER shows the children how to dye Easter eggs. ANGLE on Lulu, making a mess of an egg. She smiles. ANGLE on Shane, squashed at a little desk. He dips an egg in some purple dye.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to her. He is gesticulating, SCREAMING, reacting each time she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES. Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head. Peter and Tyler are tight in their Snuggles.
S: INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - LATER
N: The TEACHER hangs a series of cute "Turkey Hand" drawings above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make the feathers). She hangs one of a HUGE HAND, and smiles at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. Shane nods, "yeah, I know it's good." Then...
C: VOICE
D: Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice Principal Murney in the gym.
E: OVER THE PA:
N: Lulu's classmates all chant, in unison:
C: SECOND GRADERS
D: Ooooooooh!
E: You're in trouble!
S: INT. THE GYM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands, Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.
C: SHANE
D: Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...
C: MURNEY
D: That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that -- it's the boy...
C: SHANE
D: Red two? I mean Todd?
N: Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do...
C: SHANE
D: Has he been skipping class?
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this...
N: Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops, in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a "skinhead" look.
C: MURNEY
D: This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker... and I found this:
N: Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it. It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane scowls.
C: MURNEY
D: If he'd had Hustler or something, boys will be boys -- but this is just sick.
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: He's not a NAZI.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: It's certainly not normal. See if you can talk to the boy. Find out what's going on.
E: pulls Shane aside.
N: Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought. Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out. The WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks the kids out, and Murney chases after him.
C: MURNEY
D: hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me.
C: SHANE
D: I'll talk to him.
C: MURNEY
D: You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh? Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat.
E: Shane ignores him, and keeps walking.
N: He "fake-punches" one of his Boys -- who flinches like Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs.
C: SHANE
D: Another time, maybe...
C: MURNEY
D: It's a date then. I'll show you a couple moves. I promise I won't hurt you.
N: Shane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK, Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team:
C: MURNEY
D: See that? You never know when your adversary is going to strike!
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket?
N: Shane dusts off his back, and leaves.
C: MURNEY
D: Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!
N: Shane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes his head, and snickers to his Team.
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
N: The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane holds Todd back by the arm.
C: SHANE
D: Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...
N: odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house.
S: INT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm -- there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the contact, so the alarm didn't go off.
C: SHANE
D: Smart kid.
N: Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window.
C: SHANE
D: Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth!
E: CONT'D
N: He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on the sill.
C: SHANE
D: You want in or out?
E: CONT'D
N: The Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS. Shane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he hops on and pedals furiously after the bus.
S: EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough.
S: EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER
N: The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the bus. Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat. He stashes the bike behind a mailbox... Shane'S P.O.V.: At the entrance to the old warehouse, Todd meets up with three other TEENAGE BOYS, they're dressed in brown HITLER YOUTH UNIFORMS, they head inside. Shane follows them, stealthily.
S: INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane follows the Hitler Youth into a large room, set up with folding chairs. He hides in a dark corner. Todd and the Hitler Youth enter, and take seats. A CREEPY MAN in a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. Shane watches as the MAN addresses the Hitler Youth.
C: MAN
D: Alright. All my Nazis are finally here. Okay, I want all of you at attention.
N: The Nazis stand at attention. Shane is horrified...
C: MAN
D: And on stage left - VON TRAPPS! I need my Von Trapps!
E: CONT'D he yells
N: hane watches... as a group of blonde ACTORS, all dressed in lederhosen as the SINGING VON TRAPP family enter, and join the "Nazis." There's also a few NUNS, a CAPTAIN VON TRAPP, and a MARIA. The Creepy Man is, in fact, a good natured, slightly foppish DIRECTOR.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Okeydokey. Starting from where we left off Gimme Rolf and Liesl -- let's give You are Sixteen a run up der flagpole...
N: Todd heads up to the stage, the Director arranges him and the ACTRESS PLAYING LIESL (40ish) into position. An ACCOMPANIST begins on piano, Todd sings, remarkably well:
C: TODD
D: You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on...
C: ACTRESS/LIESL
D: To write on...
C: TODD
D: You are sixteen, going on seventeen...
N: Shane bursts into laughter. His whole face lights up for the first time ever... Todd and Liesl dance. Todd is good, but nervous. He attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the stage, clutching his ankle. He gets up, and limps to the seats. The Director walks onto the stage, upset. He looks up, to heaven:
C: DIRECTOR
D: Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable evil that I deserve to be saddled with the world's worst production of Sound of Music? We open in a week. The set's not finished... The cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again.
E: he shouts, at the cast:
C: TODD
D: I'm sorry... I'll get it right.
C: DIRECTOR
D: None of you will ever get it right! Which is why, I quit.
N: He throws down his script. The Cast is stunned.
C: DIRECTOR
D: And with that, he exits stage right... end scene.
E: CONT'D
N: And, on his own cue... he exits stage right, in a huff. The entire cast looks to Todd, fuming. Shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling everybody. Everyone steps back. Todd is terrified. Shane kneels down beside Todd. He closes his eyes, and begins rubbing his hands together like Mr. Miyagi.
C: LIESL
D: You gonna fix him?
C: SHANE
D: No. My hands are freezing.
N: Shane grabs Todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously CRACKS it, and yanks him to his feet.
C: TODD
D: I'm not going to quit. I hate wresting...
C: SHANE
D: AT EASE. Would you listen, just once? Look, I don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but... You're good. A lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline -- you could make a go of this.
E: Todd shuts up
C: TODD
D: ... but what about Murney?
C: SHANE
D: That guy's an idiot.
N: Todd smiles, relieved. They sit on the edge of the stage.
C: SHANE
D: "Sound of Music" is a great show. My dad took me to see it when I was a kid.
E: CONT'D
N: Shane smiles wistfully. Todd relaxes.
C: TODD
D: You don't seem like the musical type.
C: SHANE
D: Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.
C: TODD
D: What if... girls'll think I'm... weird or something?
C: SHANE
D: You know what girls think is weird? Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I've never understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.
C: TODD
D: Doesn't matter now anyway... show's off... it's over.
N: Shane looks at the Cast, they look pretty glum as they pack up their costumes. Todd looks devastated -- only a moment after Shane saw him happier than ever. Shane straightens up, grabbing Todd by the shirt collar. BEAT.
C: SHANE
D: COMPANY -- CENTER STAGE!
N: Everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do... off Shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage.
C: SHANE
D: DO YOU, OR DO YOU NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PERFORM THIS MUSICAL?
E: CONT'D
N: There's some mumbling. Liesl chimes in.
C: LIESL
D: We don't have a director...
N: Shane shakes his head.
C: SHANE
D: No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks! Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?
E: full of bravado
N: Everyone nods... Todd looks up at Shane. He smiles.
C: TODD
D: Yes.
C: SHANE
D: YES WHAT?
C: TODD/CAST
D: YESSIR.
S: INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER
N: Shane's patrolling the hallway. He hears Zoe in her room, BREAKING something, angrily. He peeks in -- just as Zoe THROWS her cell-phone into the wall, furious.
C: SHANE
D: ... What's up?
C: ZOE
D: Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me.
E: embarrassed
C: SHANE
D: I don't see what you see in this guy.
C: ZOE
D: It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know?
C: SHANE
D: It won't happen again.
E: He nods
C: ZOE
D: ... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him.
C: SHANE
D: Okay. I promise. I won't touch him.
N: Shane exits. He turns out the light.
S: INT. LULU'S ROOM - LATER
N: Shane tucks Lulu into bed.
C: ULU
D: Tell me a story.
N: Shane looks at her surprised. He sits on the bed... Stumped. Then he starts:
C: SHANE
D: Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves.
E: MORE
C: SHANE
D: One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out.
E: CONT'D
C: ULU
D: Why?
C: SHANE
D: They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north...
N: As Shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up the scene with DOLLS, on Lulu's floor.
C: SHANE
D: The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive... I mean standing... D ISSOLVE TO:
E: CONT'D
N: AN HOUR LATER: Shane's really into the story. Lulu's fallen asleep. Shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes:
C: SHANE
D: ... And not one Elf got left behind that day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez.
E: CONT'D
N: Then, from across the hall, Peter WAILS. Todd pops his head in the door.
C: ODD
D: You have to do the Panda Dance... or he won't stop.
C: SHANE
D: Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing.
C: TODD
D: I'll write it down for you...
N: The wails get louder and LOUDER...
S: INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
N: Tyler's asleep. Shane sighs, and whispers to Peter, reading from Todd's notes:
C: SHANE
D: When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance...
N: Peter starts bawling. Shane doesn't know what's wrong. Todd calls from the doorway...
C: TODD
D: You have to do the dance. Like dad used to do. He made it up for him.
N: Shane sighs. He sings again, mortified. He does the dance as he sings... Shane hops forward three times.
C: SHANE
D: Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
N: Peter applauds. Humiliated, Shane crab-walks sideways.
C: SHANE
D: Take three steps forward and one step back...
E: CONT'D He does.
S: EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY
N: As Mr. Chun gets his paper, Shane, (Tyler in the snuggle), hands out bag lunches as the Kids load into the minivan. Shane turns and catches Mr. Chun, staring.
C: SHANE
D: What are you looking at?
S: INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Todd sits in the back of the Minivan, listening to Sound of Music on his Walkman, Lulu is next to him, with her Gameboy, Zoe and Peter are half asleep. Shane climbs into the PASSENGER SEAT. Zoe realizes he's staring at her, through the mirror.
C: SHANE
D: Today you drive.
N: The Kids sit bolt upright. They turn to Zoe, terrified. She gets out in shock, and gets in the driver's seat. The other Kid's seat belts CLICK loudly.
C: ZOE
D: But -- I can't even pass driver's Ed.
C: SHANE
D: Exactly.
C: ZOE
D: Have you given a driving lesson before?
C: SHANE
D: ot in a car, no... but it's a lot like a Bradley Assault Vehicle.
C: TODD
D: Especially when Zoe's driving.
N: The Kids share a dubious look. Zoe backs jerkily out.
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe is super-tense as they drive. Shane is nervous, but trying not to show it. Lulu and Todd are terrified.
C: SHANE
D: Do you know what causes most accidents? ttention span. The most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on...

C: SHANE
D: THE ROAD! Don't look at me...
E: CONT'D

C: ZOE
D: You wanna drive?
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: No. Keep going. I trust you.
N: Zoe is surprised. Touched. She pulls out, jerkily.
S: EXT. BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - LATER
N: Zoe pulls to the curb, almost tapping a bus's rear fender. Shane unclenches his teeth.
C: SHANE
D: Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours.
N: Zoe smiles. And the other Kids all bolt from the car, terrified. Lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground.
C: ZOE
D: Ha ha ha. Very funny. hey head into the school. Shane spots something.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE reveals: SCOTT (Zoe's boyfriend), with a few FRIENDS, laughing, being obnoxious. Shane jumps out of the car. Before Scott knows what's happened, Shane's LIFTED him in the air by his backpack. Scott's terrified.
C: SHANE
D: I know 437 ways to hurt a man without touching him. Broken promises lead to broken legs. Do we understand each other?
N: Scott nods, trembling. Shane lets him down and heads into school.
S: INT. BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - LUNCHTIME
N: Shane (Peter in lap, Tyler in snuggle) keeps an eye on the Kids at their tables. KIDS boisterously run past. Suddenly -- Claire BARKS out.

C: SHANE
D: You look nice today.
E: CONT'D
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into.
N: She smiles. He smiles back... Suddenly, there's a commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging him by the ear. Principal Claire sighs "not again." In one move, Shane leaps over the table. Principal Claire watches him leap:
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: ... Love it when he does that.
E: CONT'D
N: Murney shoves Todd forward.
C: MURNEY
D: I've had it. I just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake.

N: A hushed "oooh" goes through the Students.
C: MURNEY
D: Winners never quit, boy. What're you so scared of, Freak?
N: The Students snicker. Todd looks, intimidated. Then:
C: TODD
D: I am not scared. I... I want to sing.
N: Silence. No one's sure they heard him right. Todd pulls out a stack of SOUND OF MUSIC FLYERS and hands them out. Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume. Principal Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense.
C: TODD
D: I'm in Sound of Music. It opens Friday...
E: CONT'D
C: MURNEY
D: A musical? You're blowing off wrestling for a musical? This is what happens when there's no man in the house.
E: to Shane:
C: TODD
D: There is a man in my house -- me. Let's get one thing clear. I'm not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm quitting because you're a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm the only one with the guts to do it. urney looks over at the Team. They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks around, humiliated, furious --
E: Murney turns:
C: URNEY
D: So -- you're a tough guy now?
N: Murney takes ONE STEP towards Todd -- Shane steps between them, protecting him.
C: MURNEY
D: Stay out of this, baby sitter!
E: CONT'D
N: Murney glares at him -- face to face. So calm, it's scary
C: SHANE
D: You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it.
N: Everyone is watching. Murney did not expect to be called out. His voice cracks -- then he regains his calm:
C: MURNEY
D: After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine.
N: He storms out. There is a stunned moment -- and then a mob of Students, and a lot of CUTE GIRLS, swarm Todd, taking flyers. Shane gives Todd a proud thumbs up. A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: Of STUDENTS whispering to other STUDENTS, passing notes: A Kid opens a note -- it reads: "Murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00."
S: INT. GYM - 3:00
N: The bleachers are PACKED. Murney struts out onto the mat. The two fighters begin circling one another. The Wrestlers scream for Murney. Todd cheers Shane on.
C: URNEY
D: on, you're about to enter Murney's house of pain.
C: SHANE
D: I'll be sure to lock up when I'm through.
N: Murney roars and CHARGES Shane. Shane defensively uses Murney's momentum to flip him halfway across the mat. WHAM. Murney lands on his back. The Wrestlers mouths drop. Murney, shocked, climbs to his feet and CHARGES again, Shane side-steps, and sweeps Murney -- sending him right into the wall, hard. Murney bounds to his feet, rushes Shane. Shane DIVES OVER Murney, grabs onto Murney's waist. Shane's momentum pulls Murney backwards -- BAM. Murney's shoulders hit the mat with Shane smiling down on him. Todd flops to the mat, raises his hand and SLAPS it down-
C: TODD
D: Pinned!
N: Shane stands. Shane throws an arm around Todd, and they head out. The Wrestling Team huddles around Murney, who's quietly twitching on the ground, mumbling something.
C: TODD
D: Is he okay?

C: SHANE
D: Dislocated nerve, that's all. He'll be fine in two months.

C: SHANE
D: How long you been together?
C: ZOE
D: A month...
C: SHANE
D: That's longer than any relationship I've ever had.
C: ZOE
D: You're okay, Shane. I'm not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt. My teachers don't trust me. Mom doesn't. My dad didn't care about us, he was never here...
C: SHANE
D: Hey. Your father cared about you very deeply. He told me you were the greatest things in his life. That what's bothering you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if you want.
E: interrupts her, stern:
N: Zoe's eye well up, then she cries. Shane holds her.
C: ZOE
D: I miss him so much...
N: Shane is a little taken by surprise. Then -- he decides to answer. He takes his Sfather's MEDAL out of his pocket.
C: SHANE
D: This was my dad's. He was the only family I ever had. Mom left when I was little, cause dad was always gone. Two years in... an indisclosable locale. Another six in... Another indisclosable locale. I didn't really have a home, so I went to military school -- then one day my mom got the letter. No more dad.
N: He looks at the Medal.
C: SHANE
D: I always wanted to be just like him. I'm starting to realize, I never really knew him. I don't know if I'm like him or not.
E: CONT'D
C: ZOE
D: That's horrible, Shane.
C: SHANE
D: The hardest part was living without any details...why? How? Where? I always wondered if he thought about me.
C: OE
D: Me too. So how did you get through it?
C: SHANE
D: You could say I just shut down my emotions. I turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier.
C: OE
D: I never even got to say good bye.
N: A tear runs down Zoe's face. She throws her arms around Shane. The phone rings. Shane answers it.

S: EXT. BACK YARD - LATE NIGHT
N: The house is dark. Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping the area with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES ON. Gary sits in the next chair. Shane sighs morosely.
C: SHANE
D: Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments.

S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
N: hane turns the light on. Gary follows Shane as he looks for tool. Suddenly, the Duck starts quacking... Shane turns. Gary's foot is caught in a grate.
C: SHANE
D: What happened, Gary?
N: Shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries Gary's foot from the grate. Shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye. Shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the grate... we see a CRANK WHEEL.
C: SHANE
D: What do you suppose this is?
E: CONT'D
N: Shane tugs at the grate until it pops off. Shane grips the valve and tries turning it. Nothing. He tries harder, muscles rippling, and then it gives... The wheel spins. he floor opens, revealing a CIRCULAR STAIRCASE, leading below the garage. Shane steps down it...
S: INT. BOTTOM OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: There's a small room, and a hall leading to a STEEL DOOR. It's solid and inscrutable. No hinges or cracks. The only break in its surface is a strange, TWO-PRONGED KEYHOLE. Shane looks on stunned...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. GARAGE - MORNING
N: Shane's at the Steel Door. He has high-tech tools laid out in front of him. He's been trying, unsuccessfully, to crack the lock all night. The Kids are watching his progress, Lulu hands him a tool. Shane dials a phone.

C: BILL
D: ... Do you have it?
C: SHANE

S: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane smiles, pleased, and hangs up. Then we slowly MOVE UP. Away from Shane... towards the neighbor's house. e PUSH INTO the house. Through a window... revealing the Korean neighbors standing in the dark. Silently spying on Shane. An ominous pause.

D: GHOST.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
C: SHANE
D: One things for sure. After we turn this in to my CO, whoever's been bothering you guys won't be bothering you anymore.
N: Everyone reacts happily, relieved. Except for -- Lulu. She looks stricken.
C: SHANE
D: What's wrong, Lulu? You should be happy.
E: CONT'D
C: LULU
D: But, Shane -- does that mean you'll have to go?

N: She trails off...
C: BILL
D: What's wrong?
N: They listen -- they hear, in the next room, Kids singing a beautiful, a capella version of The Hills are Alive (with The Sound of Music). She turns on the lights -- what she sees makes her drop her luggage, in shock. JULIE'S P.O.V.: The house is spotless. The rug is vacuumed. The fish tank is clear, filled with healthy TROPICAL FISH.
C: KIDS VOICES
D: ... with songs they have sung, for a thousand years...
E: singing, a capella
N: Dumb-struck, Julie goes to the...
S: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: The kitchen is sparkling clean, no dishes in the sink. She sees, attached to the fridge with magnets: A flyer for Sound of Music, featuring Todd. JULIE almost faints. Bill steadies her. She staggers to...
S: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Shane and the Kids are holding up a home-made sign: WELCOME HOME, MOM! Todd pushes STOP on a CD player: The Sound of Music stops. Zoe is in a conservative dress, Todd a button down and khakis: barely recognizable. Lulu has bows in her hair. Peter is fresh faced, smiling, Tyler is asleep: a picture- perfect family.
C: ZOE
D: Welcome home, mom.
N: Julie starts bawling. The Kids rush forward and hug her. Across the room, Shane sees Bill enter. Shane stiffens and salutes proudly. S

C: SHANE
D: That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it.
N: Bill stops, surprised. Shane continues, a bit reluctant.
C: SHANE
D: Sir, all I've never known is the military. At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never looked back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything and I have no regrets...
E: CONT'D
C: BILL
D: I should hope not.
C: SHANE
D: But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more.
N: Suddenly, an ANGRY VOICE.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!
N: WIDE Shane and Bill spin, startled. The CHUNS strides up, GUNS DRAWN.

D: Give US THE KEY!
C: SHANE
D: Mr. and Mrs. Chun? They checked out-

C: SHANE
D: NOW!
N: Shane SPINS and grabs both guns! He WHACKS the Koreans' forearms, while SLAMMING their heads together. hane takes control! He smiles, relishing a second of glory -- when suddenly, CRACK! A third gun BUTTS him in the head. CLOSE-UP - SHANE Lights out. He turns, startled, and starts to fall. Disoriented, confused, he looks up as he drops... SHANE'S POV He is losing consciousness. Things are spinning... woozy.
C: KOREAN MAN
D: You promised us GHOST months ago!
E: arguing with Bill
C: BILL
D: I'm sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays...
N: Shane peers in confusion, then passes out.
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. NURSERY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Julie and the Kids are on the floor, tied up. Peter and Tyler are caged in the play pen. Peter has a JUICE BOX. The Korean Man (Mr. Chun) secures the room, closing the window shades. Bill checks the knots binding the children. They whimper, scared.
C: ULU
D: SHANE!!
C: BILL
D: He won't be baby-sitting you anymore.
N: He GAGS the kids. Julie glares, livid.
C: JULIE
D: I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense.

E: to Mr. Chun
N: Bill GAGS Julie. The Kids are furious. Bill and Mrs. Chun exit.
S: INT. GARAGE - DAY
N: Shane lies unconscious. Bill and Mrs. Chun approach the steel door. Bill inserts the two-pronged key... and it CLICKS. The door HUMS, then slides OPEN! Inside is a dark corridor. Bill grins. They enter...
S: INT. SECRET VAULT
N: Light is at the end. They anxiously tiptoe, reaching... THE VAULT! Spare, bright and white. The floor is covered with square tiles. At the far end is a LARGE ELEVATED SAFE. Beside the safe is a red switch, with two settings: ARMED and DISARMED. It's set on ARMED. The air is filled with an ominous, low-pitched HUM, like a monstrous computer. Bill eyes the safe.
C: BILL
D: You bring your stethoscope?
C: MRS. CHUN
D: No. But I've got some C4.
N: She confidently strides toward the safe -- which sets off hidden flame-throwers in the walls. A jet blast of FLAME shoots out! She leaps back just in time, but the shoulder of her jacket is on fire. Bill pats out the flames with his own jacket. Chun is Bokay, just missing BOTH eyebrows.
C: ILL
D: Charles never made things easy.
N: Mrs. Chun's eyebrows are neatly, completely SINGED OFF.
C: MRS. CHUN
D: Just... had eyebrows... done.
S: INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Mr. Chun guards the kids, eyeballing them icily. Lulu "looks" scared. But behind her back, we reveal her HANDS untying her ropes! Freed, she hits her panic button! O.S., BEEPING. Lulu grins hopefully: Shane's coming! A beat... then Mr. Chun pulls the Tracker from his pocket. He sneers.
C: MR. CHUN
D: Think I'm stupid? Now stop bothering me.
N: Lulu frowns, then leans back against Zoe. With a rapid blur of finger-work, she unties Zoe! Then -- needing a distraction, she signals Tyler and crosses her eyes. Tyler GASPS, horrified -- and SCREAMS HIS LUNGS OUT. Chun spins, startled -- and Lulu quickly ROLLS across the room! She lands against Todd, quickly assuming a fake bound position, as if she hadn't moved. Mr. Chun whirls -- the Kids look innocent. Mr. Chun is confused for a second: "wasn't he tied to the other one?" BEHIND TODD - Lulu frantically unties Todd's ropes -- it's gonna be close... Chun scowls. Skeptical, he steps closer... He leans down to look at Todd's ropes Z--
C: OE
D: Now Peter!
N: Peter SQUIRTS JUICE into Mr. Chun's face. The Kids use the distraction: Todd POPS to his feet, then LEAPS into his SPIN KICK: it connects with Mr. Chun's head.
C: OE
D: Let's GO!
E: CONT'D
N: All the kids bounce up. They untie Julie, then scoop up Peter and Tyler. Mr. Chun growls and starts to stagger up. Lulu lands in Karate stance and calls out:
C: LULU
D: Hi ya!
N: The other Kids take off, Mr. Chun looks at Lulu. Mr. Chun laughs:
C: MR. CHUN
D: That's cute.
N: HAM without warning, Lulu SWEEPS Mr. Chun's leg, he drops to his knees in pain, then, when he's at her level, she KICKS him right in the nuts. It HURTS. Mr. Chun tries to grab her by the wrist, but Lulu EVADES with her cool, snake-like move. Lulu runs, slamming the door behind her. Mr. Chun gets up and turns the doorknob, but the door won't budge...
S: INT. OUTSIDE THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
N: Zoe shoves a chair between the door and the opposite wall, they're trapped inside.
S: INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

S: EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME
N: The family comes scrambling out -- but as Julie exits, a HAND suddenly GRABS her.
C: JULIE
D: AGGGH!

C: JULIE
D: Keep going! RUN! Go GET HELP!!!

C: BILL
D: How does it work?
C: JULIE
D: How does what work?
C: BILL
D: Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want to know how to get through the booby traps. What's the code?
C: JULIE
D: I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room...
C: BILL
D: If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't make me kill you too.
N: Julie GASPS, chilled. Then, a CRACKLING of static. Mrs. Chun exits the vault, holding a military RADIO.
C: MRS. CHUN
D: Mr. Bill, my husband has question:
N: MR. CHUN (OVER THE WALKIE) I have a clean shot at their tires. It's risky, they might wreck...

D: Change of plan. Bring them back unharmed.
N: Bill uncuffs Shane.
S: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY
N: The vehicles race, Chun just inches from the kids' tail. He tries to pass them on the right. It's like a chariot race, Chun zooming by, half on the sidewalk, to cut them off!
S: INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS
N: Todd scrambles into the back seat. He does something we can't see, as Zoe drives.
C: ZOE
D: What's taking you?
C: TODD
D: Don't wait for me!

C: TODD
D: Now!
E: CONT'D
N: Zoe floors it, Mr. Chun is now face to face with Todd -- who throws a dirty diaper into the his face. Mr. Chun swerves and almost wrecks. Lulu starts PELTING Mr. Chun with debris: milk cartons, crayons, orange peels.
C: R. CHUN
D: Aah! HEY --
N: Rubbish clobbers him. Exasperated, Mr. Chun ROLLS UP his window, then POUNDS the gas! Faster! About to pass... Zoe looks over. Chun is pointing a gun! She suddenly PULLS the emergency brake. WIDE RRRRRRRR!! The Van SPINS into a squealing 360. Mr. Chun SCREAMS, disoriented, and loses control. In the van, Peter laughs.
C: PETER
D: Wheee!
N: The Van spins madly. The sedan skids and PLOWS into a store window. CRASH!! The kids cheer, triumphant.
S: INT. SECRET VAULT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shane scopes out the vault. The walls and ceilings are covered with high-tech weaponry. Mrs. Chun holds Julie. Bill waits impatiently. Shane is figuring his options...
C: SHANE
D: Anybody got any perfume? Hair spray... breath freshener...
N: A bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of Binaca. Shane SQUIRTS it, revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing LASER BEAMS. Shane steps forward. He speaks aloud, confidently:
C: SHANE
D: Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler!
E: CONT'D
N: Bill reacts, puzzled.
C: SHANE
D: The key is the kid's names. Watch.

C: SHANE
D: But... That was the code! I swear! I saw Plummer use it on his briefcase.
C: BILL
D: Code or no code, go get it -- now.
N: ill cocks his gun. Sweat drips down Shane's face. He mists the air to see the beams: He steps forward, over one beam and ducking under another -- he miscalculates: a BURST OF FLAME blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow torch, Shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees.
C: JULIE
D: You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance.
E: to Bill

C: SHANE
D: Haven't got a chance.
E: thinking
N: Shane feels the Groove in the floor. He thinks. He looks up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor).
C: SHANE
D: ... When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you haven't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.
E: CONT'D sings softly to himself
N: Shane LAUGHS sharply. That's the code! He shares a look with Julie. Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no idea what he's laughing about. Calmness comes to Shane's face. He takes a deep breath, facing forwards:
C: SHANE
D: Just hop three times like a kangaroo --
E: CONT'D
N: He hops forwards three times, fearlessly. NOTHING HAPPENS. No BOOBY TRAPS are set off.

C: SHANE
D: Three steps forward and one step back.
E: CONT'D
N: When he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing. Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts:
C: JULIE
D: QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!
N: Shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just in time: FLAMES SHOOT FROM BOTH WALLS right at him. If he'd been standing, he'd be toast.
S: EXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - SIMULTANEOUS
N: The Minivan blasts through another yellow.
C: LULU
D: Look out Zoe! Rollers!
N: There is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them. Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan -- it takes a while, they're FLYING.
C: ZOE
D: Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.
N: Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her. The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe.
T: CUTE COP
N: I'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one!
C: ZOE
D: People are trying to kill us. They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me!
T: CUTE COP
N: Just pull over!
C: ZOE
D: Fine. Don't follow me!
N: She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the road. Zoe U-turns, and speeds back towards her house. The Squad Car turns around and chases her.
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

S: EXT. SCHOOL - SAME TIME
N: Murney and Claire are watching a SOCCER GAME. He's in a NECK-BRACE.

N: Shane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously.
C: SHANE
D: Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor.
N: Shane jumps up just AS THE FLOOR UNDER HIM DROPS AWAY, revealing a pool of liquid. Shane has wedged himself in the corner. A bead of his sweat falls into the liquid, and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. It's acid.
C: SHANE
D: Almost done, almost done... "Just hold your breath, and jump to the left."
E: CONT'D to himself, to calm down
N: He jumps, to the left of the HOLE. He lands in front of THE SAFE. He's relieved -- then nozzles spray YELLOW GAS at him. He holds his breath just in time. Still holding his breath:
C: SHANE
D: And that's the Peter Panda Dance.
E: CONT'D
N: He flips the switch to DISARMED. The safe's red light turns green. Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns retract! The gas gets sucked into grates. The whole room goes SILENT. Whew. Bill looks around. He nervously steps forward - he waves his hand over the floor, and jumps back. Nothing happens. Bill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along.
C: BILL
D: Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man. I knew you'd figure it out.
N: Shane scowls, disgusted.
C: BILL
D: You know, if you're willing to join up, I'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds. What do you say -- we make a good team?
E: CONT'D
C: SHANE
D: I was devoted to you, sir. And you betrayed all of that. All that we stand for.
N: Beat. Bill shrugs.
C: BILL
D: I'll take that as a "no."
N: Bill turns to the safe. He starts to reach for the dial... then catches himself. Something's not right.
C: BILL
D: ... I think you better open it.
E: CONT'D
N: Shane reaches for the safe, before he reaches the dial --
C: BILL
D: Wait. That's just what you want isn't it?
E: CONT'D
N: Bill thinks, trying to read Shane's poker face. Shane shrugs. Bill gestures to Mrs. Chun.
C: BILL
D: You open it.
E: CONT'D
N: Mrs. Chun doesn't budge.
C: BILL
D: Oh come on. I walked the floor first.
E: CONT'D
N: Reluctantly - Mrs. Chun reaches out, and touches the dial. Nothing happens. Relief. She turns it, and ZAPPPPP! 1000 volts ELECTROCUTES her, her hair on end, shaking from the voltage... Bill is off guard, Shane kicks his gun away! The gun skids into the acid and plunges, SIZZLING. Bill is incensed, but Shane gazes coldly.
C: SHANE
D: There will be no mercy.
C: BILL
D: None requested.
N: Full of himself, Bill LUNGES. And he's strong! He shoves Shane back, then PUNCHES him in the gut. Shane glares, then returns an onslaught of BLOWS. Shane's fury is unleashed: A volley of attacks, hitting Bill's arms, head, legs! He's crazed, unrelenting. But suddenly Mrs. Chun LEAPS onto his back.
C: MRS. CHUN
D: AAAAAA!
N: She SCREAMS and grabs his throat. Shane struggles to lose her. Suddenly, he drops and FLIPS her. She catapults, stumbles backwards across the room, and stops just inches from the acid! She teeters, tottering, unable to gain her balance. Shane shakes his head, then runs to grab her outstretched hand. She smiles, saved. But he's unforgiving.
C: SHANE
D: You're a... terrible neighbor.
N: Shane COLD-COCKS her, knocking her out. Suddenly --
C: JULIE
D: Shane! Watch out!
N: Bill is charging him. Shane whirls, delivering a ROUNDHOUSE KICK. OOF! Bill gets slammed in the chest. Bill tumbles, the wind knocked out of him. He jumps to his feet, delivering a series of hard punches, which Shane deflects -- they tangle like pro's. It's clear the both have the same training. They punch, spin, kick, connecting only occasionally. Bill wheels around and lands a kicks squarely in Shane's chest. Shane tumbles, landing on his back in front of the safe. ANGLE - BILL He steps over Shane. Leering mercilessly, he jabs the spike against Shane's throat.
C: BILL
D: Any last words?
N: Julie gasps. Shane narrows his eyes, then whispers/sings.
C: SHANE
D: ... Say, good night, Peter Panda!

C: ZOE
D: Hey, I'M the one in Driver's Ed! I think I know what I'm doing!!
N: WIDE She squeals into the driveway, then BRAKES. But it's too late. The van SKIDS, smoke BURNING from the tires -- and hits a tree. The Kid spill out and run. The lead Police Car screeches to a stop. POLICE leap from the car.
S: INT. SECRET VAULT - SAME TIME
N: Shane and Julie stare at each other, then look in the safe: Inside, the cavernous metal box holds but one object: A tiny COMPUTER CHIP. Shane gently removes it.

D: ... GHOST.
N: They look in silence. She smiles at Shane, grateful.
C: JULIE
D: Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now we can go back to our peaceful...

C: MR. CHUN
D: EVERYBODY! HIT THE GROUND!!!
E: O.S.

C: MR. CHUN
D: I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS, AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG!
E: CONT'D
N: The cops freeze, helpless. Shane weighs his not so many options... Nobody is sure what to do. But then -- a WOMAN suddenly flips over the fence, vaults onto Chun, and KNOCKS him out with a Karate Chop.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Ya!!
N: Claire lands on her feet, triumphant. Even Chun is amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the rocket launcher. CLOSE-UP - SHANE He breaks into a big grin. CLOSE-UP - CLAIRE She proudly smiles back at him.
T: ANGLE - THE CUTE COP

C: FBI AGENT
D: Yes.
C: LULU
D: Does it itch?
C: FBI AGENT
D: Yes...
N: Zoe is looking at the safe. She sees, fallen onto the floor, from the safe, a letter. Her siblings, and Julie notice, and gather around. Zoe reads the LETTER:
C: ZOE
D: If you're reading this, then Julie found the key. Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd, Lulu -- I want to say: I love you more than anything. I always have.
N: A tear comes to her eye. The Plummers hug each other.
S: EXT. THE PLUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Claire walks up to Shane. Mock-angry.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: So. What happens now? You'll be stationed somewhere else, right? I guess there's no more reason for you to stick around here.
N: Shane looks at her. He looks around: at the family. He looks at Claire....
C: SHANE
D: Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the situation, here... And to tell the truth. I don't see anything but reasons to stay.
C: RINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: So... What's the next move?
N: Shane smiles slyly and pulls her close.
C: SHANE
D: ... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're the superior office. You tell me.
C: PRINCIPAL CLAIRE
D: Well. Summer's almost here. What if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission. On, say -- Maui?
C: SHANE
D: Sir yes sir.
N: Claire beams. The Plummers all approach, interrupting. Zoe gives them a look -- that makes Shane and Claire BLUSH. Lulu turns to Shane, sad.
C: LULU
D: This is it. Your work here is through. Guess you have to go now...
N: She puts out her hand, to shake his.
C: SHANE
D: Ah, come here you.
N: He surprises her with a BEAR HUG -- he hugs the whole family at once, squeezing them off the ground. He puts them down. Before he goes: he reaches down and gives Zoe - - his medal. He squeezes her hand around it.
C: ZOE
D: But...
C: SHANE
D: He would've wanted me to give it to someone I care about. Like he did. Thank you. For everything.
C: ETER
D: Love you, Shane.
N: TIGHT - SHANE This is too much. He wipes his face.
C: SHANE
D: Your dad would be so proud.
N: Shane bawls -- he can't keep it in. He starts to head off, Lulu calls after him:
C: LULU
D: Shane, we're never gonna see you again!
C: SHANE

E: CONT'D he grins
N: Wider reveals the Cast of `The Sound of Music'.
T: CUT TO:
N: Shane's military-march version of the musical. Nuns sing "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?" The Von Trapp kids perform "So Long, Farewell." In the audience, Julie watches in astonishment. She is surrounded by her children. Scott: in a suit, his hair combed, Claire: dressed to the nines, the little Brownie Troop, even Murney. Lulu has a basket in her lap -- inside: GARY THE DUCK and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw. They all watch, rapt. You Are Sixteen begins. Shane watches with bated breath. Todd spins. In SLOW MOTION, he leaps into the SPIN KICK. It's fantastic -- a Michael Jordan dunk. The AUDIENCE goes nuts, Shane stands, and shouts:
C: SHANE
D: YESSS! Huu-ah!
E: CONT'D And an Armed forces:
N: The Audience stares at him, until he sits back down, beaming with pride. Finally: "CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN." Hearts swell, as the family crosses the papier-mâché alps. A STANDING OVATION. The performers take their curtain calls, then giddily gesture Shane to come out. He humbly steps into view -- and the house goes crazy. Thundering applause. A cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on him. Shane smiles, touched. Mission accomplished.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
