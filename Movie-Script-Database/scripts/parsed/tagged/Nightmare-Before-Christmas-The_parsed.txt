N: [entering graveyard] Jack's Lament Performed by Danny Elfman There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night I excel without ever even trying With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms I have seen grown men give out a shriek With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan I have swept the very bravest off their feet Yet year after year, it's the same routine And I grow so weary of the sound of screams And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King Have grown so tired of the same old thing Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there, far from my home A longing that I've never known I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light And I'll scare you right out of your pants To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky And I'm known throughout England and France And since I am dead, I can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations No animal nor man can scream like I can With the fury of my recitations But who here would ever understand That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin Would tire of his crown, if they only understood He'd give it all up if he only could Oh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise come year after year Does nothing for these empty tears [leaving graveyard and entering forest]
C: SALLY
D: Jack, I know how you feel.
N: [Sally gathers herbs] [back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

N: [showing her arm]
C: SALLY
D: Yes.
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: Shall we then. That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off --
C: SALLY
D: Three times!
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: You're mine you know! I made you with my own hands.
C: SALLY
D: You can make other creations. I'm restless, I can't help it.
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: It's a phase my dear, it'll pass. We need to be patient that's all.
C: SALLY
D: But, I don't want to be patient.

N: What's This? Performed by Danny Elfman What's this? What's this? There's color everywhere What's this? There's white things in the air What's this? I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair What's this? What's this? What's this? There's something very wrong What's this? There's people singing songs What's this? The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy Have I possibly gone daffy? What is this? What's this? There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads They're busy building toys And absolutely no one's dead There's frost on every window Oh, I can't believe my eyes And in my bones I feel the warmth That's coming from inside Oh, look What's this? They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss Why that looks so unique, inspired They're gathering around to hear a story Roasting chestnuts on a fire What's this? What's this? In here they've got a little tree, how queer And who would ever think And why? They're covering it with tiny little things They've got electric lights on strings And there's a smile on everyone So, now, correct me if I'm wrong This looks like fun This looks like fun Oh, could it be I got my wish? What's this? Oh my, what now? The children are asleep But look, there's nothing underneath No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them Or ensnare them, only little cozy things Secure inside their dreamland What's this? The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air The smell of cakes and pies Are absolutely everywhere The sights, the sounds They're everywhere and all around I've never felt so good before This empty place inside of me is filling up I simply cannot get enough I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know I've got to know What is this place that I have found? What is this? Christmas Town, hmm...
C: SANDY CLAWS

C: SALLY
D: I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon] Oops!
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: You want me to starve. An old man like me who hardly has strength as it is. Me, to whom you owe your very life.

C: MAYOR
D: [in his mayor truck] Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight
N: [at meeting] Clown [giggles as he hits Sally]
C: JACK
D: Listen everyone. I want to tell you about Christmastown.
N: Town Meeting Song Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast
C: JACK
D: There are objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull and it does exist Here, let me show you
N: This is a thing called a present The whole thing starts with a box
C: DEVIL
D: A box? is it steel?
C: WEREWOLF
D: Are there locks?
C: HARLEOUIN DEMON
D: Is it filled with a pox?
C: DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
D: A pox How delightful, a pox
C: JACK
D: If you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow
C: WITCHES
D: A bow? But why? How ugly What's in it? What's in it?
C: JACK
D: That's the point of the thing, not to know
C: CLOWN
D: It's a bat Will it bend?
C: CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
D: It's a rat Will it break?
C: UNDERSEA GAL
D: Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake
C: JACK
D: Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas land
N: Now, pay attention We pick up an oversized sock And hang it like this on the wall
C: MR. HYDE
D: Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?
C: MEDIUM MR. HYDE
D: Let me see, let me look
C: SMALL MR. HYDE
D: Is it rotted and covered with gook?
C: JACK
D: Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
C: MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
D: Small toys
C: WINGED DEMON
D: Do they bite?
C: MUMMY
D: Do they snap?
C: WINGED DEMON
D: Or explode in a sack?
C: CORPSE KID
D: Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys
C: MAYOR
D: What a splendid idea This Christmas sounds fun I fully endorse it Let's try it at once
C: JACK
D: Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas land Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understand
N: And I've also heard it told That he's something to behold Like a lobster, huge and red When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms That is, so I've heard it said And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies into a fog Like a vulture in the sky And they call him Sandy Claws Well, at least they're excited But they don't understand That special kind of feeling in Christmas land Oh, well... [Jack's house]
C: JACK
D: There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.
N: [Dr. Finkelstein's castle]
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.
N: [locks Sally away] [dingdong]
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: Oh my head...the door is open.
C: JACK
D: Hel-lo
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: Jack Skellington, up here my boy.
C: JACK
D: Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: Is that so, whatever for?
C: JACK
D: I'm conducting a series of experiments.
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: How perfectly marvelous. Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
C: JACK
D: I know.
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.
C: SALLY
D: Hmm. Experiments?
N: [Jack's house]
C: JACK
D: Zero, I'm home.
N: [Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]
C: JACK
D: Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?
N: [Sally's room] [after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]
C: DR. FINKELSTEIN
D: You can come out now if you promise to behave. Sally. Sally. Oooh! Gone again!

C: CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN

N: He's all alone up there Locked away inside Never says a word Hope he hasn't died Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack
C: JACK
D: Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be? I cannot tell There's so many things I cannot grasp When I think I've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
N: Something here I'm not quite getting Though I try, I keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant, gone in a flash What does it mean? What does it mean? In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though Simple objects, nothing more But something's hidden through a door Though I do not have the key Something's there I cannot see What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? Hmm... I've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart As often as I've read them, something's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it's really not as deep As I've been led to think Am I trying much too hard? Of course! I've been too close to see The answer's right in front of me Right in front of me It's simple really, very clear Like music drifting in the air Invisible, but everywhere Just because I cannot see it Doesn't mean I can't believe it You know, I think this Christmas thing It's not as tricky as it seems And why should they have all the fun? It should belong to anyone Not anyone, in fact, but me Why, I could make a Christmas tree And there's no reason I can find I couldn't handle Christmas time I bet I could improve it too And that's exactly what I'll do Hee,hee,hee
C: JACK
D: Eureka!! This year, Christmas will be ours!
C: MAYOR

I am the Pumpkin King, ha, ha, ha, ha And I just can't wait until next Halloween 'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream And, by God, I'm really going to give it all my might Uh oh, I hope there's still time to set things right Sandy Claws, hmm [Oogie lair]
