M: MINI'S FIRST TIME
M: Written by
M: Nick Guthe
M: CLOSE ON:
N: The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something. She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl. - MINI (V.O.) I know what you're thinking. Don't bullshit me, because I do... You're - thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge - out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. I'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my - mouth until I suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story. We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.
C: MINI
D: Well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school...I promise.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a
T: series of quick cuts:
N: A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull.
C: MINI
D: Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started.
E: V.O.
N: Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed Studio City hillside home.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.
N: TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.
C: MINI
D: I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday...
E: V.O.
N: Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER- AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.
C: MINI
D: See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me.
E: V.O.
N: Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
C: MINI
D: A few days before the party, I overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says "I love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face.
E: V.O.
N: Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.
C: MINI
D: And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed.
E: V.O.
N: Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini, almost challenging her. MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his imagination.
C: MINI
D: That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out.
E: V.O.
N: Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.
C: MINI
D: Yo, bee-ach!
C: KAYLA
D: Yo, birthday bee-ach!
C: MINI
D: Is it on?
C: KAYLA
D: Oh, it's on!
C: MINI
D: That's my girl!
N: Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.
N: Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey, starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.
C: MINI
D: See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. "Firsts" is what I call them.
E: V.O.
N: As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on Diane's face grows stronger with every step.
C: MINI
D: Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my first...rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many "firsts" into it as possible.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: We switch back to real time.
C: DIANE
D: What the hell are you doing? I said wait until- She's not even here, you morons!
E: looking around
N: A YOUNG CATERER'S face turns white.
C: CATERER
D: But, but her friend said--
N: POP! Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half shell.
C: MINI
D: SURPRISE!
N: MINI'S POV: A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving dollar bills. M
C: MINI
D: That was definitely a first, but more importantly, it was the first time I really understood my potential...And that's when it all started.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Mini leans over and gives her STUNNED mom a big hug.
C: MINI
D: Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday ever!
E: CONT'D doing her best Donna Reed
S: INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head, having just taken a shower. She removes the towel to reveal she's just changed her hair color to FLAMING RED.
C: MINI
D: That little stunt got me grounded for a week, but it was worth it.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini blow drying her hair.
C: MINI
D: See, I just don't understand people who live their lives as one big routine.
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini evenly spreading the base to her make-up.
C: MINI
D: They're basically saying "I'm not worthy of a unique experience on this earth."...Well, sorry, but I am.
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini applying blush to her cheeks.
C: MINI
D: The law of firsts has served me well, because it's liberated me from the usual pathetic, repetitive concerns of high school.
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini applying eye liner.
C: MINI
D: I simply don't care if I'm popular, because if I did, then I'd be constantly stressing about whether my clothes are cool enough, or if Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know it yet" quarterback, is gonna call.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: Mini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful looks from some of the more aggressive boys. They approach a group of FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
C: KAYLA
D: Oh, God, it's Troy.
E: whispering, worried
C: MINI
D: Just keep walking and don't look at him. ROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.
C: TROY
D: Yo, Kayla, I got some more of what you were looking for Saturday night.
C: MINI
D: Ahh...The joys of the American educational system.
E: V.O.
N: Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops to address Troy and his posse.
C: MINI
D: Actually, Troy, I think you confused her with that senile, toothless grandmother of yours.
E: CONT'D suddenly brightening
N: "Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks concerned his ambush has backfired.
C: TROY
D: Yo, Mini, why don't you use that mouth for something useful and suck my dick?
N: More students start to gather, overhearing them.
C: MINI
D: Actually, now that you mention it, I can't think of anything I'd rather do than suck your dick.
N: Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her declaration.
C: TROY
D: Well, it's all for you, babe.
N: Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye.
C: MINI
D: Really?
C: TROY
D: If you can fit it all in.
E: daring her
N: The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is riveted by the exchange. Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his fly.
C: TROY
D: Hey, what the?!
E: CONT'D
C: MINI
D: I'm going to suck your dick, Troy, you said I could.
E: grabbing his belt buckle
N: Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his belt. Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but then giggles start to erupt.
C: TROY
D: Yo, this ain't funny!
C: MINI
D: No, Troy, I want to suck your dick right now!
C: TROY
D: Jesus, Mini, come on, get off!
C: MINI
D: No, Troy! You said I could, now come on!
E: screaming
N: She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't believe their eyes.
C: MINI
D: Let's see it! Come on, I want to suck your throbbing member right now!
N: Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully and smiles.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini applying frosty hot pink lipstick, making her lips as full as possible.
C: DIANE
D: Mini?
E: O.S.
N: Mini looks towards the door, deciding to ignore her mother.
C: DIANE
E: O.S. screaming
N: MINI?! Mini turns towards the sound.
C: MINI
D: WHAT?!
N: Diane comes storming in.
C: DIANE
D: When I call you, I expect you to answer.
C: MINI
D: Sorry.
E: flatly
C: DIANE
D: Don't patronize me.
C: MINI
D: Sorry!
E: sugar sweet
C: DIANE
D: If you're trying to get me to call you a spoiled little ungrateful bitch, you're out of luck, because I won't give you the satisfaction.
C: MINI
D: Thanks, mommy.
N: Diane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where her mother's buttons are.
C: MINI
D: What do you want?
E: CONT'D
C: DIANE
D: I'm going out and I need you to wait for the delivery from the liquor store. They'll be here by nine.
C: MINI
D: Fine.
N: Diane gives Mini the once over, lingering on her mini-skirt. Diane winces at the outfit.
C: DIANE
D: Just thought you should know, that makes your thighs look fat.
C: MINI
D: Gosh, you're right, mom, I'm such a cow.
E: deadpan
C: MINI
D: It's a freakin' miracle I'm not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Have fun, don't do anything I wouldn't.
N: Diane turns and leaves.
C: DIANE
D: Well, that doesn't leave much.
E: over her shoulder
C: MINI
D: Cunt.
E: under her breath
N: Mini turns back to the mirror.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini pulls on a pair of thigh-high stockings, as a lit cigarette hangs from M her mouth.
C: MINI
D: My mother moved out to LA from Ohio when she was twenty to become an actress. Even though she was a total flatliner, somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps...without screwing anyone.
E: V.O.
S: INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOUSE - LATER.
N: Mini walks along the corridor in a pair of "fuck me" pumps, as the doorbell is heard ringing.
C: MINI
D: When she gets really sauced, she'll pop the tapes in and make me watch, then I'll threaten to call the suicide hotline.
E: V.O.
N: She continues through the living room towards the door, hiking her mini skirt up a little.
C: MINI
D: After a few years, she got desperate and spread 'em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn. She got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn't be on the show, unless she hoovered me out.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: She reaches the front the door.
C: MINI
D: Excuse me for one sec.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: She opens the door to reveal a delivery boy, JIMMY 20's, with six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart.
C: JIMMY
D: Hey, Mini, how you doin'?
E: nervously excited
C: MINI
D: You're late.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini watches as Jimmy carefully lifts one case after another on to the counter.
C: MINI
D: She was gonna do it, too, at least that what's she told me when she was feeling particularly loving. But then she heard rumors the show wasn't gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child support beat thirteen weeks on "Skin Tight", so I got to stick around. ...Bad choice.
E: V.O.
N: Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the kitchen. NT. THE WET BAR - LATER. Mini mixes herself a large Sapphire martini.
C: MINI
D: Anyway, what Mom didn't count on was the prick having a heart attack and croaking a year after I was born.
E: V.O.
N: She pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in.
C: MINI
D: When she tried to collect on his estate, she found out he'd owed the government two point five in back taxes.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. A RUN DOWN STUCCO APARTMENT BUILDING IN THE VALLEY-
N: CIRCA 1993. Diane walks down the steps to a waiting Porsche, with a SLEAZY LOOKING, BUT CLEARLY RICH GUY behind the wheel.
C: MINI
D: Now, if she had been smart, she would've set her sights a little lower and gone after a guy who would've worshipped the ground she walked on and wouldn't care that she already had a kid...
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: Diane getting into the car. She turns to the driver and gives him a flirty smile. IT'S NOW A DIFFERENT, but just as SLEAZY GUY smiling back at her.
C: MINI
D: But not mom, she was gonna bag another elephant if it meant gobbling every knob from Hollywood to the Palisades.
E: V.O.
N: As the car pulls away, we see an 8 YEAR OLD MINI watch from an upstairs window of the building.
S: INT. THE SAME RUN DOWN APARTMENT - EVENING
N: Mini sits watching TV as Diane walks in with YET ANOTHER SLEAZY GUY, his hands all over her. Diane looks surprised and pissed to see Mini still up.
C: DIANE
D: Jesus Chr--Mini, why aren't you in bed?
N: Mini just stares at her, then shifts her penetrating gaze to SLEAZY GUY #3. He looks unnerved by Mini. SLEAZY GUY #3 I thought you said we'd be--
C: DIANE
D: Don't worry, Larry, she's going to bed, right now. Aren't you? NT. MINI'S TINY BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini lies awake as the SOUNDS OF DIANE FUCKING SLEAZY GUY #3's brains out waft through the thin walls.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN OF DIANE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING.
N: Mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as THE FOURTH SLEAZY GUY emerges from Diane's bedroom, he's tucking his shirt in. He looks a little startled to see her up. SLEAZY GUY #4 Oh...Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom I, uh, had a good time.
C: MINI
D: Oh, I will...Like some coffee for the road?
N: The guy looks at her a little surprised, then smiles. SLEAZY GUY #4 Sure...thanks, kid.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini watching the PORSCHE PULL AWAY from the curb. In her hand, she holds a bottle of MAXIMUM STRENGTH EX-LAX.
T: CUT TO:
N: SLEAZY GUY #4 driving down the freeway, drinking coffee from a paper cup. Suddenly, a look of absolute dread overcomes him.
S: INT. DIANE'S APARTMENT - LATER.
N: Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking disheveled. She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen table eating her cereal.
C: DIANE
D: Do you want to live in this shit hole your whole life?
N: Mini just stares at her.
C: DIANE
D: Then stay in your fucking room until they leave. Got it?
N: Mini says nothing. Suddenly, Diane picks up a SMALL PIECE OF POTTERY from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head. Mini ducks as it SMASHES behind her on the wall. CUT BACK TO: 18 YEAR OLD MINI MIXING HER MARTINI IN THE WET BAR.
C: MINI
D: So it pretty much went on like that until...
E: V.O.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Mini? Diane? I'm home.
E: O.S.
C: MINI
D: Five years ago, when she met Martin.
E: V.O.
N: Mini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps.
C: MINI
D: It was a win-win...
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. A HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world, style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd effortlessly.
C: MINI
D: He didn't want kids, but needed a ready-made family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings...We finally got out of Reseda...
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini at the bar, stealing the drink of a TROPHY WIFE who has turned her back on it, to make a point to her OLDER HUSBAND.
C: MINI
D: It was great for about a year...
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: LATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth.
C: MINI
D: Then he figured out what he had married...by then it was too late.
E: V.O. CONT'D
S: INT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door.
C: MINI
D: You're home early.
E: breezing past him
C: MINI
D: First time in three months he's walked in before Letterman. He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now I'm thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or...found a new pin.
E: V.O. CONT'D
C: MARTIN
D: Yeah...uh... A dinner with a client got canceled.
E: searching
C: MINI
D: Bingo.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Tough day?
C: MARTIN
D: About the same...
N: They head back into the living room.
C: MINI
D: Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists?
C: ARTIN
D: Someone's got to make the payments on your Beemer.
C: MINI
D: He's a partner at a public relations firm, which is ironic because I can't remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together...or had relations.
E: V.O.
N: He plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer out of his breast pocket.
C: MARTIN
D: Is your mother around?
C: MINI
D: No, she went to a party off Beachwood. She was in one of her "happy moods", so I doubt she'll be sleeping here...
C: MARTIN
D: Oh.
C: MINI
D: If you were thinking of inviting a guest over.
E: innocently
C: MARTIN
D: I wasn't, but thanks for the concern...You're going out on a school night?
E: measured
C: MINI
D: Yeah?
N: Martin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind clearly elsewhere.
C: MARTIN
D: Mmm...Is your homework done?
C: MINI
D: Haven't even cracked a book.
C: MARTIN
D: Mmm...
E: not listening
S: INT. MINI'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick, compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms.
C: MINI
D: Considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed, you've got to admire his resolve. He could've left her years ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won't give in.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive. Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible sit in the open garage.
C: MINI
D: Their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm.
E: V.O.
N: Mini gets into her BMW.
S: EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT
N: The BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of traffic. M
C: MINI
D: As I said, the rule of firsts guides my life. Once you've gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
N: Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows.
C: MINI
D: I thought it would be a goof if I put a photo ad in one of those 25 cent "outcall" massage newspapers they sell around town. But I just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail. So I went to an escort service, and when they found out I was 18, they told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night...if I was up to it.
E: V.O.
N: She passes OLDER PROSTITUTES soliciting cars that have slowed down for a peek.
C: MINI
D: Would you look at them?
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: One of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look.
C: MINI
D: It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to be, what? At least twenty eight?...In dog years. Oh, wait, that would make her four.
E: V.O. CONT'D pausing
N: She arrives in front of the HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL.
S: INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and knocks. She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an answer. The door opens and a MIDDLE AGED MAN opens the door. He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way. He could be a serial killer or...
S: INT. A HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
N: Mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door, as the man sheepishly follows her.
C: MINI
D: My first night as a call girl was a serious let down. It turns out both guys were in town for the "Promise Keepers" convention.
E: V.O.
N: She reaches the door. He opens it and points to the room across from his. Mini walks across and knocks.
C: MINI
D: The first one got so excited I didn't even get a chance to get my panties off before he creamed himself.
E: V.O.
N: A HEAVIER MAN in a denim shirt opens it.
S: INT. THE OTHER HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
N: The heavier man is on his knees, weeping as he hugs Mini around the waist.
C: MINI
D: And the other said I looked so much like his niece, he started whimpering and praying for forgiveness.
E: V.O.
N: She rolls her eyes in frustration.
S: EXT. FOUNTAIN AVENUE - NIGHT
N: Mini drives home, suddenly a SIREN is heard and she sees the FLASHING LIGHTS of a cop car behind her. Mini pulls over looking pissed.
C: MINI
D: Time to bat the eye lashes...
E: V.O.
N: The cop car pulls up behind her and a FEMALE COP WITH A BUZZ CUT gets out, approaching the car. Mini looks in her mirror, with a sly smile. The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down at her, clearly attracted to her.
S: EXT. A BACK ALLEY OFF FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
N: THE POLICE CRUISER is parked with its lights off.
S: INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: THE FEMALE COP is lying on the seat with her legs spread, as Mini goes down on her. The woman is clutching the steering wheel with her left hand and the seat with her right, hanging on for dear life as Mini rocks her world.
C: MINI
D: This? Are you kidding? My first woman and my first cop?...It would've been perfect if she hadn't wanted to cuddle afterwards.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
N: Mini unlocks the door and walks in to find Diane passed out, face-up on the sofa in a loosely-tied bathrobe. At the sound of the door, Diane looks up.
C: DIANE
D: Oh...wha- what are you doing here? ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her insightful question. Mini sighs and heads for the bedroom.
E: slurring
C: DIANE
D: Did you have fun, dear?
C: MINI
D: Yeah, I turned two tricks and went down on a dyke cop.
C: DIANE
D: Thass nice...
N: Mini heads down the hallway.
C: MINI
D: God, what's gotten into her? She was almost warm and fuzzy.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks. A GREASY-HAIRED NAKED MAN lies passed out on her bed. His body hair is thick and matted. His genitals are covered by her pillow, which he cradles like a teddy bear. Mini's jaw tightens slowly.
S: INT. THE LOBBY OF THE PENINSULA HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Mini walks through the lobby past TWO BUSINESSMEN sitting at the bar, chatting up TWO VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in their mid twenties.
C: MINI
D: After that night, things really picked up.
E: V.O.
N: The men's eyes instinctively follow Mini, as their dates exchange a glance of annoyance.
C: MINI
D: My one rule which the agency wasn't too happy about was, of course, only firsts, no repeat customers.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS - DAY
N: This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school student, past a SECURITY GUARD.
C: MINI
D: But believe me, they didn't have too much trouble honoring that request.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AN IMPRESSIVE CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of the PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk.
C: MINI
D: I'd make house calls to offices at lunch hour and we'd say I was someone's niece or cousin in town on vacation.
E: V.O.
N: The man stands up and greets her like she's family, and then quickly shuts the door. XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS - NIGHT Mini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a cheerleaders uniform.
C: MINI
D: And then when football season started, Saturday through Monday...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: A HUSKY MAN in a football jersey opens the door to find Mini waving her pom poms with a Texas sized grin on her face.
C: MINI
D: I was busier than Domino's.
E: V.O.
S: INT/EXT. A MULTI LEVEL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Mini drives into the garage.
C: MINI
D: Then one Thursday night I get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so "wifey" doesn't find the motel bills on the gold card statements. They say I'm just his type...young.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE LOBBY OF A MODERN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: Mini walks quickly through the lobby.
C: MINI
D: They tell me he's not big on the chit-chat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini knocks on the door.
C: MALE VOICE
D: It's open.
E: O.S.
S: INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees... MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed. She quickly turns away before he sees her face.
C: MARTIN
D: Hello?
C: MINI
D: Can you fucking believe it?
E: V.O.
N: Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time.
C: MINI
D: Uh...hi, Sorry, I'm Mlate.
E: quickly adopting a southern accent
C: ARTIN
D: Don't worry about it.
C: MINI
D: Mind if I freshen up?
C: MARTIN
D: Sure.
N: Mini ducks into the bathroom.
S: INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks down at the counter.
C: MINI
D: My own dad! My first thought was "how sick is he?" But then I started thinking...I'm one to talk, and...well...
E: V.O.
N: Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer.
C: MINI
D: Why not? I mean, he isn't my real dad...and talk about a first. The more I thought about it...
E: V.O.
N: A wicked glint dances across her eyes.
C: MINI
D: ...the more turned on I got. Then I thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed, I could do her strange guy in this bed.
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Everything alright in there?
E: O.S.
C: MINI
D: Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would you mind turning the lights off, I'm kinda new to all this and a little shy.
E: still in her southern accent
C: MARTIN
D: No, that's fine, but can we get this show on the road?
E: O.S.
C: MINI
D: Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
S: INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Martin turns the light off next to the bed. A little bit of light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the blinds. After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in a bra and panties. Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed, letting her hair fall over her face. Martin tries to pull her hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully shaking her head "no". She reaches down and touches him through the sheet. He looks up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down. He reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet.
C: INI
D: What did you have in mind tonight?
C: MARTIN
D: The deluxe.
C: MINI
D: Oh, so you want complete access?
C: MARTIN
D: Y...yes.
E: voice quivering
C: MINI
D: You do know that's extra?
N: He nods.
C: MINI
D: Just so we're clear...Now, close your eyes.
N: Martin furrows his brow, disappointed.
C: MINI
D: Come on.
N: He obeys.
C: MINI
D: Now just keep them shut for a while.
N: Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her. She starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply. She looks up at his expectant face, intoxicated with her power. Her mouth starts to move down his chest. Martin lets out a small, almost self-conscious gasp.
T: FADE OUT:
S: INT. THE ROOM - LATER.
N: It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets, post coitus in the "spoons" position. Martin has a dreamy, satisfied look on his face. Mini smiles to herself.
C: MINI
D: I can't believe I pulled that off. Keeping my face hidden actually wasn't that hard, and he pretty much let me do whatever I wanted.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini is getting dressed.
C: MINI
D: And you know what?...He was damn good. I don't why Mom is throwing the cat all over town, when she can have this every night.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: The room still dark, Mini emerges from the bathroom, dressed.
C: MARTIN I...
D: that was...you were really good.
E: searching
C: MINI
D: Thanks, Sugar.
E: southern accent
C: MARTIN
D: I'd like to see you again, but...uh...I never got your name?
N: Even in the dark, he looks a little embarrassed. Mini smiles.
C: MINI
D: Ginger.
C: MARTIN
D: Ginger, I won't forget.
S: INT/EXT. UPPER LEVEL OF THE BUILDING'S PARKING GARAGE-
N: LATER. Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement.
C: MINI
D: I literally couldn't feel the ground under my feet. A first to top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him one day, but I wanted to savor it for a while.
E: V.O.
N: She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly, she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.
C: MARTIN
D: Ginger! You forgot your...
E: O.S.
N: Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting in.
C: MARTIN
D: ...Jacket.
N: Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant smile to spread across her mouth.
C: MINI
D: Here's to immediate gratification.
E: V.O.
N: Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth.
C: MINI
D: You were great.
E: whispering
N: Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the street below. MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It appears to be about a three or four story drop. He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the railing.
C: MINI
D: Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take.
N: Martin looks down at the street for another moment.
C: MINI
D: God, what a drama queen. Don't let this little act fool you. He'd never let mom get all his money.
E: V.O.
N: He glances back at her, looking tortured.
C: MINI
D: This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate suicide! artin backs away from the railing.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Now that's thinking outside the box.
E: V.O.
S: INT. AN ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - LATER.
N: Martin and Mini sit at a booth. Martin stirs his coffee looking shell shocked. Mini devours a plate of Belgian waffles covered with whipped cream.
C: MINI
D: We spent the next few hours just sitting there. I don't think we said three words. I think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the sweetest nights I ever spent with a guy.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. VENTURA BLVD- JUST BEFORE DAWN.
N: Mini drives home with the top down.
C: MINI
D: He told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again. I told him that was fine.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Mini sits at the table eating cereal. Martin enters, looking a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance.
C: MINI
D: Suddenly, he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework.
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math problems?
C: MINI
D: Kiddo?
E: V.O.
N: Mini looks up at him, raising her eyebrows.
C: MARTIN
D: I'd be happy to help you with it, if you need.
C: MINI
D: Actually, I'm thinking about starting a 401K plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund?
N: Martin looks down uncomfortably.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well. Martin looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly blitzed, checks his watch and stands up. NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Mini lies in bed under the covers, reading. The door to her room opens. She looks at the clock. It reads: 12:15am. Martin enters.
C: MINI
D: It took exactly one week.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under the covers.
C: MINI
D: In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini and Martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed- over glass shower door.
C: MINI
D: At first, we were very discreet, only doing it when Joan Crawford wasn't home or was completely comatose.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they both stare at the ceiling. Martin looks over at her and they share a conspiratorial smile.
C: MINI
D: Then we got bolder, doing it before she would pass out. I think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING
N: Mini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that leads to Mini's bedroom. Diane is watching TV with a martini glass in her hand.
C: MINI
D: One night we did it before "Entertainment Tonight" ended.
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: Them under the covers, but this time the lights in her room are on. M
C: MINI
D: We even almost got caught.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Mini?
E: O.S.
N: Mini and Martin stop at the sound of her voice, they look at each other, realizing Diane's right outside.
C: MINI
D: Yeah?
E: startled
N: Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the covers. Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils. She appears truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even noticed someone else in the bed.
C: MINI
D: God, I've told you a thousand times to knock.
C: DIANE
D: Have you seen Martin? I think he was in his study a half hour ago.
C: MINI
D: Uh...can't say that I have.
C: DIANE
D: Well, I assume he's gone out, so I've invited Ricardo over for a...cocktail. You know how children make him uneasy, so I'd appreciate if you and... ...your friend could either stay in here or use the back door when he arrives.
E: pointing to Martin under the sheet
N: For a moment, Mini can't believe her mother appears to have no problem with there being a man in her bed.
C: MINI
D: Oh...sure, no problem.
N: Diane shuts the door.
C: MINI
D: Okay, she's gone.
N: Martin pokes his head out of the covers. The two of them share a smile, not believing their luck. They start to laugh and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume where they left off.
C: MINI
D: Looking back, that may have been the moment we fell in love.
E: V.O.
S: INT. A WOMEN'S CLOTHING STORE IN A SHOPPING MALL - DAY
N: Mini tries on a cocktail dress, as Martin looks on, giving his approval.
C: MINI
D: We became inseparable.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE TANNEN'S POOL - DAY
N: Mini sits at the pool side table, as Martin helps her with her homework. M
C: MINI
D: Mom thought it was cute how we had suddenly grown so close, and thought it was wonderful how Martin had taken an interest in my education.
E: V.O.
N: From inside the house, Diane is seen lighting a cigarette, looking out at them and smiling. CLOSE ON HER HOMEWORK: Mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which indicates how well endowed he is. She jots down an arrow next to the words "actual size". Martin blushes, averting his eyes.
S: EXT. THE OUTDOOR PATIO AT IL CIELO RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight, as A WAITER refreshes their wine.
C: MINI
D: Now that we were spending time together, I actually started to find out what Martin was like for the first time.
E: V.O.
N: Martin tells her something and they both crack up.
C: MINI
D: He wasn't the drip I thought he was.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. VENICE BEACH - SUNSET
N: The two walk hand in hand, stopping to watch the drum rhythm circle filled with LOCAL PERCUSSIONISTS and ON LOOKERS moving to the throbbing beat.
C: MINI
D: He was funny, charming, sweet and even a little shy.
E: V.O.
N: Mini jumps into the circle, dancing along with the other revelers. Martin is content to watch, until she runs to the edge of the circle and pulls him in. Reluctantly, he begins to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself.
S: EXT. OCEAN AVENUE- SANTA MONICA- EARLY EVENING.
N: Mini and Martin walk close together, but not the way couples do.
C: MINI
D: Being seen in public was no sweat, as long as we didn't act like a couple.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
N: Martin's Mercedes snakes through an "s" curve, as the lights of the city twinkle in the background.
C: MINI
D: This went on for two months, before we had the talk we both knew was coming.
E: V.O.
N: The car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook areas with a view of the city.
S: INT. THE MERCEDES - CONTINUOUS
N: Martin pulls up the parking break and turns to her.
C: MARTIN
D: So...
C: MINI
D: So.
C: MARTIN
D: I don't want to have to sneak around in my own house.
C: MINI
D: Well, I don't think telling her is such a hot idea.
C: MARTIN
D: I mean, I don't want to live under the same roof with her.
N: CLOSE ON: A FEW RAIN DROPS HITTING THE ROOF OF THE CAR.
C: MINI
D: You can't leave, she'll get half.
N: Martin exhales, knowing she's right.
C: MINI
D: Can I ask how the hell you married her without a pre-nup? Her?
C: MARTIN
D: She wasn't as bad an actress as you think.
E: sighing
C: MINI
D: Well, there is another option.
N: THE RAIN PICKS UP, PLINK, PLUNKING ON THE ROOF.
C: MARTIN
D: There is?
N: Her eyes harden as she looks out at the city.
C: MINI
D: But it will take some planning... and some resolve.
N: Martin's eyes suddenly widen.
C: MARTIN
D: Wait, you don't mean-
C: MINI
D: Kill her?
N: She lets the word linger, as the rain beats down steadily.
C: MINI
D: No, of course not, she is my mother.
C: MARTIN
D: Good...
C: MINI
D: But I've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill-
C: MARTIN
D: Ill?
C: MINI
D: Unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs.
N: Martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right. Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips. M
C: ARTIN
D: It would be for her own good.
C: MINI
D: The only truly caring action we could take.
C: MARTIN
D: As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife.
C: MINI
D: You did it for the well being of your daughter. The selfless act of a devoted parent.
N: The sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips.
C: MARTIN
D: Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented.
N: She responds in kind, tilting her head.
C: MINI
D: And corroborated by friends and people outside the family.
C: MARTIN
D: A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt.
C: MINI
D: No, that would be useful.
N: Their lips are now almost touching.
C: MARTIN
D: And we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country.
C: MINI
D: With lots of fresh air.
C: MARTIN
D: It will be a much better life for her.
C: MINI
D: Much.
N: Unable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each other's clothes.
S: EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: The car rocks gently back and forth in the rain, as another car whizzes by, spray flying up behind it as it disappears around a curve.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Mini wakes up with a look of pure joy, ready to face the world.
C: MINI
D: I awoke the next morning, as excited as I could remember. Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this would take determination...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THEIR BACKYARD- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini swims on her back in the pool, a lit cigarette dangling between her lips.
C: MINI
D: Stamina...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Mini and Martin sit together, eating breakfast.
C: MINI
D: And imagination.
E: V.O.
N: Diane storms through the living room in the background, passing out of sight, behind the door frame.
C: MINI
D: I decided to start simply.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
C: MINI
D: Part one, violent mood swings- slash-uncontrollable rages.
E: V.O.
N: Cushions from the living room couch fly past the door frame.
C: DIANE
D: Fucking shit! Where are they?
N: Mini stirs her coffee innocently. Diane again can be seen through the door, this time throwing magazines and papers off the coffee table.
C: DIANE
D: I'm gonna be late! It took me three weeks to get an appointment with Anton...
C: MINI
D: Anton Michelle, masseuse to the stars and reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town. Rumor has it, he's pouring the pork to every rich wife between Malibu and Pasadena. He must be incredible if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this early.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: ...and now I'm gonna miss it because I can't find my fucking car keys?!
N: Martin and Mini exchange a smirk. She turns towards them, eyes ablaze.
C: DIANE
D: I could use a little help in here!
N: Martin looks up from his morning paper as cheerful as can be.
C: MARTIN
D: Coming, honey.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini and Martin walk in to see Diane on all fours, looking under one of the sofas. Her panties are blatantly visible from under her mini-skirt. Mini and Martin exchange a smirk.
C: MARTIN
D: Diane, sugar, do you remember where you put them when you came home last night?
C: DIANE
D: Yeah, in the fucking bowl by the fucking door where I always fucking put them!
C: MINI
D: Well, uh, you were kinda out of it last night.
C: DIANE
D: No, I wasn't! I had one drink with Marie, one!
C: MARTIN
D: Uh, are you sure? You did seem a bit tipsy.
C: DIANE
D: Yes, I'm sure, you dickless wonder. iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a desk near the front door.
C: MINI
D: Now don't you listen to her, you are not a dickless wonder.
E: under her breath
N: Martin tries not to let on how much he's enjoying this. Completely frustrated, Diane stops looking and heads for the "key" bowl by the door.
C: DIANE
D: Mini, I'm taking your car. Martin, take her to school.
N: Diane grabs a set of keys.
C: MARTIN
D: Diane, I have a meeting with Chapman, he's our biggest client--
C: DIANE
D: Tell him it's an emergency.
E: opening the door
N: She slams the door behind her. Mini looks at Martin with a sly grin then removes a cell phone from her pocket and dials a number. As she waits for an answer, she twirls DIANE'S KEY RING around her finger.
C: MINI
D: Now, here comes the really fun part. I realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit I could do a passable job imitating...
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Hello, Anton? It's Diane Tannen, I know it's late notice, but I'm going to have to cancel our appointment. What? No, of course, I realize I'll still have to pay...yes, something came up.
E: mimicking Diane
S: INT. THE "OFFICE" OF ANTON MICHELLE - LATER.
N: ANTON MICHELLE, 30, the very muscular "it boy" masseuse is furiously fucking JEANETTE LANG, a similarly hyper- aerobicized wife, on his massage table. He's bent her over the table and is taking her from behind when, suddenly, the door flies open. They both look up to see...DIANE with a stunned expression.
C: DIANE
D: Anton? But...Jeanette?
C: JEANETTE
D: Uh...hi, Diane?
C: ANTON
D: But, Mrs. Tannen, you call and cancel zee session thirty meenutes ago? D
E: french accent
C: IANE
D: What? No, I didn't!
C: ANTON
D: Yes, I spoke to you myself, you say sometheeng come up.
N: Diane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing.
C: DIANE
D: Jeanette, you knew I had an appointment today, did you pretend-
C: JEANETTE
D: No, I, I ...Anton called me and told me he had a cancellation.
E: flustered
C: ANTON
D: Yes, I call her after you call me.
N: Jeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around herself.
C: DIANE
D: Why, you sneaky little bitch!
N: Suddenly, Diane LUNGES for Jeanette, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her off the table. Jeannette shrieks as Anton struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: Diane sits at the table with her arm in a sling. Martin cuts her meat for her, as Mini pours her some red wine.
C: MINI
D: Needless to say, word of the L'incidént de Anton spread quickly through the community.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Do you think she'll press charges?
C: DIANE
D: Are you kidding? She should get twenty to life! When I told Margo and Penny about her little stunt, they both said they'd have ripped her eyes out. She'll be lucky if anyone speaks to her again.
N: Martin holds up a forkful of food.
C: MARTIN
D: Here comes the choo-choo.
N: Diane grabs the fork with her good hand.
C: DIANE
D: For god's sake, I didn't break both hands.
C: MINI
D: Jeez, I still can't believe you broke your hand on her face? It's so Linda Hamilton.
C: DIANE
D: I hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed.
E: slugging some wine

C: MINI
D: Phase two: wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state.
E: V.O.
N: FIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF BOUQUETS and ARRANGEMENTS line the driveway. Mini stands outside next to Carlos, sucking on a lollipop.
C: MINI
D: Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers.
C: CARLOS
D: Your mother said you are having a big party!
C: MINI
D: I know, can you believe all this?
E: innocently
N: Just then, Diane's Jaguar pulls into the driveway. She looks at the trucks, her expression souring. She stops the car and flies out.
C: DIANE
D: Carlos, what the hell is going on?
C: CARLOS
D: Senora Tannen, the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party?
C: DIANE
D: Ordered, I didn't order anything?! Who told you to bring these here?

E: MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) CARLOS(CONT'D) You were very excited, saying you were going to have the most wonderful party and invite everyone you knew and it had to be just perfect. Perfect, that's what you said. M
C: INI
D: Mom, is that what you were talking about yesterday?
C: DIANE
D: What?!
C: MINI
D: Well, it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine. You mumbled something about a party before you took a nap.
C: DIANE
D: No, I did not!
C: MINI
D: Mom, you did. The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol.
E: wincing
C: DIANE
D: But, but...I only slept for--
C: MINI
D: I am so sorry. Listen, we'll pay, don't worry.
E: to Carlos
N: Mini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes pulls up. Diane turns around to see his car and a look of dread strikes her.
C: DIANE
D: Oh, god.
C: MINI
D: Right on cue. Let's see how convincing he is.
E: V.O.
N: Martin gets out of the car, surveying the damage. A look of pure indignant outrage overcomes him and it's impossible to tell this is an act.
C: MARTIN
D: What is going on?! Carlos, what the fuck are all these flowers doing here?!
C: MINI
D: Oooh, now I see why he makes the big bucks.
E: V.O.

E: V.O.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: A strung out Diane sits on the couch, smoking and nursing a Vodka tonic. THE DOORBELL rings and Diane reacts like a dog in a thunderstorm, a jolt of fear coursing through her body.
C: MINI
D: Talk about easy. After a week of my version of the home shopping network, the doorbell might as well have been a canon.
E: V.O.
N: Diane gets up and walks unsteadily towards the front door.
S: INT. A CLASS ROOM AT MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: Mini and Kayla sit in a history class, looking dreamily at their teacher, WARREN BISHOP, 25, an earnest young preppy in the middle of a lecture.

C: BISHOP
D: As we see from a closer examination of the facts, Abraham Lincoln's decision to...
N: Bishop's voice fades out as he continues to speak.

E: V.O.
N: She takes a long slug.
S: INT. THE NURSE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C: MINI
D: Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store.
E: V.O.
N: Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label. CLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating "RITALIN" and the dosage. Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptführer enters.
C: MINI
D: Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and the lazy parents willing to let "Der Führer" keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
N: Mini stands at the counter, making her mom A MARGARITA. She's cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender.
C: MINI
D: My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more.
E: V.O.
N: She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender and puts the lid on.
C: MINI
D: Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick-me-up.
E: V.O.
N: She turns on the blender.
S: INT. DIANE'S DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Diane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry.
C: DIANE
D: Mini! I asked you for that drink ten minutes ago!
E: annoyed
N: Mini walks in, carrying the margarita.
C: IANE
D: Put it on the counter.
C: MINI
D: You're welcome.
N: Diane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita.
C: DIANE
D: Mmm...this is really good. What's in it, Sweetie?
C: MINI
D: The first time in my life she calls me "sweetie" and I've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Oh, this and that.
S: INT. A POSH PARTY IN THE HILLS - NIGHT
N: The party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN.
C: DIANE
D: My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face...
N: The two women recoil.
C: DIANE
D: ...was the best thing that ever happened to me.
C: MINI
D: Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, I would've let him stick his javelin in me any day.
N: Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS. HUSBAND #1 So I looked each and every juror in the eye-
C: DIANE
D: I want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries?
E: spinning around
N: HUSBAND #1 Uh...
C: DIANE
D: I'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of "Bikini Girl" and my line was "I'll have another," it was with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it. he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance.
N: HUSBAND #2 Uh, I think I could use a refill. HUSBAND #1 Me too, (to Diane) please, excuse us. They head towards the bar and Diane follows. The two women she turned away from shake their heads at the spectacle.
C: DIANE
D: But, but we were talking about juries and Isaac and, and that drag queen I broke my face on and..
N: The two men try to ignore her, but she keeps following them. She finally realizes they aren't stopping. She grabs the first man by the shoulder, pissed.
C: DIANE
D: Hey! COCKBREATH!
N: The party stops. Everyone is staring at Diane as the music continues to play. She looks around the room at the disapproving eyes, panic setting in.
S: EXT. THE HOUSE OF THE PARTY - LATER.
N: Diane is led away by Martin and Mini, as other partygoers watch the sad scene. They both struggle to keep Diane from stumbling.
C: DIANE
D: ...And then I told him that I had been an extra on Hello Larry and Mike Farrell had tried to--
E: slurring
C: MINI
D: MacLean Stevenson.
C: DIANE
D: What?
C: MINI
D: MacLean Stevenson played "Larry."
C: DIANE
D: Right, that's what I said...and then MacKenzie Phillips tried to slip me the tongue!
S: INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM - LATER.
N: Diane lies passed out on the bed as Mini and Martin watch her sleep.
C: MARTIN
D: Listen, great job, but you need to give me more warning. I was at dinner with Chapman, and it's the second time I've had to re- schedule.
C: MINI
D: I'm sorry, but it was a golden opportunity. You always said you can't pay enough for good publicity.
S: INT. A HARDWARE STORE - DAY
N: Mini and Martin peruse the aisles.
C: MINI
D: At this point, with all those witnesses, Martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away. hey stop in front of a wall of tools: hand axes, hammers and saws. Mini selects a large hand axe.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: My feeling was that until they were ready to weld the door to her padded cell shut...
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini picking out two black ski masks, two pairs of black goggles and two black sweatsuits.
C: MINI
D: ...there was more work to be done.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE SHERMAN OAKS GALLERIA - DAY
N: Diane walks through the mall aimlessly. She wears a wrinkled, mis-buttoned pink blouse. Her eyes are hollow, her cheeks sunken. A few SHOPPERS throw her a concerned glance as they pass.
C: MINI
D: Final phase: Complete psychotic breakdown.
E: V.O.
N: MINI, disguised in a hat and sunglasses, leans on the railing from the next level up, watching her mother.
S: INT. THE FOOD COURT OF THE MALL - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini slides into a table next to TWO SKATEPUNKS.
C: MINI
D: Hey, boys.
N: The two guys exchange a glance. Cute girls like Mini clearly don't "hey, boys" them.
C: MINI
D: Wanna have a little fun?
S: INT. THE DISPLAY WINDOW OF A STORE - CONTINUOUS
N: Diane looks at some clothes. RING! Her cell phone goes off and she answers it.
C: DIANE
D: Hello?
C: MALE VOICE
D: Diane?
E: V.O. breathy, threatening
C: DIANE
D: Yes?
N: The breathing increases, getting deeper and more menacing.
C: DIANE
D: Hello?...What do you want?
C: MALE VOICE
D: I can see you? Can you see me?
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Who is this?
E: alarmed
C: MALE VOICE
D: Do you feel safe?
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Who is this?
E: looking around
C: MALE VOICE
D: You didn't answer the question.
E: V.O.
N: Mini and the two skatepunks giggle with glee at the terror they're inflicting. She looks around, scanning THE MALL. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. D
C: IANE
D: This isn't funny. I'm hanging up.
C: MALE VOICE
D: I wouldn't do that.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: If this is some kind of joke...
C: MALE VOICE
D: I assure you, I'm no joke. May I say that pink blouse is very fetching.
E: V.O.
N: Panicked, she heads for an exit. A FEW SHOPPERS look at her with concern.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Diane, your car is the other way. Now answer my question. Do you feel safe?
E: V.O. menacing
N: A whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around.
C: DIANE
D: I'm hanging up.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Hang up and you're dead.
E: V.O. very calm
C: DIANE
D: Why are you doing this?
E: falling apart
C: MALE VOICE
D: Can you see me?
E: V.O.
N: She scans the crowd frantically, then starts walking towards a VICTORIA'S SECRET STORE for help.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Pick me out something sexy.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Leave me alone!
C: MALE VOICE
D: But I'm so close to you...
E: V.O. very calm
N: She stops, frozen in fear. Just then, the second SKATEPUNK comes up behind her, brushing into her. She jerks away from him.
C: DIANE
D: Get away!!!
E: screeching
N: EVERY SHOPPER within ear shot turns around, including TWO SECURITY GUARDS. SKATEPUNK #2 Take it easy, lady, what the hell's your problem? The skatepunk walks away. MINI and THE FIRST SKATEPUNK watch with amusement from an upper level as A SECURITY GUARD moves towards her.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Peek a boo...I'm coming for you...but that guard can't help you. Maybe you should make a run for that Gold Jag you drive home to Mira Loma Lane.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: How do you know where I live?
E: whimpering
C: MALE VOICE
D: I know everything about you.
E: O.S.
C: DIANE
D: No!
N: DIFFERENT MALE VOICE (O.S.) Maam? Diane spins around to find TWO SECURITY GUARDS standing behind her. ECURITY GUARD #1 I'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall. We'll walk you to your car.
C: DIANE
D: No! I can't leave, he knows where I live!
N: SECURITY GUARD #1 Maam, you're going to have to leave.
C: DIANE
D: Did you hear me?! He knows where I live!
N: SECURITY GUARD #1 Who knows? She hands him the phone.
C: DIANE
D: Him!
N: The security guard puts the phone to his ear. The BEEPING sound of a hang up is heard. He nods to his partner, as he removes a walkie talkie. SECURITY GUARD #1 (into walkie talkie) Yeah, this is Franklin, we've got a code 7, get an EMS unit over here. The two guards grab her. She drops the phone and starts scratching at one guard's face. The other pepper sprays her, as she falls down, howling.
C: DIANE
D: What are you doing?!
N: SECURITY GUARD #1 Sorry, Maam, this is for your own protection. RING! The phone is like a jolt of electricity through her body. Diane kicks and punches at the guards.
C: DIANE
D: It's him! Answer it! Answer it! He said he was gonna kill me!
N: The guards finally tackle her, getting handcuffs on.
C: DIANE
D: He, he knows where I live!
N: THE OTHER SHOPPERS watch for a moment and lose interest, writing her off as just another LA kook. MINI watches from the upper level, quite satisfied.
S: INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.
N: Diane lies in bed, half awake, watching TV. A scotch and soda rests in her hand.
C: MINI
D: After her performance at the mall, I'm sure she would have qualified as "committable". But that wasn't enough, I wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away.
E: V.O.
N: Mini pokes her head in the door of the room.
C: INI
D: Mom, we're going to get some dinner. Do you want us to bring you back something?
C: DIANE
D: You're leaving? Both of you?
C: MINI
D: For the last three days she hasn't left the house.
E: O.S.
C: DIANE
D: Why don't we just order in?
C: MINI
D: Mom, we can't stay in here forever. Do you want to come with us?
N: Diane considers the question by looking at her face in the bed side mirror. It's still puffy and blotchy from the pepper spray.
C: MINI
D: Mom?
N: She looks up at Mini.
C: MINI
D: Ah...vanity, the most predictable of sins.
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: I...can't. You two go.
C: MINI
D: Okay.
S: EXT. THE BACKYARD - LATER.
N: It is dark and quiet, as the evening dew rises on the lawn.
S: INT. MARTIN AND DIANE'S BEDROOM - LATER.
N: Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS, waking her up. She stares at it for a moment, trying to decide if she should answer it. On the forth ring, she answers.
C: DIANE
D: Hello?
N: A DIAL TONE rings in her ear. She hangs up the phone. A second later it RINGS again. She waits two rings and then answers. Again a DIAL TONE. Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the phone, waiting... PLINK! Something small hits the window across the room. Startled, she turns her head towards it. DIANE'S POV: Through the window, in the distance by the hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and goggles. In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming, sharp kitchen knife. She can't believe her eyes. HER POV: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up, indicating that he's going to cut her throat. Eyes wild with panic, Diane picks up the phone and dials 911. The phone dials and she waits.
C: IANE
D: Please, please, oh god.
N: She looks back out the window: THE HOODED FIGURE walks out of the bushes and heads towards the house.
C: RECORDED VOICE
D: You have reached 911, if this is an emergency, please remain on the line...
E: V.O.
C: DIANE
D: Oh god, oh god!
N: Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of the room, leaving the phone off the hook.
S: INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps down to the living room. She goes straight for the phone on the end table next to the couch. She picks it up.
C: RECORDED VOICE
D: Please continue to hold, your call will be answered...
E: V.O.
N: She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one holds a HAND AXE. She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises the axe slowly.
C: DIANE
D: No...no...help! Help!
N: She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room.
S: INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS
N: Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife appears in the door frame.
C: DIANE
D: Oh, God! Help! Someone!
N: Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles.
C: DIANE
D: No, please, no.
E: softly 
N: She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure violently tugs at the handle.
C: IANE
D: Help! Someone please, help me!
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out the peep hole. PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear. She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on. THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good. She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE WIELDING FIGURE. It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her. She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears.
C: DIANE
D: Please God, please God...please!
N: She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen. Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door.
S: INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her. iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs. CLOSE ON: A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle.
C: MINI
D: Our work finished...
E: V.O.
S: INT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER.

C: MINI
D: We rewarded ourselves on a job well done...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
N: Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom.
C: MINI
D: And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Mom, we're home!
C: MARTIN
D: Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate!
N: They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed. Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there.
C: MARTIN
D: Honey? You okay?...Honey?
C: MINI
D: Mom?
N: Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try to wake her up.
C: MARTIN
D: Diane, it's us, wake up.
N: Mini slaps her hard across the face.
C: MINI
D: Wake up, Mommy.
E: feigning concern
C: MARTIN
D: Mini.
C: MINI
D: Killjoy.
N: Martin lightly taps Diane's cheeks.
C: MARTIN
D: Diane, come on, come on.
N: Mini looks up at the counter. AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink.
C: MINI
D: Martin... e looks up and immediately sees the bottle.
C: MINI
D: I picked that prescription up three days ago. It was probably more than half full.
N: The two of them look at each other, studying each other's reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make the first move.
C: MINI
D: I suppose we should call an ambulance?
E: eerily calm
N: The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's wrist again.
C: MARTIN
D: Her pulse is almost gone.
C: MINI
D: Do you really think they can save her?
C: MARTIN
D: I...I don't know.
C: MINI
D: She'll only try it again. You know she will.
C: MARTIN
D: She will if we keep this torture up.
N: Martin looks down at Diane.
C: MARTIN
D: This is wrong, call an ambulance.
E: suddenly with resolve
C: MINI
D: Hold on, who are we to say her choice was wrong? She put those pills in her mouth.
C: MARTIN
D: Mini--
C: MINI
D: Don't "Mini" me, you've been bankrolling my little project from day one.
C: MARTIN
D: We both agreed murder was out.
C: MINI
D: I'd hardly call it murder, if anything, we're just helping to fulfill her last wish.
C: MARTIN
D: She wouldn't have taken the pills if we hadn't- Mini, for gods sake, she still has a pulse.
E: urgently
C: MINI
D: So do people in comas. It's just a matter of time-
C: MARTIN
D: Mini, we-
C: MINI
D: Look, you can drop the indignant outrage, because if you really cared, you'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now.
N: She's got him and he knows it.
C: MINI
D: Can't we just admit how lucky we are? It's the perfect alibi, she put the drugs in her system.
E: softening
C: MARTIN
D: What? Just leave her here?
C: MINI
D: Exactly.
C: MARTIN
D: I don't know.
C: MINI
D: Can you think of one person she knows who would say she's sane at this point? This is just the natural, sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life. artin ponders the choice.
C: MINI
D: We're this close from being free...let's just let nature take its course.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER.
N: Mini and Martin sit watching a game show called Absolutely Positive.
C: MINI
D: And so we passed the time watching my favorite show.
N: CLOSE ON THE TV: A YOUNG MALE GAME SHOW HOST comes out on stage to the applause of the audience.
C: HOST
D: Welcome to "Absolutely Positive!" The show where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure they're...
N: He puts a hand to his ear, encouraging the studio audience.
C: STUDIO AUDIENCE
D: Absolutely Positive!
C: HOST
D: That's right! We send them out on one last date with someone other than their fiance, so they can be sure they're really ready to make that lifelong commitment.
C: MINI
D: Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my birthday, produces it and it's so twisted, I'm surprised I didn't think of it.
E: V.O.
N: On the screen, the host introduces THE COUPLE, who nervously walk out to the studio applause.
C: MINI
D: Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiancés.
E: V.O.
N: Then the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of the couple. Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking than the engaged couple.
S: INT. THE BATHROOM - LATER.
N: Mini checks Diane's pulse.
C: MINI
D: And we waited some more.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER.
N: Martin sits on the couch. He looks up as Mini comes in from the bathroom, shaking her head "no", indicating she's not dead yet. NT. THE BATHROOM - LATER. Mini checks Diane's pulse again.
C: MINI
D: Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last act of free will...
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The 11 O'clock news is starting, as Mini impatiently looks towards the hallway leading to the bathroom.
C: MINI
D: Finally, it was time to do the only humane thing.
E: V.O.
N: Mini stands up.
C: MINI
D: Come on, let's go.
C: MARTIN
D: What?
C: MINI
D: It's time to speed this up.
C: MARTIN
D: Speed this up?
C: MINI
D: We can't wait anymore, our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour. We can say that after dinner we went to a movie, but if she hasn't croaked by midnight, you can forget about this.
N: Martin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the implications of "speed this up".
C: MARTIN
D: No, I'm sorry, this is going somewhere I'm not prepared to go.
C: MINI
D: Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in? I hate to break it to you, but wherever you "weren't prepared to go"...the hypocrite express just rolled into the station.
N: Martin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth of his actions.
C: MARTIN
D: What are you suggesting?
C: MINI
D: Well, I thought we'd disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons.
N: Martin recoils.
C: MINI
D: Kidding...God, you've lost your sense of humor. Don't worry, it'll be painless.
N: Martin takes a deep breath, considering his options.
S: INT. DIANE'S WALK IN CLOSET- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini goes through her mother's clothes, as Diane lies crumpled in a heap on the floor. Martin looks on impatiently.
C: MINI
D: To be honest, I think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this. And as my first assisted suicide, I was going to make it flawless. M
E: V.O.
C: ARTIN
D: Come on, we don't have time.
C: MINI
D: Look, if we're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven. The gas chamber? Martin, please, I can't explain everything.
E: off his confusion exasperated
N: Mini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length mirror.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front of her vanity mirror. Martin holds Diane's head still.
C: MARTIN
D: I don't think this is a good idea.
C: MINI
D: Have you lost your mind, "Mr. Public Relations"? What's the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out? "How did she look"? Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is "fabulous"?
E: waits for his answer
S: INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The door to the dark garage opens and Mini turns on a light. Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his shoulder, struggles through the doorway.
S: INT. DIANE'S JAGUAR- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini props Diane up in the driver's seat and begins touching up the make-up. She ties a silk scarf around Diane's neck, ever so elegantly. Satisfied, she turns the ignition key and lowers all the power windows in the car. She looks up at Martin.
C: MINI
D: Well, if you've got anything to say to her, now would be the time.
C: MARTIN
D: Could you just pretend to have a little remorse?
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini and Martin walk through the door to the garage and close it behind them. The hum of the car engine can he heard through the wall.
S: INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Diane sits in the driver's seat, as THE EXHAUST PIPE spews fumes into the sealed garage. XT. THE HOUSE - LATER. The garage door is open and Diane's body is visible on the garage floor as Martin and Mini kneel beside her. The wail of an ambulance siren is heard as it pulls up in front, cutting the engine. Mini comes running outside in tears.
C: MINI
D: Help us, please! My mom, I think she's dead!
S: INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
N: TWO PARAMEDICS try to revive Diane, having laid her out on the floor of the garage. Mini sobs hysterically, as Martin hugs her.
C: MINI
D: Mommy, wake up!
C: MARTIN
D: It's okay, sweetheart, everything's going to be okay.
C: FIRST PARAMEDIC
D: Mr. Tannen, I think you should take your daughter in the house.
C: MINI
D: Oh, please, don't let her die!
S: EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER.
N: Two POLICE CRUISERS are parked outside as Diane's body, now wrapped in a body bag, is being wheeled into the ambulance. A FEW "LOOKY LOOS" are standing at the gates to the house, interested to see what's happened.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER.
N: One of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in the background, as Martin continues to comfort Mini. A MAN, 30, with a slightly weary look, walks in the front door wearing an off-the-rack grey suit and barber shop haircut.
C: GARSON
D: Mr. Tannen?
N: Martin looks up.
C: MARTIN
D: Yes?
C: MAN
D: I'm Detective Bill Garson, LAPD.
C: MARTIN
D: Yes?
C: GARSON
D: I'm sorry to be here right now, but whenever there's an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to rule out homicide.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh...uh...right.
E: clearly surprised
C: GARSON
D: It's really just a formality.
C: MINI
D: My mother just killed herself! They haven't even taken her away yet! What's wrong with you?
E: exploding
C: ARTIN
D: Mini, please! He's just doing his job.
C: MINI
D: Tell him to leave! This is outrageous!
C: MARTIN
D: Could we do this another time?
E: to Garson
C: GARSON
D: Of course we--
C: MARTIN
D: Thank you.
N: Mini looks at Martin, relieved.
C: GARSON
D: But I do need to ask just a few simple questions before I go.
C: MINI
D: Didn't you hear him?! He said--
C: MARTIN
D: Mini, it's okay...just go lie down for a moment.
E: sharply
S: INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Martin stands in the garage with Garson, going over what happened.
C: MARTIN
D: So after dinner and the movie, we came home at around 11:30 and found her in the garage. I turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust.
C: GARSON
D: What about trying to revive your wife?
N: Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question.
C: MARTIN
D: Of course, we did that too, but I couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but... it didn't work.
E: taking a breath
C: GARSON
D: So your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call?
C: MARTIN
D: Yes.
C: GARSON
D: May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state?
C: MARTIN
D: We never thought she'd do anything like...this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It's been a very stressful time.
C: GARSON
D: Of course. So this was your wife's car?
C: MARTIN
D: Yes.
C: GARSON
D: Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in?
C: MARTIN
D: What?
C: GARSON
D: Was it in the garage when you left?
C: MARTIN
D: Is, is that important?
E: a little flustered
C: ARSON
D: Just trying to reconstruct what happened.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage.
C: GARSON
D: And no one drove it during those three days?
C: MARTIN
D: No, Mini and I have our own cars.
C: GARSON
D: We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab.
C: MARTIN
D: Crime lab? Oh, okay.
C: GARSON
D: Again, purely routine.
C: MARTIN
D: Sure.
C: GARSON
D: Have you found a note yet?
C: MARTIN
D: I'm sorry?
E: confused
N: Garson's eyes flicker for a split second.
C: GARSON
D: A suicide note? The deceased usually leaves one.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh...right, no...not yet. But we haven't really looked.
C: GARSON
D: Mind if I take a look around?
N: Martin hesitates for just a split second.
C: MARTIN
D: No...of course not.
S: INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini and Martin whisper together.
C: MINI
D: Who cares if we didn't leave a note? Just relax.
C: MARTIN
D: But they said it's--
C: MINI
D: So what? He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh, shit!
E: remembering something
C: MINI
D: What?
C: MARTIN
D: The sweatsuits and goggles.
C: MINI
D: I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans.
C: MARTIN
D: Good.
E: exhaling
C: MINI
D: Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we're free.
S: EXT. THE LAS HADAS RESORT- MANZANILLO MEXICO - DAY
N: Martin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort.
C: MINI
D: After the funeral, I felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
N: artin tips the BELL HOP on the way out and the moment the door closes, Mini jumps into his arms.
C: MINI
D: Martin agreed and let me pick the place. I chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that's where Dudley Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE BEACH - DAY
N: Martin spreads sun tan lotion on Mini's back.
C: MINI
D: I figured sugar daddy/younger woman would be old news down there.
E: V.O.
N: A few other OLDER MAN/YOUNGER WOMAN couples lounge near them, mixed among more traditional pairings.
S: INT. AN OUTDOOR TIKI BAR/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
N: MARIACHIS play a sexy Mexican ballad as Mini, wearing a thin sundress, dances very close with Martin.
C: MINI
D: I could feel that Martin had let the whole thing with the cops go. It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT
N: Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare up at the stars. The gentle breaking of waves further adds to the tranquility of the evening.
C: MINI
D: You know, I've been thinking that I might enjoy working in your office this summer.
C: MARTIN
D: Really? Sure, if you want.
C: MINI
D: I want.
N: She moves to kiss him.
C: MALE VOICE
D: Martin, Mini? Is that you?
E: O.S.
N: Martin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate material.
C: MINI
D: I swear I thought Martin was going to wet himself.
E: V.O.
N: Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent father/daughter closeness.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you doing here? udell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter they were lying.
E: extremely tense
C: RUDELL
D: Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little R&R, and I suddenly realized I hadn't taken a vacation in god knows when. Jennifer, this is my neighbor Martin Tannen and his daughter, Mini.
N: Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She looks equally uncomfortable.
C: MINI
D: I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met? You look so familiar.
N: Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.
C: JENNIFER
D: I don't think so.
C: MINI
D: And the icing is that Jennifer works for the same escort service that I did. Now this is rich.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: I wanted you both to know how sorry I am for your loss.
C: MINI
D: Our loss? He just lost six or seven freebies a year.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: If there's anything I can do... for either of you...
E: to Mini
C: MINI
D: Yikes, now that Mom's out of the way, I guess I'm fair game.
E: V.O.
C: MIKE
D: ...don't hesitate to ask. Remember I'm just right across the fence.
N: The meaning is not lost on Martin.
C: MARTIN
D: Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it.
E: measured
S: INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
N: Martin paces back and forth as Mini sits on the bed. His neck muscles bulge with frustration.
C: MARTIN
D: Why did you tell him?!
C: MINI
D: I was just being friendly, I had no idea he'd decide to come here.
C: MARTIN
D: He knows. He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows!
C: MINI
D: I doubt he even knows where his trash cans are.
E: MORE
C: CONTINUED: MINI
D: You're overreacting. It's just coincidence.
E: CONT'D
C: MARTIN
D: Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us together.
C: MINI
D: It was dark, I sat up before he saw anything. M
C: ARTIN
D: No, he knows. It was like he was toying with us.
C: MINI
D: Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home and tell everyone we're a couple? We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers.
N: Martin stops and looks at her, surprised.
C: MINI
D: Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward?
N: His face turns a little red.
C: MINI
D: I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration.
N: Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed.
C: MARTIN
D: You realize he could blackmail us? If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine.
C: MINI
D: Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen.
N: Her words don't appear to have calmed him.
S: EXT. THE POOL - DAY
N: Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini.
C: MINI
D: The next few days were a laugh riot.
E: V.O.
N: Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously. Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth. He instinctively pulls back.
C: MINI
D: Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father.
E: V.O.
N: Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes M channels. Mini looks very annoyed.
C: MINI
D: We returned home and things didn't get much better.
E: V.O.
N: MONTAGE: Mini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror: -Catholic School girl.
C: MINI
D: What little sex we were having was getting dull.
E: V.O.
N: -Cheerleader.
C: MINI
D: Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed...
E: V.O.
N: -Naughty Nurse.
C: MINI
D: I was bored. I became concerned that in my world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first...
E: V.O.
N: -French Maid.
C: MINI
D: ...at too young an age.
E: V.O.
N: -Marilyn Monroe in the sequined dress she sang to JFK in.
C: MINI
D: "Happy birthday, Mr. President"
E: singing breathily
C: MINI
D: As for school, well, I was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death.
E: V.O.
N: THE DOOR BELL RINGS. Mini looks towards the hallway.
S: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well.
C: MINI
D: Uh oh.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Yes?
C: GARSON
D: Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I don't know if you remember me?
C: MINI
D: Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And "yes", I remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm.
C: GARSON
D: So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather?
E: ignoring her dig
C: MINI
D: Nice work, McGruff.
C: GARSON
D: Again, I am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible.
C: MINI
D: What do you want?
C: GARSON
D: I need to ask you a few more questions about your mother's death. M
C: INI
D: Sure, come on in.
S: INT. THEIR LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini leads him in.
C: MINI
D: I know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but I didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation? I could feel something tingle deep inside.
E: V.O.
N: Mini and Garson take a seat. Mini lights a cigarette. Garson looks over her outfit again.
C: GARSON
D: It's a little early for the prom, isn't it?
C: MINI
D: A girl can dream, can't she?
C: GARSON
D: Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report. Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust.
C: MINI
D: Is it that important?
C: GARSON
D: Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods. Her choices seemed, I don't know how to put it... improvisational.
C: MINI
D: Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her? She clearly put some thought into that outfit.
C: GARSON
D: Clearly...But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out.
C: MINI
D: I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them.
C: GARSON
D: I suppose you're right...Also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer.
C: MINI
D: Really?
C: GARSON
D: Any idea why she'd call 911?
C: MINI
D: Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing I've done in a while, but even I know when the rush isn't worth the risk.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Look, I think you should come back when my father's around. He'll be upset I let a stranger in the house. G
C: ARSON
D: I think you're safe with me.
C: MINI
D: Even so, he won't be happy.
C: GARSON
D: Not a problem, will he be home tonight?
S: INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Martin is on the phone.
C: MARTIN
D: And you let him in?!
S: EXT. THE POOL - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone, while sucking on a red popsicle.
C: MINI
D: I played it cool, it would've looked worse to be defensive.
N: Mini looks across the yard to see... MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are locked on hers.
C: MARTIN
D: Well, when's he coming over?
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Tonight?
C: MARTIN
D: Tonight!? I've got a dinner with Chapman. I've already cancelled-- Damn it! Why didn't you call me?!
E: V.O. frustrated
N: RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze, revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good shape for a man his age.
C: MINI
D: Hey, I didn't know you had plans!
E: annoyed
N: Mini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her bikini top.
C: MARTIN
D: Listen, I'll be home early so we can get the story straight.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Okay.
N: Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth.
S: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING
N: Martin and Mini sit across from Garson. Martin appears cool and relaxed, a scotch in his hand.
C: GARSON
D: I really appreciate you taking the time to help us out. There's just a few loose ends we want to tie up.
C: MARTIN
D: Absolutely. What would you like to know?
N: Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts leafing through papers.
C: ARSON
D: There appears to be some question as to the time of death. You said you went to dinner and a movie-
C: MARTIN
D: Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do I need my lawyer here? Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation.
C: GARSON
D: Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just finish this up, I've got real homicides that need attention. How about if I just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip?
C: MINI
D: That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad? I mean, let's just get this over with.
N: Martin looks at Mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second.
C: MARTIN
D: Fair enough.
C: GARSON
D: Terrific...now, the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system.
N: Mini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad.
C: MARTIN
D: I wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin.
C: GARSON
D: Neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it.
C: MARTIN
D: Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, I'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription.
C: GARSON
D: I know, but it's an odd drug to be taking. It's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them. But in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated.
C: MARTIN
D: Again, Detective, I really can't say why she was taking these drugs.
C: GARSON
D: Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you and your wife close?
C: MARTIN
D: No...we led, for the most part, separate lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini.
C: MINI
D: oh...sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit of the child. Excellent.
E: V.O.
C: GARSON
D: I see...
C: MARTIN
D: Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I don't see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely disturbed person. Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst?
C: GARSON
D: Yes, but what I'm still unclear about is her time of death.
C: MARTIN
D: Well, that makes two of us... Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening.
C: GARSON
D: After dinner you saw a movie that night?
E: looking at his notes
C: MARTIN
D: That's right.
C: MINI
D: Start time 9 o'clock.
E: V.O.
C: GARSON
D: What did you see?
C: MARTIN
D: That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore.
C: MINI
D: Running time 115 minutes.
E: V.O.
C: GARSON
D: Ahh...My buddy told me the end is crazy.
C: MINI
D: For god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it?
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Yeah, he slides down Washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him.
C: MINI
D: Dad...Don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet.
N: Martin turns to Mini, giving her a fatherly smile.
C: MARTIN
D: Another demerit...
N: Mini rolls her eyes at Garson.
C: GARSON
D: That's okay...Where did you see it?
C: MARTIN
D: The Galleria.
C: MINI
D: Drive time 17 minutes.
E: V.O.
C: GARSON
D: And you got home at?
C: MINI
D: Precisely...
E: V.O.
N: MARTIN
C: MINI
D: With 12 minutes of previews. You didn't think we'd forget the previews?
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night.
C: GARSON
D: No, that about wraps it up for now.
C: MARTIN
D: For now? Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up. We've told you everything we know. G
C: ARSON
D: I wish I could be more definitive.
C: MARTIN
D: Well, I'm telling you the next time you have a question, it had better be because you're charging us-
C: GARSON
D: Us?
N: Martin momentarily freezes.
C: MARTIN
D: I'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives.
C: GARSON
D: Thanks again for your time.
E: standing
S: EXT. THE POOL - LATER.
N: Mini sits in a chair as Martin paces.
C: MARTIN
D: What the hell was I thinking, letting you talk me into this?
C: MINI
D: It's probably just routine stuff.
C: MARTIN
D: That was not routine, my dear.
C: MINI
D: Nice use of the word "us", by the way.
C: MARTIN
D: Sorry, it just slipped out.
C: MINI
D: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that-
C: MARTIN
D: Okay.
E: sharply
C: MINI
D: Look, just chill, I'm sure this will blow over in a few days.
C: MARTIN
D: Chill?! Believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. You do understand they could go for the death penalty?
C: MINI
D: He's probably just trying to spook us.
C: MARTIN
D: Hello?! They don't try and spook you unless they think you did it!
C: MINI
D: It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't.
C: MARTIN
D: Well, if it was such a great plan, why am I cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide?
E: seething
N: Mini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside.
C: MINI
D: I'll see you later.
C: MARTIN
D: Where are you going?
C: MINI
D: Out.
S: INT. A DANCE CLUB IN EAGLE ROCK - NIGHT
N: The club is packed with YOUNG LATINO CLUBHOPPERS gyrating to the pulsating beat. Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively with a MUSCULAR YOUNG LATINO.
C: MINI
D: Would he follow?
E: V.O.
N: His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in ecstasy. As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room. MARTIN stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen.
C: MINI
D: Was there any question?
E: V.O.
N: Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not. Martin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her partner a deep, long kiss. MARTIN looks ill.
S: EXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAWN
N: Mini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking rumpled.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a bathrobe. He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee. Mini opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking a big slug.
C: MARTIN
D: A phone call would have been appreciated at some point. I was worried.
C: MINI
D: Worried that refugee from a J.Lo video rode me `til the tires fell off?
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're aware, but at this point you can't be my dad and my lover. Where I go and how late I stay out is my business.
C: MARTIN
D: I wasn't saying that as a dad. Before your mother and I...grew apart, I would worry if she was out late.
E: very sincere
C: MINI
D: Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her and I can assure you I won't end up passed out in some greaseball's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles... nless I choose to.
E: cold, smooth
C: MARTIN
D: What the hell's gotten into you? I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me? Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else.
C: MINI
D: I kind of have to admire this. He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists.
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Haven't you ever been in a relationship?
N: The questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost ashamed.
C: MARTIN
D: My god, you haven't.
N: She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up.
C: MINI
D: Congratulations... you're my first.
E: sniffling
N: He comes over and gives her a very sweet hug.
C: MARTIN
D: Oh, angel.
C: MINI
D: And I'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, "Free Tibet".
E: V.O.
S: INT. AN ELEVATOR - MORNING
N: Martin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS. His eyes look tired from staying up all night.
C: MINI
D: Fake tears aside...he actually was my first relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms.
E: V.O.
S: INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
N: He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: "BOYD, MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES".
C: MINI
D: And I was willing to give him the chance to be that person...
E: V.O.
N: He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is waiting with an envelope.
C: MINI
D: ...if he could just hold it together.
E: V.O.
C: MARTIN
D: Morning, Lois.
C: LOIS
D: Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for you.
N: She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office, sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy photo of: MINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO. The caption reads: "THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS".
C: MINI
D: That's when things started to get interesting.
E: V.O.
N: Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER, but no return address.
S: INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
N: Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell.
C: MARTIN
D: Lois, I need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting... I know...Tell him...tell him it's an unavoidable emergency.
E: listening
S: INT. SPEEDWAY COURIER - DAY
N: Martin stands at the front desk, talking to A CLERK.
C: MARTIN
D: What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are?
C: CLERK
D: When it's paid cash, we only keep records on packages, not envelopes.
S: EXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS
N: Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he answers it.
C: MARTIN
D: Yeah?
C: LOIS
D: Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr. Chapman...he told me to tell you that he's going to be seeking a new firm to handle his company's needs.
E: O.S.
N: Martin's jaw tightens.
C: MARTIN
D: Thank you, Lois.
N: Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT. Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control.
S: INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM AT MARTIN'S FIRM - LATER.
N: Martin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised and concerned.
C: MARTIN
D: Steve? Charlie? What, what are you doing in town? Why didn't you tell me you were coming--
C: ATHER
D: We just heard about Chapman...not that it matters.
C: BOYD
D: We can't afford to lose any more clients.
N: The color drains from Martin's face.
C: MARTIN
D: Jesus, guys, my wife just committed suicide...
C: MATHER
D: No one's saying this isn't a difficult time for you, but whatever's been distracting you started long before that.
C: BOYD
D: There's just no way to sugarcoat this...you're a liability we can't afford anymore...
N: Martin sits very still, his world crumbling around him.
C: MARTIN
D: Fifteen years...we've been--
C: MATHER
D: We'll be asking all our clients who they would prefer to stay with, and of course, you'll have an equal shot to make your case with them.
E: curtly
N: Martin continues to stare off into space, reeling.
S: INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
N: Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen. The veins in his neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead. Suddenly, he starts pounding on the steering wheel.
C: MARTIN
D: Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking shit!
N: Just then, he looks over to the next car. A three year old GIRL in the back seat holds up her "PO" TELETUBBY DOLL to show him. CLOSE ON: AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE- NIGHT. Through a BINOCULAR'S VIEWFINDER: Rudell is seen through the window talking on the phone, unaware he's being watched.
C: MARTIN
D: Look at that smug prick...He's fucking with me and I will not be fucked with.
E: O.S.
S: INT. THE KITCHEN OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martin and Mini stand in the dark kitchen, as Martin peers out the window through binoculars at RUDELL across the yard.
C: MINI
D: What are you gonna do?
N: Martin goes to a drawer and removes the LARGE KNIFE they bought at Williams Sonoma.
C: ARTIN
D: I'm gonna go over there and tell him to back off or he's gonna get hurt.
C: MINI
D: Are you crazy? We're not even positive it's him!
C: MARTIN
D: My god, the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office! He was the only person at the resort who knew who we were!
C: MINI
D: He could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him, then they'd really start investigating us. It's just one photo and you can't even really tell if it's me.
C: MARTIN
D: That son of bitch just cost me the firm I worked fifteen years to build.
C: MINI
D: Well, if you start waving that thing around, he's gonna cost you a lot more than that.
S: INT. THEIR BEDROOM - LATER.
N: Mini lies awake, looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and shifting in bed.
C: MINI
D: Martin didn't sleep at all that night and made damn well sure I didn't either.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Mini walks up the long driveway.
C: MINI
D: With Mommy Dearest out of the way, I decided to take the matter of Rudell into my own hands. I knew Martin wouldn't approve, but at this point...action had to be taken.
E: V.O.
N: She arrives at the front door and rings the bell.
C: MINI
D: I would catch him off guard, disorient him and then kill him...
E: V.O.
N: The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush bathrobe.
C: MINI
D: ...with kindness.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: Hi, Mr. Rudell, I'm sorry to bother you.
C: RUDELL
D: Not at all, as I said down in Mexico... anything for a neighbor.
E: slightly lascivious
C: MINI
D: May I come in?
S: INT. RUDELL'S IMPRESSIVE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Eighteen foot ceilings frame the room, garishly decorated with very modern, modular furniture. Rudell leads Mini in.
C: INI
D: Wow, I haven't been here since you redecorated.
C: RUDELL
D: It was just finished. I'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed.
C: MINI
D: I know she'd approve.
C: RUDELL
D: If you don't mind me asking, ...how are you doing?
C: MINI
D: It's been hard, but I guess I've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now.
C: RUDELL
D: You're absolutely-
C: MINI
D: Positive!?
N: Mini giggles, almost embarrassed.
C: RUDELL
D: Well, that too, but "correct" was the word I was thinking of. Do you like the show?
E: chuckling
C: MINI
D: Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together.
C: RUDELL
D: I could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant?
C: MINI
D: A contestant? Really?
C: RUDELL
D: Sure, those dates are really quite harmless. You just spend an evening with the person. We prep you on what to say before the show.
C: MINI
D: It sounds like fun.
N: Rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. Mini, keenly aware, blushes.
C: RUDELL
D: Anyway, what's on your mind?
C: MINI
D: Well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately?
C: RUDELL
D: No, is everything okay?
C: MINI
D: Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together.
C: RUDELL
D: Together?
C: MINI
D: It indicated that we were...I know this sounds crazy, but...a couple.
C: RUDELL
D: A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm...I mean, certainly older men and younger women are an ...accepted part of society, but for someone to do that, well...it's just tasteless.
E: searching again
C: MINI
D: Exactly, so we're just trying to figure who Rit could be.
C: UDELL
D: Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at all...Out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together?
C: MINI
D: Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. I mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step- father.
C: RUDELL
D: Of course.
S: EXT. RUDELL'S POOL - LATER.
N: Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini flirts shamelessly with him.
C: MINI
D: Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. RUDELL'S HOT HOUSE - LATER.
N: Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair.
C: MINI
D: I knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. RUDELL'S PUTTING GREEN - LATER.
N: Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her, wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the swing.
C: MINI
D: And the one undeniable fact I had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life...
E: V.O.
S: INT. RUDELL'S KITCHEN - LATER.
N: Rudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip cream.
C: MINI
D: ...than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to.
E: V.O.
N: He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes.
C: MINI
D: Frankly, I'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there. XT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE - LATER.
E: V.O.
N: Mini walks out, skipping down the path, singing "The Candy Man" to herself.
C: MINI
D: "Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can"
C: MINI
D: I left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon, I had turned Rudell into a trout on a line...and he'd follow me anywhere I tugged the pole.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: "The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good..."
E: singing
S: INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
N: Mini walks down the corridor with Kayla.
C: MINI
D: The photos stopped coming and although Martin was freaking out about his business, things were returning to normal. I even decided to return to school.
E: V.O.
N: They approach TROY, the football player she humiliated earlier. Mini raises two fingers to her mouth in a "V", simulating cunnilingus, taunting Troy. His friends laugh and he wilts, pretending he didn't see her.
S: INT. A CLASSROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Mini and Kayla walk in with other students. Her teacher, Warren Bishop, comes over to her immediately.
C: BISHOP
D: Mini, I've got a message for you to go to the principal's office right away.
S: INT. THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER.
N: Mini is led in by A SECRETARY, as Detective Garson sits in a chair next to PRINCIPAL PATTY ANDREWS, 50.
C: MINI
D: Then things got interesting again.
E: V.O.
N: Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the appropriate concerned tone.
C: MINI
D: Detective Garson, is everything all right?
N: CLOSE ON: A VIDEO MONITOR. black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's hallways is seen.
C: GARSON
D: Mini, this tape was shot a week before your mother's death.
E: O.S.
N: The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse Hauptführer walks out.
C: GARSON
D: The next day, the school nurse reported two bottles of Ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet.
E: O.S.
N: A few seconds later, Mini is seen entering the nurse's office, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw her. THE TAPE FREEZES, then fast forwards. Mini is seen leaving the office, stuffing something in her pocket.
S: INT. AN EMPTY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: A TV and VCR sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner, as Garson puts down the remote and looks at Mini. Principal Andrews is not pleased.
C: GARSON
D: We've lifted two prints from the door and the inside of the medicine cabinet. They don't match the nurse.
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Mini, is there something you'd like to say to Detective Garson?
N: Mini eyes remain calm.
C: MINI
D: Can we see the tape of the Der Führer sucking down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff, or don't you have cameras in the bathroom stalls?
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Young lady, stealing anything, especially prescription drugs is a serious matter.
N: Mini looks at Andrews, her eyes suddenly starting to tear up.
C: MINI
D: You got me, okay? But what was I supposed to do?
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: What do you mean?
C: MINI
D: She...She said if I didn't, she was...was gonna--
E: suddenly hysterical
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Who? Another student?
C: MINI
D: My mother! She made me steal them for her! I didn't want to, but she said she was going to send me to boarding school in Canada if I didn't! P
C: RINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Canada?
C: MINI
D: The Yukon territories! Are you happy, now? You got me!
E: sobbing
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Oh my lord, I had know idea, she was--
C: MINI
D: An addict? Detective Garson knew! We told him, and now what? The whole school's gonna know!?
N: Mini hides her face in her hands.
C: MINI
D: She's dead, my mommy's dead. Can't we just leave her be?
N: Andrews casts a harsh glance at a frustrated Garson.
C: PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
D: Detective Garson, I assume, there won't be a need to press charges against Ms. Drogues?
N: Mini holds out her wrists to Garson.
C: MINI
D: You gonna cuff me, Copper!?
E: sniffling
N: Garson looks at Mini, clearly not convinced of her innocence.
C: GARSON
D: She's free to go.
S: INT. THE LOBBY OF MARTIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
N: Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby. GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him. Martin looks a little unnerved to see them.
C: GARSON
D: Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming up to see you. Have you got a minute?
C: MARTIN
D: Detective, I told you no more questions without my lawyer.
C: GARSON
D: I think you'd better call him.
S: INT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER.
N: Martin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, NED VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them.
C: GARSON
D: There's a small discrepancy that I can't quite figure out and I was hoping you might be able to explain it.
C: MARTIN
D: I suppose I can try.
C: GARSON
D: The final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills. She wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her.
C: ARTIN
D: Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update-
C: VOLANT
D: Martin, easy.
C: MARTIN
D: I'm sorry, but this is harassment.
C: GARSON
D: See, here's what I needed to ask you. The gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used.
C: MARTIN
D: And?
C: GARSON
D: Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. An unconscious person can't turn on a car, right?
C: VOLANT
D: Detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point?
C: GARSON
D: Well, here's where I get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas.
N: Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay.
C: GARSON
D: So, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours. Is there?
N: He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer.
C: GARSON
D: So, I guess what I'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car?
C: VOLANT
D: Martin, don't say anything.
C: GARSON
D: Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but I've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship.
C: VOLANT
D: Again, Detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse.
C: GARSON
D: I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, I'd be careful. The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town.
N: Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn, whispers back.
C: OLANT
D: Does this mean he's offering Mr. Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter?
N: Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for his answer.
C: GARSON
D: It's a strong possibility. But he wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing.
N: Martin's eyes shift slightly.
S: INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Garson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident as Martin's lawyer.
C: MINI
D: It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.
N: Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve.
C: PELHAM
D: Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-
E: nervously
C: MINI
D: Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow...
N: Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin.
C: MINI
D: ...my tongue.
N: Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation.
C: GARSON
D: Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin.
C: MINI
D: So you want me to say it was his idea?
C: GARSON
D: If it was his idea, give me one reason you should take the fall?
C: MINI
D: At that moment I knew we had him. If he was trying to get me to rat on Martin, he didn't have enough to charge either one of us.
E: V.O.
C: MINI
D: So if I tell the jury it was his idea and I was scared for my life, because he said he'd kill me if I ever told anyone, then I walk?
N: Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair, just a bit. Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching. She looks around the room, weighing her options. Pelham attempts to whisper something in her ear. She waves him off.
C: INI
D: Sorry, sport, but I'll take my chances.
S: INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
N: Mini and Martin drive home together. There is an icy chill between them, as Martin looks over at Mini.
C: MARTIN
D: I never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm. Not a second. I hope you know that?
C: MINI
D: Oh, I knew...I knew.
C: MARTIN
D: Good. You realize, we've got to rely on each other?
C: MINI
D: Who else do we have?
C: MARTIN
D: Exactly. We're almost home free. My lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell. I've only got one concern now.
C: MINI
D: What?
C: MARTIN
D: Rudell. If a jury knew we were a couple, we've both got a motive and that changes everything.
N: Mini puts her hand on Martin's, reassuringly.
C: MINI
D: Baby, don't worry about him, he's just jealous 'cause you've still got rockin' abs and a better hairline.
N: Martin looks over at her, softening.
C: MINI
D: Even if he did send that picture, what does it prove?...Nothing.
S: INT. THE SHERMAN OAKS GALLERIA - DAY
N: Mini walks through the mall.
C: MINI
D: For all of Martin's talk of relying on each other...
E: V.O.
N: MARTIN follows about a hundred yards behind.
C: MINI
D: Garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of distrust.
E: V.O.
N: MINI turns around and Martin ducks into a boutique.
S: EXT. A MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
N: Mini walks out of a movie theater, with Kayla and TWO BOYS.
C: MINI
D: Our relationship had turned into what some might call...
E: V.O.
N: A few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing dark glasses and a hat. He follows them.
C: MINI
D: ...unhealthy.
E: V.O.
S: INT. THEIR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mini sits in front of the TV, watching a commercial. She is wearing the same "Fuct" T-shirt she wore when we first met her. Her eyes are filled with anticipation.
C: MINI
D: Something had to give, and ironically enough, it was the night I was making my television debut.
E: V.O. MORE
C: CONTINUED: MINI
D: I had asked Martin to be home by eight for a big surprise.
E: CONT'D
N: Martin walks in the front door with his briefcase.
C: MINI
D: Oh, hey, come and watch. You're missing me, I'm on TV!
C: MARTIN
D: What? Why?
C: MINI
D: Hurry up, the commercial's almost over!
N: Martin walks over. CLOSE ON: THE TV. Absolutely Positive! Comes back on and we see that MINI and A MALE CONTESTANT are sitting on either side of this show's BLONDE HAIRED ENGAGED COUPLE. Mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better looking than the engaged couple, both of whom have a midwestern wholesomeness. MARTIN'S FACE turns white. THE HOST turns to the camera.
C: HOST
D: Welcome back to Absolutely Positive. Now it's time to hear how the date between Jason and Mini ended.
C: MARTIN
D: You? You went on-
C: MINI
D: Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now shhh...
C: CLOSE ON THE
D: SCREEN:
C: HOST
D: Jason, you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation.
C: JASON
D: Well, since Becky and I have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, I just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how I would react. You know, whether there'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision?
E: a bit nervous
C: HOST
D: So, after dinner, what happened?
C: JASON
D: Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew. I'm not really a good dancer, but I said "yes."
C: BECKY
D: We never go dancing.
E: hurt
N: Jason smiles at her uncomfortably.
C: HOST
D: So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer?
C: INI
D: Well, he's a damn quick learner, and not just at dancing.
N: MARTIN shoots a look at Mini
C: MINI
D: Martin, for god's sake, that was their line. You think I talk like that?
C: CLOSE ON THE
D: SCREEN:
C: HOST
D: Oh, really? So there was some other teacher-student stuff going on?
C: JASON
D: Uh, no, not really-
E: uncomfortable
C: MINI
D: Oh, come on, what about when we went back to your place?
C: BECKY
D: You what?!
C: JASON
D: I, I don't know what she's talking about.
C: MINI
D: Come on, don't be bashful. He put on some soft music and-
C: JASON
D: No! This isn't true, why are you-
C: MINI
D: We started kissing and-
C: BECKY
D: Jason!
C: JASON
D: Shut up!
E: to Mini
C: STUDIO AUDIENCE
D: OOOOHHHHH!
C: MINI
D: But, Jay-Jay, it was really special. He loves to be called "Jay-Jay".
E: to the host
C: BECKY
D: You, you...
C: MINI
D: Let me tell you, Becky, you're in for a wild ride from this Bronco.
C: STUDIO AUDIENCE
D: WHOOOOOOAAAA!
T: CUT TO:
N: MARTIN staring at Mini.
C: MARTIN
D: Did, did you...
C: BECKY
D: You slept with her?!
E: O.S.
C: MINI
D: God, Martin, it was a one time thing. He was a virgin, how could I say "no"? Believe me, she'll thank me after their wedding night.
C: MARTIN
D: You had me come home early to-
C: MINI
D: Don't be jealous. It won't happen again. It was just a goof.
N: Martin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN: BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage. MARTIN picks up the remote and hits "mute".
C: MARTIN
D: Rudell? He let you go on?
C: MINI
D: Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I wasn't really supposed to, you know, "go all the way" but-
C: MARTIN
D: I can't believe you...th-that couple, you ruined their relationship.
C: INI
D: Excuse me, but the show is called Absolutely Positive for a reason. Clearly, the only thing Jason was positive about was-
C: MARTIN
D: You're a sick little twist, you know that?
C: MINI
D: Well, what does that make you?
C: MARTIN
D: I need some air.
E: heading outside
C: MINI
D: Oh, by the way, some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something. It's on the desk.
N: Martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN". He opens it to find... AN 8x11 PHOTO of him and Mini kissing passionately on the beach in Mexico. This time there is no question as to the nature of their relationship. Scrawled across the bottom in black marker is: "REMEMBER, I'M JUST ACROSS THE FENCE". Martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting in.
C: MINI
D: What is it?
N: Martin slowly holds it up for her to see.
C: MINI
D: Oh, my god.
C: MARTIN
D: I think it's time I had a little chat with our neighbor
E: very evenly
C: MINI
D: No, this is exactly what he wants! What if he's working with Garson?
C: MARTIN
D: Then he can't blackmail me. Wait here, I'll be right back.
N: Martin heads for the back door.
C: MINI
D: No, please, don't do this! Let me go with you!
C: MARTIN
D: I said wait here.
N: Mini jumps up and runs over to him, grabbing his wrist.
C: MINI
D: Don't do this, we can leave tonight! We'll drive to Mexico!
N: Martin looks up at her.
C: MARTIN
D: He'll never leave us alone, you realize that?
C: MINI
D: No! Let me talk to him, he promised me he wouldn't hurt us!
C: MARTIN
D: He did? When?
C: MINI
D: A few days ago!
C: MARTIN
D: You saw him?
C: MINI
D: I went to try and find out what he knew! I spent the afternoon with him- M
C: ARTIN
D: You...spen-
C: MINI
D: I was doing it for us! I figured he wouldn't turn us in if I...
C: MARTIN
D: If you...?
C: MINI
D: If I made him think I was... interested.
N: A wave of nausea washes over Martin's face.
C: MARTIN
D: And was he?
N: Mini nods.
C: MARTIN
D: Please tell me you didn't.
N: Mini hesitates.
C: MINI
D: No...
N: Martin looks unconvinced.
C: MINI
D: I just made him think I would, so he wouldn't turn us in.
N: When Animals Attack comes on the TV in the background.
C: MARTIN
D: Thank you, I appreciate your restraint.
E: sarcastically
C: MINI
D: Fuck you. I'd think you'd be a little more appreciative.
C: MARTIN
D: Who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid? Huh? Who was that selfless act for!?
C: MINI
D: Oh, like you're such a martyr for being faithful? It shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter!
C: MARTIN
D: Don't lecture me about fidelity! Your mother was cheating within six months of the "I do's"!
N: He heads for the door again.
C: MARTIN
D: Now, if you'll excuse me...
N: Mini grabs him again, desperate.
C: MINI
D: Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really am, but this isn't the answer!
N: Martin grabs her wrist, forcefully.
C: MINI
D: You're hurting me!
C: MARTIN
D: Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me?
E: through his teeth
N: Mini nods her head.
C: MARTIN
D: Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you understand?
N: Mini nods again.
C: MINI
D: Please don't do this.
E: softly
N: He lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard. Mini watches him go.
S: EXT. RUDELL'S FRONT DOOR- MOMENTS LATER.
N: Martin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's "Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background.
C: UDELL
D: Martin, what a surprise, how are you?
C: MARTIN
D: Just watched Mini on your show.
C: RUDELL
D: Ahh...was tonight the night? We taped that two weeks ago. Let me tell you, I have girls audition all the time for me and... She was fucking incredible.
E: enjoying this
N: Rudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction.
C: MARTIN
D: A natural, huh?
C: RUDELL
D: Like a duck to water...and totally willing to take direction.
N: Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife in him.
C: RUDELL
D: I wish all the girls I worked with had her...how can I put this?... Need to please.
C: MARTIN
D: You son of a bitch...
N: Martin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him staggering backwards inside.
C: SINATRA
D: "Let's take it nice and easy..."
E: V.O.
S: INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone. She looks out THE WINDOW at the fight beginning in Rudell's house.
C: MINI
D: Yes, hello, you've got to send a police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane right away! My father's gone crazy, I think he's going to hurt our neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry!
E: frantic
S: INT. RUDELL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face.
C: SINATRA
D: "Hey, baby, what's your hurry? Relax, don't you worry..."
E: V.O.
N: Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces. Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table. He rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it. Martin crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him. Martin grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him. The two men grapple on the floor.
C: MARTIN
D: Where are they?! Huh?
C: RUDELL
D: What are you talk-
C: MARTIN
D: Don't fuck with me! The negatives!
C: RUDELL
D: What?!
S: EXT. RUDELL'S PATIO AND POOL - CONTINUOUS
N: Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green.
C: SINATRA
D: "The problem now of course is, to simply hold your horses..."
E: V.O.
N: Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes. Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another.
C: SINATRA
D: "To rush would be a crime..."
E: V.O.
N: Rudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after another.
C: MARTIN
D: You son of a bitch! How's that feel?! You like that?! You thought you could have my wife and my daughter too?!
C: SINATRA
D: "`Cause nice and easy does it, nice and easy does it..."
E: V.O.
N: Martin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN is heard getting closer.
C: MARTIN
D: Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas, but not her! Not her!
N: Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising it with both hands above his head for a final swing.
C: ARTIN
D: Now tell me where they are or I swear to god, I'll crack your head open!
C: MINI
D: Martin, don't!
E: O.S.
N: He turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks, standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop.
C: MARTIN
D: Go look for the negatives!
C: MINI
D: No! This is insane!
C: MARTIN
D: We need the negatives!
N: He raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm before it comes down.
C: MINI
D: You're gonna kill him!
N: He tries to pull the club away.
C: MARTIN
D: What are you doing! He'll tell everyone!
C: MALE VOICE
D: Freeze, police!
E: O.S.
N: Martin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked clothes, the reality hitting him.
C: OFFICER
D: Drop the club and put your hands up!
N: Martin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second officer. The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him on the ground.
C: MINI
D: Thank God! Thank God, you came!
C: MARTIN
D: Mini, you called them?! How could you call them?!
N: Mini buries her face in the officer's chest.
C: MINI
D: He's...he's crazy, I told him not to! I told him to stop!
C: SINATRA
D: "Nice and easy does it...every time."
E: V.O.
T: FADE OUT:
S: EXT. THE FRONT OF A POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Mini emerges from the station with her lawyer as a throng of REPORTERS jostle for a photo.
C: MINI
D: Needless to say, my appearance on Absolutely Positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town.
E: V.O.
N: TV VIDEO FOOTAGE OF: Mini at Martin's trial sitting in the front row.
C: MINI
D: The trial was quick. Once Mom's affair with Rudell came out, the D.A. realized he had a motive and a slam dunk. HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye towards Martin and then reads the verdict.
E: V.O.
C: FOREWOMAN
D: Guilty.
N: Martin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs behind him.
C: MINI
D: Since, Rudell was in a coma, the issue of my relationship with Martin was moot. Martin realized trying to pin anything on me would probably get him the chair.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY
N: Martin, wearing an ORANGE PRISON UNIFORM, is led into a van by a DEPUTY.
C: MINI
D: At his sentencing I begged for leniency. He got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life for mom's death.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Mini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn, snapping photos. Dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up next to the front door.
C: MINI
D: The outpouring of support was amazing.
E: V.O.
N: A MAILMAN hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door. She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other bags full.
S: EXT. A DUSTY TWO LANE ROAD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY - DAY
N: The sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes convertible with the top down.
C: MINI
D: Martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since I was eighteen, I was allowed to live by myself.
E: V.O.
N: She turns down another road at a sign reading "LOMPOC STATE PRISON, 5 MILES".
S: INT. A VISITING ROOM AT LOMPOC - DAY
N: Mini and Martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier. There are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy.
C: MINI
D: I'm sorry I forgot to bring that book you wanted.
C: MARTIN
D: It's okay, Myou can mail it.
C: INI
D: Are you okay? You look like you haven't showered in days.
C: MARTIN
D: Well...uh...you have to be careful about sh-...So how's school?
E: disturbed
C: MINI
D: You'll never guess what happened.
E: excited
C: MARTIN
D: What?
C: MINI
D: I was voted valedictorian!
C: MARTIN
D: But don't you have to be-
C: MINI
D: The best student? I know! But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss.
C: MARTIN
D: I wonder how the real valedictorian feels?
E: smiling sadly
C: MINI
D: Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor.
C: MARTIN
D: Is Rudell out of his coma yet?
C: MINI
D: I don't know, why?
C: MARTIN
D: Why? Mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures.
E: taken aback
C: MINI
D: Oh...I wouldn't worry about that.
E: nonchalant
C: MARTIN
D: But if the D.A. got those pictures, you could-
C: MINI
D: I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them.
N: He looks suddenly very worried.
C: MARTIN
D: Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? Because I've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that.
C: MINI
D: Help us?
C: MARTIN
D: They know people on the outside we could...pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you.
C: MINI
D: Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but I'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet.
C: MARTIN
D: What?
N: Mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines Martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.
C: MINI
D: Oh...wow, like I thought you were just playing along `cause I'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know?
N: Martin furrows his brow, confused.
C: INI
D: Rudell didn't send those pictures.
N: He suddenly becomes very still, as Mini's lips curl in a thin smile.
C: MINI
D: You remember, Aurelio?
N: Martin looks at her blankly.
C: MARTIN
D: Our cabana boy from Mexico?
N: Suddenly, it hits him. He looks almost nauseous.
C: MINI
D: What a sweetie, I thought I might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough.
N: His knuckles tighten around the phone.
C: MARTIN
D: You...you...
C: MINI
D: It was pretty clear Garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. It just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering.
N: Martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.
C: MINI
D: Oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first...you know I'm right.
N: The veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone.
C: MINI
D: Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, I thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex.
E: suddenly switching gears
N: Martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths.
C: MINI
D: They don't tap these lines, do they? I think I might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing...you ready?
E: looking around
C: MARTIN
D: Guard!
C: MINI
D: No? Are you sure? I won't be able to come back for a few weeks. Wait, have you met someone in here?!
E: mock jealous
C: MARTIN
D: Guard!
C: MINI
D: Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn't be single in here for long.
N: A PRISON GUARD appears behind Martin's stall.
C: MARTIN
D: Guard! She did it! She just admitted it! It was her idea!
C: MINI
D: I guess this means I could start dating around too?
C: MARTIN
D: Don't let her leave! She's guilty! Get the warden!
C: UARD
D: Okay, that's enough!
N: The guard moves to take the phone from him. Martin clutches it to his head.
C: MARTIN
D: You bitch! You little whore!
C: MINI
D: Daddy, why are you saying those things!
E: starting to cry
N: The guard struggles to rip the phone away, but Martin holds on for dear life.
C: MARTIN
D: I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me, you little bitch!
C: MINI
D: Daddy, stop! I love you! Don't say that! I love you!
E: sobbing
N: Finally, the guard smashes Martin with a billy club, sending him sprawling on the floor. Martin screams behind the glass, but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him away by his feet.
S: EXT. A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY - DAY
N: SENIORS in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as PARENTS sit in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. Mini stands at the dais, addressing the class.
C: MINI
D: ...As many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. I don't know how I would have gotten through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first straight "C" student in school history voted Valedictorian.
E: V.O.
N: A FEW CHEERS go up from the rowdier students.
C: MINI
E: CONT'D MORE
N: Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and I want to wish him a speedy recovery. I spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall. A polite smattering of applause is heard.
C: MINI
D: While I may not have excelled in the classroom, I think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call "life", have taught me a few lessons that I'd like to share with my fellow graduates.
N: Her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.
C: MINI
D: Follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. Trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine.
N: Principal Andrews nods in approval.
C: MINI
D: But as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. Don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love.
N: A few PARENTS look almost surprised to hear positive things said about them.
C: MINI
D: And I mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service. Really do it...Whenever you can.
E: voice breaking holding back tears MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) MINI(CONT'D) I know I did, and I just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech I could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here...in front of all of you. Thank you and good luck. Mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as THE AUDIENCE ERUPTS. PRINCIPAL ANDREWS moves quickly to console her.
C: MINI
D: Like I promised, no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular, no Shakespeare shoved up your ass.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: MINI'S FELLOW GRADUATES give her a standing ovation. A few PARENTS become misty-eyed.
C: MINI
D: And in case you're feeling guilty about having no one to identify with but me, relax...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: MINI looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden sunlight.
C: MINI
D: ...There's a first time for everything.
E: V.O. CONT'D
T: FADE OUT:
N: THE END
