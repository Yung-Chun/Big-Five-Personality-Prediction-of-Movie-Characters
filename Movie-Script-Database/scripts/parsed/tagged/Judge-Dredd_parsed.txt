N: MONTAGE (STOCK - IF DESIRED) Vicious events, both natural and man-made. Earthquakes. Floods. Ice storms. War. Riots. Chaos and injustice.
C: NARRATOR
D: Climate. Nations. Borders. All were in upheaval. Humanity itself turned as violent as the planet. Civilization threatened to collapse. And then... a solution was found. The crumbling, teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police, creating a powerful and efficient hybrid. Trained equally in jurisprudence and combat, these new guardians of Society could dispense both justice and punishment. They were police, jury and executioner, all in one. They were... The Judges.

D: Some people say that to be a Judge on these mean streets is bound to have a certain dehumanizing effect, and that we should sympathize with the Judges. I agree. But the Mega- City Council apparently doesn't. To them, "dehumanization" isn't just a buzz word - it's a byword. And I'll show just how terrifyingly far they've taken that thought... tomorrow night.
