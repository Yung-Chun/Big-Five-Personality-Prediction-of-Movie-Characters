T: FADE IN:
S: INT. VOID - DAY
N: Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit nervous. Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness. His hair is slicked-down, and he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman special. Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.
C: ANDY
D: Hallo. I am Andy. Welcoom to my movie. I hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible! It is all LIES! Tings are mixed up... real people I knew play different people. WHAT A MESS! So I broke into Universal and cut out the junk. Now it's much shorter. In fact, this is the end of the movie. So tanks for comink! Bye-bye!
E: AS FOREIGN MAN beat; he gets upset
N: Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING CREDITS MUSIC starts to play. FINAL CREDITS roll. Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience. Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music. He does that as many times as the credits require. Finally, CREDITS END. And then--a sly smile. He leans in. DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.
C: ANDY
D: Okay! Just my friends are left. I wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places. I was only kidding about the movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD! It shows everything... from me as a little boy until my death -- Oops!! I wasn't supposed to talk about that! Oh. Eh, uh, we better just begin. It starts back in Great Neck, Long Island...
E: AS REGULAR VOICE beat his eyes pop; he covers his mouth
N: Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on. WHIR! He smiles at the flickering light.
C: ANDY
D: Oh, yes. I remember it well...
N: We PUSH INTO the white light. It fills our frame, blazing whiter, whiter...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY
N: A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR. Great Neck, 1957. An upper-class Jewish neighborhood. In the street, crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting. A fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY KAUFMAN, 40, gets out. Still in his suit, he's a well- meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible. Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game. At bat is his son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer. Michael swings -- crack! -- and hits a solid single. Stanley smiles.
C: STANLEY
D: That's my boy! Good swingin', kiddo. Hey -- Michael... where's your brother?
E: warm beat; then a look
C: MICHAEL
D: He's inside.
N: Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black. He frowns angrily, then snatches his briefcase and marches in.
S: INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY
N: Baby CAROL is crying. Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels carrots, trying to get dinner made. Stanley marches past.
C: STANLEY
D: Is he in his room?
C: JANICE
D: Of course he's in his room. All his "friends" are in there.
E: aggravated
N: Stanley glowers. He huffs upstairs.
S: INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY
N: Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door. We hear little Andy doing VOICES.
C: ANDY
D: But professor, why are the monsters growing so big? (now as BRITISH
E: O.S. as WORRIED GIRL
C: PROFESSOR)
D: It's something in the jungle water. I need to crack the secret code.
N: Stanley rolls his eyes. He opens the door...
S: INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY
N: ...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall. Andy is happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting.
C: ANDY
D: (as BRITISH
C: PROFESSOR)
D: Maybe I should talk to the natives. Shoom boom boo ba! Shoom boom boo ba --
E: as dancing NATIVES
C: STANLEY
D: Andy!
C: ANDY
D: Oh!
E: startled
N: The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward. Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.
C: STANLEY
D: Andy, this has to stop. Our house isn't a television station. There is not a camera in that wall.
N: Andy glances over at the wall. Hmm. STANLEY (cont'd) (trying to cope) Son... listen to me. It isn't healthy. You should be outside, playing sports.
C: ANDY
D: But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
C: STANLEY
D: You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
E: he blows his top
C: ANDY
D: B-but I have them.
E: he points at the wall
C: STANLEY
D: No! That is NOT an audience! That is PLASTER! An audience is people made of flesh! They -- live and breathe! Got it?!
N: Andy thinks, considering his options. Then, he nods.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY
N: Baby Carol sits in her crib. Andy's hands suddenly YANK her out.
S: INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY
N: Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor. She dutifully sits there, deadpan. Andy returns to the center of the room. He resumes his show.
C: ANDY
D: (as KIDDIE SHOW
C: HOST)
D: And now, boys and girls! It's time for... TV Fun House! (he makes an
C: APPLAUSE SOUND)
D: Hi, everybody! Are you ready for a singalong? I'll say the animal, and you make his sound! Okay...? Okay! "Oh, the cow goes........."
E: he starts to SING
N: Carol stares, unblinking. Then --
C: CAROL
D: Moo.
C: ANDY
D: "And the dog goes......"
E: he smiles, pleased
C: CAROL
D: WOOF!
C: ANDY
D: "And the cat says......"
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT
N: TIGHT on ANDY, now GROWN UP. 26-years-old, still performing the song.
C: DRUNK AUDIENCE
D: MEOW!!
N: WIDE - It's a small, hip New York nightclub.
C: ANDY
D: "And the bird says..."
C: DRUNK AUDIENCE
D: TWEET!!
C: ANDY
D: "And the lion goes..."
C: DRUNK AUDIENCE
D: ROAR!!
C: ANDY
D: "And that's the way it goes!" Thank you. Goodbye!
E: he grins
N: Andy waves and bows. There's faint scattered applause. Andy sighs. An irritated MANAGER steps onstage. He shoots Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike.
C: MANAGER
D: The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies and Gentlemen!
N: In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets, conga drums, a phonograph... it all goes into a big bulky case.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The club is empty. At the bar, the manager cleans up. Andy eagerly comes over. Offstage, his presence is soft, placid -- his voice barely above a whisper.
C: ANDY
D: So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
C: MANAGER
D: Eh, I dunno... Andy. I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
E: awkward
C: ANDY
D: You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
E: beat
C: MANAGER
D: Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting. But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
N: A stunned beat. Andy is hurt.
C: ANDY
D: What do you want? "Take my wife, please"??
C: MANAGER
D: Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material...
C: ANDY
D: I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
C: MANAGER
D: Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
N: Andy stares, disheartened. MANAGER (cont'd) I'm sorry. You're finished here. An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying. The manager is dumbfounded. He doesn't know what to do. Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks. The manager is confused -- totally disoriented. Shamed, Andy covers his face, then runs out. Silence. The manager stares after him... having no idea what just happened.
S: EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT
N: Sobbing Andy bursts out the door. He steps onto the sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING. Just like that. Andy lifts his big case and starts walking. Andy shakes his head angrily. He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an unsavory New York neighborhood. But then... TWO MEN appear... silently approaching. Andy stops uncertainly -- debating whether to turn around. But in that second -- the thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly. THUG #1 Give us your wallet. Andy stares fearfully. An anxious moment. He thinks... considering his options. Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.
C: ANDY
D: I -- doo not unterstand!!
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
N: THUG #1 Give us your money!
C: ANDY
D: What?? What mooney? Abu daboo! I do not have mooney!
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
N: The thugs glance at each other. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) Pleaze! I just move to America yezterday! I do not know! THUG #1 What's in the case?
C: ANDY
D: NO! Eeet, eet is just perzonal trifles from my homeland --
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
N: THUG #2 Shut up! Gimme that thing! The guy snatches the case. He impulsively BREAKS the lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out. The thugs are dismayed. THUG #1 Goddamn immigrants! THUG #2 This guy's pathetic. Let's go. Harsh glances. They angrily turn and leave. Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things off the street. He shouts after the guys:
C: ANDY
D: Tank you veddy much...!
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT
N: The Improv, the biggest comedy club around. People are lined up, waiting. The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a Hollywood talent manager. George is old school: Bronx accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming. A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and waves George in.
S: INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT
N: The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES. A few turn and smile -- "George!" "Hey, George!" George takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the...
S: INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT
N: Where the show's in progress. Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees George and gives him a bear-hug. Then he hustles George to a table. George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention. Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.
C: WISEASS COMIC
D: So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral! The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated. I said, "Make it all three! I'm not takin' any chances!" Thank you. Good night! The comic waves and exits. APPLAUSE. George politely claps. A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.
E: the crowd LAUGHS
N: We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage. He is in character as Foreign Man. Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights. He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs. The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. Andy tentatively grabs the mike. The stagefright is agony.
C: ANDY
D: Now? Now...? Tank you veddy much. I am very happy to be here. I tink -- this is a very beautiful place. But one ting I do not like is too much traffic. Tonight I had to come from, eh, and the freeway, it was so much traffic. It took me an hour and a half to get here!
E: AS FOREIGN MAN looking around
N: Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline. Silence. The crowd is baffled. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) But -- talking about the terrible things: My wife. Take my wife, please take her. Yikes. A few NERVOUS LAUGHS. Andy gestures, as if they got the joke. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) No really, I am only foolink. I love my wife very much. But she don't know how to cook. You know, one time, she make a steak and mashed potato. Ehh, and the night before, she make spaghetti and meatballs. Her cooking is so bad... is terrible. People are embarrassed. Some avert their eyes. A couple hipsters laugh mockingly. George leans forward. Andy wipes the sweat from his brow. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) Right now, I would like to do for you some imitations. So first, I would like to imitate Archie Bunker. (no change in his voice) "You stupid, everybody ees stupid! Ehh, get, get out of my chair Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat get into the kitchen, making the food! Ehh, everybody ees stupid! I don't like nobody, ees so stupid!" Tank you veddy much. (pleased, he proudly bows) Now I would like to imitate Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States. (no change in his voice) "Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States." Some people BOO and walk out. A few giggle, getting into the groove. George is intrigued. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) And now... I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley. A woman LAUGHS caustically. Andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us. He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER... and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing. House lights dim dramatically. With a flourish, Andy pulls tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones. He removes his pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket. He combs his hair. Then he brushes his hair. Then he combs his hair some more. Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins around. He is ELVIS. CONFIDENT. SEXY. LIP CURL. DEAD-ON PERFECT. The crowd is blown away. Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts. Andy/Elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow. Then he goes stage right and takes a bow. Then he returns stage left for another bow. Music STOPS.
C: ANDY
D: Thank you very much.
E: AS ELVIS
N: Wow. Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD. This man is Elvis. Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in. ANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd) (SINGING) "Warden threw a party In the county jail! Prison band was there And they BEGAN to WAIL!" ANGLE - GEORGE He is astonished. George cannot quite figure out what's going on... but he wants in. He waves Budd over. Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS.
C: GEORGE
D: Pst. What's the story with this guy?
C: BUDD
D: I think he's Lithuanian. None of us can understand him.
N: George nods admiringly.
C: GEORGE
D: He does a hell of an Elvis.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Andy is packing up his things. He very methodically folds each item of clothing, then checks the creases. George strolls up.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
C: ANDY
D: Tank you veddy much.
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
C: GEORGE
D: So I understand you're from Lithuania?
C: ANDY
D: No. Caspiar.
E: AS FOREIGN MAN
N: George is puzzled.
C: GEORGE
D: Caspiar? I haven't heard of that.
C: ANDY
D: It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea. It sunk.
E: AS FOREIGN MAN beat
C: GEORGE
D: Oh. Hm. I'm uh, sorry. Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting. If you ever need representation... we should talk.
E: beat
N: George hands him a BUSINESS CARD. Andy reads it -- then his eyes pop. He DROPS the accent.
C: ANDY
D: Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!
N: George realizes it's all been an act. He laughs heartily.
C: GEORGE
D: Caspiar, huh?!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals. Andy and George sit together, trying to get a sense of each other.
C: ANDY
D: You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world.
N: George is surprised at this hubris.
C: GEORGE
D: People love... comedians.
C: ANDY
D: I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man.
E: he shrugs
N: George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril. George cringes. He doesn't know what to say. A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD -- seaweed, beans, stringy paste. George frowns. Andy beams. ANDY (cont'd) Mmm! I particularly recommend the Lotus root. Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands. Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes. Sprouts in piles. George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
C: GEORGE
D: You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
C: ANDY
D: I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
E: bright
N: George is unsure if that's a joke.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, ha-ha. That's funny.
N: Andy dips his silverware in the water glass. Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin. George stares, perplexed. He looks back up -- and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils. Huh?
C: ANDY
D: See, I don't want easy laughs.
N: Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent prayer. George raises an eyebrow. Andy snaps his head back up. ANDY (cont'd) I want gut reactions! I want that audience to go through an experience. They love me! They hate me! They walk out -- it's all GREAT! Andy triumphantly eats a bean. George peers, unable to take the booger anymore. He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose. Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box. ANDY (cont'd) After I'm famous, I can sell these as "Worn by Andy Kaufman." And at that... George is won over. He smiles broadly.
C: GEORGE
D: You're insane. But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it.
E: then sincere
N: George warmly extends his hand. Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand. The men shake. A moment of supreme importance. EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY The glitz strip of Los Angeles. Money. Beauty.
S: INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
N: Real working showbiz offices. No glamour at all. It looks more like an insurance agency. George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone.
C: GEORGE
D: Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig. You'll be on the road... get some exposure...
N: O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.
C: SECRETARY
D: Tony Clifton on the phone!
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Who?
C: SECRETARY
D: He says he's an associate of Andy Kaufman's.
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh. Sammy, think about it. I gotta go. Hello? George Shapiro here.
E: back to the phone he punches a line
N: On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Uh, yeah. Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
E: V.O.
C: GEORGE
D: Er, yes. Speaking.
E: beat
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: "Speaking"! Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
E: V.O.
N: George is baffled.
C: GEORGE
D: Can I help you with something?
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Yeah! You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
E: V.O.
C: GEORGE
D: Who is this?
E: stunned
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: You -- you know damn straight who it is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer. Ear.
E: V.O. beat
C: GEORGE
D: Look... I don't know what your problem is...
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Kaufman's a lying bastard! If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
E: V.O.
N: CLICK. Clifton hangs up. George is bewildered.
S: INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY
N: The light is magical. Soothing SITAR music plays. Andy and fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi- circle. Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating. Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian YOGI. At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.
C: LITTLE WENDY
D: Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert.
N: The students all open their eyes.
C: YOGI
D: Do any thoughts come...?
N: STUDENT #1 My mind is clear. I feel great.
C: YOGI
D: Good...
N: STUDENT #2 All the tension is gone from my body. The Yogi's eyes go to Andy. Andy smiles sweetly.
C: ANDY
D: I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy.
N: The Yogi nods kindly.
C: YOGI
D: You always had a good heart. But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline.
C: ANDY
D: Yes. TM got me focused. In fact, my manager got me a TV gig! It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited.
N: Oh. The Yogi peers intently.
C: YOGI
D: Are you at peace with your family?
C: ANDY
D: Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
C: YOGI
D: Goals are important.
C: ANDY
D: I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life...
C: YOGI
D: We are all impressed.
N: Andy smiles beatifically. This means a lot.
C: LITTLE WENDY
D: Okay. Anyone else --?
C: ANDY
D: Oh, wait! I have a question. Is there... is there a secret to being funny?
E: beat; working up his nerve
N: Huh? The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face. Then... he finally speaks.
C: YOGI
D: Yes. Silence.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
N: An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end. TECHIES tweak lights. CAMERAMEN get ready. Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY. Stanley and Janice are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's. They're all anxious.
C: CAROL
D: I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV...!
C: JANICE
D: I hope he doesn't get nervous.
C: STANLEY
D: What's the difference? This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it.
N: The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks. The crowd APPLAUDS. An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.
C: HOST
D: Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest ANDY KAUFMAN!!!
N: The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song. Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone. When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth. Instead he looks around -- frightened. The band stops... and starts again. Andy remains mute. The Band stops again.
S: INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT
N: The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried.
C: LORNE MICHAELS
D: What's happening to him?
S: INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
N: At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it loudly. The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy just blankly stands there. He's purposefully doing nothing.
C: MIGHTY MOUSE THEME
D: "Although we are in danger, We never despair, Because we know where there is danger He is there!"
E: V.O.
N: The audience is puzzled. The Kaufmans are alarmed.
S: INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT
N: Lorne Michaels is panicked.
C: LORNE MICHAELS
D: Oh my God, he's doing nothing. It's dead air...!
S: INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
N: BACK ON ANDY.
C: MIGHTY MOUSE THEME
D: "We're not worrying at all. We're just listening for his call..." Then SUDDENLY -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly LIP SYNCS.
E: V.O.
N: MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd) "Here I come to save the day!" Shocked, the crowd HOWLS with LAUGHTER. Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression. MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd) "That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way!" The audience SCREAMS with glee. The tune ENDS, and the audience APPLAUDS CRAZILY. Delighted, Andy grins and bows. The Kaufmans clap the hardest. Stanley locks eyes with Andy... and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
N: George jumps from his desk. Andy is walking in.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!!
C: ANDY
D: The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
C: GEORGE
D: That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
E: giddy; milking the moment
N: Andy's smile drops. He freezes up.
C: ANDY
D: Sitcom...?
C: GEORGE
D: And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
C: ANDY
D: I'm -- Fonzie?
E: confused
C: GEORGE
D: NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
C: ANDY
D: George, I hate sitcoms.
E: soft
C: GEORGE
D: HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
E: he checks his notes
N: Long pause. Then -- Andy responds.
C: ANDY
D: No.
C: GEORGE
D: "No"? "No" to which part??
C: ANDY
D: No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good.
N: George is flummoxed.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
C: ANDY
D: I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
C: GEORGE
D: B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
E: shocked
C: ANDY
D: I'm not interested. I want to create my own material.
N: Beat. George glares.
C: GEORGE
D: You have to do it.
C: ANDY
D: I refuse.
C: GEORGE
D: LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
E: he explodes
N: Long pause. Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion. Then Andy gets up and looks around the office. He stares at the awards... the gold records... emblems of success and experience. Andy thinks -- then nods.
C: ANDY
D: Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.
E: beat
C: GEORGE
D: Of course! That's what negotiations are for.
E: relieved
N: Andy starts to write on a piece of paper. GEORGE (cont'd) What are you doing?
C: ANDY
D: Writing down my terms.
N: George watches patiently. Andy clicks his pen, done. George smiles and takes the list. He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled.
C: GEORGE
D: Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS!
C: ANDY
D: Those are my terms.
E: blasй
C: GEORGE
D: They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
E: he points at one item
C: ANDY
D: He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him. We sorta... got in a fight over that.
N: George gets a look.
C: GEORGE
D: This Clifton called me up. He's a loon! He HATES you!
C: ANDY
D: Nah, he just talks tough. But I owe him one.
N: Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern. ANDY (cont'd) If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just gonna have to give me what I want. (a sarcastic FONZIE
C: IMPRESSION)
D: Heyyyyyy!
N: George winces. He stares at the list.
S: INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY
N: George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK SUITS. He stoically reads the men his demands.
C: GEORGE
D: Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming. Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse. Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special.
E: beat beat beat
N: The execs are stupefied. Finally -- George delivers the clincher. GEORGE (cont'd) And Taxi must guarantee two guest appearances to... Tony Clifton.
C: NETWORK GUYS
D: WHO???
C: GEORGE
D: Tony Clifton.
N: NETWORK GUY #1 Who is he?!
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know.
E: solemn
N: Long pause. The execs stare at George like he's lost his mind. GEORGE (cont'd) But Andy says he's fabulous. (awkward) He also says, these are the terms. The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly. NETWORK GUY #2 Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else? George slowly, sadly shakes his head: No. Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns. MAYNARD (cont'd) George, we don't book phantom performers. The deal's off.
S: INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
N: GEORGE throws his attachй case on the desk, then slumps into his chair. He picks up the phone and dials.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy?
C: ANDY
D: Hi George!
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
C: ANDY
D: Of course. But only on Monday nights.
E: O.S. beat
C: GEORGE
D: That's alright. Where...?
S: INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT
N: Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise guys, and cigarette smoke. The Maitre'd guides George to a booth. A small BAND fills the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room. The lights dim. A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And now, Mama Roma's is proud to present International Singing Sensation... a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined...
E: V.O.
N: George is skeptical. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON! The DRUMMER starts a drum roll. Patrons APPLAUD. A LIGHT SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters. The spot is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum roll slows down and stops. The announcer BOOMS again. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands, could everyone please extinguish your cigarettes and cigars. The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies. One ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass.
C: ANGRY GUY
D: Goddamn, I paid five dollars for this.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: And now! A man who needs no introduction... TONY CLIFTON!
E: V.O.
N: The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE". And then, obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out. Tony has a rubbery face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly, and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping. Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a cigarette. He blows smoke rings at them.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Heh-heh. How ya all doin'?
N: The crowd is furious.
C: ANGRY GUY
D: Fuck you!
N: People light back up and start talking. Tony ignores the ruckus. He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: "Volare! Whoa, whoa. Cantare, Whoa whoa whoa whoa."
E: singing
N: George winces. He's horrible. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) (singing) "I got the wings of your love, I got the wings of a dove. I got the... uh... (forgetting the words) ... the chicken wings from Eh, Kentucky Fried..." The band is lost. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Oh. Whoop do doo, Whoop de di, Stick a needle in your eye... The band gives up and stops. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Eh, the hell with that song. One person CLAPS. Most BOO. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) So how ya doin'! (leering) How ya doin' over here? How ya doin' over there? (he approaches a
C: WOMAN)
D: How's that pasta carbonara?
C: WOMAN
D: Leave me alone.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Okay! So, you havin' a good time, sir?!
E: he spins around
N: Tony approaches a LONELY SAD SACK sitting at the bar. Tony thrusts his mike at the guy.
C: SAD SACK
D: Sure...
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: What's your name?
C: SAD SACK
D: Bob.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: "Bob"? BOB! Bob bob bob. Bob what?
E: he reacts as if this is enormously funny beat
C: SAD SACK
D: Bob Gorsky.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: "Gorsky"? What is that, Polish?
C: SAD SACK
D: Yes.
E: meek
N: Tony gets indignant.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor? Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
C: SAD SACK
D: It's my name.
E: timid
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: SHUT UP! I hate them Polish jokes!
N: People are embarrassed. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) I do a clean show! Like, I wouldn't do that one... oh, you know it... "What do you call a pretty girl in Poland"?
C: SAD SACK
D: A -- a tourist.
E: he giggles stupidly
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about! Here! I'LL give you a little humor!
E: enraged
N: Tony snatches Bob's water glass and POURS IT over his head! George is appalled. The crowd is aghast. Bob is wet. People BOO AND HURL THINGS. Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the building. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) And stay out, Fatso! The room erupts, outraged. George covers his face, looking ill. Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.
C: ANDY
D: And YOU. I wanna see you backstage!
N: George is rattled.
S: INT. MAMA ROMA'S, KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The kitchen staff is working. George wanders around... then finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the employees' table. Aggravated, George aggressively steps up.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright, I'm here. What do you want?
N: Tony puts down his fork. He pauses... slowly turns around... and is Andy. George GASPS. His eyes bulge. Andy smiles innocently. He gestures to an empty seat.
C: ANDY
D: Are you hungry?
N: George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a heart attack. His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a chair and sits. George glances down. Lying alongside the food is Tony's rubber face.
C: GEORGE
D: I... I-I don't understand this act.
C: ANDY
D: It's good old-fashioned entertainment. Everyone loves a villain.
E: in jolly spirits
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah? Well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated!
N: Beat -- then Bob strolls over. His real name is BOB ZMUDA.
C: ZMUDA
D: Hey Andy, good show.
C: ANDY
D: Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years.
N: George gapes. On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof, and conniving. He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.
C: ZMUDA
D: That was a really hot house!
C: GEORGE
D: So your name's not Gorsky.
C: ZMUDA
D: Don't believe everything you hear.
N: George thinks about this -- then laughs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY
N: Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized. George is confidentially whispering to them.
C: GEORGE
D: This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony. And Tony is Andy! They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! It's smart business! You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!
E: with urgency
N: Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically. A beat, and then he cracks a smile...
S: INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
N: 1 a.m. in the supermarket. Just a few people linger... including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame. Andy stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians. Andy is oblivious to all around him. In the b.g., George suddenly enters. He looks around the market, then spots Andy. He feverishly runs up.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy!
C: ANDY
D: What's up?
E: still playing the game
N: George grins crazily, ecstatically.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy... THEY SAID YES! They agreed to it all! They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you! You're getting EVERYTHING!
E: beat
N: Whoa. Andy looks up, astonished. His space station EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice. He turns to George... and slowly smiles sweetly. Genuinely.
C: ANDY
D: Well thank you very much...!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET - DAY
N: The first week of "TAXI." The CAST rehearses on the Taxi set. PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers. (The actual TAXI scene will be determined.) JUDD HIRSCH, TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines. Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line. The cast glances around. Tony Danza loses his temper.
C: TONY DANZA
D: Man, this is bullshit! Where's Kaufman? Why isn't he here??
E: he marches up to the PRODUCER
N: One producer stands. This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER.

N: An angry beat. The actors resume...
S: INT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER
N: The AUDIENCE is filtering in. They fill the studio bleachers.
S: INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY
N: Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms.
C: JUDD HIRSCH
D: I'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in.
C: MARILU HENNER
D: No, I hear Andy arrived. Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room.
N: Judd is surprised.
S: INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
N: Andy is meditating. He's tranquil, at total inner peace. Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS. Andy snaps his eyes open. He exhales a few calm breaths, then sits upright. Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips it open, and removes a SCRIPT. Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader.
S: INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY
N: Bleachers are full. They're now filming TAXI (the same scene as earlier). On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide- eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls. Andy is hilarious. The crowd HOWLS with laughter. MONTAGE - TAXI In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments. He's beloved. The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER...
S: INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY
N: TAXI curtain calls. The whole cast takes bows, then runs offstage. Everyone is grinning -- except Andy. He soberly strolls up to Zmuda.
C: ANDY
D: I'm gonna quit.
C: ZMUDA
D: What?!?
C: ANDY
D: Each show is worse than the next.
C: ZMUDA
D: Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
C: ANDY
D: So? What do they know?
C: ZMUDA
D: Absolutely nothing! That's the beauty! It's credibility. You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
E: he lowers his voice
N: Hmm?! Andy raises an eyebrow.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MAYNARD SMITH'S OFFICE - LA - DAY
N: The power office of Maynard Smith, the powerful ABC exec. He shouts into a phone.
C: MAYNARD
D: I don't care! Travolta signed a contract, he's a Sweathog for life!... Oh yeah? Just try to sue us.
N: He HANGS up. His ASSISTANT peeks her head in.
C: ASSISTANT
D: Sir, they're having a problem down on the Kaufman Special. They say he's not following the... technical requirements.
N: Maynard is baffled.
C: MAYNARD
D: "Technical"???
S: INT. "KAUFMAN SPECIAL" SET, TECH BOOTH - SAME TIME
N: Andy is in a booth, arguing with a HEAVYSET TECHNICIAN. Zmuda watches and eats a banana.
C: ANDY
D: It's my show! Now make it roll!
C: TECHNICIAN
D: NO!
N: Maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as he walks around Little Wendy meditating in front of a ring of candles.
C: MAYNARD
D: Andy, I hear fabulous things about the Special... Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny speedbump?
E: a delicate pause
C: TECHNICIAN
D: Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold! He wants the picture to roll!
E: harried
N: Maynard doesn't exactly understand.
C: MAYNARD
D: Show me.
N: The technician pushes a button. ON THE MONITOR - Andy's image briefly appears.
C: ANDY
D: And now... in her television debut, the incredible Chubby Rosalie!!
E: ON-SCREEN
N: At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...
C: ANDY
D: It'll be great. The viewer will think their TV is broken. They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV, but they won't be able to fix it!
E: happy
N: Maynard stares at the monitor. The totally indecipherable picture still rolls. A glum pause.
C: MAYNARD
D: Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. They might change the channel.
C: ANDY
D: But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated!
N: Andy beams giddily. Maynard gazes dully, struggling to reason.
C: MAYNARD
D: Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
C: ANDY
D: But it's only for thirty seconds!
N: Beat.
C: MAYNARD
D: Five.
C: ANDY
D: Twenty!
C: MAYNARD
D: Ten.
C: ANDY
D: Deal.
N: Both men quickly extend their hands and shake. Maynard nods and leaves. Beat. Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his palm. A STUDIO PAGE walks over. He has a huge MAIL BAG.
C: STUDIO PAGE
D: Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?
N: Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas.
S: INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the Maharishi. Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with THOUSANDS OF LETTERS. He happily chats on the phone.
C: ANDY
D: ... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!... Really! ...I got your fan letter... So you like the show? Your letter said I was silly. Did you think I was too silly?... Oh good. I'm glad.
N: Andy holds a letter which has a GIRL'S SNAPSHOT stapled to it. He is very nervous. ANDY (cont'd) It was real nice of you to send your picture, Mimi... 'Cause you knew what I looked like... and now, I know what you look like! Andy flips the letter over. He glances at the return address. ANDY (cont'd) So, um... San Bernardino... (beat) That's just a couple hours away, isn't it...?
S: EXT. SAN BERNARDINO, DOWNTOWN - DUSK
N: The sun is setting. In an ugly shopping district, Andy walks along with sexy, wholesome MIMI.
C: MIMI
D: ... so after I finish junior college, I'll go to work for my dad's accounting firm. Unless, I decide to live with my friend Valerie, but she wants to move to Anaheim, and I don't want to do that.
N: A disinterested beat.
C: ANDY
D: Oh.
N: Another beat. ANDY (cont'd) So do you wanna wrestle?
C: MIMI
D: Excuse me -- ?
C: ANDY
D: Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
E: pause
N: Mimi is bewildered, and offended.
C: MIMI
D: What are you talking about?! We just met an hour ago.
C: ANDY
D: No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
E: calm
C: MIMI
D: I don't wanna talk about it!
N: An awkward silence. They continue walking. She points up. MIMI (cont'd) The sunset is really beautiful.
C: ANDY
D: What do you mean?
C: MIMI
D: I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. I love this time of day.
E: a bit offput
C: ANDY
D: I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
E: he shrugs dully pause
N: ANGLE - MIMI Fear. She shivers, then hoarsely speaks.
C: MIMI
D: I think I wanna go home.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY
N: George screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team. The network execs look constipated. ON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody.
C: ANDY
D: You know... I was once in your gallery. I was just sitting there and I wanted to touch you. I was kind of depressed because I could see what everyone was like, and I was wondering if, now, maybe I could... touch you.
E: ON TV
N: Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping. THE EXECS -- are horrified.
C: ANDY
D: Howdy, I've been watching you ever since I was a little boy... You're the first friend from television I ever had. I always wanted to meet you... and now ...I finally am.
E: ON TV cont'd choked up, nervous
N: EXEC #2 This is NOT funny. EXEC #3 (ominous) "Artsy Fartsy shit"...
C: GEORGE
D: No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical.
E: worried at this response
N: At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW. Maynard scowls.
C: MAYNARD
D: Christ! We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs?!
N: Maynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV. BANG, BANG! George winces -- then mutters awkwardly.
C: GEORGE
D: No, um... it's part of the snow.
N: An awful beat. Maynard is embarrassed. Finally -- he explodes.
C: MAYNARD
D: Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this program!!
S: INT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT
N: A delicatessen. Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables. He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food. Two BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth. BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 Excuse me, could I please have more coffee?
C: ANDY
D: Yeah, yeah, in a sec'. That was decaf, right?
E: he lugs the dishes to the kitchen
N: The guy nods. Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring. BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You know, you look just like Andy Kaufman.
C: ANDY
D: Yeah, I get that all the time.
N: Andy hurries off. The guy's buddy leans in, whispering. BLUE COLLAR GUY 2 I'm telling you, it's him. BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You wanna bet?? If that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee! NEAR THE KITCHEN Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds. He is sweating. In the b.g., George enters the restaurant. He sees Andy, sits at a table and YELLS OUT.
C: GEORGE
D: Hey! Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake?
N: Andy turns. They stare down each other. GEORGE (cont'd) Andy, this is ridiculous. Take off that apron.
C: ANDY
D: NO! I'd rather work here, than at ABC. There's no lying in a restaurant. They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook!
E: infuriated
N: Andy hurries off with a water pitcher. George chases him.
C: GEORGE
D: Look, I'm sorry. They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
C: ANDY
D: The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
C: GEORGE
D: Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
E: trying to calm him
C: ANDY
D: Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
E: bitter
N: A glum moment. Andy fills water glasses. ANDY (cont'd) How long is left on my Taxi contract?
C: GEORGE
D: You signed for five years -- So four years, seven months.
E: awkward
C: ANDY
D: Okay... I'll go back. But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka. They're gettin' Tony!

N: Andy fiercely GRABS a small book from Zmuda. Zmuda cringes.
S: INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
N: Andy strides back out. He gazes at the crowd.
C: ANDY
D: Since you're such a special audience... I'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me. (he goes into a
C: CLIPPED BRITISH ACCENT)
D: I'm actually British. I was raised in London and educated at Oxford. And though I dabble in clowning, I do find it so boorish. So... American. I prefer the fine arts. Henceforth, tonight, I'd like to grace you with a reading of the greatest novel ever written! "The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott Fitzgerald!!
E: beat he holds up the book
N: BEAT. Heh? The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad. A confused murmur.
C: ANDY
D: Chapter One. "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages you've had.'"
E: BRITISH he cracks open the book he starts READING
N: There's a little NERVOUS LAUGHTER. Is he really gonna read this? ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) "He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that..." Suddenly, somebody from the audience screams:
C: FRAT BOY IN AUDIENCE
D: LATKA!!!
N: The audience ROARS approvingly. Andy stops reading and looks at the student. He smiles.
C: ANDY
D: Tank you veddy much!!!!
E: AS LATKA
N: The audience APPLAUDS enthusiastically. Andy waits until the applause dies and goes back to the book.
C: ANDY
D: "When I came back from the East last autumn, I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart..."
E: BRITISH
N: People start BOOING. Andy looks up. ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) Please, let's keep it down. We have a long way to go. (he resumes reading) "Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction - Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn..." The crowd is incredulous.

S: INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: People are streaming out. Maybe fifty are left. Andy realizes this -- but is committed. He must continue.
C: ANDY
D: "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness..."
E: BRITISH
N: A weak VOICE feebly shouts:
C: WEAK VOICE
D: Do Latka.
N: Andy looks up, shocked. Insulted, he "blows his temper."
C: ANDY
D: Look! I don't have to tolerate this impoliteness! Forget it -- I'm gonna stop the show. GOODBYE!
E: BRITISH
N: He slams the book shut. People CHEER. Andy starts to storm off -- then turns. ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) No, no, I'm only fooling. The audience GROANS. ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) I'll tell you what. Would you rather have me continue reading or would you like to hear the phonograph record? The audience ROARS for the record. Andy smiles, puts the needle on and to everyone's horror more "Gatsby" comes out.
C: ANDY
D: "His presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer..."
E: BRITISH-FROM THE RECORD

E: BRITISH
N: Andy somberly shuts the book. ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) The End. A moment of quiet personal euphoria. Andy looks enraptured, the man who has just climbed Everest. A pause -- but no applause. It's dead silence. Andy looks out... and realizes the few audience members are asleep. Andy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage. In the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair.
S: EXT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DAWN
N: Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily. They drag the suitcase containing the props. They walk slowly towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted.

D: We might have lost our focus...
E: a guilty sigh
N: George paces furiously.

E: beat
C: ANDY
D: But George, I like to push the boundaries...
C: GEORGE
D: And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care!
N: Hmm. Andy thinks.
C: ANDY
D: How long would they let me sleep?

D: Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice...
N: Zmuda mulls this over.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MUSTANG RANCH, NEVADA - DAY
N: A tattered sign says "Welcome to the MUSTANG RANCH." The world-famous whorehouse sits behind a barb-wire fence. Dusty connected trailers sit in the sand. A CAR idles out front. Zmuda and a scared Andy sit inside.
C: ANDY
D: I dunno about this... What will my mother think?
E: worried
C: ZMUDA
D: She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
C: ANDY
D: It's so dirty.
C: ZMUDA
D: Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.
N: Andy nods.
C: ANDY
D: Okay.
S: INT. MUSTANG RANCH - DAY
N: The reception room -- wood paneling and black-lite posters. Music is playing. Twenty deadpan HOOKERS are lined up. Andy, nervous as a high school kid, points at one... then another... then the first...
C: ZMUDA
D: Which one?
N: Beat -- then Andy becomes GERMAN, with a monocle and stiff walk.
C: ANDY
D: I vill haf both! I vill haf dat fraulein... unt... the vun vith the big strudels!
E: GERMAN
N: The two chosen girls take Andy's hands and lead him off. He reaches the door -- then gives Zmuda a nervous look. Zmuda smiles reassuringly. Andy gulps, and goes in... Beat. Zmuda turns to the older, jaded MADAM.
C: ZMUDA
D: This is a big day. It's my friend's first time with a prostitute.
C: MADAM
D: What're you talking about? Andy comes here almost every weekend.
E: mocking
N: Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied.
C: ZMUDA
D: You're talking about... Andy?
C: MADAM
D: Oh, he doesn't always call himself that. Sometimes he's Tony, and wears a tux.
N: Disbelief -- then Zmuda LAUGHS sharply. He's been conned.
S: INT. MUSTANG RANCH, BEDROOM - DAY
N: Andy and the two hookers are WRESTLING. They grapple and roll around, all three of them in their underwear. Suddenly Andy flips the girls over and pins them with his arms. Breathing hard, he stares down.
C: ANDY
D: You let me win.
C: HOOKER
D: What if we did...?!
E: she giggles sexily
N: Andy grins and leans down...
C: ANDY
D: Hey. If I give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET, REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
N: The Taxi cast sits irritably around a big table, holding scripts. Ed Weinberger enters.
C: TONY DANZA
D: Where is he?
C: ED
D: He just arrived.
C: CAROL KANE
D: He's an hour late.
C: ED
D: Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a little eccentric. You're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week.
N: Suddenly -- the door SLAMS open. Tony bounds in, filthy drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Taxi! Laxy! Just the factsy, Maxie! Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls?
N: Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts. Tony feels them up, and they SQUEAL. The cast stares in horror. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Eh, why the blue faces? You musta read the script! (he chuckles) Well, don't worry! Your pal Tony stayed up all night, writin' some fixes on it. (he pulls out some
C: SCRIBBLED PAGES)
D: I added me a musical number, cut out Judd Hirsch, and changed the location to Mardi Gras!
N: Ed's expression goes ashen.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY
N: An attempted rehearsal. Tony is tap-dancing on top of a car hood. He does a "fancy" move, and his booze bottle suddenly flies away and CRASHES against the wall. The cast watches, pissed and bored.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: And now, the new theme song! "Oh yes, we drive a taxi, And we're havin' fun. Yeah, we work together, And we get the freakin' job done."
E: he starts SINGING
S: INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY
N: Beleaguered Ed sits with George.
C: ED
D: George, we've lost two days. Filming is on Friday. We HAVE to let him go!
C: GEORGE
D: I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this...
E: worried
C: ED
D: So we'll go downstairs and tell him!
N: He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set. George shakes his head.
C: GEORGE
D: But that's Tony down there. That's not Andy. Trust me, it's like "Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises!
N: Ed glares.
C: ED
D: Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him!
C: GEORGE
D: Okay. But we'll have to warn Andy first. I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert.
E: he sighs
N: Heh? Ed raises his eyebrows.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER
N: George is on the phone. Ed hovers.
C: GEORGE
D: Hi, Diane, this is George. I'm trying to reach Andy up in San Francisco. Yeah, I'll wait.
E: INTO PHONE a stilted pause
N: Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no longer there. He's magically vanished. Beat. George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK! Andy's happy voice pops on the line.
C: ANDY
D: Hi, George! Good to hear from you!
E: V.O.
C: GEORGE
D: Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there?
C: ANDY
D: Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!
E: V.O.
N: Ed looks totally off-balance. George winks at him.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
C: ANDY
D: Oh no! Did he get hurt?
E: V.O.
C: ED
D: No, no, Andy, nothing like that. But... Tony's not fitting in. His style of performance is too... burlesque.
E: nervous beat
T: INTERCUT:
S: INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
N: Tony is on the phone. Little Wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea. He looks up, insulted.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: "Burlesque"?
E: AS ANDY
N: BACK TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY
C: ED
D: Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry. But -- I need your permission to fire him.
C: ANDY
D: Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
E: V.O. upset
C: GEORGE
D: There'll be other shots.
C: ED
D: Andy, I have to do it. He's a terrible actor.
N: Andy thinks about this.
C: ANDY
D: I guess I understand. But Ed -- please... let him down gentle.
E: V.O.
C: ED
D: Yes, Andy, I will.
N: Andy hangs up. A relieved Ed turns to George. ED (cont'd) Thank you.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY
N: Tony SCREAMS insanely.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: FUCK YOU! I AIN'T GOIN'!!
N: WIDE Ed is stupefied. The cast stands nervously behind him.
C: ED
D: We had a deal!!
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
C: ED
D: Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman!
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman. He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
N: Ed is livid. He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning eyes piercing through the rubber features.
C: ED
D: Get off my stage! You're fired!
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: I GOT A CONTRACT!! I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
N: Suddenly -- FLASH! Ed looks over. A REPORTER has a camera.
C: ED
D: Who're YOU?!
C: REPORTER
D: I'm from the LA Times. We're doing a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton. Mr. Kaufman arranged it.
E: beat
N: UP IN THE BLEACHERS - George enters. He looks down at the growing debacle, and winces. Uh-oh. ONSTAGE - Enraged, Ed blows up.
C: ED
D: Security! Escort this man off the lot!!
N: ONSTAGE - Studio SECURITY GUARDS run over. They GRAB Tony.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Stop! GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!
N: Tony scuffles. The camera FLASHES. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) LEMME GO! I'M A BIG STAR! IN THE BLEACHERS - George stares at this mess... and starts giggling. ONSTAGE - Two guards drag Tony to the door. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) You'll be SORRY! One day I'm gonna OWN this town!! Tony SCREAMS and gets removed. Dead silence. Then --
C: ED
D: I don't want those pictures getting out.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: This is a closed set. You'll have to give me the film in that camera.
E: to the reporter
N: The Guard reaches for the camera. An uncertain moment... until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.
C: ZMUDA
D: I'll take care of this.
N: Zmuda takes the camera. He casually starts to make his way for the exit... when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.
C: ED
D: Wait -- he's one of THEM!
N: Zmuda gasps. Two guards go running for him. Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape. The guards chase. Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera into George's arms. The guards whip by, oblivious. George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties. He sweatily peers at the timebomb in his hands. And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket. He bolts for the door and feverishly scampers out.
S: EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY
N: George runs for his life. He knocks aside a rack of costumes and serpentines between people. At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Stop! HELP! You wouldn't do this to Wayne Newton --
N: The guards toss Tony out the gate. He lands in a heap. In the b.g., George crazily flies by. He gets out the exit.
S: EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT, OUTSIDE THE GATES - DAY
N: George doubles over, trying to catch his breath. He glances down... and Tony is lying next to him. Little Wendy and Zmuda run up, out of breath. They all look at each other. There's a moment of understanding.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Hey. Good hustlin'.
N: George slowly smiles.
S: INT. TAXI OFFICES - SAME TIME
N: Ed storms in, insanely angry.
C: ED
D: That asshole! That FUCKING
C: BASTARD!!
D: We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!!

N: Ed is seething. His SECRETARY timidly speaks.
C: SECRETARY
D: Um, Ed... you have a phone call --
C: ED
D: I'M NOT IN!
C: SECRETARY
D: Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman...
N: Heh??! Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone... then slowly picks it up.
C: ED
D: Yeah???
N: A long pause... then Andy's voice calmly speaks.
C: ANDY
D: You were brilliant.
E: V.O.
N: A flabbergasted beat.
C: ED
D: Huh?
C: ANDY
D: You were in the moment. You became a producer losing his mind. It was the best improv I've ever seen.
E: V.O. sincerely joyful
N: TIGHT - ED He thinks intently about this. And then... amazingly, a magnificent smiles comes over his face.
C: ED
D: Well -- thank you.
N: Pause.
C: ANDY
D: Okay. See you next week.
E: V.O.
N: Andy hangs up. Ed just sits there, astounded.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LA HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Andy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a booth, laughing and celebrating. They eagerly read the LA Times. INSERT - The headline says "WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?" Below is a PHOTO of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set. They all HOWL.
C: ANDY
D: This is great! It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional! It's very good for his career.
N: Zmuda reads one paragraph.
C: ZMUDA
D: "Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
C: ANDY
D: Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy!
E: he chortles
N: Hmm. A few awkward glances. Then -- Andy grins at his meal. ANDY (cont'd) Boy, this is tasty. (he shouts to a
C: WAITER)
D: Hey, can I please have some more seaweed?!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BOOKER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: A slick BOOKER, sitting in a crowded office full of head shots. He's on the phone. He's reading the LA Times story.
C: BOOKER
D: Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe. We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.
T: INTERCUT:
S: INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
N: George on the phone.
C: GEORGE
D: Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him.
C: BOOKER
D: Oh.
E: O.S.
N: Disappointed beat. The booker thinks. BOOKER (O.S.) (cont'd) What about Tony Clifton?
C: GEORGE
D: Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
E: startled
C: BOOKER
D: Eh, sure. We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
E: O.S. being tricky
N: George winces.
C: GEORGE
D: Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
C: BOOKER
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge nudge!
E: O.S. he LAUGHS merrily
C: GEORGE
D: No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
E: frustrated
C: BOOKER
D: I'll take my chances!!
E: O.S. LAUGHING harder
N: George rolls his eyes in annoyance. Finally, he shrugs.
C: GEORGE
D: Fine, be my guest! Book him.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY
N: George is driving in his convertible. Suddenly, something catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes. Three cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each other. George is oblivious. He's staring up at a BILLBOARD. The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON! TOGETHER ON STAGE! ONE NIGHT ONLY!" George is flabbergasted.
S: EXT. SUNSET BLVD, PHONEBOOTH - DAY
N: George is shouting into a payphone.
C: GEORGE
D: Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible!
E: upset
C: BOOKER
D: Why's that? You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
C: BOOKER
D: Sure it is. Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
E: O.S.
N: George is stupefied. He looks at his watch.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK
N: Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline. The marquee blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!" George screeches up in a rental car. He jumps out and runs inside.
S: INT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT
N: The showroom is packed. It hums with curiosity. WAITERS clean off the dinner tables. George rushes in and is seated in a far booth, with some STRANGERS. He overhears a heated conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.
C: PUSHY MAN
D: You're not listenin'! It's a VERY simple concept.
C: WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
D: You're making no sense. How can they be the same person --?
C: PUSHY MAN
D: Trust me! You'll never see them on stage at the same time!
N: The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare. LIGHTS DIM. Sharp SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage. Suddenly -- Tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph. Thunderous APPLAUSE. Tony beams. The music stops. George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of this. Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits. The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not entirely. Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS FURIOUSLY.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: SHUT UP!!!!!!
N: Everybody looks up, alarmed. The general murmur almost dies. Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people. As they quiet down... Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. The MUSICIANS lift their instruments. Silence is total -- except for the clank of china. Waiters are serving coffee. Tony spins back around, livid. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) THAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO, PENGUINS!!! People signal "shh"! The waiters realize Tony's addressing them, and they stare back in disbelief! This is their job! TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Yeah! Yeah! YOU! I'm talkin' to YOU!! And you better freeze, or I'll get your asses fired!!! Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze. The waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror. Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. Again, the musicians lift their instruments. In anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about. Audience members start whispering. Tony hears this -- and drops his arms and head in despair. The musicians lower their instruments. Tony waits for absolute silence. Only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again. They do. And then at that precise moment -- somebody DROPS a spoon. Tony jolts, as if hit by a current. He drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look. Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits. And waits. And waits. The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.
C: PUSHY MAN
D: He's never gonna start! Kaufman thinks this is funny! We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start!
E: beat
N: George grins stupidly. The silence is now deafening. Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms. Slowly... the musicians get their instruments ready. Tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything... to disturb the silence. In vain. Somebody COUGHS. The whole scene repeats itself. Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence. Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable), he begins to move. Tony pivots around, looks at the audience... And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum. Tony starts LAUGHING hysterically. The audience's reaction is mixed: Some people LAUGH. Some BOO. Some ask perplexed questions. Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES. Some even APPLAUD. Tony is very happy. He turns to the orchestra, raises his baton -- and commences the downbeat! The MUSIC BEGINS. A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT. George's jaw drops.
C: WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
D: You see! I told you! They're not the same person!
N: The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE. Life is back to normal. Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a prepared row of congas. He starts to play. Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Thank you! Thank you! I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album.
N: He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me". George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) "Whether I'm right Or whether I'm wrong Whether I find a place in this world Or never belong! I gotta be me! I gotta be me! What else can I be, but what I am?" Tony's singing is awful. Andy happily accompanies on congas. The audience doesn't know what to think. Tony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Let's bring it on home -- (he hits his screeching CLIMAX) "I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!" The BAND ends with a brassy punch. The crowd responds with LOUD BOOING.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HARRAH'S, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms. He turns and finds a door marked "KAUFMAN". Next to it is a door marked "CLIFTON". George stares. He thinks, then opens the "KAUFMAN" door. Andy is inside alone, gathering his things. He's pleasantly surprised to see George. George doesn't enter. He goes to the "CLIFTON" door. Andy follows. George opens the mystery door...
S: INT. HARRAH'S, CLIFTON'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
N: and inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda. George starts hyperventilating. Shaking, he tries to sit himself down. Andy enters, beaming. George is amazed.
C: GEORGE
D: You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
C: ANDY
D: But wasn't it funny?
C: GEORGE
D: "Funny"? I dunno. But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
E: softening
N: Andy excitedly jumps up and down.
C: ANDY
D: Uh-huh! See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders. They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman." But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth! Tony's not me! But maybe he is! The audience will never know... They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right!
E: giddy
N: George is dazed.
C: GEORGE
D: So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You... and you.
E: dry
C: ZMUDA
D: Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
C: GEORGE
D: But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
E: he turns serious
N: Hmm. Andy contemplates this.
C: ANDY
D: George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
E: thoughtful
C: GEORGE
D: But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
N: A perplexed beat.
C: ANDY
D: George, it never was. Didn't you know that?
E: pause
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder, on the cover of a magazine. Magazines are everywhere. Body- building. Women's. Wrestling. ANDY is sifting through them. Zmuda watches, worried.
C: ANDY
D: Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
C: ZMUDA
D: What is this, World War Two...?
C: ANDY
D: You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
C: ZMUDA
D: No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it. These he- men'll kick your ass!! They're huge!
N: Andy's face drops. He realizes Zmuda's right. Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiancйe on the cover. He slowly lifts it up, intrigued.
C: ANDY
D: Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...!
S: INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY
N: CLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin. Andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear. He is shouting like a wrestler.
C: ANDY
D: ... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!!
C: MERV
D: By a woman.
E: nonplussed
C: ANDY
D: Yes! BY A WOMAN! I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability -- And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that...
E: emphatic a clumsy pause
N: The audience MURMURS uncomfortably. Andy laughs and backpedals. ANDY (cont'd) No no! Women are superior in many ways. When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men. I believe that! An appalled silence. Merv winces. Some people start BOOING. We can tell Andy is pleased. ANDY (cont'd) But when it comes to wrestling, forget it! If there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here. I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500 dollars. Merv baitingly turns to the crowd.
C: MERV
D: Any... volunteers...?
N: WIDE All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up! We move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty woman, LYNNE. She mutters, half hateful, half laughing --
C: LYNNE
D: I wanna kill that jerk.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER
N: Andy and Lynne stand in the ring. She scornfully watches him preen about. Zmuda is in a referee's uniform.
C: ZMUDA
D: Will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling.
E: AS REFEREE
N: Lynne extends her hand. Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely refuses and struts away. The crowd HISSES. DING! It's the bell. The match begins. Lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience. Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over. WHUMP! She's down. Andy has trained for this. Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official. Lynne struggles and slithers away. She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down. People CHEER. His torso hits the mat. LOUDER CHEERS. But suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair! Her head snaps back. The crowd is INCENSED. Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning. Andy nods, and they separate. They do a little dance around the ring, Lynne looking for a hole. Suddenly, Andy spins her into a Half-Nelson. Her arms are pinned. They struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach. One! Two! Three! And DING! It's OVER. Andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd.
C: ANDY
D: I'm the winner! I've got the
C: BRAINS!
D: Now baby, don't fight nature! Get back in the kitchen where you belong!!!
E: he points at his head
N: Lynne glares. Out of the blue, and old RECORDING OF BOUNCY PIANO MUSIC starts playing. A chicken CLUCKS to the music, and Andy lip- syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the ring.
S: INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY
N: Lynne is escorted by a GUEST COORDINATOR. Lynne is dazed. The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap.
C: GUEST COORDINATOR
D: Here's your complimentary photo with Merv. Here's your Turtle Wax --
C: LYNNE
D: I don't need Turtle Wax.
C: GUEST COORDINATOR
D: Every guest of Merv gets it. And here's your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster.
N: Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off. She passes Andy, who sees her and grins.
C: ANDY
D: Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies!
C: LYNNE
D: Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.
N: Lynne coldly hurries away. Andy chases after her.
C: ANDY
D: Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
E: eager to impress
C: LYNNE
D: Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
N: Andy nods, pleased.
C: ANDY
D: It's what I'm good at!
N: Lynne stares -- then begrudgingly cracks a smile.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY
N: Jumbo-sized BEEFY MEN work out, sweating and groaning. In a corner, Andy lifts huge barbells. George stares, pained.
C: GEORGE
D: Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail. Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.
C: ANDY
D: That means it was a success. I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! (he hands him a
C: BARBELL)
D: Here, take this.
C: GEORGE
D: No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back.
N: He crosses his arms. Andy frowns and lowers the weight. GEORGE (cont'd) Buddyboy, they detest you! Next time you make an appearance, women are gonna picket.
C: ANDY
D: They're having a laugh...
C: GEORGE

S: INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT
N: The arena is filled with furious BOOING SOUTHERN WRESTLING FANS. Ladies in hair nets. Men clutching beer cans. This is a rougher crowd than we've seen before. Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe. He's screaming at them.
C: ANDY
E: screaming
C: SHUT UP!
D: SHUT UP! Show some respect! I want SILENCE when I speak!
E: more BOOS
N: People BOOO louder and throw debris. Andy is pleased. ANDY (cont'd) If any woman can defeat me, I will pay her 1000 dollars! Then I'll shave my head bald! And then as a bonus -- that lucky lady will get to marry me!! Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS. Down front... Lynne jumps up.
C: LYNNE
D: Look here, Andy Kaufman! I'll take you on -- SISSY!
N: The mob LAUGHS harshly.
C: ANDY
D: Ooo, the little lady's upset. Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
C: LYNNE
D: No! YOU get in the kitchen. I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
E: "outraged"
N: The crowd APPLAUDS. Lynne grins and starts to climb in the ring. Andy's eyes are ablaze. But suddenly -- an oversized Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.
C: MAN
D: STOP IT! This woman's a FAKE! She's nothing but Kaufman's girlfriend!
N: Andy and Lynne are startled.
C: ANDY
D: T-that's not true --
C: MAN
D: It's a set-up! And I won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix!!
N: The crowd angrily starts to HISS. Lynne whispers to Andy.
C: LYNNE
D: Andy... who is that...?
C: LAWLER
D: I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of Memphis wrestling!! (this gets HUGE
C: CHEERS)
D: So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've brought a real wrestler! She's trained and she's READY!! Kaufman, do you think you can handle... FOXY JACKSON???!!!
N: At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands -- FOXY. The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement. People POUND their seats. The roar is deafening. Lawler gleams cockily. Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: DING! The bell rings. Foxy comes out, ready to brawl. But Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock. He nonchalantly peels off his robe. Foxy dances around impatiently. Andy casually removes a towel from his neck. People BOO. Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch. People SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced. Andy is tormenting them. A TATTOOED GUY jumps up.
C: TATTOOED GUY
D: Are you scared???
N: Andy sneers. He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over... and commences a WINDMILL. Absurdly, he spins his arms around and around, daring Foxy to get near him. She rolls her eyes and waits. The REF jumps out of the way. A minute has counted down. Finally, Andy stops -- and the real wrestling begins. Foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke-hold. The crowd CHEERS, relieved. Lawler motions signals. Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away. Andy is intrigued. She's coming to play! Andy gestures to the Ref and points UP. The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS Foxy. The crowd furiously JEERS. The Ref spins around, and Andy shrugs innocence. He then runs at Foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes. She bounces off, stumbles back - - and Andy drops to his knees. She trips over him and hits the mat. Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her. The Ref counts: One! Two! Three! DING!! It's over. But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely. Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.
C: LAWLER
D: Alright, you won. GET OFF HER!
N: Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken. THE BOOING grows. Louder. More emotional.
C: ANGRY VOICES
D: Jerry, help her! Get in there! Do something!
N: Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts Andy off! Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down. Andy is flabbergasted.
C: ANDY
D: W-what are you DOING? I don't fight men!
N: Lawler snickers and walks away. Completely overreacting, Andy grabs the mike. ANDY (cont'd) I'm gonna SUE YOU! (he starts RANTING berserkly) Let me tell you something, Lawler! I am not a hick -- I'm a national TV star! And I DON'T like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring! I never agreed to wrestle you! So you know what I'm gonna do??? (seething) I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent you've got! This was assault and battery! In a court of law, I'm gonna kick your Southern- fried rump!!! Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.
C: LAWLER
D: YEAH?! Well I got news for you, Andy Kaufman! Wrestling is a serious sport to me! I don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin' the South! So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for REAL!
N: Andy watches, fuming. He is INFURIATED.
C: ANDY
D: He -- can't get away with this. YOU! You think I'm CHICKEN?!
E: to Lawler
N: Andy grabs back the mike. He sticks his face in shocked Lawler's. ANDY (cont'd) (sarcastic SOUTHERN
C: ACCENT)
D: You wanna "wraaastle" me?! You wanna "WRAAASTLE" me??? Okay, Lawler -- let's rumble! Yeah, I've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you! In fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!" I'm from Hollywood. I have the brains. That's how I win. And Mr. Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry "Mama!"
E: back to his regular voice, he points at his head
N: Andy bears his teeth. Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing at him. HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.
S: EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, TUNNEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: We hear NOISE from the main event above. Andy and Lynne hurry along. She is disgruntled. He swaggers arrogantly, still in his fighting outfit.
C: LYNNE
D: Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
C: ANDY
D: I can shtop whenever I want...
E: he jokingly impersonates a drunk
N: She's unamused.
C: LYNNE
D: Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
C: ANDY
D: I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...!

It's not so hot... but this is a great opportunity for you. The show's live, they'll give you carte blanche, and you can get back to the business of making people laugh. Andy gets a strange gleam. He only heard one thing.

E: V.O.

C: LAWLER
D: Hey! Did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass?
N: Andy paces around, unsure of his next move. LAWLER (cont'd) Look... if you get in here, I'll give you a free headlock. Lawler leans down and offers his neck. Andy peers skeptically. People JEER. Andy looks at waiting Lawler... then tentatively climbs in. As promised, Lawler doesn't move. So Andy crosses over and grabs Lawler's head! Andy grins triumphantly. He squeezes his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment. Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over. Andy SLAMS DOWN on his back. CRUNCH!
C: ANNOUNCER
D: It's a side suplex!!
E: V.O.

C: STANLEY
D: Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew, you were DYING! Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!

C: ZMUDA
D: WE NEED A STRETCHER!!

N: Stanley, totally numbed, holds Janice. They're on the verge of collapsing. Tons of commotion. Cameras FLASH BLINDINGLY. A stretcher is lifted into the ring. Andy is loaded on.

S: INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Andy is being carried by the Coliseum EMPLOYEES into the dressing room. The entourage follows. Zmuda pushes out the crowd of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, and ONLOOKERS. He slams the door and locks it.

N: Stanley has a blank expression. But Janice starts to cry.
C: JANICE
D: Andy, I love you! I love you, whatever you do...!
N: She hugs Andy tightly. Andy is genuinely shocked. He looks at his quivering mother... and then his voice softens, truly remorseful.
C: ANDY
D: Geez, I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have put you through all that... Well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: Anything that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.
E: quiet
S: EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - NIGHT

C: ZMUDA
D: It's working for Elvis.

E: sarcastic he sees an article and winces
C: ZMUDA
D: Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
N: George rolls his eyes.
C: ANDY
D: George, let's not drop the ball on this. I've made some kind of cosmic career move.
N: Somebody KNOCKS outside. Andy jumps up, puts on his neck brace, and transforms himself into a shuffling invalid. A DELIVERY BOY drags in an enormous basket of flowers and goodies. Andy takes the card. It reads "Andy, we're all praying for you. Your friends at Taxi." Andy chuckles.
S: EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY
N: George is eating with the Saturday Night Live Producer, Lorne Michaels. They're eating lunch in an outdoor cafe.

E: he takes a careful beat
N: Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably. He chooses his words.
C: LORNE MICHAELS
D: George -- I don't know if Andy works for our show anymore. That wrestling stuff... is such a turnoff.
C: GEORGE
D: We agree completely. Andy has to reconnect with his core audience. So I got him on Letterman tonight. He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans.
E: tactfully begging
N: Lorne Michaels mulls this over.
C: LORNE MICHAELS
D: That's smart.

C: ANDY
D: I apologize for all the wrestling I've ever done. I'm sorry for all the abuse I've ever given... I was just playing bad guy wrestler. That's not me... it's just a role. But Jerry took it personally.
E: soft
N: Lawler and Letterman are unimpressed.
C: LETTERMAN
D: You said some pretty inflammatory things.

They're all slack-jawed. Even PAUL SHAFFER. Trying to cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE. Andy jumps up, crazed. ANDY (cont'd) I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT! Lawler freezes in his seat. Letterman hides behind his desk. Andy storms over, out-of-control. From a safe distance, he starts SCREAMING at Lawler. ANDY (cont'd) YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!

N: Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out. The crowd CHEERS rowdily. An unsure moment. Dave glances at Lawler. Until, Andy stumbles back in. He tries to calm himself. ANDY (cont'd) I am sorry. I am sorry to use those words on television. I apologize! I'm sorry! (demented) But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE!!!! Andy slams Dave's desk. Dave jerks nervously. Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup. Uh-oh. Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler! Lawler jumps, burned. A SECURITY GUARD runs in. Andy screams and hurtles away. He slams open the stage door and barrels out of sight.

C: SMUG COMIC
D: Hi. Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea. Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman's a comic genius. But others disagree... they say he's just not funny anymore. So we're putting the decision up to you. Please call up and vote. To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618. To DUMP him, call...
E: beat beat
S: INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
N: Tight on Andy, staring at the LA Times. A small headline says "JOKESTER ANDY KAUFMAN VOTED OFF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'" He is bothered.
C: ANDY
D: This is bad... I only got 28 percent! I'm like McGovern in '72...
N: George sighs.
C: GEORGE
D: And this wasn't "Merv." This was the hippest audience on television. They've turned on you.
E: grim
N: At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to Andy. But only the back of his head is visible. GEORGE (cont'd) It's like you two guys wanted to destroy Andy's career! Upsetting all those people... putting out that toxic venom... (helpless) What did you THINK would happen?!
C: ANDY
D: We were just trying to push the envelope --
E: guilty
C: GEORGE
D: You're BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!! It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- I don't want you two to ever work together again.
E: beat pained
N: We WIDEN... And the other person is JERRY LAWLER. He feels bad.
C: JERRY LAWLER
D: I'm sorry. We thought it was funny...
C: ANDY
D: Jer', it's not your fault. You were terrific. But maybe George is right...
E: sad
C: JERRY LAWLER
D: That's fine. But I wouldn't have traded it for anything... Because for one brief, shining moment... the world thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally.
E: poignant
C: ANDY
D: We'll stay in touch. Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake.
C: JERRY LAWLER
D: Alright, buddy... Stay good.
E: choked up
N: Andy and Jerry hug. A touching beat... until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam.
C: ANDY
D: Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount...
C: GEORGE
D: Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back.
E: somber
N: Andy's face drops.
S: INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought. A few DISCIPLES IN TURBANS mill around.

N: NINE STUDENTS, sitting in the Lotus position, are listening to a teacher. The teacher is Andy.
C: ANDY
D: Open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes...
N: Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are blinking their eyes faster and faster. The door opens. The Yogi sticks his head in.
C: YOGI
D: Excuse me, Andy...
C: ANDY
D: Yes, your Holiness?
N: The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room.
S: INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

C: ANDY
D: Why?? I... I attend every year.
E: surprised
C: YOGI
D: Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
N: Andy is stunned.
C: ANDY
D: "Philosophically"?
C: YOGI
D: The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. It seems you have no respect for anything.
E: he sighs beat
N: Andy is stupefied. He doesn't know how to respond.
C: ANDY
D: Of course I do...
N: The Yogi shakes his head. Andy can't believe it. He looks around -- men in turbans staring at him. Andy cracks.
C: ANDY
D: Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
C: YOGI
D: It is apparently not working.
C: ANDY
D: So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
C: YOGI
D: Andy, don't raise your voice. We don't wish your presence here.
E: pained
N: Andy is broken. He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy down the corridor, peering helplessly. Beaten, Andy waves goodbye to her. Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

S: INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed. Covers pulled up to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life. Suddenly DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. Andy ignores this. Beat. Another DING-DONG! Then KNOCKING.
C: ANDY
D: Go away.
C: LYNNE
D: It's me.
E: O.S.

C: LYNNE
D: Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
C: ANDY
D: You don't know the real me.
C: LYNNE
D: Andy... there is no real you.
N: TIGHT - ANDY An astonished silence. And then... he slowly smiles.
C: ANDY
D: You're probably right.
N: They both giggle. Andy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes. Pause.

D: Do you wanna move in together?

S: EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY
N: A moving van outside a funky 60's house. MOVERS carry boxes in.
S: INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Andy sits disoriented in the living room. Movers bustle around him. Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls -- and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself. In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out. Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll. He smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases. Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS. He grins.
C: ANDY
D: Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?
E: he scrambles for the phone
C: GEORGE
D: Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled.
E: V.O. long beat
N: Silence. Andy has no response. GEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd) Do you want me to come over? Talk about it?
C: ANDY
D: Um... no. Uh, I'm sorta busy right now. Thanks. We'll get together next week.
N: Andy hangs up. He just sits there... confused... unsure how to react. Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd. He goes over to the mirror. On the back of his neck... is an inflamed red pimple. Andy grimaces. ANDY (cont'd) Yuck!
S: INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT
N: Very late -- a clock says 1:15. A YOUNG COMIC is onstage, performing to the DOZEN audience members left. In back walks... Andy. Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN. Budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug. Andy points at the stage and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods.
S: INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Budd is onstage.
C: BUDD
D: And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards. The star of Taxi -- here in person, Andy Kaufman!
N: The sparse crowd APPLAUDS. Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles up.
C: ANDY
D: Actually, Budd, you're wrong. I found out today that Taxi's been canceled.
N: The crowd AWWWWS sadly. Andy blinks. ANDY (cont'd) Yeah, that's how I felt too... though I don't know why. 'Cause for years, all I wanted to do was get off that show. (quiet, very confessional) But now that nobody will hire me, and nobody thinks I'm funny... I guess it was probably a pretty good job. One guy LAUGHS sharply. Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues. ANDY (cont'd) Not to mention that my wife has left me. And she took the kids. (he sighs) I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. My options are sorta limited... (beat) This morning, I noticed I've got a cyst, or some kind of boil, on the back of my neck. It's really disgusting. Look. Andy turns. The red lump is bigger, grosser. The crowd GROANS, revolted. ANDY (cont'd) So I was thinking, since I'm sort of a quasi-celebrity, that I could charge people to touch it. (candid) Does anybody want to pay a buck to touch my cyst? A couple stoners GIGGLE and CLAP. Andy COUGHS, then frowns. ANDY (cont'd) I'm serious. A pause... then a few curious people walk up to the stage. The first taker is a GOOFY BLONDE WOMAN. She starts to reach for the cyst -- when Andy stops her. ANDY (cont'd) No, no, you gotta pay first. She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse...

C: ANDY
D: I made six bucks. That's good money.
N: Budd stares sadly.
C: BUDD
D: This is a comedy club -- not a medical sideshow. If you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and pull yourself together. Come back and do the material that people love: Do the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy! Andy, you gotta snap out of this funk! If you can -- I'll give you the headline spot tomorrow.

D: George, you won't believe it... I got Andy to do all the old material! And he's killin' them!

S: INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - NIGHT
N: And it's packed! Andy is onstage, playing struggling, lovable Foreign Man.
C: ANDY
D: ... but one ting I do not like is too much traffic. Tonight I had to come on de freeway, and it was so much traffic... It took me an hour and a half to get here!

D: "Take my wife, please take her."
C: ANDY
D: T-take my wife, please take her...
E: AS FOREIGN MAN

C: INTERRUPTING JERK
D: "Her cooking is so bad, is terrible."
C: ANDY
D: H-her cooking... Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible.
E: AS FOREIGN MAN Andy stumbles uncomfortably
N: The laughs are weaker. The act is getting wrecked. IN BACK - George grimaces. Who the hell's doing this?? Angry, George hurries down front, looking for the loud jerk. He scans the tables... and it's Zmuda. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) But right now --
C: ZMUDA
D: "But right now I would like to do for you some imitations. First, the Archie Bunker."
E: AS JERK
N: Andy freezes up. The audience is embarrassed. A frazzled confusion, then Andy drops the accent. He glares at Zmuda.
C: ANDY
D: Sir, do you have a problem?
C: ZMUDA
D: Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
E: AS JERK
N: Andy winces.
C: ANDY

C: ZMUDA
D: I used to think you were original.
C: ANDY
D: I was very original!
C: ZMUDA
D: Yeah, exactly -- "was"! But now, you're creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn't that true???
E: he gleams cruelly back to Andy
N: Andy shudders. The audience averts their eyes. A painful silence. "Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed.
S: EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Andy and George walk sadly down the street. There is a horrible gloom over them.

D: The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...

D: Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.

S: INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY
N: Andy is doing laundry. He empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug. Then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns. Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it. Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked. She stares in frustration at Andy's behavior.
C: LYNNE
D: How can you be so casual??!
C: ANDY
D: Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
E: he shrugs
C: LYNNE
D: You're NOT DYING!

N: Lynne storms out. Andy finishes his socks. Satisfied... he turns on the TV. ON THE TV: It's "Lassie." Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed, with a broken leg. Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book. Lassie places the book on his lap. The boy smiles gratefully.
C: TIMMY
D: Thank you, girl. You're my best friend.

D: The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs. We've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells. Excuse me. I'll be right back.
E: his BEEPER goes off
N: The doctor leaves. A somber silence -- and then Janice bursts into tears. Stanley hugs her tightly. Carol watches the doctor with great hostility. His old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention. He leaves, and she frowns.
C: CAROL
D: What a crock.
C: STANLEY
D: How dare you make light of this!
E: angered
C: CAROL
D: Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again --
C: STANLEY
D: Jesus! He's got lung cancer!
E: impassioned
N: A standoff moment. Carol loses it.
C: CAROL
D: See, that's exactly it! He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke. That makes it weird! If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick." So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?"
C: JANICE
D: Of course it's real. We're in a hospital...
E: trying to convince herself
C: MICHAEL
D: Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai! It's a showbiz hospital! Andy's studio friends probably run this place!
C: CAROL
D: He plans these things out. He takes over, hires actors... Personally, I didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing.
E: beat
C: MICHAEL
D: Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes?
C: CAROL
D: Yeah! He didn't have doctor shoes!
E: excited
N: A moment of total silence. All four of them look at each other. Is there... a glimmer of hope?
C: MICHAEL
D: We all know he's talked about faking his own death...
C: STANLEY
D: Sure -- but what if he isn't? My son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera.
E: sad; poignant

S: INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The house is dark. Lynne leads George into the shrouded living room... and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position, concentrating. In front is a WILD-HAIRED MAN in a purple robe.
C: WILD-HAIRED MAN
D: I want you to visualize. Visualize big, healthy white cells in your body. Now visualize little cancer cells. Now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells...

N: Ah. Andy's eyes widen. His wheels are spinning fast.
C: ANDY
D: Uh, yes... that's true. But he's also ordained in holistic medicine.
N: ON GEORGE - He glares, stewing. George is fed up. ON ANDY - An unspoken tension. Then suddenly, he breaks down. ANDY (cont'd) George, what am I supposed to do?! I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get better... but everyone's lookin' at me funny! Even you come to my home and act like I'm puttin' on a skit!
C: GEORGE
D: You must take a little pleasure in it.
C: ANDY
D: Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
E: beat
N: George shakes his head.
C: GEORGE
D: Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy.
C: ANDY
D: Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
E: thrown
N: Andy struggles to remain composed. George sighs.
C: GEORGE
D: So how can I help you...?
C: ANDY
D: I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!

C: EDITOR
D: What bullshit! No. No more Kaufman stories! He's burned us too many times!
N: REPORTER #2 Yeah, he's definitely not dying. He's playing Carnegie Hall next month! The Reporter frowns. REPORTER #1 Jesus. Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt.
S: INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - NIGHT

N: WE WIDEN Andy, George and Zmuda watch. Andy's face is enthralled like a kid.
C: ANDY
D: This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
E: giddy; thinking
C: ZMUDA
D: I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
C: ANDY
D: Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
E: excited
C: ZMUDA
D: And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?" And he says, "Cancer!"
C: ANDY
D: No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive!
C: GEORGE
D: That's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune. Even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand.
N: Andy smiles.
C: ANDY
D: I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver.
C: GEORGE
D: So who's gonna pay for it?
C: ANDY
D: Tony Clifton.
C: GEORGE
D: You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
E: beat

S: INT. CARNEGIE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The corny "Jingle Jangle Cowboy" MOVIE is playing on a big screen. It finishes. Beaming Andy grabs the mike.
C: ANDY
D: Ladies and Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould!!
N: Crazed APPLAUSE. Frail ELEANOR GOULD, 75, comes onstage. ANDY (cont'd) It's such an honor to have you here.
C: ELEANOR
D: Andy... this is so overwhelming...
E: squinting into the lights
C: ANDY
D: Well, it's gettin' even better! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses! Do you -- do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"?
N: Eleanor starts to protest -- but Andy hands her the HOBBY HORSE. She blushes. Andy turns away, goes to the band, and starts conducting. They begin to PLAY "JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE." Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles. Andy gets excited and conducts FASTER. Eleanor is sweating. She dances faster. Andy impatiently SPEEDS UP the MUSIC MORE. Eleanor desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up... when suddenly she grabs her heart. Eleanor stops -- and collapses. She's down. A horrified GASP from the crowd. The band stops playing. CREW MEMBERS run on from backstage. One checks her heart. She's not moving. Zmuda runs out, horrified.
C: ZMUDA
D: Is there a doctor in the house??!
N: The crowd is stunned silent. Pause -- then one man stands. It's Michael. Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the aisle, and goes on stage. Michael checks her pulse and loosens her blouse. He presses Eleanor's chest, trying to restart her heart. But then -- he shakes his head sadly. She's dead. The crowd MOANS sadly. Michael covers Eleanor with a jacket.
S: INT. CARNEGIE HALL, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
N: Andy watches, pleased. Suddenly, he COUGHS harshly. Andy drinks some water. Pause... then he puts on a goofy Indian headdress and runs back out.
S: INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT
N: Eleanor lies dead. Andy skips over and starts doing an Indian war dance around her body. The crowd is baffled. Andy WHOOPS, he CHANTS... and then Eleanor starts to rise! He WHOOPS triumphantly. She lives, like Frankenstein reborn! The crowd CHEERS, surprised and giggling.

Yes indeed, TWO DOZEN ROCKETTES rush in from the sides, legs kicking high. The crowd WHOOS. ANDY (cont'd) Girls and Boys, it's Santa Claus!! Snow start falling, and SANTA ON HIS SLEIGH drops from above. The crowd screams with excitement. It's unbelievable. They leap to a standing ovation. In front are Stanley and Janice. They start crying. Beaming Andy embraces Eleanor. Then he takes the mike. ANDY (cont'd) And it's not over yet!! 'Cause I'm taking you all out to Milk and Cookies!! The crowd laughs. ANDY (cont'd) I'm serious!!!!!!!

S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT
N: The audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies. It's remarkable. At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne. Andy's face is pure joy.

N: Suddenly -- a SHARP VOICE.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: What is that crap? Looks like somethin' my dog would puke up!!
E: O.S.
N: The women turn. It's Andy -- dressed as Tony Clifton. A spooked moment. Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but Andy is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: How 'bout me and you dolls go get some REAL food: French fries and a Porterhouse steak!
C: LYNNE

D: Yeah, you're right. We better get movin'. We don't wanna miss Happy Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's you can drink for $4.99.
N: Tony jauntily turns to exit. He gestures to the ladies. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Let's go! (he starts SINGING "New York, New York") "These vagabond blues, Are washin' away. I'll make a brand new start of it..." Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses. He clutches himself in pain.

S: EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK
N: The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills. Andy and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out. Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight. He is a shadow of himself.

D: I can't move my arm.
C: GEORGE
D: You've got good days and bad days.
E: awkwardly
N: Andy softly sighs.
C: ANDY
D: My hair is coming out.

N: George silently pats Andy. Andy's energy is sapped, but he forces himself to be upbeat.
C: ANDY
D: I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in. It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids. You know, puppets, magic tricks...
N: George is choked up. He goes along with it.
C: GEORGE
D: I think we can sell that.
E: long pause
N: Silence. George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm. Andy smiles gratefully.

N: George clenches Andy's hand.
C: GEORGE
D: Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
C: ANDY

N: TIGHT - ANDY His voice gets hushed.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY
N: Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city. Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the sky. It hits a dirt runway. Dust flies. Chickens squawk and run.
S: INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY
N: Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city. Andy stares in amazement.
S: EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
N: They reach a brick building. A sign says "CLINIC," with an eye over a triangle.
S: INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
N: A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms. Money is handed over. Andy's clothes are stripped off. They're thrown in a locker.
S: INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY
N: A large white tiled room. Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid Andy, his limp body unmoving. Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE. Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand. They have a look of desperation and reverence. At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels. A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench. Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching. Pause, then he removes some BLOODY GUTS. He flings them into a bucket. The woman cries out. Andy gasps. The woman is helped away. Jun turns to wash his hands. An attendant gives him a towel to dry with. Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up... Andy rolls closer. He stares at all this with fear. Nervousness. Hope. Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head. He concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS. He flings them into a bucket. The man shakes. He is helped away. Andy is wide-eyed. He gets closer... closer... More patients. More bloody guts. More sobbing. Andy's excitement builds. Then -- he reaches the front. A moment. Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief. They are overcome. It feels like they're saying goodbye. Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss. Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly. Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair. They help him up to the bench. Andy lies down. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient. Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle. Jun turns. An attendant gives him a towel to dry off. Andy relaxes, readying for it all... He glances at Jun's hands. Jun hands back the towel -- and under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines. Jun discreetly palms it. He's a fake. CLOSEUP - ANDY A moment of stunned disbelief. He is shocked. Outraged. Disappointed. Flabbergasted. The faith is meaningless. The joke is cosmic. The con man has been conned. Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to LAUGH. It's sidesplittingly funny. Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks. His face flushes with color. Life sparkles in his eyes. Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse. This is the best gag of them all.
T: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
N: Andy lies in peace in a casket. He has died. His expression is pleasantly bland. Almost Latka-like. But his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it almost looks like a mask. We slowly widen. The casket is surrounded by beautiful flowers. We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN. On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at us. There's a gentle smile on his face. It's the image from the opening of this film. ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS. All are in black. Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock. Andy's family is huddled. Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying. George gives Zmuda a hug. Little Wendy comes over... and they comfort each other. Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger, Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on... And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions. They stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.
C: ANDY
D: Well... My show is over. I did my best, and I just want to say, until we meet again... please remember: "In this friendly, friendly world... With each day so full of joy. Why should any heart be lonely."
E: ON FILM he begins to SING
N: Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING. ANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd) So everybody! Put your arm around the person next to you, even if you don't like that person. Come on! (he resumes SINGING) "The world is such a wonderful place, To wander through, When you've got someone to love, To wander along with you. With the sky so full of stars, And the river so full of songs, Every heart should be so thankful, Thankful for this friendly, friendly world..." The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS. The curtain closes. The FILM ENDS. And all goes silent. Some people cry. Some begin to leave. Most of them are just staying, numbed. George and Zmuda whisper.
C: GEORGE
D: It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
C: ZMUDA
D: Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
N: The Taxi cast are flustered.
C: CAROL KANE
D: Why are people leaving? The curtain's gonna open. Andy's gonna come out... I know it!
C: TONY DANZA
D: Sure, the body was just made of wax...! Wasn't it......?
E: a very long beat
N: Silence. They look to the front. The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT
N: A SUPER slowly appears: "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER" On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards. Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY. Traffic on Sunset is jammed. HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by. Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes pop. DUDE #2 Oh my GOD. (stupefied) That's the freakiest thing I've ever seen!! Look! He points. His friend turns -- and gasps. AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!" DUDE #1 Man, we were right! He's not dead! DUDE #2 He's just been lyin' low for a year! WE GOTTA GO! Hysterical, the guys race up to the club. But outside, there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB. People are screaming. Police have barricades. Everybody cries to get in.
S: INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME
N: It's packed. Every square inch is filled with glittery Hollywood VIPs. People make chit-chat... but there is a squeamish excitement in the air. A brooding unease. Nobody knows what to expect. Suddenly -- the lights go black. A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Ladies and Gentlemen! Please put your hands together for... Tony Clifton!
E: V.O.
N: The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing. "DAAAAA, DAAAAA, DAAAAA! DA-DAAAAA"! A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo. The light grows bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is revealed onstage! It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response. The crowd has no idea what to do. Tony smirks.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: How ya doin'?
N: Dead silence. Tony struts downstage. He waves to the crowd. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) How you doin' back there?! (to the front rows) How you doin' up here?! Still no response. Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.
C: VOICE
D: Andy!
N: Whoa. The crowd rustles nervously. Tony grimaces.
C: TONY CLIFTON
D: Don't know nothin' about no Andy. Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my coattails. Let's HIT IT, boys! One, two, anda one two three four!
E: to the BAND
N: The BAND kicks in with disco anthem "I WILL SURVIVE." Tony starts SINGING the schmaltzy opening: TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) "First I was afraid I was petrified. Kept thinkin' I could never live Without you at my side." (he wipes away a pretend tear) "Were you the one that tried to Hurt me with goodbye? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and Die...?" We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators. At a front table are George and Lynne. Tony attacks the chorus. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) "Oh no not I!
C: I WILL SURVIVE!
D: As long as I know how to love, I know I'll simply stay alive!"
N: In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling... frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a man in the very last row. Bob Zmuda. Enjoying the show more than anyone. TONY CLIFTON (cont'd) "I've got all my life to live I've got all my life to give. I will survive..." (he hits his big finish) "I -- WILL -- SURVIVE!!!" The music CRESCENDOS, and the song ENDS. Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly.
T: FADE OUT.
