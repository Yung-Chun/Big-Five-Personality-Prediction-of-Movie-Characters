S: 1 INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING
N: A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway.
S: 2 INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING
N: At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3.
S: 3 INT. COACH. MORNING
N: Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye. The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text.
S: 4 EXT. STREET. MORNING
N: We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War.
T: CUT TO:
N: We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up. SHIFTY Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
T: fence, making a short cut.
S: 5 INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
N: Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose. SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.
S: 6 INT. COACH. MORNING.
N: Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.
S: 7 INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
N: Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table.
S: 8 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast.
S: 9 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
N: Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end.
S: 10 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.
S: 11 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING
N: In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.
S: 12 INT. COACH. MORNING
N: Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across. 13 GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.
S: 14 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING
N: Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.
S: 15 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.
S: 16 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
N: The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his shoulder. A BEAT. He turns and walks off. 17 TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his face, he seems a little more with it.
S: 18 INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
N: Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.
S: 19 EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING
N: Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.
S: 20 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY
N: Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.
S: 21 INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING
N: Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.
S: 22 EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNING
N: Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.
S: 23 INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING
N: Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the rush.
S: 24 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING
N: Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.
S: 25 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.

S: 26 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING
N: CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP. Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.
S: 27 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING
N: Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's, lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side, books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He stands, staring.
S: 28 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast ready. Shifty turns to face him.
C: SHIFTY
D: You alright son?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah I just needed to splash my face, freshen up a bit.
C: SHIFTY

D: No, no... just some fucking booty call.
C: CHRIS
D: What, Break Glass Arse?
C: SHIFTY

D: Yeah, she's alright you know.... She's got fucking massive Gary's.

C: SHIFTY
D: Mate, do you mind halal?
E: CONT'D

D: No, no, that's sweet mate, whatever.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: Were you on just one bus?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to change at Luton.
C: SHIFTY
D: LUTON!
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, man.
C: SHIFTY
D: Fucking random.
N: Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer, opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large bag of sweet corn.
C: SHIFTY
D: I've got a few things to do today geezer, you can stay here if you want, just chill out.
E: CONT'D
N: He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty closely, but doesn't say anything.
C: SHIFTY
D: Or you can come with me?
E: CONT'D

E: O.S. CONT'D
S: 29 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst talking on the phone.
C: JASMINE
D: ... she's living like a drifter babe, I'm telling you, she's split... sort of... with Stefan... I know she did... but she stays at Mike's in the week, and then she's back at Stefan's at the weekend... with the kids Katie, darling, stop banging your bowl...
E: on phone to baby
N: Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.
C: JASMINE
D: ...Neither knows about the other, and then she expects me to fucking cover for her Stefan's my mate for Christ's sake, I'm not getting caught up in that whole mess Freddie, sit down and finish your breakfast!
E: CONT'D on phone she drops to a whisper normal volume to boy
N: This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the table.
C: JASMINE
D: ... and she has a go at me for taking on too much Babe, I'm cooking you some eggs...
E: CONT'D on phone she laughs - then without looking up
N: SLAM - the front door crashes shut - he's gone - his breakfast untouched.
C: JASMINE
D: Oh... what... nothing, Trevor's just walked out without touching his breakfast... I don't know, I thought so anyway...
E: CONT'D
S: 30 EXT. DRIVEWAY. MORNING
N: Silence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding. He approaches his work van. "T. PALMER - BUILDER'S MERCHANT" inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings - he answers.
C: JASMINE
D: What's the matter?
N: Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray.
C: TREVOR
D: Nothing, I'm fine.
C: JASMINE
D: Why didn't you say good-bye?
C: TREVOR
D: You were gassing away to Nicola...
C: JASMINE
D: And why didn't you touch your breakfast?
C: TREVOR
D: I'm not hungry.
N: Off Screen Freddie yells.
C: JASMINE
D: What's the matter with you?
C: TREVOR
D: I'm fine.
N: She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs.
C: JASMINE
D: Where's the grey suitcase?
C: TREVOR
D: What? I can't hear you babe.
C: JASMINE
D: I want to start getting stuff ready for next week - where's the grey suitcase?

D: Babe it's fine, I'll get it down.

S: 31 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNING
N: Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's temperament, and watches through the front room window as he drives away.
S: 32 INT. SHIFTY'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Shifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez, Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.

E: PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED
N: Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.
C: CHRIS
D: How you doing Rez, good to see you, man?

S: 34 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING.
N: All three of them eat in silence. Chris' eyes dart occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the food. There is an uncomfortable air in the room.
S: 35 INT. TREVORS'S VAN. MORNING
N: Trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key. We see that he doesn't have a huge amount left in his wrap.
S: 36 INT. REZ'S HOUSE/KITCHEN. MORNING
N: Shifty's putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the table. Rez stabs away with a tooth pick measuring up Chris, who reads a magazine.

D: Rachel who?
C: SHIFTY

C: REZ
D: Who?
C: SHIFTY
D: Mate, Rachel and Serena.
N: Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy stare.
C: REZ
D: Oh right.
N: Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic.
C: SHIFTY
D: You remember Rachel, you fucking lunged her at Jazzbo Browns?
E: to Rez
C: REZ
D: WHAT... that's BULLSHIT.

N: Glen grabs Shifty and pulls him to one side. His face is close to Shifty's ear, his insipid breath hot.
C: GLEN
D: Who the fuck is that?
C: SHIFTY
D: Chill out, he's an old mate of mine.
C: GLEN
D: Don't just bring any fucking Muppet to the party, at least let me know first, do you know what I mean, give me a fucking heads up.

C: SHIFTY
D: What? Magnus never wants me to call him.
N: Glen shrugs. A BEAT.
C: GLEN
D: I dunno, mate...
N: Shifty watches Glen.
C: SHIFTY
D: Where's the gear?
C: GLEN
D: Lenny's got it.
N: As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of money to Glen. Seated in the driver's seat sits Lenny, a frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She's pulling out a crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny, slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into his lap.
C: SHIFTY
D: Alright Lenny?
C: LENNY
D: Alright mate.
C: SHIFTY
D: You alright Loretta.
C: LORETTA
D: Alright Shifty.

C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, a few years ago?
C: GLEN
D: You'd fucking hope so, she's dead you cunt.

D: Don't go blowing up any fucking tube trains.

N: Glen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and storms off, Shifty follows after him.
S: 58 INT. LENNY'S CAR. DAY
N: Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it to Lenny.
C: GLEN
D: What are we waiting for?
C: LENNY
D: Give me a fucking break I'm rushing my tits off...
N: Lenny attempts to start the car.
C: LENNY
D: Where's the keys babe?
E: CONT'D
C: LORETTA
D: Let's just go Lenny. I'm freaking out.
N: Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive off, frog-hopping the VW down the road.
C: GLEN
D: Yeah, it's a good job we're not making a fucking scene.
S: 59 EXT. ROW OF GARAGES. DAY
N: Chris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris stands there for a moment his fists clenched.
C: SHIFTY
D: Mate, are you alright?
C: CHRIS
D: Yeah, I'm fine.
C: SHIFTY
D: What's the matter, what did he say?
C: CHRIS
D: Geezer don't worry about, just...don't worry about it, it's cool, I'm alright.
S: 60 EXT/INT. BUILDING SITE. DAY
N: Trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta-cabin and let's himself in. We follow him into see Bob Moran, portly, sitting at a desk, another gentleman, in a suit and hard-hat stands before the desk. Bob spots Trevor.
C: BOB
D: No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
C: TREVOR

N: Bob comes around from his side of the desk.
C: BOB

N: Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.
C: TREVOR
D: Bob.
N: Bob ignores him.
C: TREVOR
D: Bob I need this money.
E: CONT'D
N: Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to him. Trevor stands behind them.
C: TREVOR
D: Bob!
E: CONT'D
N: Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.
C: BOB
D: Thank's for coming today Trevor, we'll definitely be in touch.
N: Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together.
S: 61 EXT. HILL TOP. DAY
N: Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty hands Chris a rolled spliff. Shifty doesn't say anything, doesn't want to push Chris. A BEAT.
C: CHRIS
D: Was that Loretta Martin in that motor?
C: SHIFTY
D: Yeah.

N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: ...the paramedics had to peel her off.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Jesus Christ!
N: Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He hits reject.
S: 62 INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY
N: Trevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his dashboard.
S: 63 INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY
N: Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine.
C: REZ
D: FUCK!
N: He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks in the gap, and sees something. He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through, watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez sits back against the machine just staring at it.
S: 64 EXT. HILL TOP. DAY
N: Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something.
C: CHRIS
D: What's that?
C: SHIFTY
D: What?
N: Chris points.
C: CHRIS
D: That fucking thing.
S: 65 EXT. PARK. DAY

C: CHRIS
D: What does it fucking do?
N: Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it.
C: CHRIS
D: Mate, grab the other end.
E: CONT'D
N: Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground.

D: FUCKING HELL!
E: CONT'D
C: SHIFTY
D: SHIIIIIIIIT!
N: They're both cracking up laughing, loving it.
S: 66 INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY
N: On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum. WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM WATCHING HER.
S: 67 EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY.
N: A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms.
S: 68 INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY
N: Shifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the emblem of the cat.
C: SHIFTY
D: Fucking cat lovers.
N: A BEAT.
C: CHRIS
D: I can't stand people who feed their cat's... fucking red snapper... or goose liver, because they say the fucking things fussy...

D: Sorry about this geez.
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Mate, it's cool.
C: SHIFTY
D: I didn't wanna drag you around all day.
N: A BEAT. Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps, echoing down the clinical looking hallway. 69 *
S: INT. VALERIE'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAY
N: We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller. We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards. A BEAT. Valerie looks towards Chris.
C: SHIFTY
D: Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm, he's an old friend of mine, we grew up together. He's cool. We go way back. So it's cool, you know.
C: CHRIS
D: How you doing?
N: He offers a hand that she takes politely.
C: VALERIE
D: Yeah. Hi.
N: A moment of uncomfortable silence.
C: SHIFTY
D: I called yesterday but you were out.
C: VALERIE
D: When?
C: SHIFTY
D: I dunno, It was probably about two in the afternoon.
C: VALERIE
D: I was in all day.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: You must have been asleep.
C: VALERIE
D: No, no I was awake, I didn't sleep.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: I dunno then.
C: VALERIE
D: Did you say two o'clock.
C: SHIFTY
D: Yeah.
C: VALERIE
D: Are you sure it wasn't two thirty.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: It may have been.
C: VALERIE
D: I was out on the balcony at two thirty.
N: A BEAT.
C: VALERIE
D: But I was in here at two.
E: CONT'D
N: A BEAT.
C: VALERIE
D: I'll make us some tea.
E: CONT'D
C: SHIFTY
D: Yeah, that'll be sweet.
N: 70 *
S: INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY
N: Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this.
T: CUT TO:
N: Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle. 71 *
S: INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY
N: Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the counter top.
C: SHIFTY
D: How you been, alright.
C: VALERIE
D: Yeah, I'm alright babe, you alright?
C: SHIFTY
D: Yeah, I'm alright.
C: VALERIE
D: Good, good.
N: Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.
C: SHIFTY
D: She visited you yet?
C: VALERIE
D: No... not for a long time, Shifty... not seen her for a long time really, darling.
N: Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He places a hand on her arm.
C: SHIFTY
D: She'll come back one day.
N: They carry on making the tea. 72 *
S: INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY
N: The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.
C: CHRIS
D: No, no, I'm fine......thanks though.
N: CLOSE ON SHIFTY.
C: SHIFTY
D: Look Val we're gonna have to do one...
N: THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO SHIFTY... Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he's seen. 73 *
S: EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE'S FLAT. DAY
N: Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried on walking.
C: SHIFTY
D: Geezer, give me a minute.
N: Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n' bass booming out. 73A *
S: INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY
N: Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out.
C: SHIFTY
D: Alright mate?
C: OTIS
D: Alright.
N: Shifty looks about at the room.
C: SHIFTY
D: What's your name?
C: OTIS
D: Otis.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: Where do you get your weed from?
C: OTIS
D: It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here... I could phone him if you want, he'll sort you out...
C: SHIFTY
D: Where d'you get your fucking weed from rude boy?
N: A BEAT.
C: OTIS
D: I get it from this geezer... Glen Dowdy innit.
N: Shifty smiles.
C: SHIFTY
D: No, you don't.
S: 74 EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / CORRIDOR. DAY
N: Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable.
S: 75 INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY
C: OTIS
D: No his names Glen, I'm sure it is man, his names Glen innit?
C: OTIS' GIRLFRIEND
D: Yeah, I think so.
C: SHIFTY
D: From now on you get your weed from me...
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: At half the price.
E: CONT'D
N: Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly confused.
S: 76 EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY
N: Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16, pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.
S: 77 INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY
C: SHIFTY
D: I'm gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down.
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: Yeah?
E: CONT'D
N: A BEAT.
C: SHIFTY
D: YEAH?
E: CONT'D with threat
N: At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the situation.
C: OTIS
D: Yeah, alright, yeah.
C: SHIFTY
D: Because if I hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, I'll come back here and I'll take your TV, I'll take your stereo, and I'll shove em up your birds arse.
N: He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked.
C: SHIFTY
D: Do you understand me?
E: CONT'D
N: Otis nods.
C: SHIFTY
D: DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
E: CONT'D
C: OTIS
D: Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I'm sorry.
N: Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis' wall.
C: SHIFTY
D: Call me if you need any more weed.
N: He walks into the hallway, past Chris.
C: CHRIS
D: You don't miss a fucking trick.
E: almost disdain
C: SHIFTY
D: You know it.
S: 78 INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAY
N: Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates. CLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB. Shifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind. A BEAT.
C: CHRIS
D: That was all a bit fucking surreal.
C: SHIFTY
D: What d'you mean?
C: CHRIS
D: I can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad.
N: Shifty laughs as they carry on descending.

C: SHIFTY
D: Have you?
E: CONT'D
C: CHRIS
D: Fuck that.
N: They still descend the stairs.
C: SHIFTY
D: Do you wanna try it?
N: Chris looks at him, unsure if he's joking.
C: CHRIS
D: Only if I get a fucking discount.
C: SHIFTY
D: I have to charge you wholesale, you know. I got family in Pakistan, they need ticket for plane travel, man.
E: Asian accent
N: They both laugh.
