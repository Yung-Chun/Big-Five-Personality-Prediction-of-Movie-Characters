M: FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS)
N: This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre. In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard. The battered terrain shows the effects of battle. In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage. Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and the ground. A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby. MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation area. A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON. JEEP - MED. CLOSE As it jounces along. General Waverly is weather-beaten and weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long wear. General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean and fresh from the Pentagon. He is staring off at the recreation area.
C: GENERAL CARLTON
D: What's this all about, Colonel?
E: To Adjutant
C: ADJUTANT
D: A little entertainment for the men, sir. Tonight's Christmas Eve.
E: Turning
C: GENERAL CARLTON
D: These men are moving up tonight. They should be lined up for full inspection!
N: The jeep has come to a halt.
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: You're absolutely right. There's no Christmas in the Army, Colonel.
E: Eyeing him To Adjutant
C: ADJUTANT
D: Yes, sir.
N: Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: There's always a slip-up or two during a change in command. The men get a little loose. But I know I'm leaving them in good hands.
E: To Carlton
C: GENERAL CARLTON
D: Thank you. Sergeant, take me to headquarters immediately! We'll have those men turned out on the double!
E: Stiffly To Driver
N: The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: Goodbye, Sergeant. Take the short cut.
C: SERGEANT
D: Yes, sir!
N: The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him. TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT The Adjutant turns to him.
C: ADJUTANT
D: That's not the way to headquarters!
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: Joe, you know that, and I know that, but the new General doesn't know it. Or he won't for about an hour and a half.
C: ADJUTANT
D: That Sergeant'll be a private tomorrow!
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: Yes... isn't he lucky?
N: He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the recreation area. RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes. They are doing a number to entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR CHRISTMAS? During introduction, we

N: 5A. TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are not noticed by the performers. 5B. GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS seated in audience. They look off, see General, start to rise. 5C. TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself. 5D. PLATFORM - FULL SHOT The number concludes to applause. Bob holds up his hand for silence. He removes his beard.
C: BOB
D: Thanks, fellows. I guess by now you know the Old Man's being replaced by a new Commanding General fresh out of the Pentagon... this divisions's been awfully lucky so far, but tonight they're running a special on St. Christophers at the PX... The Old Man's heading back to the rear - he's never moved in that direction in his life. All I can say is, we owe so much to General Waverly and the way --
C: WAVERLY'S VOICE
D: ATTENTION!
E: A bellow
N: Automatically, Bob stiffens. Phil does the same. AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of the platform.
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: Captain Wallace, button your shirt. You're out of uniform! This division is now under the command of General Harold G. Carlton, and I don't want anyone to forget it -- not that he'll let you. He's tough -- just what this sloppy outfit needs. You'll be standing inspection night and day -- you may even learn how to march. And if you don't give him everything you got, I may come back and fight for the enemy. Merry Christmas!
E: Bob, grinning, hastily buttons his shirt
N: The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".
C: GENERAL WAVERLY
D: Well -- I guess that's about it - uh - uh --
E: Embarrassed
N: Bob, covering his embarrassment:
C: BOB
D: Perhaps I can help you out, sir.
N: He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat. They play THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit. The General stands at attention through the first chorus, visibly moved. During the second chorus he starts up the aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help. Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, faces the men and salutes them. The men return the salute. (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.) There is a Red Cross ambulance standing by.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE SHOT - (NIGHT) - TINY CANDLE THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on a tiny makeshift Christmas tree. We reveal a number of enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including Bob and Phil. One of the men looks at his wristwatch. Now another does. CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH The hand is approaching midnight. CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER He is looking at his wristwatch. CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH The second hand is pointing to the hour. FULL SHOT OF SCENE This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE CHRISTMAS. Phil accompanies him on a harmonica. Toward the end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music. A shell BURSTS in the vicinity. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst. This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which he thinks is unnecessary. Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song left off. Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

S: MED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE
N: Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant. They're warm. One woman has a fan, some use programs. They are enjoying the show, however. There are some vacant seats apparent. This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida. FULL SHOT - AUDIENCE APPLAUDING the conclusion of the number. MED. FULL SHOT - BACKSTAGE The curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up on the next number, which is dancing. Phil and Bob are met by COOKE, the Company Manager. RITA, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus girls and other players ad lib, "Couldn't be cuter!" "Great." "Very funny!"
C: COOKE
D: New York's on the telephone.
E: To Bob and Phil
N: Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone.
C: PHIL
D: Hello. Oscar.
E: Into phone He listens. To Bob and Cooke
S: MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE
N: This is the business office of Bob and Phil. OSCAR is their representative and manager, not their employer. He is sixty and looks competent. He refers to a telegram in his hand. Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall. It must be evident from their billing that the boys are important stars in New York.
C: OSCAR
D: Listen, I just heard what you're doing -- giving the cast a week off with pay for Christmas. You don't know how touched I am. I'm all choked up. Between sobs, I managed to book you on the Ed Harrison show this week to take up the slack. It'll be stealing money.
N: 17A. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Phil is holding the receiver up to Bob. Oscar's VOICE can be plainly heard.
C: PHIL
D: We'll have to go to New York -- four days and four nights of rehearsals -- that's stealing money?

N: 17B. CLOSE SHOT - OSCAR As he speaks into the telephone
C: OSCAR
D: It is for me -- I get ten percent. Next time you guys make a charitable gesture, find out if you got with what to make it. See you Wednesday.
E: He listens for a moment
N: He hangs up. GROUP SHOT - PHIL, BOB AND COOKE Bob hangs up the phone.
C: BOB
D: Well... while the cast takes it easy we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie.
C: COOKE
D: What train do you want? There's a one-thirty this morning but you have to sit up all night.
C: PHIL
D: Let's get out tonight.
C: BOB
D: Okay.
N: The boys walk to their dressing room. A group of the chorines come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing. They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all.
C: PHIL
D: What are we going to do until one- thirty?
C: BOB
D: We'll eat dinner.
C: PHIL
D: Eat, eat All you think of is your stomach!
E: Looking at the retreating bouncing
N: Rita shows up in front of Phil.
C: RITA
D: You said you had something to rehearse with me after the show. What is it?
E: Eagerly
N: Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self- conscious at being caught.
C: PHIL
D: It's a kind of new dance number.
C: RITA
D: I'm ready.
E: Eagerly
C: BOB
D: He isn't. Some business has come up. See you in a week. Come on, Romeo, dinner! Lamb chops, lamb chops!
E: Taking Phil by the arm He pulls Phil away Tempting him
C: PHIL

N: MED. SHOT - WATERFRONT INN - BOB AND PHIL - (NIGHT) The boys are now finishing their dinner. Bob is facing the orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it. The MUSIC plays, the boys eat. The table is close to the bar. On two stools sit JUDY and BETTY. Betty is wearing her glasses and examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed her by the bartender. Phil is not paying attention to his eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over the bar stool. Bob cannot see the girls and is not even interested enough to turn around. MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY On her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is unobtrusively sizing up Phil.
C: BETTY
D: We'll have to rush to get the 1:30 train.
E: Checking the tickets
N: CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND BOB Bob notices Phil's absorption.
C: BOB
D: Have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile?
C: PHIL
D: What other kind is there? 'The Stewart Sisters.' Sister act!
E: He picks up the card which announces the performers names and reads He smacks his lips. He doesn't realize that these two girls are the Stewart Sisters
C: BOB
D: Down, Rover, down. Remember, we have an agreement--you chase no new tidbits during the season. You were man enough to give me your hand on it.
C: PHIL
D: You were sneaky enough to take it.
N: MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly eyeing Phil. She leans forward.

E: Quietly Judy's eyes are toward Phil. A little louder
C: JUDY
D: He's awful cute.
C: BETTY

C: JUDY
D: Canton, Ohio wasn't so much.
E: Mock seriousness

C: BOB
D: Shoot.
C: PHIL
D: Four feet two inches tall. Pudgy. Round races. Have big bows in their hair. Always smiling. Lots of teeth. Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else. Two, three hundred teeth at a time. The American Dental Association is investigating it.
E: He parodies a smile
N: There is a drum roll from the orchestra. Betty takes off her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar. The bandleader's voice announces:
C: BANDLEADER
D: Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart Sisters!
N: The audience applauds politely while the girls start toward the platform, Phil reacts in surprise to the new development. 23-A. PLATFORM - FULL SHOT Betty and Judy do their number: "SISTERS". As they take their bows -- MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL Phil pretends to recognize Judy.

D: Remember that girl I told you about who got sick in St. Paul? That's her! The girl in the oxygen tent! I told you about her! The road company of "Student Prince." The whole company went to church and prayed for her! It was the most touching thing I've ever seen in show business.
N: (HE GETS UP.) I'll bring her over. He goes, Bob watching, disgusted. NOVELLO, the owner of the Waterfront Inn, comes up. MED. SHOT - BOB AND NOVELLO Novello evidently knows Bob.
C: NOVELLO
D: Didn't you get your dessert yet, Mr. Wallace?
C: BOB

C: PHIL
D: Where are you going to be for Christmas?
C: JUDY
D: We're booked in Vermont.
C: PHIL
D: Vermont? What's there?
C: BETTY
D: Snow. We spent last Christmas in South Carolina, the year before in Hawaii. They didn't seem like Christmases. There ought to be snow. This one's going to be real white.
C: BOB
D: Well, it's the way you've been raised. If you saw a lot of snow when you were a kid you miss it more around Christmas. There's a lot of snow around St. Paul.
C: JUDY
D: Is that where you come from - St. Paul?
N: It dawns on him, slowly. He shows no emotion.
C: BOB
D: No. You come from St. Paul.
C: JUDY
D: I come from Canton, Ohio.
C: BOB
D: I'd like to ask you something. Were you ever in an oxygen tent?

D: Oxygen tent? Oh no!
C: BOB
D: Were you ever in a road company of "Student Prince?"
C: BETTY
D: No. Why?

C: PHIL
D: Thank you.

D: What I admire are the details, the invention, the little lies all around the big one. It takes talent.
C: PHIL
D: Oh, it's nothing.
C: BOB
D: Don't say that. Don't belittle yourself. Credit where credit is due. You did it fine.

C: BOB
D: You sure?
C: BETTY
D: I'm positive. I trained her myself.

C: BETTY
D: Well, you keep an eye on him, and I'll keep an eye on her.
C: BOB
D: Fine. We can make out the probation report together.
N: The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song. (To be decided upon.) The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy and Phil, individually. Toward the end of the vocal Phil dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water. This blends into their dance. The staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number. The audience applauds and they all go back to their booth. MED.

E: Apologetically
C: BOB
D: That's considerate! How'd you arrange that?
C: NOVELLO
D: I'm a taxpayer here! You better go in and change, girls! You haven't much time!
N: The girls start off, confused. Novello, Bob and Phil follow.
C: BOB
D: May I enquire what you are being arrested for?
C: BETTY
D: The owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it.
C: JUDY
D: We couldn't have dropped a cigarette because we don't smoke.
C: BETTY
D: He wants two hundred dollars, but it's just plain stealing.
C: JUDY
D: We left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed.

C: JUDY
D: What are we going to do now?

N: The Sheriff watches them go, pleased. A pounding on the door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns. He strides to the door, takes out his key and opens it. MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the departing police car, the noise having distracted them from the door pounding. The siren is still heard, retreating. The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet. They turn to him, faces alight.

N: All but Phil are half dozing. One or two other people are seen in the background, asleep. There is an air of peace and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues. Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes emanating from the surrounding countryside. Phil turns to the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising Vermont. CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept. This is the WINTER FANTASY production number. At the end of the fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree. Pine Tree, Vermont." MED.

S: MED. SHOT - INT. COLUMBIA INN
N: MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk. The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying the mail, walks toward her.
C: SUSAN
D: Mail, Martha.
N: She puts the mail on the desk.
C: MARTHA
D: What's the weather forecast down at the Post Office?
E: As she shuffles through it
C: SUSAN
D: Awful. Fair and warmer.
C: MARTHA
D: If we don't get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house. We haven't had a guest for three weeks.
C: SUSAN
D: What are you looking for?
E: As Martha keeps searching through the mail
C: MARTHA
D: Your grandfather's written Washington asking if he can get back in active service. I think he wants to fly jets.
E: Not finding it
C: SUSAN
D: I think he could do it.
C: MARTHA
D: He says older men have been called, and besides, he misses the food. I tell you, Susan, he tried to make it a casual letter, with little jokes, but it came out just begging.
N: Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow. His back is to CAMERA.
C: SUSAN
D: Oh, Martha! What are we going to do?
E: Moved
C: MARTHA
D: I don't know. Don't let on we know he's written. He'll start in I'm only his housekeeper and that I found out through some chicanery or something.
E: Blowing her nose
C: SUSAN
D: How did you find out?
E: Soothing her
C: MARTHA
D: Like any housekeeper -- I read the carbon paper. Bring him the mail.
E: She hands the mail to Susan
N: Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window. After a moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls. He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General Waverly. He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

E: Smiling

D: Well, to put it in one sentence, people don't expect major generals to carry firewood.
N: Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking:
C: PHIL
D: Bob, I was thinking we ought to -
N: Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door, when he sees Waverly. He freezes. He brings his hand up to a salute, from that position.
C: WAVERLY
D: At ease!
C: PHIL
D: Oh, sir! A janitor!
E: Horrified

C: MARTHA
D: Last time I looked. But who are they going to sing to?
C: WAVERLY
D: Even if it's only to you and me, it will be well worth it. Besides, there will be six inches of snow tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow.
C: BETTY
D: Is that the weather forecast?
E: Happily
C: WAVERLY
D: No. But if there was one thing I learned in the army it was to be positive -- especially when you don't know what you're talking about. You'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P.
N: Phil and Bob stiffen automatically.
C: PHIL AND BOB

There is a scant audience distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen in number. Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil are sitting at one table. Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting as hostess. Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and helping out at table. MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL They are admiring the performance. Phil indicates for Bob to look in this direction. Bob does. REVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT The General is seating a table. MED.

N: MED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, but the few people in the audience don't make for much clatter. One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest and clearest. MED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding. He walks toward the boys, still applauding. They applaud too. The girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys. Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at her. Then her enthusiasm is boundless.
C: WAVERLY
D: Excellent. I enjoyed it very much.
C: JUDY
D: Thank you.

D: It was nice, if you like music.

D: You've been very nice not canceling, we'd like to make a gesture. Until it snows, and you have guests, we'll take half salary.

Have everybody on the train first thing in the morning. The whole Troupe, and the scenery, and the costumes... You'll have to cancel us off the Ed Harrison Show... Oscar, remember your blood pressure. Incidentally, how much will this cost? Good night, Oscar. There you are.

C: BOB
D: Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming?

T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: FULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY) The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show. The little stage has been enlarged - the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther. There is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room. Trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks arrive. Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness of the previous scene. THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls standing nearby. Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.
C: MARTHA
D: I can't believe it! You mean you brought the whole show up here?
C: BOB
D: When you hired the Stewart sisters you also hired a New York show. It was in the small print.
C: PHIL
D: And you can't get out of it. We've got lawyers.
C: SUSAN
D: I can't thank you enough, but I wonder if Gramp'll let you do it?
C: PHIL
D: Why not?
C: MARTHA
D: His pride. When he decides he's going into bankruptcy he likes to go.
C: BOB
D: Now just a second. We're not doing this for him!
C: PHIL
D: Oh no! We're bringing the show down here to rehearse!
C: BOB
D: The company's been getting a little ragged. We'd appreciate the use of the hall.
C: PHIL
D: Of course we don't expect it free!
C: BOB
D: We'll pay a little, but not much. - You see, the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us, that's quite an improvement.
N: This has not fooled Susan. She throws her arms around Bob and then Phil.
C: SUSAN
D: I don't know what to say!
N: She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out. There is a moment of silence.
C: BOB
D: I hope this is not an indication of advancing age, getting kissed out of gratitude.

C: PHIL
D: That's what we said. Ideal.

C: WAVERLY
D: Where are you going to get the audience?
C: PHIL
D: Oh, what guests there are in the other hotels. They're pretty bored here without snow, and a New York show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.

N: Music has underscored this scene. Betty is wide awake. She is looking toward the window. As the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, putting out his pipe. This is followed by an equally diffused figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, and joining Bob. Bob takes her in his arms.

N: Betty whirls around. MED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB We see Bob is having a snack of his own.
C: BETTY
D: Oh!
C: BOB
D: What are you doing? Sleep-walking?
C: BETTY
D: I couldn't sleep.
C: BOB
D: Little young for that, aren't you?
N: He gets up and goes to the refrigerator. His preoccupation with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for Bob, since their significance must escape him.
C: BOB
D: What shall I make you?
C: BETTY
D: Anything'll do.
C: BOB
D: If you tell me what you want to dream about I'll know what to make you.
C: BETTY
D: How's that?
E: Amused
C: BOB
D: Different foods make for different dreams. I've got a whole theory about it. It's called "The Wallace Way of Wishful Wooing." You'll find it in the American Medical Journal under 'W'. Ham and Swiss cheese, for instance, you get a cool, thin, blonde girl. Turkey sandwich, you get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy though. Now a liverwurst sandwich - you get both girls at once. Bad night.
E: He shakes his head
C: BETTY
D: What do you dream on tuna?
C: BOB
D: Darndest thing, I dream about me.
C: BETTY
D: Then I'll have a tuna sandwich.
E: Evenly
N: Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.
C: BOB
D: Now that's very flattering. Tuna coming up. Let me make you some warm milk. That'll help the insomnia.
E: He is occupied at the frigidaire while she watches him yearningly
C: BETTY
D: No it won't. Warm milk won't do it.
E: Meaningly Looking straight at his back
C: BOB
D: Whatever you've got on your mind isn't worth staying awake for.
C: BETTY
D: I think it is.
N: He smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines.
C: BOB
D: Would you like to know how I handle a situation like that...?
C: BETTY
D: Tell me, Doctor...
N: Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares the warm milk and hands it to her. She drinks it down. As he reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the table, Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward Bob. He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between her head and her chair. She waits, eyes closed, expectantly. But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door and exits, closing it softly behind him. After a moment, Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.

S: LONG SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)
N: Various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and sitting around the room. The orchestra is playing the introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of six girls who are just coming on the floor. Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal. Judy is standing across from the piano. Betty is seated on the sidelines with her legs stretched over two chairs. She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock. Phil, standing close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn. He looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet.
C: PHIL
D: Don't make them too tight. I wear size 12.
C: BOB
D: All right kids! Places! Let's get going! Phil, you're on!
N: Phil reacts. Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water. Albert holds a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration.
C: BOB
D: How long are we so far?
E: To Albert
C: ALBERT
D: An hour and ten minutes.
C: BOB
D: Something has to come out.
N: From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns, reaches center floor and begins his solo. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY She continues knitting while watching Phil dancing. As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to Phil's feet. At the end of the number, which is applauded by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him, THE CAMERA STAYING at this distance. Bob, looking at Betty, mistakenly sees her disappointment.
C: BOB
D: All right, places for the next number! You're next, Sylvia. What's the trouble?
E: He turns to Sylvia Sylvia and Albert exchange peculiar glances, Bob senses it
C: ALBERT
D: Mr. Wallace -
E: He is embarrassed to go on
C: BOB
D: Come on, out with it.
C: ALBERT
D: I don't think Sylvia ought to go on, unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes. Very easy waltzes.
N: Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy.
C: BOB
D: You're kidding!
C: SYLVIA
D: We don't want anyone else to know.
C: ALBERT
D: Please don't mention it. For heaven's sake!
E: The orchestra starts to play ROCKABYE BABY. Sylvia and Albert are startled
C: SYLVIA
D: How did they know?
N: The girls start crowding around.
C: GIRLS
D: You wouldn't tell us, would you? We had to find out ourselves, etc.
E: Ad libbing Phil and Judy are among the group
C: MARTHA
D: There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show!
E: Formally Everyone approves
N: MED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT Phil puts his arm around Albert.
C: PHIL
D: Obviously you're going to call the boy after me!
C: BOB
D: After you? I hired Sylvia! The baby'll be named after me!
C: PHIL
D: I've been dancing with her! That's more important! The baby'll be named after me!
C: BOB
D: The hiring was more important! After me!
C: PHIL
D: The dancing was more important! After me!
C: ALBERT
D: I'm her husband. The baby'll be named after me.
E: Small pause
C: BOB
D: Well, we're going to need another dancer!
C: PHIL
D: How about Judy, she knows all the routines, she could pick it up in no time.
N: They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group now includes Betty.
C: BOB
D: On the other hand, it's all right if we lose a number, we're running too long now. We have to cut somewhere.
C: BETTY
D: Wouldn't it be better if you cut my solo number? I've never felt right in it anyway. The show needs every bit of his dancing.
E: Indicating Phil
C: BOB
D: Well -
E: Interpreting this as mere selflessness for love
C: BETTY
D: There you are - painless.
N: She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming emotional. Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks is her devotion. MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty. He looks at Phil and shakes his head.
C: BOB
D: Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number. Old Chinese saying.
C: PHIL
D: What are you talking about?
E: All this is beyond him
C: BOB
D: Drink your coffee.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT) This is the party later that evening. Some people are dancing. Others are grouped about, and there is a general home party atmosphere. The General, Martha and Susan are seen helping everyone to feel at home. The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the impending baby are sketchily HEARD. The CAMERA CONTINUES toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL. Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who is dancing with Rita. Rita nestles up close to Phil. This is seen by Bob and Betty. Bob smiles. CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND RITA On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor.
C: PHIL
D: Don't you want me to breathe?
E: Referring to the grip
C: RITA
D: Not especially.
C: PHIL
D: What's gotten into you?
C: RITA
D: You were chasing me in Florida.
C: PHIL
D: And you were running. What made you stop?
C: RITA
D: You're interested in Judy, aren't you?
C: PHIL
D: That's it, eh? Unless it belongs to someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch!
E: Evidently Rita has deliberately stepped on his instep
N: SCENE FROM BOB'S VIEWPOINT Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but yield. Bob's reaction still implies that this is understandable since Betty loves Phil. He turns back toward the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and Phil. Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil over to Judy. CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY Judy is a little cool.
C: PHIL
D: What's the matter?
C: JUDY
D: Nothing is the matter.
C: PHIL
D: This isn't the way you dance.
C: JUDY
D: Some people dance closer than others.
N: Phil is delighted that she is jealous.
C: PHIL
D: Yes, that's true. I'm one of the close ones. That's my type.
N: He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased with himself. MED. FULL SHOT - ROOM The dance music stops. The people disperse. MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PIANO Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of A MAN CHASES A GIRL. Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano, Bob humming the melody. Betty pantomimes to the others to quiet down. Bob starts to sing the lyric. In the second chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty. During this chorus we CUT TO show various reactions of the group, and end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand. CLOSE TWO SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY We HEAR Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last four bars.
C: PHIL
D: And once you've caught him, don't ever let him go.
E: Singing; looking at Judy
N: APPLAUSE follows the song. Phil gets up.
C: PHIL
D: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make an announcement.
N: FULL SHOT - CROWD Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement.
C: PHIL
D: It is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing. I am him! - Or he! - Or it! Anyway, Judy has caught me. What I'm trying to say is, we're engaged.
N: He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her. He hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations. MED. SHOT - BOB He is flabbergasted. MED. SHOT - GROUP Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators. Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm.
C: BETTY
D: I hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world.
N: Bob sees her emotion through the speech. Betty notices Judy upset, shaking off the people around her and running through the doorway to the kitchen. Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE.
S: MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN
N: Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters.
C: BETTY
D: Darling, don't cry.
C: JUDY
D: I didn't know he was going to make that announcement, I swear I didn't.
E: Turning to her
N: Betty puts one arm around her.
C: BETTY
D: I know you didn't.
C: JUDY
D: He had no right to do that.
C: BETTY
D: You do love him, don't you?
C: JUDY
D: That doesn't matter.
C: BETTY
D: Nothing else matters.
C: JUDY
D: We're not going to break up our act.
N: Phil enters the kitchen.
C: PHIL
D: I've been looking for you, Judy.
C: BETTY
D: Excuse me.
N: She goes through the corridor toward the living room. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry getting some drinks for the guests. He is not seen by Betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears. Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the corridor from the living room.
C: BOB
D: Don't take this too much to heart. Phil is a great kid but constancy isn't his long suit.
C: BETTY
D: I'm not the least bit worried. Frankly, this couldn't come at a better time. They want me to come back to The Carousel again - I used to sing there before Judy and I teamed up - and I had to turn it down because they can only use a single. So - this couldn't be more convenient. You stay with the show and I'll go back to The Carousel.
E: Phil and Judy enter from the kitchen Not too well
C: JUDY
D: When did you get this offer?
C: BETTY
D: Just today, as a matter of fact. I got a telegram.
C: JUDY
D: Why didn't you mention it before?
C: BETTY
D: I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
C: JUDY
D: Where is the telegram?
C: BETTY
D: I threw it away. What is this, a third degree? You don't think I made it up?
C: JUDY
D: Yes, I do.
N: There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each one, speaks.
C: WAVERLY
D: Well now, I wouldn't bet any large sum of money on that, since I took the message over the telephone, and I had to deliver the telegram. And she didn't tip me, either.
E: To take the tension off
N: Betty looks at him gratefully.
C: JUDY
D: Oh, Betty! I'm sorry! I misunderstood!
E: She throws her arms around her
C: BETTY
D: Now, baby! It's all right!
C: PHIL
D: Well, everything's fine now!
N: Happy, he beams at Judy. MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY Something bothers Bob about this story. He looks searchingly at Betty, puzzled. He does not notice Waverly, who watches him watching Betty.
T: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
N: LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY Train about to leave. The General is in the foreground sitting in the buggy. Betty is saying goodbye to him. Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.
C: GENERAL
D: Where are you going to be?
E: Shouting over noise of train
C: BETTY
D: The Carousel.
N: The General looks at her, questioningly.
C: BETTY
D: I sent them a telegram this morning.
E: Whispering, during a lull in the noise
N: The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train, starting up the steps. The notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam. The manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment. To emphasize it: Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, consciously, her affection. We hear Betty:
C: BETTY
D: Take care of my little sister.
C: BOB
D: She can take care of herself. Worry about the menfolk. Now don't forget to write.
C: BETTY
D: I'll send you picture postcards.
N: Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching the scene with a whimsical look. He, as does the audience, realizes Bob's true feelings. As the train starts to leave, Betty and Bob shake hands. She holds his handshake a little longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with the train. Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after the train, puzzled. REVERSE ANGLE THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight. Betty wipes away a tear. In the background we see the General in the buggy noticing this. MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background. Bob joins the General at the buggy. From Waverly's expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.
C: WAVERLY
D: Must be interesting to be a woman.
C: BOB
D: The idea's never occurred to me, sir.
C: WAVERLY
D: Well, think about it. Well?
E: Bob is thinking about it
C: BOB
D: Not interested!
C: WAVERLY
D: A man like you must be an expert on women.
C: BOB
D: It's a little immodest to say so, but I consider myself an authority on the fair sex, I've made a study of the subject. They're simple creatures.
C: WAVERLY
D: They couldn't fool you?
C: BOB
D: I'm single.
C: WAVERLY
D: 'Pride goeth before a fall.'
C: BOB
D: 'Who knows his own strength is twice armed.'
C: WAVERLY
D: It's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field. Tell me, why do you think Betty went to New York?
C: BOB
D: She has a job in The Carousel.
E: Not willing to admit it
C: WAVERLY
D: Expert, you're wrong! She went to New York because she's so in love with someone here she just couldn't stand it.
C: BOB
D: Phil. I'm darned if I can figure out why.
E: A mixture of resentment and frustration
C: WAVERLY
D: I thought you were an expert on women. Come on, Delilah!
E: To the horse

N: CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY THE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve. Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil and Judy rehearse. The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's part, but it is lover's coolness.
C: PHIL
D: Good, Judy. Now the same as the middle part.
E: Fitting the action During the dancing
N: They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, dancing as one. REVERSE ANGLE - BOB He enters the room, and watches. He looks intently at Phil. Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue dancing, talking as they do.
C: PHIL
D: Betty get off all right?
C: BOB
D: Certainly.
E: Slightly belligerent
C: JUDY
D: Betty left something for you. She said to give it to you after she left. It's on the piano.
N: Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil. Phil becomes conscious of the staring.
C: PHIL
D: What's the matter?
C: BOB
D: I don't get it.
C: PHIL
D: Don't get what?
C: BOB
D: I just don't see it. You' re skinny, you got a big nose, and you squint.
C: PHIL
D: Who? Me?
C: BOB
D: Yes, you! Nothing personal though.
C: PHIL
D: No, of course not.
C: BOB
D: I'm just trying to figure out what anyone sees in you.
C: PHIL
D: Well, stop worrying about it. When I ask you for a date just turn me down. Come on, Judy.
N: They dance away. Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the package Betty left for him. He opens it up and it is a single knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously. He looks through the box for its mate. There is none. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Bob, puzzled.

D: How about it, Waverly, want to play?
E: Starting a new game
C: WAVERLY
D: I'm too young for that sort of thing.

C: WAVERLY
D: Kind of warm for that kind of exercise, isn't it?
C: BOB
D: It isn't very warm. I think the weatherman's wrong about his forecast. Those look like snow clouds to me.
E: Trying to help He looks to the sky
C: WAVERLY
D: They're cumulus clouds, at an elevation of seven thousand feet.
E: Without looking up

C: WAVERLY
D: Yes. I miss the Army.
C: BOB
D: Where are you going to be sent, sir?
C: WAVERLY
D: Well, I'm not sure yet. I've always been a combat officer, but I got an idea they're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me. They'd better not. They just better not. I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet. Now nothing to the women folk about this!
E: He's worked up now He smiles

N: The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back.

D: Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old -
E: Reading He stops
C: WAVERLY
D: Skip that word.
E: Pleased
C: BOB
D: Yes, sir. It certainly was a surprise hearing from you. Your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine. Of course you've got plenty of time to be amusing, sitting on that porch, rocking away, while we put in a full day's work. You always were a lucky stiff, and I envy you. A few years more, I was saying to Emmy the other evening, and I'm going to be able to take it easy like old Tom.

All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to their respective tables as the song finishes. MED. SHOT - WAVERLY He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage. The audience is seated. Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great affection. The people begin to shout, "Speech! Speech!"

Neckties will be worn in this area! I have also noticed a deterioration in the quality of saluting! This is to be improved! I have also had complaints from the commanding officer of the rest area in Naples! He informs me that the non-fraternization rule is constantly being broken by men of this division! In fact, this division is outstanding in its violations of non-fraternization! You all know the rules! The non- fraternization ban expressly declares you are not to talk to women! Don't talk to them!

In the exultation, General Waverly places two fingers to his lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval. We underscore with MUSIC indicating another number is taking place on stage, although we do not see it. SECTION OF AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE Ed Harrison crosses to General Waverly and whispers to him.
C: ED HARRISON
D: Long distance call for you, sir.
N: Waverly looks surprised, but rises and starts out. Bob, visible in b.g., has been watching. He and Harrison exchange knowing glances. AT HOTEL DESK - MED. SHOT The lobby is empty; in b.g. are the doors to the dining room, where the show is in progress. The telephone lies on the counter. Waverly enters and crosses to it. He is a little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment.

D: Hurry up, hurry up, I'm busy. Yes, this is General Waverly.
E: Into phone, gruffly
N: He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier.
C: WAVERLY
D: And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr. President... Yes, practically the whole outfit is here. A little paunchy, but they're here. It certainly was a surprise -- more like a frameup. As usual, my Intelligence was not functioning efficiently... Yes? That's very nice of you, Mr. President... any time you want me, just say the word... but may I add this? It isn't always necessary to take a job... sometimes it's enough just to know it's there.
E: Quietly Long pause
N: Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin to SNOW. The General notices it for the first time, and his face brightens.
C: WAVERLY
D: If you ever take it into your mind to grab a little rest from all that work I wish you'd drop in on us here -- I can't promise you any golf but -- -- we can certainly give you plenty of snow, Mr, President... Yes, Mr. President... What? Thanks, Ike.
E: As he looks at the falling snow Smiles
N: He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet. He lifts the bell on the desk with a loud bang. Martha hurries in, startled.

D: You frightened me to death! That bell hasn't been used for three months!
C: GENERAL
D: Get this area policed up. No telling who might be dropping in.
N: Martha salutes.
C: MARTHA
D: Yes, sir!
N: She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby door which is blown open by the wind. Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress on the stage. Waverly now turns and walks into the dining room.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - MOVING CAMERA
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance. As he passes Susan, we see she is reacting to something on the stage. CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to: STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas tree. Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, etc. Bob and Betty are seen singing. Throughout action of this number Phil and Judy dance. In addition there is staged movement by the ensemble. Bob and Betty are on each side of the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating with one hand behind the cutout tree. CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them behind the tree. It is now that we see very clearly that the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered by the falling snow. Also, we see pine trees in the snow that are decorated. Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock she gave him in scene 110. Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe and the sock, and smiles at Betty. She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is wearing the other sock. They laugh and embrace. REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible. One by one, the trees are lighted. AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE Martha and Susan are standing happily beside the General, each holding one of his arms.
