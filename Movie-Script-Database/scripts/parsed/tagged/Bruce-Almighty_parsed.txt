S: INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY
N: A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY, MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the background. BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying to place a large segment of wayward hair.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong. This is a bad sign. We really need to get a make-up person?! The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
E: calling out
C: ALLY
D: Not in the budget. And not to * worry, you're going to look great in this. She holds out a HAIR NET.
C: BRUCE
D: A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair net. I just did the hair.
C: ALLY
D: Health code. In the kitchen or around the cookie, you gotta have it.
E: matter of fact
C: BRUCE
D: You guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose. Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
E: to crew: re hair net
C: BRUCE
D: Remind me to swing by an elementary * school after this and serve lunch. Ally laughs.
C: ALLY
D: You're a thing of beauty. In three, two, one. . . Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
E: Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his "REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms Bruce's version is to the 7th power.
C: BRUCE
D: For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo. Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about?
C: GUSTOV
D: Well, Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why don't we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in Buffalo?' And I said, 'Yeah, sure.'
C: BRUCE
D: Wow. Fascinating. Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
C: BRUCE
D: The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time. The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
C: BRUCE
D: As we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. What are we really looking at here?
E: CONT'D MORE
C: BRUCE
D: Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in. And finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live.
E: CONT'D motions his eyes to the Kowolski twins
N: Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
C: BRUCE
D: And that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News. Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh. The frame FREEZES. We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now... INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
E: CONT'D
N: Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album.
C: BRUCE
D: So, what do you think?
C: GRACE
D: It's good.
C: BRUCE
D: It sucks. It's a story about a cookie. People with eating disorders will be riveted, Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece. I can't wait to vomit so I can make room for more cookies.
E: goes into huge pathetic fan character
C: GRACE
D: I thought it was funny. I love the hair net. How'd you get it to do that?
C: BRUCE
D: What? I'm cutting that. They made me wear that stupid thing. I don't even look like myself. The hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. Right out of the gate, I lost the hair advantage. Grace looks at a photo,
C: GRACE
D: Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My sister is so drunk. She places it in the album.
C: BRUCE
D: Grace. Try to stay focused here. I need your help.
C: GRACE
D: Aren't you taking this a little too seriously?
C: BRUCE
D: It's sweeps Grace. It is serious. There's an anchor job open. This is important. This is our future! Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
C: GRACE
D: I'm sorry. Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly has a fragile temperament.
C: BRUCE
D: I'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. I want my work to matter.
E: sighs
C: GRACE
D: It does matter. You're funny. You make people smile. Come on, take a break, help me put this album together.
C: BRUCE
D: Alright. Grace holds up a photo.
E: reluctant
C: GRACE
D: Oh look at this. It's the first day we moved in together. It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
C: BRUCE
D: Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
E: down
C: GRACE
D: Oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. I caught the bouquet. It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet.
C: BRUCE
D: You look pretty intense, hun.
C: GRACE
D: Well, I was thinking about you. Grace cuddles into Bruce.
C: BRUCE
D: So, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say? Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
C: GRACE
D: You have no idea.
C: BRUCE
D: I was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, I may lose my resolve. Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
C: GRACE
D: Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles. They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.
C: BRUCE
D: Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. From the diaphragm. That's the way the cookie crumbles.
E: newscaster voice
C: GRACE
D: Oh, say it again.
C: BRUCE
D: That's the way the cookie crumbles.
E: bigger
C: GRACE
D: Oh, I just love on-air personalities.
E: sweet, southern groupie
C: BRUCE
D: Well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net. Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom. CUT TO: A TELEVISION SCREEN
E: newscaster voice
N: We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:
C: NEWS CLIP
D: I'm Ed Bradley, I'm Merely Safer, an d I ' m -- LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART. Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.
C: BRUCE
D: ...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty Minutes. THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS We are in. . .
S: INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
C: GRACE
D: Sweety, time to get up... She kisses Bruce, gets up.
C: BRUCE
D: No, I'm having a great dream. The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME. Bruce throws a mock hissy fit. INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
C: SPORTSCASTER
D: ...and the Sabers lost another close one last night. Four to three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
C: BRUCE
D: Of course they lost, they're my team. CUT TO: MOMENTS LATER
N: Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign- off.
C: BRUCE
D: "And that's the way the cookie crumbles." You know, I think there might be something to that cookie line. Everything great anchor has his own signature sign-off. "And that's the way the cookie crumbles." ANGLE - SAM
E: calls to Grace as Walter Cronkite
N: Peeing in the corner on the carpet.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh no! Grace, the dog!
C: GRACE
D: I'm in the shower!
E: O.S.
C: BRUCE
D: Ah! INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
C: BRUCE
D: Whoops, sorry. EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, you're all done, huh? B-e-a-utiful. EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
C: GRACE
D: Wow, nice car, huh?
C: BRUCE
D: Yeah, if you want to rub your success in people's faces. Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
C: BRUCE
D: What's with the hubbub?
C: GRACE
D: We're having a blood drive.
C: BRUCE
D: Creepy. Needles, yech...
C: GRACE
D: Oh, that's a nice response.
C: BRUCE
D: I mean, it's just s o . . .
C: GRACE
D: Helpful and life saving?
C: BRUCE
D: C'mon, that's your...blood. It's in your body and I don't think it's supposed to come out. Besides, they stockpile that stuff. They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage.
C: GRACE
D: They do not. Now stop it. I'm * giving. I have a very rare blood * type, AB positive.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive they aint touchin' me with no needle. Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
C: GRACE
D: O. . . She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
E: suddenly remembers something
C: BRUCE
D: What's that?
C: GRACE
D: Prayer beads. The kids made 'em. Keep you safe.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, I hope they work, cause it's going take a miracle to get me to work on time. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.
N: A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is oblivious.
C: BRUCE
D: This is just my luck. Bruce's BEEPER sounds. He checks it.
C: BRUCE.
D: The meeting's starting, perfect... Screw it. He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
E: thinks
C: BRUCE
D: Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's kill or be killed, only the strong survive, no guts, no glory1
E: laughs
C: SFX: SIREN
D: Bruce pulls over, fumes.
C: BRUCE
D: Thank you. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN reads:
E: looking heavenward
C: R EWE BLIND?
D: Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on. INT. NEWSROOM - DAY Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.
C: BOBBY
D: Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy. Don't even move, I got somethin' special today. My mom made it just for you.
C: BRUCE
D: Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go- I'm late...
C: BOBBY
D: You like Quiche? He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
E: bending down
C: BOBBY
D: You know, contrary to popular belief the quiche was actually invented by the Mayans, then stolen by the French. They shoulda said, "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's Mayan!" Bobby belts out a laugh.
C: BRUCE
D: Bobby, I can't, I--
C: BOBBY
D: Just taste it, taste it... Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking it with exasperation.
C: BRUCE
D: Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
C: BOBBY
D: That's a buck seventy-five.
C: BRUCE
D: Can you get Kelly- Ahh... Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for cash.
C: BOBBY
D: Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o- five, two-ten...
E: excited
N: Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
C: BOBBY
D: Way out of our league, huh? Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
C: BOBBY
D: You know, I saw them editing your cookie piece.
C: BRUCE
D: Really?
C: BOBBY
D: They must have gotten high or something, cause they was orderin' everything, I had. Hey, how long have you been interested in pastry? 'Cause I've got an aunt who makes baklava twenty layers deep.
C: BRUCE
D: Bobby.
E: holding money out
C: BOBBY
D: Maybe you could do a story on her! Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
E: gets a brilliant idea

E: calling after
N: ON THE MONITOR:
C: EVAN
D: Is something killing your kids? Find out tonight at eleven. Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on.
C: IN THE ROOM
D: The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a constant furrow in his brow. Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture, perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it. FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned, vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally Loman.
C: JACK
D: Okay, promos are approved, let's--
C: ALLY
D: Ah, isn't that last one a little misleading? I mean, the story's about flu shots. Do we have to scare people to death?
C: EVAN
D: No, just into watching. Or I could change it to: "Slow news day, come yawn with us. At eleven."
C: FRED
D: Sniffles at eleven is nice.
C: DALLAS
D: Attack of the killer sniffles?
C: ALLY
D: The tanning booth is starting to zap your brain, you know that?
E: to Dallas
C: DALLAS
D: I don't use a tanning booth. A beat and they all crack up. FRED * Come on. You're turning orange. * EVAN * He looks Florida ripe to me. . * More laughs. *
C: JACK
D: I would have swore I already said this, but promos are approved. Now * can we move on? *
C: ALLY
D: Jack, shouldn't the promos be * focusing on Pete's retirement. This is his last week.
C: EVAN
D: Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open anchor position, Jack?
E: leading
C: JACK
D: Evan, you'11 know something when I know something. Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
C: BRUCE
D: Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault. The traffic was -- You guys already played the spots?
C: JACK
D: Nice story, Bruce, but we're going with Evan's piece on the sex scandal at the mayor's office for sweeps. This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
C: EVAN
D: And that's the way the cookie crumbles. The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
C: EVAN
D: I'm just messin' with you, Bruce. See you've got to remember that the news room is like a cookie... More laughs.
C: BRUCE
D: That's great Evan.
E: re: Evan's perfect posture MORE
N: BRUCE (cont'd) Is you're posture naturally that good, or do you have to shove a stick up there?
C: JACK
D: Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're holding your story in reserve. Now, can we get back to the board so we have something to air today? Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce slides down into his chair, deflated. INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce catches up .to him.
C: BRUCE
D: Jack, Jack, hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
C: JACK
D: Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
C: BRUCE
D: Sweeps. Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
C: BOBBY
D: Don't worry about it. I called my aunt, we're on. Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
C: BRUCE
D: Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm getting desperate man, I am pushing forty and what have I got to show for it? The point is, I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. Some kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And Evan is just lovin' it, by the way. He gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more like Evan.
C: JACK
D: You don't want to be like Evan. Evan's an asshole.
C: BRUCE
D: I can be an asshole.
C: JACK
D: No, Bruce. You can't. Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other for a beat.
C: JACK
D: Are you going to pick that up?
C: BRUCE
D: Yeah, I'm sorry. Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
C: BRUCE
D: It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA saunters by.
C: JACK BRUCE
D: Hi, Susan. Hi, Susan.
C: SUSAN ORTEGA
D: Hi, Jack. Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
C: JACK
D: Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter. You make people laugh. God knows today we can use it. Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before. * JACK * Alright, tell you what. It's the * 23rd anniversary of the Maid of the Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour.
E: beat

C: JACK
D: Well now you and Evan get the live feeds.
C: BRUCE
D: I'm going live. In sweeps.
C: JACK
D: Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce. I've seen your outtakes. Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
C: BRUCE
D: Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. I will not forget you when I go national. Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS... INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY

S: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE. A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him around, breaking and painting over his signs. Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
C: BRUCE
D: Hey, come on guys. What are you doin'? Just leave him alone. They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off. Bruce helps the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.
C: BRUCE
D: Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'. They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile, swinging and kicking. Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.

C: GRACE
D: Bruce, don't talk like that.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, don't worry, he's not listening. If he is he doesn't care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's God. They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. I think it's time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs.

D: Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi And I'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. I'm not okay with a mediocre job. I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE! Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the photo albums to floor.

C: BRUCE
D: Well, hello again 772-5623, don't hold your breath. Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom. The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the bathroom. INT. BATHROOM
N: A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says: "I LOVE YOU. WE NEED TO TALK. Grace" Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the rug.

C: COMPUTERIZED VOICE
D: So come on down, or we'll just keep beepin' ya. EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS. Bruce's demolished car enters frame. He studies the area and building suspiciously. Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
C: BRUCE
D: Perfect. He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside. INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY. It reads: OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.

D: You're looking for room 7. Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor. He looks at Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
E: O.S.
C: JANITOR
D: Want me to even those up for you?
C: BRUCE
D: How would I get to room 7?
E: feigns a smile
C: JANITOR
D: That'd be on the seventh floor. Stairs are right over there.
C: BRUCE
D: What about the elevator? He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
C: JANITOR
D: Out of order. Bruce heads for the stairs.
C: JANITOR
D: You mind giving me a hand with this floor?
C: BRUCE
D: What? Yeah, I mind. He continues on.
N: SEVENTH FLOOR The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space. Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending into a hole in the ceiling.
C: BRUCE
D: Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this joint...
C: MAN
D: Be right with y.a, just fixin' a light. Tell me if it's working? CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining down blinding Bruce.
E: O.S.
C: BRUCE
D: Yep, seems to be. Kinda bright, though.
E: wiping his eyes
N: An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the ladder.
C: MAN
D: Yeah, it is for most people. They spend their lives in the dark... As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is the SAME JANITOR.
E: O.S.
C: JANITOR
D: . . . thinkin' they can hide from me. The two stand, angelically illuminated. Bruce tries to put everything together.
E: CONT'D
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
C: JANITOR
D: Yeah, but I'll get around to it. The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
C: BRUCE
D: You installed a clapper?
C: JANITOR
D: Nope. Catchy jingle, though. CLAP ON. CLAP OFF. CLAP ON, CLAP
E: sings
C: OFF. THE CLAPPER.
D: You can't get it out of your head.
E: claps twice
C: BRUCE
D: I gotta go.
C: JANITOR
D: Okay, but the boss'11 be right out. The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit. He extends his hand to Bruce.
C: JANITOR
D: You must be Bruce. I've been expecting you.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, this is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor.
C: JANITOR
D: Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your sleeves, son. People underestimate the benefits of good 'ol manual labor. There's freedom in it. Happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end of the day. He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
C: JANITOR
D: Your father knew that. He was a damn good welder. Bruce approaches the desk.
C: BRUCE
D: How do you know my father? And how did you get my pager number?
C: JANITOR
D: Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce. Pretty much everything there is to know. Everything you've ever said, done or thought about doin', is right there in that file cabinet. He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
C: BRUCE
D: Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me? Mind if I take a look?
E: sarcastic
C: JANITOR
D: It's your life. Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM -- The Janitor casually pulls a file.
C: JANITOR
D: Now this last entry was a little disturbing. He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor reads from the file.
C: JANITOR
D: Thanks for everything, Lord.
E: reads, scanning MORE
N: JANITOR (cont'd) I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan.. The gloves are off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty smiter. (aside) I'm not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh. Oh, and let's not forget "What kind of a God would let this happen? I mean, have you seen then news lately?" Bruce stands, dazed.
C: BRUCE
D: Who are you?
C: JANITOR
D: I'm the creator of the heavens and the earth. I'm the alpha & omega. The first and the last.
C: BRUCE
D: Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
C: JANITOR/GOD
D: I'm God, Bruce.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh, you're God. Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me. That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly. Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse. Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
E: placating
C: BRUCE
D: Okay, I don't know how you're doing that, but I really gotta go. This place is obviously rigged in some way. We're on some freaky hidden camera show. ...for which I will not sign a release, by the way! But you know what, I'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion.
E: playing to the "cameras" MORE
N: BRUCE (cont'd) Everyone with a brain in their head would know that the drawer is being fed through the wall from behind-- Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a normal back.
C: BRUCE
D: Okay. That's good. That's a good one. Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
C: BRUCE
D: Okay, God. How many fingers am I holding out? Bruce extends three fingers.
C: GOD
D: Three. He quickly pulls one finger in.
C: GOD
D: Two. Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly. God doesn't miss a beat.
C: GOD
D: Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One... One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
C: BRUCE
D: Okay, how about now. He quickly pulls in two fingers.
C: GOD
D: Seven.
C: .BRUCE
D: AH HAl Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS ON HIS ONE HAND.
C: BRUCE
D: AAAHHHl
N: 39, He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers disappear. God approaches Bruce.
C: GOD
D: You've been doing a lot of complaining about me, Bruce. And quite frankly, I'm tired of it... Bruce backs away from God.
C: BRUCE
D: You stay away from me! I don't know what your doing. But whatever you're doing is probably actionable!
C: GOD
D: Well, that's not very neighborly. I brought you here to offer you a job.
C: BRUCE
D: Job? Wh at job?
C: GOD
D: My job. You think you can do it better, so here's your chance. When you leave this building you will be endowed with all my powers.
C: BRUCE
D: Sure, whatever you say, Pal. He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor uniform, holding the mop.
C: GOD
D: All the power of God. Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce sprints out of the room. EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY Bruce barrels out of the building --
C: BRUCE
D: Okay, that did not happen. He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He paus es f or a bea t --

N: He races on.
S: INT. BRUCE'S CAR

C: BRUCE
D: I'm having a breakdown. That's what it is. Just a normal, everyday psychotic episode, brought on by tumor or brain lesion... We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
C: BRUCE
D: Come on, startI The car INSTANTLY starts.
E: to the car
C: BRUCE
D: Well, that was lucky. Bruce backs up, peels out. MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"
E: denial
S: EXT. CITY STREETS
N: Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself, immediately stops whistling.
C: BRUCE
D: Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and I do not have his powers. If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left.
E: laughs
C: BRUCE
D: AAAHHHHHHHH!J!
N: Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the driver's window.
C: PAUL NEWMAN
D: Hey Mario, did you get that box of dressing I sent you? Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
C: BRUCE
D: Si, dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un certo tempo. Bruce reacts shocked. The crew backs off and urges him on in Italian.
E: in perfect Italian SUBTITLES: Yes, you must come over for dinner some time.
C: PIT CREW
D: Vete l Ve tel Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.
N: He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a diner.
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
C: BRUCE
D: It isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real... An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand, stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
C: BRUCE
D: Oh hi, ah, coffee please. The waitress pours him a cup.
C: WAITRESS
D: We've got a special on soup today.
C: BRUCE
D: No, that's okay.
C: WAITRESS
D: It's tomato.
C: BRUCE
D: Alright, okay. She heads off. Bruce sits thinking. Could it be real? He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand. Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
C: BRUCE
D: Excuse me I need a spoooo... Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin.
C: BRUCE
D: That's alright, I found one. The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter. The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
C: WAITRESS
D: I lie to my sister.
C: BRUCE
D: What?
C: WAITRESS
D: And I'm sleeping with my best friend's husband. I know he's just using me but.. I'm just so tired of being alone. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Just seems like you'd understand.
E: becoming emotional
C: BRUCE
D: Okay.
C: WAITRESS
D: Take care of that whenever you're ready. Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense. He slowly raises his hands over the soup bowl.... MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME
E: sets the check down
N: The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
C: PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
D: A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
C: GOD
D: Havin' fun? Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
E: O.S.
C: BRUCE
D: You- He- Thy...
C: GOD
D: Let's take a walk. EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY
N: God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go. God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
C: GOD
D: Most people want to kill these guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very streamlined design. Like little armored tanks. Y'know, they can hold their breath for forty minutes and their cells divide only once per molting cycle creating a cytoskeleton with cell adhesion that... Oh, this is a bit over your head, isn't it? Off Bruce's look.
E: re: the cockroach catching himself
C: GOD
D: Okay, let me explain the rules.
C: BRUCE
D: Rules ?
C: GOD
D: Yeah, you left in such a rush I didn't get a chance to explain.
C: BRUCE
D: Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit.
C: GOD
D: I figured that would get your attention.. I did the same thing to Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three weeks. Now, here's the deal. You have all my power. Use it any way you choose. There are only two rules. You can't tell anyone you're God. Believe me you don't want that kind of attention. And you can't mess with free will.
E: laughs
C: BRUCE
D: Uh huh. Can I-ask why?
C: GOD
D: Yes you can. That's the beauty it. Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM. Bruce looks to the sail, oddly, then... WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass. Bruce is awestruck.
E: excited
C: BRUCE
D: This is amazing.
C: GOD
D: Oh, speaking of amazing... God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS. He pockets them as he talks.
C: GOD
D: Since you're finished with these, I think I'll hang to 'em. Might come in handy someday. WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE
N: God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to walk away.
C: GOD
D: I'll be seein' ya.
C: BRUCE
D: Where are you going?
C: GOD
D: I'm taking a vacation.
C: BRUCE
D: God can't take a vacation. Can he? Can you?
C: GOD
D: Ever hear of the Dark Ages? Besides, I'm covered. You can fix everything in five minutes if you want to, right?
C: ON BRUCE BRUCE

C: DEBBIE
D: Well, I've been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years, but it's not going to happen. You know, it's not all about money. The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.

A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
C: BRUCE
D: And he saw that it was good. He spots a mannequin in a store window display, wearing a cool, casu al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens them, HE'S WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is dressed in his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.

C: BRUCE
D: What a coincidence. That's today. The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants. The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
C: BIG GUY
D: Did that come out of your butt, man? Hood #1 faints from shock.
