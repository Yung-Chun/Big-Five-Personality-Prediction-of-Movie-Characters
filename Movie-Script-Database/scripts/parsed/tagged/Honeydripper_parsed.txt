M: We hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE.
S: EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption- WIDER SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire. His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-
C: LONNIE
D: Leave off with that, Scratch.
C: SCRATCH
D: Aint bothering you.
C: LONNIE
D: Yes it is. That aint no kind of music.
N: We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-
C: SCRATCH
D: Least I make a sound.
C: LONNIE
D: Yeah and it's a nasty one.
N: Lonnie looks at the sky-
C: SCRATCH
D: You want to try again tonight?
N: Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from the setting sun-
C: LONNIE
D: Might as well.
S: EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS- We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze. A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them. The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: MUSIC CONTINUES. We see the boys walking on a PATH through the PINES-
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, RAILROAD TRACKS - AERIAL SHOT - LATE
N: AFTERNOON MUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on the ties-
S: EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING
N: MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an ARMY BARRACKS. SOLDIERS, black and white, DRILL on the grounds-
S: EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE, RIVER - EARLY EVENING
N: The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a RAILROAD BRIDGE. We SUPERIMPOSE- ALABAMA - 1950 OPENING CREDITS END
S: EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads. BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up with Lonnie and Scratch. The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and go up on their toes to peek in through a window-
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
N: An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys- SINGER A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY, leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: I know a gal name of Betty Sue Shook it so much She got the German flu No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same
N: As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near- empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You women don't worry About your life She made Jack the Ripper Throw away his knife-
N: Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening aimlessly.
C: BERTHA MAE
D: No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same
N: Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping that nobody will notice and tell them to leave. They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his 50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up the song-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: A copper brought her in She didn't need no bail She shook it for the judge He threw the cop in jail No matter how she done it No matter how she done it No matter how she done it She done it just the same
N: SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem more empty. Ty stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-
C: TY
D: You take it for a while.
N: As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from outside-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: They makin all that racket again at Toussaint's.
C: TY
D: Yeah. And all them people over there buying drinks and throwing their money after them dice and whatnot. Lucky we got none a that here.
N: Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO. Ty pauses at the counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You can drink your liquor You can drink your cold can beer-
C: SLICK
D: She sounding good, huh?
C: TY
D: Sounds fine. Always has.
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You can drink your good whiskey You can drink your cold can beer-
C: SLICK
D: Not much of a crowd.
C: TY
D: Not a crowd at all. Just some stiffs who want to drink theirself to sleep without the music wakin em up.
C: SLICK
D: You ought to advertise. Got an attraction like Bertha Mae-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You can lay up with your sweet gal But Poppa don't you leave me here
C: TY
D: Singin is one thing, Slick. Whether people want to look at you while you do it is another.
C: SLICK
D: You saying something about-
E: defensive
N: Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting-
C: MACEO
D: Got quite a number over to Toussaint's place tonight.
C: TY
D: Sounds like it.
C: MACEO
D: Lots of young folks. Come to listen to that box of his.
N: China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey. He gives her a sad smile-
C: TY
D: Thanks, China Doll.
N: We FOLLOW as Ty crosses to the door-
C: MACEO
D: Don't see why we don't just turn our box on and let folks feed it nickels like they do.
E: O.S.
C: SLICK
D: The lady is singing.
E: O.S.
C: MACEO
D: But didn't nobody come to listen to her, Slick.
E: O.S.
N: Ty looks out the door at-
S: POV - EXT. ACE OF SPADES CLUB
N: -the RED-lit ACE OF SPADES CLUB across the road, PEOPLE hanging out in front, LAUGHTER heard from within- HONEYDRIPPER Ty reacts. Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room-
C: MACEO
D: Like the man say, you can't argue with failure.
N: STOKELY, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar, calls out to them-
C: STOKELY
D: You know why Slick here is like a preacher?
N: Slick tenses, used to this-
C: STOKELY
D: Cause he does all his best work on his knees.
N: Stokely almost chokes with laughter-
C: MACEO
D: Never mind him, he just a drunk-
C: STOKELY
D: I hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house.
N: Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-
C: MACEO
D: You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick.
C: STOKELY
D: I oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries. Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then-
C: MACEO
D: You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get?
C: DELILAH
D: Gentlemen-
N: They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the back of the club. She is dressed for church-
C: SLICK
D: Miss Delilah-
E: doffs his hat
C: DELILAH
D: Let's behave ourselves. What are you boys doing in here? Out!
E: sees
N: Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out. Delilah turns her attention to China Doll-
C: DELILAH
D: And what are you doing behind that bar?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: It's just for a minute.
C: DELILAH
D: That's sixty seconds too long. Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place.
N: China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind-
C: DELILAH
D: You bring people their food. Don't you be messing with their liquor.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Nobody's eating.
C: DELILAH
D: That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil.
N: Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the door-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer-
N: Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in-
C: NADINE
D: Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good tonight.
C: MACEO
D: Likewise, Miss Nadine. What can I do for you?
C: NADINE
D: You know what you can do for me, sweet man.
E: flirting
N: Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time-
C: MACEO
D: What would you like to drink?
N: DOORWAY Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades. Delilah comes up to join him, indicates his drink-
C: DELILAH
D: How many is that tonight?
C: TY
D: Don't dog me about that, baby. Not tonight.
C: DELILAH
D: I don't want China Doll behind that bar.
C: TY
D: She got to help out.
C: DELILAH
D: Not there she doesn't. You know she's not sposed to get excited-
C: TY
D: Not much chance of that in here. Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones.
E: wistful
C: DELILAH
D: You'll get some of them.
C: TY
D: They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone.
C: DELILAH
D: Maybe that's the wages of sin.
E: joking
C: TY
D: Aint no sin happenin here tonight, baby, and there sure as hell aint no wages. Your God wants to chastise some sinners He best move on over to Toussaint's, got a whole barroom crowded with em.
E: bitter
C: DELILAH
D: He isn't `my God'. He's everybody's God.
N: He looks at his wife-
C: TY
D: How that tent meeting went tonight?
C: DELILAH
D: Viola Underwood found the Lord.
C: TY
D: I thought she found Him last year when they come through.
C: DELILAH
D: Well, she must have lost Him again between then and now, cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues.
E: smiles
C: TY
D: The Spirit didn't move you, though?
C: DELILAH
D: Not yet. Might be too late for me.
E: thoughtful
N: Delilah surveys the room-
C: DELILAH
D: I can't believe you're serving Alton Stokely.
N: STOKELY Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he drinks-
C: DELILAH
D: That poor man-
E: O.S.
C: TY
D: Toussaint cut his credit off. Either he gets it here-
E: O.S.
N: TY AND DELILAH
C: TY
D: -or he drinks that paint-peeler Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp.
C: DELILAH
D: He's gonna drink himself to death in here.
C: TY
D: Least he won't go blind first.
N: Delilah shakes her head and heads out the door-
C: DELILAH
D: Imonna go home and say a prayer for that man.
C: TY
D: Say one for me too, baby.
E: calling after
N: STAGE Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now, as Metalmouth backs her up on the harmonica-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Come here sweet Poppa Let me whisper in your ear Go back to Alabama But don't you leave your Momma here
N: Only Slick applauds-
C: SLICK
D: That was outstandin, baby. You still got the voice.
N: Bertha Mae, a little unsteady, holds onto Slick's arm as he helps her off the stage-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You think so?
C: SLICK
D: Sent a chill down my spine to hear you.
N: Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: I might be a little late Saturday, Tyrone.
C: TY
D: Don't need to come in if you don't want to.
E: mutters, embarrassed
N: She stops dead. Stares at him till he has to let it out-
C: TY
D: I've made other arrangements.
C: BERTHA MAE
D: Other arrangements-
C: TY
D: Try something new in here.
C: SLICK
D: You can't do that!
C: BERTHA MAE
D: It's his place, darlin, he can do whatever he want.
N: Bertha Mae nods to Ty, holding onto her dignity for all it's worth-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: You know where to find me if you need me.
N: Bertha Mae pulls Slick out the door. China Doll watches after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink-
C: MACEO
D: I put the box on now, Ty?
E: softly
C: TY
D: Yeah. Put the box on.
C: MACEO
D: Imonna crank it up some, see if we can draw a little life in here-
N: Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX in. The jukebox sputters to life, LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC BLARING for a moment, then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the POWER in the club goes OFF!
S: EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
N: The Honeydripper SIGN is the last to FLICKER and DIE. Lonnie and Scratch watch from under the streetlight-
C: LONNIE
D: There it go again.
C: SCRATCH
D: Lectricity don't like that jukebox.
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
N: DARKNESS.
C: MACEO
D: Damn.
C: TY
D: China Doll?
N: A MATCH is struck, FLARES as China Doll lights a KEROSENE LAMP she's pulled from under the bar-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Got to get the power company in here-
C: TY
D: No you don't. They turned my juice off last month- don't want them sniffin around that splice job Maceo done.
C: MACEO
D: Must be a short circuit in the juke here-
N: He yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure the few patrons-
C: TY
D: Don't worry folks, bar's still open.
C: NADINE
D: It's nice like this. Kind of romantic.
C: MACEO
D: Imonna have to go out back, wiggle some things around.
C: NADINE
D: Don't be wigglin nothin round less I'm there to see it.
N: Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway- It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge. Pugh strolls into the club as if he owns it.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Evenin, folks.
C: TY
D: Evenin, Sheriff.
N: Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Your lights gone out.
C: TY
D: Looks like it.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Don't know but that be a vilation of somethin or other.
N: Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground without pissing off the white man with the badge-
C: TY
D: We just about to close up here.
N: Pugh sniffs the air-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Your wife been cookin?
C: TY
D: Not tonight. Went to the revival tent.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: I stood by there a while. Them nigras was singin up a storm.
E: grins
N: Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely won't meet his eyes-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: I just come out here to look in on Toussaint- had that shooting two nights ago.
C: TY
D: Lot's of fighting in there.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: There is that. But me and Old Toussaint got us a greement. SHERIFF PUGH You get these field hands suckin down that whiskey, hop em all up with music, there's gonna be some razors drawn. He only call me if it's a fatality.
E: MORE cont'd
C: MACEO
D: Never been a killin in here. Them youngbloods know better-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: -than to mess with Tyrone Purvis.
N: He turns his attention to Tyrone-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You got quite the reputation round here, Tyrone. Say you put some poor black boy in the grave.
N: It gets very quiet, the HISS of the KEROSENE LANTERN growing tense and insistent. China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching for a flicker of evidence. Ty stays deadpan-
C: TY
D: Just people talkin.
N: The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You remember that this is my county, Tyrone. What goes on goes on cause I let it. Don't want to get too big for your britches out here.
N: Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the sheriff turns and heads for the door-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You folks have a pleasant evening, now.
N: They all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale.
C: STOKELY
D: A nigger aint shit in this world.
N: Maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from Stokely-
C: MACEO
D: Speakin for yourself.
C: STOKELY
D: You didn't have this club, Tyrone, what you think you be?
N: We TIGHTEN on Ty's face. He has been thinking about this very thing-
C: STOKELY
D: Wouldn't be nothin. And if that aint true then grits aint groceries.
E: O.S.
N: A long TRAIN WHISTLE echoes outside-
S: EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Bertha Mae pauses as she climbs the FRONT PORCH of her two- story wooden HOUSE, the nicest in the neighborhood, listening to the TRAIN WHISTLE with a troubled look on her face. Slick waits for her with the door open-
C: BERTHA MAE
D: That is a terrible noise.
C: SLICK
D: Just the northbound from Talledega. Sounds like it always does.
C: BERTHA MAE
D: Like a soul bein carried away from this life.
N: ANOTHER WHISTLE-
C: SLICK
D: Come on in, darlin. You catch your death out here.
S: EXT. RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT
N: We hear the TRAIN WHISTLE again as the WHEELS ROLL and the TRAIN strobes past us, picking up speed as it pulls out from the yard- When it clears we see a LONE FIGURE standing across the tracks. He steps forward and catches a bit of light-- SONNY BLAKE, 20's, rumpled from hard travelling. He carries a GUITAR CASE and something bulky in a SACK- SHACK THOMAS, an older man in a PULLMAN PORTER'S UNIFORM stands under the moth-addled light on the tiny STATION PLATFORM, watching Sonny-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Lucky the high-sheriff aint here to see you crawl outta that boxcar.
C: SONNY
D: He come round here much?
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Only when he's bored.
N: Sonny reaches Shack at the platform-
C: SONNY
D: You working that train?
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Kansas City to New Orleans.
C: SONNY
D: What you get off here for?
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: I growed up here. Still got people. How bout you?
C: SONNY

E: shrugs
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Switchman's shed, right over there, has got a cot. Don't mind the rats none, less you got food on you- and I can see you and a good meal has been strangers for some time.
E: points
N: Sonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: You get into town tomorrow an need somethin, tell em Shack Thomas sent you. They know who you talkin about.
C: SONNY
D: Thanks. Hey, what's the name of this town?
N: Shack points to the SIGN hanging down from the lip of the platform roof- SIGN
C: HARMONY
D: The sign reads-
C: SONNY
D: Name like that, must be a good place for musicians.
E: O.S.
N: PLATFORM Shack laughs as he heads away-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Only night I ever spent in jail was a town called Liberty. Sun comes up, you'll see where you landed. And you best be out of that shed by first light.
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - LATE NIGHT - CU MONEY
N: A few wet, crumpled BILLS and dirty COINS are spread out on the bartop-
C: MACEO
D: It's just a weekday night-
E: O.S.
N: WIDER Still operating by LANTERN LIGHT, Ty and Maceo look at the night's dismal take, as China Doll lays chairs on top of tables-
C: TY
D: I owe the chicken man, I owe the ice man, I owe the liquor man-
C: MACEO
D: Least you don't owe the electric company.
C: TY
D: Yeah, that's a big relief.
E: indicates the dark room
C: MACEO
D: You thinkin bout closing down?
E: worried
N: Ty frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a POSTER. He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads- SPECIAL ATTRACTION New Orleans Singing Sensation `GUITAR' SAM
C: TY
D: What you think?
C: MACEO
D: Biggest act in New Orleans, got him a hit on the radio-
C: TY
D: He's playing here Saturday night. Figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae was gone to put this up.
N: Ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster-
C: MACEO
D: Here? You mean like in this room here?
C: TY
D: You know the Tomcat Club in Texarkana?
C: MACEO
D: Big Jim Jamison's place-
C: TY
D: Just went out of business.
C: MACEO
D: Damn-
C: TY
D: And since Sam is giggin his way over to Tulsa, that means he got the date open-
C: MACEO
D: But you aint never had a guitar pl-
N: Ty gives Maceo a warning look, which China Doll notes-
C: TY
D: I'm having one now.
C: MACEO
D: What you gonna pay the man with?
N: Ty glances at China Doll, uneasy-
C: TY
D: You just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow. Payday come Saturday, he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here, get us back in the black.
N: Ty looks around at the empty club-
C: TY
D: They gonna take me down, it won't be without a fight.
N: Maceo holds the poster up to the lamplight, warming to the idea-
C: MACEO
D: Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper. Man, this joint is going to jump!
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/1ST COTTON FIELD - EARLY MORNING
N: SUNRISE. An OLD MAN in coveralls leads a MULE along the side of the road. A TRUCK carrying two dozen PICKERS in its open bed approaches- TRUCK One of the pickers, DEX, turns to look back at the man and mule-
C: DEX
D: Aint seen no mule in a long time.
N: The other pickers, men and women, don't look interested or even fully awake yet-
C: DEX
D: I knew this was Alabama, but that's the Stone Ages, man.
N: One of the other men, HAM, looks him over. Dex is little and combative and has a nasty-looking SCAR on his face. Ham is big and morose, with a deep, grumpy voice-
C: HAM
D: Where you from, boy?
C: DEX
D: Memphis.
C: HAM
D: Down on you vacation?
N: A few snickers-
C: DEX
D: Got in a piece of trouble up there with the white folks, need to bide my time for a spell.
N: JUNEBUG, a local man with a nervous air, jumps in-
C: JUNEBUG
D: You bide any time in these fields, bossman gonna fire your ass for takin up space.
C: DEX
D: Aint no worry bout that. I'm a cotton-pickin fool.
C: HAM
D: You a fool, all right.
N: More snickers and the truck stops at the side of a COTTON FIELD. Somebody lets the tailgate down and they begin to climb off-
C: DEX
D: And where you from, Brother Bear?
C: HAM
D: Missippi.
C: DEX
D: Then this a real step up for you. Folks round here has discovered fire and whatnot-
C: HAM
D: That trouble you in have anything to do with runnin your mouth?
N: The pickers unroll the sacks they pick up from the pile that's been left and begin to spread out at the base of the unpicked rows-
C: DEX
D: Had to do with somebody get on my nerves and I had to deal with him.
C: HAM
D: Must of been somebody kind of puny.
N: Dex turns to face the much larger Ham-
C: DEX
D: As I recall he just about your size.
N: The two men stare at each other for a long moment. Way too early to fight. Dex breaks eye contact and moves toward a row-
C: DEX
D: What's this place we at?
C: JUNEBUG
D: Nearest town is Harmony. This Mr. Silas Tugwell's place.
N: He nods toward Dex's row-
C: JUNEBUG
D: You better get pickin.
C: DEX
D: Cotton aint goin nowhere.
C: JUNEBUG
D: More you get first thing when the dew still on it, the more it weighs when it tip that scale.
N: Dex's gaze falls upon a tall, strong-looking young woman starting down the row next to his-
C: DEX
D: You live here too?
N: She gives him a weary look-
C: DEX
D: You got my sympathies.
E: shakes his head
S: EXT. TOWN - TRAIN TRACKS - EARLY MORNING
N: A WIDE SHOT of the TRACKS that cut the town in two. CLOSER Sonny stands on the tracks just as the SUN RISES, pondering- which side of the tracks is for white people, which for the colored. He hears GUITAR MUSIC to one side, steps cautiously toward it-
S: EXT. MAIN STREET - GENERAL STORE - EARLY MORNING
N: Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case, moving toward the sound of a SLIDE GUITAR being played expertly- An irate-looking WHITE LADY glares at Sonny as she picks up the milk bottles from her stoop, steps inside and slams the door. Sonny moves ahead, uneasy- We TIGHTEN on his face as he stops to listen, the MUSIC ECHOING, seeming to come from here, then from there, then suddenly from right behind him- He turns- POSSUM, blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet- open GENERAL STORE, PLAYS expertly on a beat-up old GUITAR. Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment, watching the man's fingers- Possum gets a whiff of him. He keeps playing as he speaks-
C: POSSUM
D: Somebody slept in the railroad yard.
N: Sonny watches the blind man's fingers move on the strings-
C: SONNY
D: Yall can play that thing.
C: POSSUM
D: Been doin it near forever.
C: SONNY
D: Listen, which side of the tracks am I-
E: looking around
C: POSSUM
D: The wrong side for you.
C: SONNY
D: What you doing here then?
C: POSSUM
D: White folks look right through me. How much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow?
N: Sonny surveys the street-
C: SONNY
D: Where our people go for music around here?
C: POSSUM
D: There's a couple places just a little bit out of town. At the crossroads.
C: SONNY
D: Long walk?
C: POSSUM
D: You in a hurry?
N: Possum finishes his song-
C: SONNY
D: How old is that box you playin, Pops?
C: POSSUM
D: Second one that ever was- an the devil's got the first. How bout yours?
E: smiles
N: Possum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe. Sonny is surprised at the blind man's perception-
C: SONNY
D: Brand new. Made it myself.
C: POSSUM
D: Made it hisself-
E: whistles
C: SONNY

N: Ty glances over to the Ace of Spades, then points behind the Honeydripper-
C: TY
D: Pull it around to the back- we'll help you unload.

N: We SHIFT to see GATLIN, a white planter who chews and spits tobacco, looking Sonny over as Sheriff Pugh stands by-
C: PUGH
D: Caught this young fella in flagrant violation of the statutes. Gawkery with intent to mope.
C: GATLIN
D: What's he gonna run me?
C: PUGH
D: Three dollars a day plus you feed im lunch. Now the sentence- that depends on how long you gonna need the help.
N: Sonny decides to speak up-
C: SONNY
D: I don't get any trial?
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Sure you do, boy. And a speedy one, too. Meet Judge Gatlin.
E: points
N: Gatlin spits-
C: GATLIN
D: Grab a sack.
S: EXT. PINEY WOODS - CROSSROADS - AFTERNOON
N: Maceo nails a Guitar Sam POSTER to a tree, looks over his handiwork. An ARMY PLATOON trudges into the crossroads, sweat-soaked and footsore- Maceo watches, pleased, as the black soldiers check the poster out as they pass-
C: MACEO
D: Saturday night, fellas! Every fine- looking colored woman in the county gonna be there- don't want to miss it!
N: A white LIEUTENANT passes, giving Maceo a dark look. Maceo salutes-
C: MACEO
D: Afternoon, sir. Nice lookin bunch of soldiers.
S: INT. MAYOR WINFIELD'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich she's made herself. We hear PERRY COMO on a RECORD somewhere in the house. She hasn't gotten two bites down before Amanda wanders in, crossing to the liquor cabinet-
C: AMANDA
D: Oh dear, I believe it's about that time-
N: She pulls out a DECANTER OF WINE-
C: AMANDA
D: Would you care to join me?
C: DELILAH
D: No thank you.
N: Amanda pours herself a glass of wine-
C: AMANDA
D: Of course you won't join me, you don't partake. That was thoughtless of me.
C: DELILAH
D: That's all right.
C: AMANDA
D: So you don't take spirits and- what else? In your church?
C: DELILAH
D: I'm sort of between churches right now. I been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but I- I haven't been sanctified yet.
C: AMANDA
D: Ah-
C: DELILAH
D: There's been a minister in this week-
C: AMANDA
D: The tent out by the fairgrounds.
N: Delilah nods. Amanda takes a drink-
C: AMANDA
D: The church I grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. They took up serpents.
C: DELILAH
D: I've heard of that.
C: AMANDA
D: I tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified. They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family.
C: DELILAH
D: They're good people too.
C: AMANDA
D: When I married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. As if I'd taken up with somebody in a cult.
C: DELILAH
D: It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion.
C: AMANDA
D: And your husband is a--- ?
C: DELILAH
D: Unaffiliated.
C: AMANDA
D: Unaffiliated. I see. He has his-- social club-
C: DELILAH
D: The Honeydripper.
C: AMANDA
D: Such a colorful name.
C: DELILAH
D: Yes.
C: AMANDA
D: He must devote a great deal of his energy to it.
C: DELILAH
D: It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then I go over and cook some when I get off here.
C: AMANDA
D: That's very- supportive of you. Considering the sort of- environment-
C: DELILAH
D: I been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda.
E: defensive
N: Amanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up-
C: AMANDA
D: I see-
C: DELILAH
D: I was a singer. I met Tyrone in the Paradise, down in Shreveport, China Doll was only two-
N: Delilah considers, struggling to express who Ty is-
C: DELILAH
D: I was just kind of livin along, you know, drinking more than I ought-- then Tyrone. It was like a light come into my life.
N: Delilah turns away, embarrassed to have revealed so much-
C: DELILAH
D: People think things because he owns the Lounge, but they don't know him.
C: AMANDA
D: Small minds are never in short supply.
N: She crosses to look out a window-
C: AMANDA
D: The people in this town---
N: She catches herself, smiles-
C: AMANDA
D: I suppose they expected that Floyd, being from a prominent family- as prominent as is possible here in Harmony- would have chosen somebody more--
N: She fades away again, empties her glass-
C: AMANDA
D: My people were very devout, but they weren't- financially successful.
C: DELILAH
D: No shame in that.
C: AMANDA
D: In school, if you didn't have shoes-
N: She frowns at the memory, sighs-
C: AMANDA
D: Oh, I forgot--
N: Amanda is up and out of the room. Delilah frowns at the decanter, hurries to put it away. Amanda comes back in holding a DRESS for a young girl-
C: AMANDA
D: I was going through Emily's old things the other day, and I thought this would look just darling on your China Doll-
N: Delilah examines the dress, which is clearly for a little girl-
C: DELILAH
D: Oh- I don't think it would near fit her, Miss Amanda.
C: AMANDA
D: How old is she now?
E: disappointed
C: DELILAH
D: Seventeen.
C: AMANDA
D: Oh my- I must have lost track somewhere along the line. Seventeen.
E: shocked
N: She sits, still holding the dress, sneaks a look over to where the wine decanter was-
C: DELILAH
D: It was a very nice thought.
N: An awkward silence that Perry Como fills inadequately. A KNOCK at the back door, then China Doll steps in, not seeing Amanda right away-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Mama? They need you at-
N: Delilah shifts her eyes to indicate-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Amanda. I didn't know you was home.
C: AMANDA
D: China Doll! We were just recalling- you used to play right here under this table.
E: smiles
S: INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM
N: Ty sits staring, mind working overtime, staring at the dead woman on the bed. He barely hears Slick talking to the undertaker behind him, busy filling out forms-
C: SLICK
D: There isn't any cash money I know of. She sold a good deal of the furniture, but there's still a nice- lookin sofa in the parlor. Only thing she cared for anymore was singin out to Pinetop's place-
N: Ty looks at a large RING on Bertha's Mae's cold gray hand. He touches it with a finger-
C: SLICK
D: You welcome to look around the house- if there's anything your Missus might like-- long as it's not something personal to me and Bertha Mae-
N: Ty draws his finger away from the ring as if burnt-
C: SLICK
D: It's just- she got to go out in style, is what it is. The best you got, all the trimmins- lay it out for her. That's the way she lived it- that's the way she ought to leave it.
N: Ty closes his eyes and buries his head in his hands-
S: EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - AFTERNOON
N: Blazing hot. Cotton chaff in the air as the prison WORK GANG bend to their task, dragging long sacks behind them like snakes. Even the DEPUTIES are sweating rivulets as they stand by with their SHOTGUNS in hand. Sonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work, wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time. NED, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him-
C: NED
D: Y'all never done this job before.
C: SONNY
D: Can't say I have.
C: NED
D: You want to set your pins out wide, bend over from the hip-
N: Sonny widens his stance-
C: NED
D: -and don't be bobbin up and down all the time. When you up, be up, but when you on the row, stay down.
N: Sonny digs in and keeps low-
C: NED
D: But most important, you got to get you a rhythm. Everything in this life got a rhythm to it- even pullin cotton off the plant.
C: SONNY
D: Lay it out for me.
C: NED
D: Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it.
C: SONNY
D: I'm going so slow.
C: NED
D: You gettin paid by the pound or by the hour?
C: SONNY
D: I'm not gettin paid at all. None of us are.
N: Ned cackles-
C: NED
D: Then I suggest you work that into your rhythm too.
N: A DEPUTY calls out-
C: DEPUTY
D: Let's see more pickin and less talkin over there!
C: NED
D: Gettin right on it, Boss!
N: Ned picks his way behind Sonny. Sonny starts to rock slightly, looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain-
S: EXT. 1ST OPPOSITE COTTON FIELD
N: The free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought them, eating lunch. Dex watches the prison laborers across the road as he SHUFFLES a battered DECK OF CARDS, sitting with a couple of the other men-
C: DEX
D: Them boys fryin over there.
C: JUNEBUG
D: That Judge Gatlin's gang- he work them people from can until can't, ever damn day, and when his fields is picked he bid em out to the neighbors. Harvest time comes round here, you sign up with somebody fast or you stay outa sight.
N: Dex waves flies away from his face, spits-
C: DEX
D: Ate a peck of dust today.
C: JUNEBUG
D: Take some water.
C: DEX
D: Only thing wash the dust out is whiskey.
C: JUNEBUG
D: Aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what I swallowed in my life.
E: smiles
N: Dex riffles the cards-
C: JUNEBUG
D: What we playin for?
C: DEX
D: Two bits a hand.
C: JUNEBUG
D: That's kind of steep-
N: Dex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players-
C: DEX
D: Hell, I member playin this game one night- Memphis is Boss Crump's town, folks is gamblin before they can walk- ten dollars a hand. I caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on Beale Street. Got up from that table, my money was as long as train smoke-
C: JUNEBUG
D: What happen to it?
N: Dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the morning can hear-
C: DEX
D: Spent it all on fine-lookin women.
N: He calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground-
C: DEX
D: Yo, Missippi-
C: JUNEBUG
D: His name Hamilton.
C: DEX
D: Hambone! You want in on this?
N: He raises a matchstick in his fingers-
C: DEX
D: Settle up on payday.
C: HAM
D: That your deck of cards?
C: DEX
D: What if it is?
C: HAM
D: I stay clear of it then.
N: Dex stops dealing to stare at Ham, insulted-
C: DEX
D: You sinuatin?
C: HAM
D: Just sayin I don't want to play.
N: There is a sudden RUSTLING at Ham's feet and WHAP! he brings his stick down hard. He pulls up a RABBIT, dead, by its hind legs-
C: JUNEBUG
D: Looks like dinner.
C: DEX
D: Rabbit is a rodent. Man eat a rabbit, might's well eat a rat.
N: Dex snorts, disgusted, then finishes dealing. He lays the top card face up and slaps down the rest of the deck-
C: DEX
D: Simple country nigger, fraid to sit down an lose his little handful of change--
E: mutters
C: JUNEBUG
D: He awful big to mess with.
C: DEX
D: Don't scare me none. I'm a steppin razor, man, I'm trouble on two legs.
N: We hear a CAR APPROACHING, SLOWING DOWN-
C: DEX
D: Your draw, Junebug. And don't be drippin sweat on my cards.
C: MACEO
D: Excuse me, folks-
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see Maceo leaning out of the window of Ty's old Ford, a Guitar Slim POSTER taped to the side of it-
C: MACEO
D: Yall heard about the show we puttin on at the Honeydripper Saturday night?
S: EXT. PURVIS HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A very modest wooden house with a porch. LIGHTS on inside-
S: INT. PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Ty and China Doll sit as Delilah lays dinner on the table. She is dressed to go out-
C: DELILAH
D: I expect there'll be a nice turnout for Bertha Mae tomorrow.
C: TY
D: Folks who wouldn't have nothin to do with her when she was alive.
C: DELILAH
D: Some of them, maybe. You still got to pay your respects.
C: TY
D: Slick gonna have to find him a new ride.
C: DELILAH
D: That's a terrible thing to say-
C: TY
D: That's how the man gets over, is all, sugarin up to some woman got a job or a bankroll-
C: DELILAH
D: It's no way to live.
C: TY
D: Just how it is out in the world, baby- man got to walk through the gates of Hell to get a piece of cheese.
N: He stares moodily, unnoticing as she lays his plate in front of him-
C: TY
D: You're not so young any more, lose hold of what little you got-
N: He just shakes his head-
C: DELILAH
D: If you lose the club I'm sure you'll find something else.
C: TY
D: In this town? Like what?
N: Delilah proceeds cautiously-
C: DELILAH
D: You know anytime you want I could get Miss Amanda to ask her husb-
C: TY
D: "Watch yo feet, Mr. Mayor, I done just mopped the flo! "
N: Delilah tries to ignore this-
C: DELILAH
D: You work so hard at the Lounge, and what it brings in-
C: TY
D: Isn't even as much as what you make polishin that white lady's silver. I know.
C: DELILAH
D: I didn't say that.
C: TY
D: You didn't have to.
N: Delilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood-
C: DELILAH
D: It'll just have to work out, then.
N: A strained silence. Delilah crosses to the back door-
C: DELILAH
D: Meetin gonna start without I'm there.
C: TY
D: Your soul not the one needs savin, baby.
N: She gives Ty a lost look, steps out. The screen door slams. China Doll sees how worried Ty is-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: It's all gonna be fine, Daddy. Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar Sam comin to Harmony.
S: EXT. REVIVAL TENT - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT
N: A CHOIR sings at the front of the LANTERN-LIT tent, a CONGREGATION of salvation-seekers filling the benches-
C: CHOIR
D: Mother died- Yes she died and left me It was long- long time ago Oh but I searched Searched her record over I found mother just had to go
N: UNDER TENT
C: CHOIR
D: Oh she cried son, Son don't you worry Oh you know the Lord Always fix a way
N: Delilah arrives at the rear of the tent, finds herself a spot on a bench-
C: CHOIR
D: She left me standing Standing along the highway Oh wondering- which way I must go!
N: REVEREND CUTLIP watches his singers, clapping out time with his big hands-
C: CHOIR
D: As I walked- All along the highway I was seeking my Lord each day She left me standing Standing along the highway Just wondering- which way must I go!
N: `Amens' and other sounds greet the end of the song. Reverend Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around at the souls gathered-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray! He gets an `Amen!' from someone in the crowd-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits! The congregation start to get into it, RESPONDING, rocking with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their PAPER FANS that advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night--
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan! That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow! The Reverend picks up speed-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: We got to get on that other road! The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name!
C: CONGREGATION
D: Praise the Lord!
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: The thoroughfare I'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow! (MORE)
T: REVEREND CUTLIP(cont'd)
N: Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way! Several people in the audience are up and SHOUTING now, getting into the Spirit. Reverend Cutlip shifts gear, filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey! There's many a loved one got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness! DELILAH We TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all very personally-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP (O.S.)
N: You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between!

C: KING
D: Yeah, aint no free ride allowed through Georgia. And the food there-
C: NED
D: Paltry-
C: KING
D: Paltry aint the word for it. Breakfast was a joke, lunch was a rumor-
C: NED

C: KING
D: Spose you been locked in that box.
E: laughs
C: NED
D: Or one just like it.

D: Singer, guitar player- Imonna be on the radio some day. People gonna know my name.
C: NED
D: Keep thinkin that way, young man. Judge Gatlin don't choose to work you into your grave, you just might do it.
E: chuckles
N: Sonny ponders this, looking back out through the bars, singing more moodily now as we TRACK AWAY from the cell-
C: SONNY
D: If you ever go to Houston Don't you stagger don't you fight Cause the Sheriff will arrest you You're in the cooler for the night-
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
N: We hear the slow BLUES DIRGE Bertha May as we see China Doll applying polish to Bertha Mae's fingernails-
S: INT/EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: MUSIC CONTINUES. We TRACK BACK through the house, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS and POSTERS of her singing in her glory days, finally TRACKING out onto the PORCH where Slick sits glumly on the steps and the undertaker stands in his black suit, looking at his watch as MOURNERS begin to pass into the house-
S: INT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - PARLOR - MORNING
N: MUSIC CONTINUES. MOURNERS pass the OPEN COFFIN-
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING
N: MUSIC CONTINUES. Ty and Maceo help carry the coffin down a dirt road, Slick walking at the head of the mourners following it-
S: EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING
N: MUSIC CONTINUES as- Hands grip ropes as the coffin is lowered into the HOLE-
T: Reverend Cutlip speaks a eulogy-
N: Slick tries to keep it together- Scratch and Lonnie watch the ceremony from a tree branch- Ty looks at his watch, slips away from the funeral party. Delilah notices, frowns. Reverend Cutlip takes note as well- A shovel digs into piled dirt- Dirt is tossed down upon us and the screen goes BLACK.
S: EXT. RAILROAD STATION - MORNING
N: Ty waits for a train, still in his mourning suit. We TIGHTEN on his face- tense, preoccupied with his schemes to save the club-
C: POSSUM
D: Hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed.
N: Ty whirls around-- somehow he didn't see Possum, sitting on a bench behind him, guitar in his lap.
C: TY
D: That's right.
C: POSSUM
D: She lived it how she sang it.
N: Ty tries to ignore him, looks down the rails-
C: POSSUM
D: Waitin for somebody.
N: Ty is silent.
C: POSSUM
D: Aint nobody on that train gonna change your luck, Tyrone. Gonna have to save your own self.
C: TY
D: What you know about anything?
E: annoyed
C: POSSUM
D: Oh, nothin much.
N: Ty steps away. Possum speaks quietly-
C: POSSUM
D: But I know you from way back.
N: Possum starts PLAYING, a dark, moody, slide-guitar blues. Ty looks toward Possum, not happy he's there, then looks away. The MUSIC gets LOUDER, FASTER, Possum MOANING and WHOOPING, stomping his foot- We TIGHTEN on Ty's face, tighter, tighter, then DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: We're in a BAR ROOM- smoke, heat, packed bodies- Possum's SONG grows more intense as we TRACK IN on GUITAR MAN- young, with slick hair a moustache and tons of attitude. He sneers, flicks his cigarette almost straight at us. We TRACK IN on YOUNG TYRONE, also swearing, stepping away from his piano- Guitar Man hands his guitar to one of the eager MEN standing close, hoping for a fight- A PRETTY GIRL stands to one side, looking scared and excited, covering her mouth with her hands- Young Tyrone steps in to meet him, the CROWD around almost pushing them together- Guitar Man pulls out a KNIFE! Young Tyrone grabs for it and they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance- A TRAIN WHISTLE breaks the spell!
S: EXT. TRAIN YARD - MORNING - PRESENT
N: Possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen- The WHISTLE again as the TRAIN APPROACHES. Ty takes a deep breath, hoping-
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY
N: Mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw the coffin carried. Reverend Cutlip sidles up to Delilah-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: A mournful end for a wayward sinner.
C: DELILAH
D: She always seemed at peace with herself.
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: The company she kept, the life she led-
C: DELILAH
D: I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul.
N: The Reverend is not too pleased with Delilah's forgiving attitude-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: We're all hoping to see you get over and accept the Lord tonight, Delilah.
C: DELILAH
D: I'm hoping so too.
N: Cutlip nods toward the FIELD as they pass the PRISON LABOR GANG, picking cotton under guard-
T: REVEREND CUTLIP
N: You been lingering at the threshold long enough, Sister. Time to step ahead. Delilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this challenge. She passes out of frame and we see China Doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought. She looks over into the cotton field- POV - SONNY, PRISON LABOR GANG Sonny bends his back with the other laborers, picking and sweating- CHINA DOLL China Doll pauses, frowns as she sees it is Sonny working, a DEPUTY strolling past him, shotgun in hand. Sonny sees her, lowers his head in shame-
S: EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE MORNING
N: The TRAIN has just pulled into the station. A pair of PULLMAN PORTERS step out-- But nobody else. Ty feels his heart sink. Shack Thomas comes up behind him, carrying an overnight bag-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Tyrone- got somebody gettin off here?
C: TY
D: Supposed to be.
N: He halts by Ty for a moment, watching. Nobody else is stepping out-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: What's the party's name?
C: TY
D: Sam- Guitar Sam-- don't know his birth name-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: He's comin here?
E: impressed
N: He calls to the porters further up the platform-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Yo, Nat! Guitar Sam get on this train?
C: NAT
D: Naw, man. He's in the hospital back in Little Rock.
C: TY
D: Hospital?
C: NAT
D: You know music folks- whatever he was doin, he must have done too much of it.
N: The porters LAUGH. Shack, realizing this must be a setback for Ty, pats his shoulder before he steps onto the train-
C: SHACK THOMAS
D: Well, brother- maybe he be in tomorrow.
N: We FOLLOW Ty away from the train as Nat calls `All aboard!' and the engine gathers power. Possum sits listening to the single SLIDE NOTES he plays, as if tuning his guitar-
C: POSSUM
D: Somebody didn't show up.
C: TY
D: Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind.
E: grim
N: We HOLD on Possum, cackling darkly, as Ty walks away. The train WHISTLE BLOWS-
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY
N: A torn and crumpled Guitar Sam POSTER lays on the bar counter. FINGERS move on the keyboard. Ty sits drinking, brooding, PLAYING and SINGING softly at the piano. Maceo is at the bar-
C: TY
D: Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more Well I had my fun if I Don't get well no more My head is spinnin And I'm goin down slow-
C: MACEO
D: Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night-

D: Got so bad, I heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses. Does pretty well for hisself, what I hear-
N: Ty pauses on the keyboard-
C: TY
D: Somebody we could find?
C: MACEO
D: Hell, I don't know. Just a story I heard.
E: shrugs
N: They both go back to brooding. Ty takes a drink. He stares at the keyboard-
C: TY
D: There must have been a first one.
C: MACEO
D: First what?
C: TY
D: Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton.
C: MACEO
D: House niggers.
C: TY
D: That's how they called em. They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-
C: MACEO
D: Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa.
C: TY
D: The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and I figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever-
N: Ty PLAYS something like a MINUET-
C: TY
D: -him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music.
C: MACEO
D: Down to the bones--
C: TY
D: And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-
C: MACEO
D: Watch out now-
C: TY
D: -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he-
N: Ty hits a MINOR CHORD, lets it decay-
C: TY
D: And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some damage with this.'
N: A silence. Maceo is moved by the scene-
C: MACEO
D: Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.
N: Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand, distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left, nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat-
C: TY
D: Mace, Imonna lose my club.
C: MACEO
D: Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that-
C: TY
D: I got no more cards to play-
C: MACEO
D: Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person-
C: TY
D: I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed-
E: angry
N: WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at the contents-
C: TY
D: What the hell that sposed to be?
N: Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it-
C: MACEO
D: Some kind of guitar.
C: TY
D: A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs.
N: China Doll rushes in, upset-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: They gone and arrest him!
C: TY
D: Arrested who?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin.
C: TY
D: Who's Sonny?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Sonny that was here yesterday morning.
C: TY
D: Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that-
N: Maceo plucks a string. Not much of a sound-
C: MACEO
D: It's electric-
C: TY
D: I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make.
C: MACEO
D: Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out-
N: He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires, also home-modified-
C: MACEO
D: -your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Sonny said he fix radios in the Army.
C: TY
D: Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Daddy-
C: TY
D: Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs-
C: MACEO
D: A sideman-
C: TY
D: Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies-
C: MACEO
D: Old time music-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work.
C: MACEO
D: They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: But he doesn't belong there!
N: Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands-
C: MACEO
D: You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal.
C: TY
D: I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!
N: Ty has a thought. He looks over at the guitar in Maceo's hands-
C: TY
D: Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing-
E: thinking out loud
C: MACEO
D: I think I fixed it good this time, Ty.
E: O.S.
N: Ty smiles-
C: TY
D: So he come out and plugs his ax in-
C: MACEO
D: He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back-
C: TY
D: Clothes, right-
C: MACEO
D: Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums-
C: TY
D: You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile?
C: MACEO
D: And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter-
E: smiles
C: TY
D: They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they?
C: MACEO
D: Naw- it was his place that got robbed.
C: TY
D: Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show-
C: MACEO
D: They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted-
C: TY
D: And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they?
N: Maceo begins to see where Ty is leading-
C: MACEO
D: Aw, no, Ty, we can't-
N: Ty claps his hands together, jumps up and heads for the door-
C: TY
D: China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone! Come on, man, we got work to do.
E: to Maceo
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Where you going, Daddy?
C: TY
D: I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam!
S: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE
N: We start on a portrait of Governor Big Jim Folsom on the wall, then TILT DOWN to Sheriff Pugh, feet up on the desk, a table-top FAN pointed at him, looking up at Ty-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Why you interested in this boy?
C: TY
D: Got a job for him.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Must be doin pretty good for yourself out there, Tyrone, you hirin new people on.

C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You gonna pay me four for the duration of his sentence?
C: TY
D: Which might be- ?
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: -as long as I care to make it.
C: TY
D: Well, I was counting on more of a one-time deal- if I could just rent him out for the weekend-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Fifty dollars.
N: Ty looks stricken-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: It's not just the money. There's legalistic principles involved here. Public safety issues-
C: TY
D: I pay you Sunday morning?
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You pay me now or you forget about it.
C: TY
D: I don't have it now.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You think you too smart for the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone? Think you can go it by yourself.
N: He puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his eyes-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor-
C: TY
D: It's not a favor if I got to pay-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with Toussaint. How'd that be?
N: Ty considers. He doesn't have any options-
C: TY
D: You'll get the fifty.
E: deadpan
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: And that wife of yours-
E: smiles
C: TY
D: Delilah-
E: wary
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Them fried chicken sandwiches- if I was to come by, now and then, check up on my interests-
C: TY
D: She be happy to fix you whatever you want.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: My wife's cookin would gag a maggot.
C: TY
D: Different people got different kinds of talents.
N: Sheriff Pugh heaves himself to his feet-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Lurleen aint discovered what hers is yet. Let's go fetch that boy.
S: EXT. 2ND COTTON FIELD - DAY - SHOTGUN
N: A SHOTGUN in a deputy's arms- POV - PICKERS Faces dripping sweat, prison gang pickers stoop to their work- TY Ty stands by his beat-up old Ford at the side of the road, watching, remembering. A few of the PRISON LABORERS look up, curious, as Sonny is led over-
C: DEPUTY

N: Ty pulls away, leaving the less fortunate stooped in the field-
S: INT. SEWING ROOM - NADINE
N: MUSIC plays on the RADIO as Nadine masterfully works her SEWING MACHINE and Maceo stands by uneasily. He holds up the denim jacket Sonny left at the club-
C: MACEO
D: This size, right, but it's got to shine.
C: NADINE
D: And when you need this?
C: MACEO
D: Tonight.
C: NADINE

N: Maceo turns at the open door-
C: MACEO
D: Boy's gonna need time to try that jacket on- see how it feels. Later, Nadine-
N: He is gone-
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY
N: Ty and China Doll stand looking at Sonny as he sits on a bar stool-
C: TY
D: You got to do somethin with this boy's head, darlin. They might not know what the real Sam look like, but it aint this.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: I can try.

C: TY
D: Let's hit it.
N: Ty leaves to join Maceo-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Bye, Daddy.
N: China Doll is a little nervous to be left alone with Sonny. She puts her comb in her hand and walks around Sonny, examining his hair while he examines her face-
C: SONNY
D: You know what you're doing?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: I fix Mama's hair all the time.
C: SONNY
D: But you aint been to that school yet.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: You go to school to learn your guitar?
C: SONNY
D: No.
E: laughs
N: China Doll steps behind the bar-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: I might pick up some new things at beauty school but mostly it's for my certificate, and that is `a ticket to adventure'- that's what it says in the brochure. People lookin for beauty all over the world.
N: Sonny sees the LOOSE WIRES that come through the wall behind the bar. China Doll searches around-
C: SONNY
D: You want to watch out for them wires sticking down- don't look safe.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Yeah- power's always going out, people getting shocks and whatnot-
E: shrugs
C: SONNY
D: Somebody ought to fix it.
N: She searches under the counter for something-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: `A career in beauty is like money in the bank.' Says that in the brochure too. Plus it isn't physically taxin.
C: SONNY
D: Yeah, I can't see no pretty thing like you behind a plow.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: I had the rheumatic fever when I was little, left me with a weak heart.
C: SONNY

D: Imonna just make yours relax a little.
S: INT. PARLOR
N: TIME TRENIER, an older musician with a permanently stoic expression, sits watching his pupil, a YOUNG BOY, torture the SCALES with a CORNET. He glances up at Ty and Maceo, trying not to plug their ears as the boy continues to PLAY-
C: MACEO
D: Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to be reckoned with.
N: Time doesn't seem to react to the flattery-
C: MACEO
D: Story goes that you used to play with Buddy Bolden.
C: TIME
D: Played with most all of em down there.
C: MACEO
D: And King Oliver-

S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD, 2ND COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The free pickers are lined up at the side of the road- CLOSER A white CLERK sits behind a wooden table in front of the transport truck and pulls cash from a METAL BOX, consulting a thick LEDGER in front of him as he pays the pickers off. Sheriff Pugh observes, his patrol car parked nearby. Ham has come to the head of the line, Junebug behind him-
C: CLERK
D: Twenny-four, twenny-five, twenny- six, twenny-seven, twenny-eight. Make your mark here-

D: But there wasn't none in my sack-
C: CLERK
D: We take off two dollars a week, always have. Aint that right, Junebug?
N: Junebug knows it's useless to complain-
C: JUNEBUG
D: Yes suh. Been that way my whole life.
N: Ham is furious but has nowhere to go with it-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: You gonna take your pay, son, or give it up to charity?
N: Ham swipes his pay off the table, stalks away. Sheriff Pugh glares after him. We FOLLOW Ham as he crosses to the rear of the truck. Dex sits on the tailgate, grinning at him-
C: DEX
D: Wouldn't let nobody mess with my money like that.
C: HAM
D: They took the same two dollars off yours.
C: DEX
D: Yeah, and you could pave a highway with the rocks I threw in that mess.
N: He catches the eye of Lucille, standing nearby-
C: DEX
D: You country nigros let the crackers run you like dogs-
N: SNATCH! Ham grabs Dex by the shirt front and yanks him close, hissing in fury-
C: HAM
D: That sheriff wasn't here I'd snap your neck, boy.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Don't let me stop you.
E: O.S.
N: Ham turns to see Sheriff Pugh standing behind him, a wry smile on his face-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: But first you gonna sign that ledger like you sposed to. Don't want nobody cryin they didn't get their due.
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - DAY
N: Ty is repairing the little STAGE with hammer and nails-
C: SONNY
D: Mr. Purvis?
E: O.S.
C: TY
D: People call me Ty or they call me Pinetop. Mr. Pinetop to you.
E: doesn't look up
C: SONNY
D: I just wanted to tell you- I preciate the opportunity.
E: O.S.
N: Ty looks up to see Sonny with his hair pressed under a tight cap made from an old STOCKING-
C: TY
D: Right.
C: SONNY
D: I know ever one of Guitar Sam's songs- know the chords, know the words-
C: TY
D: That's fine.
N: Sonny begins to stroll around the edge of the club, looking at PHOTOS and SHOWBILLS on the walls-
C: SONNY
D: China Doll said how you was famous once.
N: Ty is pleased at his step-daughter's bragging, but doesn't show it-
C: TY
D: I was known, but I was never what you call famous.
C: SONNY
D: How'd you get your start?
N: Ty sighs, sits back from his work-
C: TY
D: Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him.
C: SONNY
D: How old you were?
C: TY
D: Thirteen, fourteen. This one night it was goin hot and heavy and Joe just passed, right there at the piano, in the middle of Black Bottom Stomp. They propped him up at the bar, stuck a drink in his hand, and told me to keep poundin them ivories. There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows.
E: shrugs shakes his head
N: Sonny stops by a poster for the `REGINALD ERSKINE BAND featuring Tyrone "Pinetop" Purvis'-
C: SONNY
D: This is you-
C: TY
D: Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it.
C: SONNY
D: `Reginald Erskine'. Don't believe I ever heard of him-
E: reading
C: TY
D: Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway.
C: SONNY
D: And you were the piano man.
C: TY
D: Piano man, arranger, you name it.
C: SONNY
D: That must of been somethin, see the country first class.
C: TY
D: I don't know about first class, but we seen the country.
C: SONNY
D: How come you stopped?
C: TY
D: Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas.
E: shrugs
N: He bangs the last nail in-
C: TY
D: Met Delilah and wanted something of my own.
C: SONNY
D: Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight.
N: Ty looks at Sonny, considers telling him what the plan is-
C: TY
D: No- I don't spose you will.
N: Ty gets up and goes into the back. Sonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall behind the counter and snaking off in every direction. He grabs hold of one, thinking-
S: INT. PURVIS HOUSE - KITCHEN
N: Delilah is in her kitchen, HUMMING a GOSPEL SONG to herself, apron on as she begins to make a pie. She pulls a METAL FLOUR CANNISTER down from the shelf, flips the lid off- about half full. She starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out- a small CLOTH PURSE. She picks it up to put it aside, then frowns at the way it feels. She shakes flour off, unzips it- Nothing inside.
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM
N: Maceo loads bottles of beer into the ICEBOX, wincing as the sounds of a SCREAMING ARGUMENT blast in from the bar-
C: DELILAH
D: How could you do that?

C: TY
D: Imonna put that back and double-
E: O.S.
C: DELILAH
D: You don't go gamblin with my baby's money!

E: O.S.
C: DELILAH
D: I don't care what you took it for, I saved that money up for China Doll-
E: O.S.
N: Delilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room, pursued by Ty, trying to explain-
C: DELILAH
D: -and you got no business puttin your fingers on it!
C: TY
D: China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job!
C: DELILAH
D: There's got to be some line you won't cross, some thing you won't do-
C: TY
D: The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe I'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, I-
C: DELILAH
D: Reverend Cutlip is right about you!
N: WHAM! Delilah slams the back door as she storms out. Ty turns and CRACK! kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar. Maceo opens a beer with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development-

N: That voice telling you where you need to be right now! You just got to move your feet and get there!
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BACK ROOM - NIGHT
N: China Doll fusses with Sonny's hair after he hangs his guitar, dangling with electrical hookups, over his head-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: You look good.
N: Ty steps back in with them, wiping sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. He looks Sonny over- his hair slick and shiny, the outfit Nadine sewed up for him tight and sparkling-
C: TY
D: Damn-
E: impressed
C: CHINA DOLL
D: He looks good, doesn't he Daddy?
C: TY
D: Honey, I want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge. And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear?
C: CHINA DOLL
D: What's gonna go wrong?
C: TY
D: Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping it could get a little rough- just be on your toes, that's all.
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Okay.
N: She starts away-
C: TY
D: China Doll-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: Yeah?
C: TY
D: You know there aint a thing in this world I wouldn't do for you. Even if I mess up sometimes, you know that, right?
N: China Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but pleased to hear it. The CALLS for Guitar Sam grow LOUDER from the floor-
C: CHINA DOLL
D: I know that, Daddy.
C: TY
D: You go on, now.
N: China Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny-
C: TY
D: Well, you look like something might of come outa New Orleans-
C: SONNY
D: I forget to tell you- I fixed your hook-up.
C: TY
D: My what?
C: SONNY
D: Where the electricity comes in? It was all-
C: MACEO
D: Ty!
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see Maceo stepping in, concerned-
C: MACEO
D: We got a situation out there-
C: TY
D: You don't think I know that?
C: MACEO
D: Got the law in the house.
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - BARROOM
N: Sheriff Pugh stands near the piano, putting a considerable damper on the mood in the room. Ty hurries out to him, with a panic-stricken smile on his face-
C: TY
D: Didn't think we'd be seeing you so soon!
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Got a nice crowd in here tonight, Tyrone. See them army uniforms-
E: looking around
C: TY
D: Yeah, well we got ourselves this special attraction, see, and-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Chicken.
C: TY
D: Huh?
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Them ribs outside smell real good, but I got my heart set on some of your Delilah's fried chicken.
C: TY
D: Right-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: She made it last Saturday at the mayor's but ole Clayford Gentry was up from Eufala and he got the drumsticks.
N: Sheriff Pugh is distracted for a moment as Opal and the girls from the store step in, dressed to the nines, drinking up the eyeball action from the pickers and soldiers-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: I'm partial to dark meat.
C: TY
D: See, the thing is-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: She is back there cookin, aint she? Our agreement was-
C: TY
D: The situation we got, Sheriff, what with this special guest come up from Louisiana- what it means is- uhm-
N: Ty has nothing, the crowd is starting to CHANT for Guitar Sam again. He wipes his forehead-
C: TY
D: Maybe if you were to come back in-
C: DELILAH
D: Regular or spicy?
N: Delilah is there, smiling at Pugh, pulling her coat off-
C: DELILAH
D: They both take the same time to fix up, I just got to know which.
N: Ty and Delilah exchange a long look-
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Have to make mine regular. I like the spicy fine but it always come back to nip me later.
N: She shoots a look to Ty-
C: DELILAH
D: It's important not to bite off more than you can chew. Yall just make yourself at home.
E: to Pugh
N: She kisses Ty on the cheek and heads for the kitchen-
C: DELILAH
D: Good luck tonight, baby.
C: SHERIFF PUGH
D: Slap some maynaise on it!
N: Ty smiles, his nerves all gone now-
C: TY
D: Might want to wait over there, Sheriff. Don't want to scare off the customers-
E: pointing
N: A CHEER from the crowd. Sonny has wandered uncertainly out onto the stage!
C: TY
D: Oh Lord-
N: Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar- Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty- Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE, then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind the keyboard-
C: TY
D: So here's what you all been waitin for, people, the noted performer and recordin star-
N: ENTRANCE - TIME AND YOUNG HENRY Time Trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case, hat on his head, exuding his no-sweat attitude. Beside him is YOUNG HENRY, a kid who can't be more than 14, wearing a fedora-
C: TY
D: -direct from New Orleans, Louisiana-
E: O.S.
N: STAGE
C: TY
D: -Guitar Sam!!!!
N: A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the connection- Sheriff Pugh cover his ears- The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained faces- Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-
C: SONNY
D: Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on the train.
N: The audience is stone-faced. Could this really be the man? Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling sticks from inside his shirt- Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat- China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at the door- Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage, worried- Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the BUZZ under control- Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear-
C: DEX
D: What's this fool playin at?
N: Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the stage, panicked- -as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering, ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO! Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open- Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-
C: SONNY
D: Gonna hold may baby as tight as I can Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty man! Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight!
N: Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins- Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-
C: SONNY
D: Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight!
N: Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a look upward-
C: DELILAH
D: Thank you, Jesus.
N: Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other-
C: SONNY
D: Meet me at midnight behind the barn Don't you worry I'll do you no harm
N: The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time-
C: SONNY
D: Make sure to bring my rockin shoes Tonight I'm gonna rock away all of my blues!
N: Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break, walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand! Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified jitterbug, people spreading to give them room- Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner paying special attention to Opal's hip action- As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving- closer, closer- Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone, takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the break from Time! The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now, others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to his guitar- China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time, thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter! He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the NIGHT-
S: EXT. ACE OF SPADES - NIGHT
N: Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaint's, beers in hand, staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny steps out PLAYING with a CROWD behind him-
C: HAM
D: What the hell is that?
N: Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays, a CAR stopping short of running him over. He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a TRUCK from the other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS. Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the Honeydripper, still playing-
C: HAM
D: We got to check that out!
N: A couple dozen patrons move away with him. We HOLD on the doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look, puzzled and angry-
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT
N: Time and Metalmouth SING into the same microphone as Sonny plays his way back up to the stage-
C: TIME AND METALMOUTH
D: Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight- Have you heard the news? There's good rockin tonight-
N: We FOLLOW as Maceo hustles back and forth, trying to keep up with orders for ribs, bring cold beers out from the icebox, etc. He suddenly stops in his tracks- Nadine stands before him, looking fatally sexy in a SATIN DRESS she no doubt made herself.
C: MACEO
D: Oh my soul.
C: NADINE
D: Don't tire yourself out, Poppa. You an me got bidness together.
C: MACEO
D: I believe we do.
N: He hurries past with his arms full of beer, pivoting to check her out from another angle- Dex sees across the room, frowns- Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar, leaning in close to be heard over the music-
C: SONNY
D: I heard the news- There's good rockin tonight!
N: Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild- CHEERING, WHISTLING, STOMPING!
C: SONNY
D: Alla you men grab hold of a woman! You can't find a woman, just grab hold of yourselves- we gonna play this one slow and tight.
N: Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light Boogie. Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and Ty joins in at the piano-
C: SONNY
D: They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low
N: Ty joins him-
C: SONNY AND TY
D: They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low
N: Ty takes the verse-
C: TY
D: I went to a party With a bobby sox I started swingin All she would do was rock
N: As they join in the chorus, Ty sees- Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a proprietary air. Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar. Maceo sees as well, tightening up- Cool Breeze nods to Ty. A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already counting out a huge pile of BILLS-
C: MACEO
D: Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty. And they's another fifty in here-
N: Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the countertop-
C: MACEO
D: Lucky Hardaway don't mind some change, does he?
N: Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty instead-
C: COOL BREEZE
D: What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change, he wants the club back one way or the other?
N: Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-
C: COOL BREEZE
D: How'd that be?
C: TY
D: Well- he'd have to take it up with my bidness partner.
N: Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from Delilah. Ty smiles and waves- Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-
C: COOL BREEZE
D: That sheriff your partner?
C: TY
D: Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly.
E: sighs
N: Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-
C: COOL BREEZE
D: You must want this club awful bad, brother.
N: Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-
C: COOL BREEZE
D: You maybe know this already, but that aint no Guitar Sam.
N: He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song-
S: TOUSSAINT (O.S.)
N: You is a lie! A shocked silence. The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony finger at Sonny-
C: TOUSSAINT
D: You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy since he's drinkin mama's milk, hell, I known his Mama herself when she live up to Plaquemine- and you aint him!
N: The audience looks to Sonny for his defense- Ty holds his breath. Maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar. Sonny just smiles-
C: SONNY
D: That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.
N: Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-
C: TOUSSAINT
D: As long as we straight on that.
C: JUNEBUG
D: Get on outa there and let the man play!
N: A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back to his microphone-
C: SONNY
D: Imonna play you one I come up with today while I was havin my hair cut-
N: He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with, then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-
C: SONNY
D: Oh China Doll Can't get you offa my mind! Oh China Doll I can't get you offa my mind! If you be my baby Gonna leave all them others behind!
N: The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is drawn toward the stage-
C: SONNY
D: Oh China Doll Think about you day and night! Oh China Doll I think about you day and night! Can't forget you baby Oh when you gonna treat me right?
N: Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK- TY Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room- POV - SHERIFF PUGH The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door. The last person he passes turns toward Ty- Possum? But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone. TY Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the train station. Ty searches the crowd- POV The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the crowd dancing- There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty. TY We TIGHTEN on TY. Why is he here? POV - POSSUM Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we PAN to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each other's face. We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men, body language telling us a fight is about to break out- ECU TY Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again, the SAX MUSIC growing echoey and menacing-
S: INT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
N: The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the- -KNIFE falls to the floor, BLOODY, and the- -Guitar Man falls to his hands and knees, his stomach a bloody mess, crawling on all fours and HOWLING and Young Tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and the Girl SCREAMING-
S: INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT - (PRESENT)
N: -which becomes Time BLOWING HIS SAX into the microphone- -and Dex reaches for his pistol- -and Ham reaches for his knife, but- -a huge, strong hand clamps down on Dex's wrist- -and another huge hand grabs Ham's wrist! Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron. A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised pickers-
C: TY
D: Yall in my house, here, gentlemen. Don't have no fightin, don't have no killin, don't have none of that dismal nonsense in my house. Understand? What's your name son?
N: Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm-
C: DEX
D: Dex- Dexter Moncrief.
C: TY
D: And you?
C: HAM
D: Hamilton Drinkwater.
C: TY
D: Well, gentlemen, this is the night there won't be no pitiful song written bout you two killin each other. Don't nothin rhyme with `Moncrief' anyhow.
N: Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard BOX in one hand and the BASEBALL BAT in the other-
C: MACEO
D: Got a problem here?
C: TY
D: These young men seem to brought something in for our collection.
C: MACEO
D: Yours first.
E: to Dex
N: Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-
C: TY
D: Now yours.
N: He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-
C: TY
D: Yall still need to mess with each other, you go outside and do it.
N: Ty lets go of their wrists-
C: TY
D: This world is full of people got no use for us, like to see us in the grave. We don't need to give em any help.
N: The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into opposite corners- STAGE Sonny keeps playing-
C: SONNY
D: Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart! Oh China Doll Got to let you into my heart! I surrender darlin I loved you from the very start!
N: Ty rushes to the piano, joins in jamming with the other players-
S: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
N: Slick sits on a tomb, drinking wine, MOONLIGHT spilling over Bertha Mae's fresh-dug GRAVE. He listens to the MUSIC in the far distance-
C: SLICK
D: Sound like the music movin on again, darlin. The way it always do.
N: He listens for another moment, sighs-
C: SLICK
D: Time to make room for whoever comin next.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING
N: The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign. We hear the CROW of a distant ROOSTER. The parking lot is empty but for Ty's old Ford- Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-
C: POSSUM
D: That boy can play some.
E: O.S.
N: Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.
C: TY
D: You leavin?
C: POSSUM
D: Aint needed round here no more.
C: TY
D: Where you headed?
C: POSSUM
D: Oh-- down the road.
E: smiles
N: Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment.
C: MACEO
D: Tyrone-
E: O.S.
N: Ty turns as Maceo steps out, equally tired and unshaven-
C: MACEO
D: Who you talkin to out here?
N: Maceo looks down the road, but Possum is nowhere to be seen. Ty shrugs-
C: TY
D: Just myself.
S: EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - EARLY MORNING
N: Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again. Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the board- -and begins to PLAY! Fast, rhythmic boogie piano- Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who nods, and then- -he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie. We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over the field- It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll. THE END
