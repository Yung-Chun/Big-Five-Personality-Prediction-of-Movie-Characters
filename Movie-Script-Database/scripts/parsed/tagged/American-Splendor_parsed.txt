T: FADE IN:
S: INT. HARVEYÂ’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A BEDROOM MIRROR. The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall. Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely wrong. Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark. ANGLE ON BED Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, he's almost translucent.
C: HARVEY
D: Joyce... Joyce?
E: faintly
N: Joyce springs up, alarmed.
C: JOYCE
D: What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up?
N: Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.
C: JOYCE
D: What is it?
C: HARVEY
D: Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book?
E: delirious, out of breath
N: Joyce rubs her eyes.
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey...
C: HARVEY
D: If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away...
N: Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly Harvey collapses. Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down on the floor and shakes him.
C: JOYCE
D: Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!
N: CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY
T: FADE UP ON:
N: A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN. INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956 CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils glare through the eye holes... The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin. Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat. He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door. The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.
C: BOYS
D: Trick or treat!!
E: in unison
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Well, look at this! All the superheroes on the porch! Ain't that cute.
N: The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: We got Superman here, Batman, his sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern even...
E: still yelling
N: She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: And what about you young man?
C: KID
D: What about what?
N: The other boys giggle. The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass" look.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Who are you supposed to be?
N: The kid shrugs.
C: KID
D: I'm Harvey Pekar .
E: pronounced "Pee Car"
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound like a super hero to me...
C: BOYS
D: Pecker, Pecker...
E: mumbling
C: KID
D: I ain't no super hero, lady. I'm just a kid from the neighborhood, alright?
N: The Housewife stares at him, confused.
C: KID
D: Ahh, forget this...
N: Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down. He trudges off as the others watch in confusion.
C: KID
D: Why is everybody so stoopid?
N: BEGIN NERVOUS JAZZ SCORE WE FOLLOW the schlumpy kid (aka HARVEY PEKAR) as he sulks down the street...

S: EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1975 - DUSK
N: INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1975 A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The "GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly expression. CREDIT SEQUENCE - ANIMATED SEQUENCE INTERCUT HARVEY WALKING WITH COMIC BOOK PANELS OF THE CARTOON HARVEY IN ACTION. This is not your typical super-hero stuff. Instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats as:
S: INT. CITY BUS - FALL 1975 - DAY
N: --Riding the city bus.
S: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: --Working as a file clerk at the Veteran's Hospital.
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY
N: --Trying to wash dishes.
S: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
N: --Waiting on line at the supermarket.
S: EXT. GARAGE SALE - DAY
N: --Buying used records from a garage sale table.
S: INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY
N: --Eating junk food at a greasy spoon.
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue. (Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn by different comic artists.) Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen: FROM OFF THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND COMES... Followed by the explosive title: AMERICAN SPLENDOR The high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the remainder of the credits.
S: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET OVERLOOKING FACTORIES - DAY
N: We're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at the factories below.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say comics saved his life. This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere. Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie.
E: V.O.
N: SUDDENLY EVERYTHING -- THE MUSIC, THE CREDITS, THE IMAGES -- COMES TO A HALT.

S: INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY
N: HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over" above. He clutches a movie script in his hand. The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate that he's in a recording session. Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack... maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey" through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary, saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened. "But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough." We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life. SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off... Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast before they get to know the real me..." END HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE

S: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: INTERTITLE: 1975 HARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR unwraps a tongue depressor. Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting.
C: HARVEY
D: Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She says I'm a social embarrassment. Now that she's got her PhD, she's some hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it. But me bein' a file clerk was fine when I wrote the damn check for her tuition --
N: DOCTOR #1 Harvey, stop talking please, and open wide. He points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just keeps on going.
C: HARVEY
D: I just don't get it... We were doin' okay for a while. Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. I started losin' my voice on the plane. Can you believe that... On the plane, doc?
N: DOCTOR #1 Bad timing, I guess. Now please say "Ah," Mr. Pekar.
C: HARVEY
D: "Ahhh." "Ahhh" ruined the trip. I got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what I'm like? Man, it's torture --
E: without missing a beat
N: DOCTOR #1 Shhh... The Doctor shines a penlight into Harvey's mouth and looks around. DOCTOR #1 Uh-huh. He raises an eyebrow. Harvey catches this. Hypochondria overtakes him.
C: HARVEY
D: What? Is it bad, doc?
E: the penlight in his mouth
N: The Doctor removes the penlight. DOCTOR #1 It's not good. Harvey jumps off the table.
C: HARVEY
D: It's cancer? First I got marital problems and now yer tellin' me I got throat cancer? Omigod...
N: DOCTOR #1 Harvey, calm down. It's not cancer. You have a nodule on your vocal chords. Probably from screaming and yelling too much. And if you don't stop talking and give it a rest, you're gonna lose your voice completely. Relieved, Harvey calms down. He nods, agreeing to be good.
C: HARVEY
D: Whew... Okay, okay. But fer how long?
N: DOCTOR #1 A few months.
C: HARVEY
D: Months!!
E: loudly
N: Suddenly Harvey's voice cracks under his effort to raise it. He sheepishly grabs his throat. DOCTOR #1 See? More of that and you'll do permanent damage. Now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won't have to operate. Operate? Harvey gets nervous again. The Doctor throws him his clothing.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: A silent sequence. A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along an empty lot. Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground. He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing run-down stores and ramshackle apartments.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: Harvey approaches TOBY -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60- something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing. He is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice. In short, he is a super dork.
C: TOBY
D: Hi Harvey. You weren't in work today. Are you okay, Harvey?
N: Harvey barely looks up. He nods his head "yes" and keeps walking.
C: TOBY
D: I'm heading downtown to the White Castle. Wanna come, Harvey?
E: yelling after him
N: Harvey leaves Toby behind and turns the corner.
S: EXT. DELI - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: Two WOMEN argue loudly over a payphone. SPANISH WOMAN #1 (in Spanish) I already told you, I'm waiting for a call! SPANISH WOMAN #2 Oh yeah? Since when is this your private office?! SPANISH WOMAN #1 Since you can kiss my ass. Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of their ability to speak. CLOSE UP: SPANISH WOMAN #1's MOUTH
C: HARVEY
D: Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do it?
E: to himself
N: Out of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey eavesdropping. WOMAN #2 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone! Startled, Harvey moves on.
S: EXT. ACROSS FROM A PARK - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: He passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream, yell and laugh with abandon.
C: HARVEY
D: They all make it seem so easy.
E: shaking his head
N: Then, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball. The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on. A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Here's our man walking home from the doctor's. He's got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really? 'Cause his throat's a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day. His problems are nothin'.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BRIDGE OVER TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
N: Totally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his way home.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid, like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Maybe his old lady will go easy on him today, when she sees how upset he is.
E: V.O.
S: INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY
N: Harvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate. An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously leaving him. HARVEY enters the room.
C: HARVEY
D: Ay... What is this?
E: whispering
N: Harvey's voice breaks up.
C: LANA
D: Exactly what it looks like.
C: HARVEY
D: Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? Ah, shit!
E: loud his voice really rips
N: That last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving.
C: LANA
D: Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore. Cleveland's not working for me anymore. I gotta get out of here before I kill myself.
C: HARVEY
D: But --
N: She gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails her, trying to reason. He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.
C: HARVEY
D: Please! Wait, honey... Just listen to what I got to say...
E: mouthing, just a wheeze
N: She turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something. But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes air. He tries again. No sound at all. Finally LANA gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves. SLAM!!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY
N: At his cubicle in the file room, Harvey fills a cart with files. He's physically at work, but mentally in a daze.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Here's our man -- yeah alright, here's me -- or the guy playin' me, anyway, though he don't look nothin' like me, but whatever. So it's a few months later an' I'm workin' my flunky, file-clerk gig at the V.A. Hospital. My voice still ain't back yet. Things seem like they can't get any worse...
E: V.O.
N: A nurse pops her head in. Harvey hands her a file.
C: NURSE
D: Thank you, Harvey dear.
N: He doesn't hear her, still stewing about LANA. He shoves the last files in the cart and pushes it away.
C: HARVEY
D: Plebeian... where the hell did she get that shit?
E: to himself
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FILE ROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER
N: We see rows and rows of endless files... Still in a daze, Harvey removes the files from the cart and puts them on the shelves.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Avoid the reeking herd! Shun the polluted flock! Live like that stoic bird, The eagle of the rock!
E: O.S.
N: Harvey turns around. Mr. Boats -- a portly, African-American maintenance worker wearing a bow-tie -- steps into Harvey's row. He has a tool box.
C: HARVEY
D: Huh? Oh. Hiya, Mr. Boats.
N: Harvey resumes shelving.
C: BOATS
D: You know what that means, son?
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah. It's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem. It means stay away from the crowds of common ordinary people an' do yer own thing.
N: Mr. Boats laughs.
C: BOATS
D: Nope, it means don't compromise yourself for women. Ain't gonna do you no good! Get away from 'em as soon as you can!
C: HARVEY
D: Well I ain't got no woman now. So I'm living like the stoic bird, man.
C: MR. BOATS
D: The only way to live, son.
N: Somehow this doesn't make Harvey feel any better about his life.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY
N: Harvey carries an armful of files. Mr. Boats still trails him, lugging his tool box. Suddenly, Mr. Boats points out a young African-American FILE CLERK wearing a pair of big headphones on his afro. He moves as if he's listening to music.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Look at that fool over there. What's he wearing?
C: HARVEY
D: Huh? That's an A.M.-F.M. radio he's listening to... They got 'em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs.
C: MR. BOATS
D: MMPH! Isn't that somethin! People have gone crazy. They'll buy any kinda junk! Probably listening to that loud rock stuff. Junk, junk, it's all junk!
E: inappropriately angered
C: HARVEY
D: Well, I don't know. Rock music's got some good qualities. I mean it ain't jazz or nothin'.
N: Mr. Boats looks at him like he's crazy.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Say, when you gonna bring me in some good records? Some Nat "King" Cole with Strings...
C: HARVEY
D: I don't got any of that, Mr. Boats...
N: Mr. Boats stops and yells down the hall at Harvey.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Yeah, you got it... You're keepin' it at home, though! You won't turn loose the good stuff... You just sell the junk!
N: Harvey shakes his head as Mr. Boats finishes his diatribe. Mr. Boats turns into a room.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa. Men have named you.

N: HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE Harvey sits on outdoor furniture. A few props are featured in the frame indicating a garage-sale-like setting (including a record player). Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of used records. HARVEY shows us his prodigious record collection. Thousands of LP's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc. -- are piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases. He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing jazz reviews and music articles. He finds the first record that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable. As the music plays... Harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records. This leads into how he first met ROBERT CRUMB.

N: INTERTITLE: 1962 HARVEY (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a bunch of his BUDDIES sift through old records at a junk sale.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: In the early sixties I was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when I met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb. You know the guy; Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all -- they made a movie about him, too.
E: V.O.
N: One of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a box.
C: MARTY
D: C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann. You gonna buy that or what?
N: Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP.
C: HARVEY
D: I don't know, Marty. It's got a lamination crack in it... A quarter. Maybe I can get him down.
E: checking out the price
C: MARTY
D: You are one cheap bastard Harvey.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I live on a government wage.
N: A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB.
C: CRUMB
D: You collect Jay McShann, man?
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, man. How 'bout you?
C: CRUMB
D: Yeah but most of my records are back in Philly.
N: A greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, PAHLS, joins them.

D: Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He just moved to town. He's an artist at American Greeting Card Company.
C: HARVEY
D: That's cool.

C: REAL HARVEY
D: So Crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on -- THE BIG YUM YUM BOOK. I'd never seen anything like it.
E: V.O.
N: HARVEY marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated comic novel. CRUMB sits on the floor nursing a beer and sorting through vintage comic books. Harvey's bursting with so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive.
C: HARVEY
D: It's terrific, man! I really dig your work.
N: Crumb ignores Harvey's praise.
C: CRUMB
D: This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly... It's pretty rare.
E: holding up a vintage comic
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah? Can I get good bread for it?
C: CRUMB
D: Nah! Not yet.
N: Harvey flops down in an overstuffed chair. Stuffing flies out. He sips his beer.
C: HARVEY
D: Listen man, let's get back to your book. What are you gonna do with it?
C: CRUMB
D: I hadn't thought about it. It's just an exercise.
E: looking up
N: Harvey flips through the book.
C: HARVEY
D: It's more than an exercise. It's breaking ground, man. There's some wild shit in here.

C: REAL HARVEY
D: Crumb and I hung out a lot back then. We had records and comics in common.
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE ON CRUMB'S DRAWING We see Crumb is actually sketching Harvey, slumped in a chair reading a book. Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty madman with ratty clothing. Crumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him.
C: CRUMB
D: Check it out, man. Pretty scary.
E: laughing
N: Harvey glances up at his portrait, completely unselfconscious.

N: ANOTHER R. CRUMB DRAWING OF HARVEY (Now circa 1975) On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting alone on a park bench. He pulls at his hair, and looks as though he may murder the next person who walks by. INTERTITLE: BACK TO 1975 As the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face, WE HEAR:
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Once he came to visit when I was really feelin' bad. It was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me. At first it was pretty weird. I mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him. I was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks. I was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist.
E: V.O.
N: HARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches. Harvey's voice is still raspy.
C: HARVEY
D: I dunno, man. On the one hand most women gettin' graduate degrees wouldn't give a guy like me the time a' day. An' she married me an' everything, so I gotta give her some kinda credit. But then she got so mean to me in the end. An' it ain't like I tried t'keep her captive or anything like that, y'know?
N: Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to tell.
C: HARVEY
D: An' then on top of it I lost my voice for three months. I still sound like shit, but before I had nothin'. Man, talk about hell. I started forgettin' what I sound like, y'know? So I started writin' stuff down -- stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas. I even published a couple jazz record reviews. I guess that ended up bein' a good thing.
C: CRUMB
D: Uh-huh.
C: HARVEY
D: But don't think I buy into this "growth" crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that clichÃ©d stuff. I've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty. Right now, I'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness.
E: a beat
N: For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to each other, each man in his own private universe. Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.
C: HARVEY
D: So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland?
N: Crumb never looks up from his picture.
C: CRUMB
D: I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in New York. And I'm really busy with the comic book stuff. It's good bread and all man but I'm getting fed up with the whole scene.
C: HARVEY
D: What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin' a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh. How many guys get that lucky in their life, huh?
C: CRUMB
D: Yeah, I dunno.
C: HARVEY
D: Ya know man, people are startin' to know the name "Crumb." When you croak you're gonna leave something behind.
C: CRUMB
D: Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. It's not like I'm Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton.
C: HARVEY
D: C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck.
C: CRUMB
D: Yeah, well that's true...

N: CLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: "RECENTLY DECEASED." A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer. By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of "expired patient" files. He places each into the appropriate alphabetical "deceased" drawer. Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks the entire pile onto the floor.
C: HARVEY
D: Damn it!
N: He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired lives" laid out before his eyes. We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, etc... Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp. Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up. ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, "CHARLIE MARSHALL." He opens the folder and reads the stats... Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: Clerk ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's small, invisible and now vanished life...

N: HARVEY pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded supermarket. He pulls a few cans of Beef-A-Roni off the shelf and heads off to pay. Reaching the check-out area, he evaluates the situation. ANGLE ON CHECK-OUT COUNTERS: There are three lines to choose from. Two of the counters have long waits. The third is much shorter but there is an OLD JEWISH LADY next in line. SUDDENLY, THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO: The LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME remains Harvey at the supermarket deliberating over the check-out lines. However, the RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRAME now contains a CRUMB STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts. It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art... There's a lot of things you gotta consider." ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind the Old Lady. MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon Harvey stands behind the Old Lady. A new BUBBLE reads: "It may be the shortest line but I am takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady." BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... The CASHIER rings up the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses.
C: OLD JEWISH LADY
D: Listen, goily, dese glasses are six for $2.00 because I couldn't carry twelf... But I vanted twelf so today I'm buying six more... But you should only charge me $1.50 for dem... It's ok, you can esk de meneger.
E: Yiddish Accent
N: Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently. He knows he's in trouble now.
C: CASHIER
D: Frank! I need a price check.
E: yelling
N: SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.
C: CARTOON HARVEY
D: Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything. Get behind them in a line an' yer gonna wait forever!
N: The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica. He impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething.
C: CARTOON HARVEY
D: I mean, I'm a yid myself, an' the women in my family are like that... But I never got used to it... I may be cheap, but I got limits!
N: ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN... The MANAGER finally arrives. The Old Lady haggles with him, too.
C: OLD JEWISH LADY
D: Please. Let me 'splain von more time.
N: MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE... The Cartoon Harvey turns to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the eyes. It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon alter ego.
C: CARTOON HARVEY
D: Wake up! You're whole life's gettin' eaten away by this kinda crap! What kind of existence is this? Is this all a workin' stiff like you can expect? Ya gonna suffer in silence fer the rest a' yer life?! Or ya gonna make a mark. Huh? Huh?
N: IN AN INSTANT, THE CARTOON HARVEY DISAPPEARS AND THE LIVE ACTION SCENE TAKES OVER THE WHOLE FRAME. Suddenly motivated by an odd notion, Harvey abandons his grocery cart and runs out of the supermarket.

S: INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT
N: Bursting with ideas, Harvey (wearing his undershirt and boxers) starts story-boarding his first comic with stick figures.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1975 - MORNING
N: A bleary-eyed HARVEY, still clad in an undershirt and boxers, dozes off over a bowl of Corn Flakes. On the table next to some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with scribbling. He clearly has been slaving over this work all night. ANGLE ON PAPERS: At the top is a quickly scribbled title, "Standing Behind Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines." These are ad hoc versions of a comic book. The pages are divided like a tick- tack-toe board. Each square is filled with crude stick figure drawings and lots of writing. An alarm clock goes off. Harvey's eyes fly open.
C: HARVEY
D: Shit. Work.
N: Harvey yawns, then notices the pile of papers. He peruses them, proud of his work. He gets up and looks out the window. I/E. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - HARVEY'S POV - 1975 - MORNING It is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere. The following scene unfolds through the window: Two UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their conversation is distant, but entirely audible. MATTRESS GUY #1 So how smart is she? MATTRESS GUY #2 I dunno. I guess she's about average. MATTRESS GUY #1 Average? Hey, man. Average is dumb! They drop the mattress in place. With the window framing these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic book panel.
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. He moves back towards his pile of stick-figure drawings. CLOSE ON PAPER Harvey scribbles the words "AMERICAN SPLENDOR" at the top of the page.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1975 - DAY
N: The following scene is shot through the restaurant window. We see reflections of people walking by. A tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and reads Harvey's mock-ups. Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice.
C: HARVEY
D: See, ever since I read your stuff, man I've been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done.
C: CRUMB
D: Uh-huh.
E: munching on a fry
C: HARVEY
D: I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know?
C: CRUMB
D: Pass me the ketchup?
C: HARVEY
D: I mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form. Like those French movies are. Or De Sica over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried writin' some things about real life. Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with.
N: Crumb finally looks up from Harvey's work.
C: CRUMB
D: These are about you.
C: HARVEY
D: Er, yeah...
C: CRUMB
D: You turned yourself into a comic hero?
C: HARVEY
D: Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit. No phony bullshit. The real thing, y'know? Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.
N: Crumb reads more. Harvey waits anxiously. Finally Crumb starts to chuckle.
C: CRUMB
D: These are really good, Harv.
C: HARVEY
D: Really? Ya think so?
E: insecure
N: Crumb shuffles through more.
C: CRUMB
D: Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can I take them home and illustrate them?
N: Harvey is practically bursting.
C: HARVEY
D: Wow!!
N: Harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. He clears his throat. And something miraculous happens... When Harvey opens his mouth to speak his LARYNGITIS IS GONE!
C: HARVEY
D: You'd do that for me, man? That'd be great! I can't draw a straight line!
C: CRUMB
D: Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv? All of a sudden it sounds fine.
C: HARVEY
D: I don't know, man! I guess you cured me!
E: thrilled
S: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - SNACK ROOM HALLWAY - DAY
N: HARVEY bounds towards the snack room where a group of hospital workers and patients hang out. He bangs on the window to get their attention. When they look up, Harvey waves a comic book in the air.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - SNACK ROOM - DAY
N: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR COMIC BOOK FEATURING THE TWO MATTRESS GUYS: Scrawled across the top in big red letters reads, "AMERICAN SPLENDOR. Vol. #1" A man's finger points to the words, "All Stories by Harvey Pekar. Art by R. Crumb." The comic book sits atop a table in the dreary snack room. A crowd of HOSPITAL WORKERS, PATIENTS, DOCTORS, MAINTENANCE WORKERS, etc. (under ten total) gather around a proud HARVEY who shows off his work. For the first time, he seems almost happy.
C: HARVEY
D: See that? All stories by yours truly.
E: beaming
N: A WWII VET PATIENT with a portable IV cranes to get a glimpse.
C: WW II VET PATIENT
D: Hot off the presses, huh? We got a regular Hemingway here.
C: HARVEY
D: No way, Jack, I don't go in for that macho crap.
N: DOCTOR #3 chimes in. DOCTOR #3 I didn't know you could draw, Pekar.
C: HARVEY
D: Nah! I don't draw. I just write the stories. A buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work.
N: TOBY, the supernerd from the bus stop, grabs the comic book off the table and peruses it.
C: TOBY
D: Harvey, am I in here? You promised I would be in here.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah! Yeah! You're in there, alright? Jeez, Toby.
N: SUDDENLY, MR. BOATS -- Harvey's philosophical co-worker -- pushes his way thorough the crowd. He snatches the comic out of Toby's hand.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Let me see this.
C: TOBY
D: Mr. Boats, it's not polite to grab things. Next time --
C: MR. BOATS
D: Son, you done good. Ya know, I was up in Toronto a few weeks back an' I saw the Red Chinese Ballet...
N: As Mr. Boats talks, the crowd starts to disperse.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Now that was beautiful. The way those people were dancing together. Those Chinese work hard. I tell ya, they work hard -- Where is everybody goin'?
N: Mr. Boats hands the comic book back to Harvey and turns on his heels. Through the window he notices TWO VETS IN WHEELCHAIRS moving down the hall.
C: MR. BOATS
D: Where these sickly men rushin' off to? They ain't goin' nowhere for now. Maybe not for a long time. But damn if they ain't in a rush to get there.
N: Harvey stands there, his moment of glory passed. But it's okay. He flips through his comic and smiles.

C: HARVEY
D: Cut it out. Man, I ain't nothin' yet compared to Bob Crumb.
N: GUY #3 Ah, listen to him. One lousy comic book and he wants to be Crumb. The GUYS laugh. ANGLE ON SILENT GUY A SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND BROWNS trading cards.
C: PAHLS
D: Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it.
N: GUY #3 Yeah, you can write about Marty's sex life. Harvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage. He seems to be observing them more than interacting with them. GUY #3 Right Marty? I heard ya went out with Bonnie yesterday.
C: PAHLS
D: Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her?

C: REAL HARVEY
D: Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now. Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think. But so what? It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb.

D: So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness -- I resigned myself to a menial existence. But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just needed a woman.

C: HARVEY
D: Huh? Sure, I'll take 'em.
N: Toby watches Harvey eat a few.
C: HARVEY
D: Hey, watermelon. That's pretty good.
C: TOBY
D: I recommend the piÃ±a coladas. They are excellent and very authentic tasting.
N: Toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves, stuffing his bag. Harvey gets up and comes after him.
C: HARVEY
D: Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during lent?
C: TOBY
D: Sure. I don't see why not. You can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime.
C: HARVEY
D: Ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent?
C: TOBY
D: I don't think so but I'll ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday.
C: HARVEY
D: Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute? Sounds kinda mannish but who am I to be picky.
C: TOBY
D: Harvey, you're funny. She's a nun.
C: HARVEY
D: So what? Maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy.
C: TOBY
D: Harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling.
C: HARVEY
D: Higher calling. That is such a crock of shit. I don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway.
C: TOBY
D: Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I'm a very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up.
N: Toby turns on his heels and walks off.
C: HARVEY
D: What? Do I seem depressed, Toby?

N: ACTOR HARVEY steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service table behind him. At the table, the REAL HARVEY and the REAL TOBY load up on donuts. The two discuss the food on the set. Ironically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely incapable of eye-contact. The REAL TOBY discusses the finer points of nerdom and evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient. The Real Harvey explains to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans -- would have cheered him up at that point in his life. He was too lonely and depressed.

N: Harvey scratches his armpit.
C: HARVEY
D: I know, man. I got good grades and all but there was this required math class. I can't do math, an' that required class hangin' over my head made me crazy. Eventually the pressure got to be too much.

D: Well, you're doing okay anyway. I heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics.
N: This perks Harvey up.

D: Sure, you're famous. Meanwhile I got my degree but I'm just a plain old wife and mother.
N: Harvey stares at her wedding ring. His face drops.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah. I'm not doing as great as ya think. My second wife divorced me and I work at a dead end job as a file clerk. Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time I just stay home by myself and read.

What will he look like? As Joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different versions of an animated, illustrated Harvey among the people. She double-takes as sees the R. CRUMB HARVEY -- hairy, scary, smelly and picking his nose. Joyce rubs her eyes. Next she sees the BRANDO HARVEY (Gary Dumm), but unfortunately he disappears fast. Disappointed, Joyce notices the realistic DREW FRIEDMAN HARVEY walking towards her. She smiles as he dissolves into:
C: HARVEY
D: Hey. Are you Joyce?
E: O.S.
N: Joyce turns around. The flesh and blood HARVEY PEKAR stands before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable. She sighs with relief.
C: JOYCE
D: Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person.
N: She politely offers her hand. Harvey shakes it, but he looks overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic.
C: HARVEY
D: Hiya. Look, before we get started with any of this, ya might as well know right off the bat. I had a vasectomy.
N: Joyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief.

S: INT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT
N: The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture.
C: HARVEY
D: What's wrong?
C: JOYCE
D: Nothing.
C: HARVEY
D: Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around everywhere.
C: JOYCE
D: I guess I never imagined you eating in a place like this.
C: HARVEY
D: Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya?
C: JOYCE
D: It's fine. What difference does it make?
N: Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic.
C: HARVEY
D: I dunno. None, I guess. They sure got a lot of meat on this menu.
E: beat
C: JOYCE
D: You're a vegetarian?
C: HARVEY
D: Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore.
N: Joyce grabs a bread stick.
C: JOYCE
D: Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating.
N: Harvey just stares at her.
C: HARVEY
D: Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh?
C: JOYCE
D: Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness.
N: A cheery waitress bounces over.
C: WAITRESS
D: Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy! What can I bring you two today?
E: sing song
N: They slowly look up at her.

S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - NIGHT
N: JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, as usual.
C: HARVEY
D: Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed.
N: Joyce puts down her bag.
C: JOYCE
D: I've seen worse.
N: She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her.
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin.
N: Harvey just bounces back up and obeys.
C: HARVEY
D: What, ya got a headache?
C: JOYCE
D: No, but I want to avoid one.
N: Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable.
C: HARVEY
D: Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch.
N: Harvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce.
C: JOYCE
D: I had a nice time with you, too.
N: Joyce swallows the pill. Harvey sits down next to her.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah? You had a nice time?
C: JOYCE
D: Don't make people repeat themselves. It's annoying.
C: HARVEY
D: Oh, sorry.
N: They're inches away from each other.
C: JOYCE
D: C'mere...
N: She pulls him close. Harvey plants a kiss on her. They slowly separate. Joyce's eyes are closed. She likes him. He kisses her again. They start making out, moaning a bit. But before it gets heavy --
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey?
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah?
N: Joyce opens her eyes. She looks uneasy.
C: JOYCE
D: Which door's the bathroom?
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - 1980'S - DAY

N: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
C: HARVEY
D: I feel terrible. Lemme at least do something for you.
N: BACK TO:
S: INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on. She picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room. Then she looks at the can and realizes it's WD-40.
C: HARVEY
D: Can I make ya something? How about some chamomile tea?
N: Joyce puts the can down.
C: JOYCE
D: Chamomile tea? What the hell's a guy like you doing with that? I thought you drink soda pop for breakfast.
C: HARVEY
D: I dunno. I noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talkin' on the phone. So I stocked up on herbal teas for your visit.
E: O.S.
N: Joyce turns her head to the door. She's truly surprised by what Harvey's just said. And very moved. She smiles to herself. BACK TO:
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - DAY
N: Harvey stands there waiting.
C: HARVEY
D: The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff. One of 'ems good for stomachaches. Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint, I think. Are you still there?
N: Joyce slowly opens the door. She leans against the door frame like she's just been through a war. She takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt.
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married.
T: CUT TO:

N: Harvey and Joyce are in bed, lying in each other's arms. They look quite contented.
C: HARVEY
D: Man, am I glad I talked you into comin' up here. Any more time alone and I mighta lost it fer good.
C: JOYCE
D: Me too.
C: HARVEY
D: So you don't have any problems with movin' to Cleveland?
C: JOYCE
D: Not really. I find most American cities depressing in the same way.
C: HARVEY
D: An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing?
N: She shrugs.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY
N: HARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never. He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat. Harvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down.
C: HARVEY
D: Ay Toby.
C: TOBY
D: No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask.
E: mouth full
C: HARVEY
D: Can I have a fry?
N: Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries.
C: TOBY
D: Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over.
N: Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another fry.
C: HARVEY
D: Whattya got, a church function?
E: munching
C: TOBY
D: No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie. Would you like to come?
C: HARVEY
D: Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I'm gettin' married.
C: TOBY
D: Oh. Why Delaware?
C: HARVEY
D: The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie?
E: a beat
C: TOBY
D: It's not playing at the Mapletown. I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey.
E: a beat
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah. We met last week.
N: Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby.
C: HARVEY
D: Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for?
C: TOBY
D: It's a new film called "Revenge of the Nerds." It's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. I already saw it once.
C: HARVEY
D: Wow, ya really dig this movie.
C: TOBY
D: I like it a lot, Harvey.
C: HARVEY
D: What are these nerds like? How would you describe them?
C: TOBY
D: Hmm... Nerds are smart but they look and act differently than other people. Like nerds might wear polyester button- down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are showing.
N: Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt. He stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants.
C: HARVEY
D: So what yer sayin' is you identify with those nerds?
C: TOBY
D: Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And this movie has uplifted me. There's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. Then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward... So nearly everyone in the place does. That's the way the movie ends.
E: rubbing out the catsup
C: HARVEY
D: So the nerds won, huh?
C: TOBY
D: Yes.
E: smiling
N: Harvey grabs the rest of Toby's fries and opens the door to leave.
C: HARVEY
D: Wow. You got this movie an' I'm gettin' hitched. We both had a good month, huh?
C: TOBY
D: Right. Harvey, how long are you going to be in Delaware because I'd really like to see this movie with you?
E: finishing his last burger
C: HARVEY
D: I'm only goin' for a week but then I'll have a wife, so I'll have to take her along. Is it a girl flick?
C: TOBY
D: Depends on the girl. What kind of girl is your new bride? Is she a nerd?
C: HARVEY
D: I don't know, man. Maybe. She's into herbal teas.
N: Toby watches Harvey saunter off. He returns to his last hamburger.

S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - 1980'S - NIGHT
N: A brightly lit marquee reads, "REVENGE OF THE NERDS." The doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street. HARVEY, JOYCE and TOBY are among them. Toby proudly wears a "Genuine Nerd" button on his striped shirt.
C: JOYCE
D: I agree with Toby. I think it's a story of hope and tolerance.
C: TOBY
D: Yes. It's about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes.
N: Harvey scrunches his face in disbelief.
C: HARVEY
D: It's an entertaining flick an' I can see why you like it Toby, but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you! They're college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs. They're gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being nerds.
N: Joyce hits Harvey.
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey, what did I say about loud talking? Use your inside voice.
C: HARVEY
D: Look Toby, the guys in that movie are not 28-year-old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto.
E: whispering loudly
C: JOYCE
D: That's enough, Harvey.
C: HARVEY
D: They didn't get their computers like you did -- by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49.50 at the supermarket.
N: Joyce folds her arms in disapproval. Toby starts to laugh.
C: TOBY
D: You're funny Harvey.
N: Harvey looks at him, disappointed. He shakes his head.
C: HARVEY
D: Sure, Toby. Go to the movies and daydream, but "Revenge of the Nerds" ain't reality. It's just Hollywood bullshit.

E: V.O.
C: REAL HARVEY

S: INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - PRESENT - DAY
N: HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE A few items indicating film production are in the frame. At a table in the foreground, BOB THE DIRECTOR discusses the character of Joyce with the ACTRESS playing her. The actress just nods as the director goes on. We can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in the distance.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Okay, I think the thing with Joyce is that as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression. In that way they complete each other. I mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control. And she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc.
N: THE REAL JOYCE and REAL HARVEY listen curiously -- sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases. CLOSER SHOT OF REAL JOYCE AND HARVEY The REAL JOYCE puts in her two cents about the actress playing her. She rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life. She moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey, and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it was to live with him. The REAL HARVEY just rolls his eyes.

C: HARVEY
D: Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't getting rid of my 78's.

E: angry

D: I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my good stuff.

D: I don't care if you wanna hear it or not. You're the poster child for the DSM III. I'll have you know that I come from a very dysfunctional family. I can spot personality disorders a mile away...
N: A KNOCK ON THE DOOR interrupts their argument. Joyce storms away to answer it. ANGLE ON THE DOOR: Joyce opens it to face a smiling TOBY -- dressed as usual in a loud polyester fashion don't. He talks in his strange robotic voice and avoids all eye contact.

D: Alright settle down Harvey. Settle down. Now let's explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what it is you do here, exactly. You have comic books about you in your daily life in Cleveland.
E: the Audience laughs
C: HARVEY
D: That's right.
C: LETTERMAN
D: And are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual?
C: HARVEY
D: No. It's all true, David. All true.
E: patronizing
C: LETTERMAN
D: And you also have a regular job in Cleveland working at a hospital.
C: HARVEY
D: That's right. Aiding the sick, yes.

C: LETTERMAN
D: Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a very successful career here. This is being published by a major publishing company, Doubleday. Why do you maintain the day job?
C: HARVEY
D: To make a living! I don't make a living as a writer. I've been writing for many years, David. Maybe more years than you've been alive.

N: A LETTERMAN REGULAR (Tony Randall?) comes in with some food. He stops by the monitor to watch a moment with Joyce.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, I know that my youthful appearance belies, you know, my actual age. But, I've been around for a long time --
C: LETTERMAN REGULAR
D: You know this guy?
E: to JOYCE
C: JOYCE
D: I'm beginning to wonder.
N: The Letterman Regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor. He seems more intrigued than Joyce. LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE
C: LETTERMAN
D: But I have a feeling though, if you wanted to, you could probably get by on what you make selling your work. Because I know people are after you to write other things. You're publishing this anthology...
N: This hits a sore spot. Harvey goes from politely condescending to cantankerous in one second flat!
C: HARVEY
D: Who? What people? What people? What are you talking about? Where the hell do you get that stuff?
N: Letterman cracks up. The Audience laughs even harder.
C: HARVEY
D: I'm no show biz phoney. I'm telling the truth. Come on, man.

C: JOYCE
D: Damnit.
C: LETTERMAN REGULAR
D: Excuse me, but what are you doing?
C: JOYCE
D: I'm trying to get some news. You know there's a big story about to break about the US selling arms to Iran and the Contras.
C: LETTERMAN REGULAR
D: That's a monitor.

D: Ugh. Just forget it.
N: Joyce gives up. She sinks back into her seat and pulls a book from her bag. The Letterman Regular stares at her like she's from Mars. LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE ANGLE ON THE MONITOR

N: OFF TO THE SIDE: Two HOT BABES slave over TOBY as he gets his hair and make- up done. HARVEY wanders onto the set. He finally spots Toby in the corner. As he heads over to say hello, Harvey bumps into the MTV DIRECTOR -- a new wave fashion victim who looks like a lost member of A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS.

D: Fuckin' yuppie or whatever kinda freak you are.
E: muttering
C: REAL HARVEY
D: That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations. We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system. What can I say, it was the 80's man.

C: HARVEY
D: Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show.
C: JOYCE
D: Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters.

E: furious
N: People start to look over.

D: Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?!
N: Joyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer. She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt. He sighs, calming down. He looks around sheepishly.

E: O.S.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: I was startin' ta lose it. Between the lump, the loneliness -- I felt like everything wuz closin' in on me. And with Joyce over there savin' the world, I never felt more like a sell-out hack in my life.

D: I don't understand, does "tumor" mean the same thing as "cancer"?
N: The doctor gently nods. Joyce covers her mouth. Harvey holds onto his head. He looks positively dizzy. The doctor starts to talk, yet the words don't seem to match his mouth. He looks dubbed. Strange phrases just weave together, echo and bounce off the wall, making no sense at all. ...we know the growth is malignant. What we don't know is how far it may have spread. Once we have the results of the biopsy, we can make more informed decisions about treatment... blah, blah, blah... The whole office seems to spin.

D: What's going to happen to you, baby? Who's gonna take care of you if I'm not around?
N: Joyce stands up, determined.
C: JOYCE
D: Harvey, look at me and focus. We are going to get through this. I understand illness. I know how to handle these things.
C: HARVEY
D: But that's you. I'm not strong enough. I don't know how ta be positive. I can't do it. I can't.
C: JOYCE
D: Yes, you can. And I'll tell you how. You'll make a comic book out of the whole thing. You'll document every little detail. And that way you'll remove yourself from the experience until it's over.
N: Despite Joyce's passionate pitch, Harvey shakes his head.

C: HARVEY
D: When I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away.
N: Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Finally Harvey collapses. Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down on the floor and shakes him.
C: JOYCE
D: Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!
N: CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. The sound of Joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant echo. Then PANELS from Harvey's comics begin to float over his head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic book form. Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate, giving way to: GREEN SCREEN A SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic book panel. A healthy, fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner of the frame. He is very far away, barely recognizable. We slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera:
C: HARVEY
D: My name is Harvey Pekar. It's an unusual name -- Harvey Pekar...
N: As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again. This time in front of him, behind him, everywhere. We dolly in towards him.
C: HARVEY
D: 1960 was the year I got my first apartment and my first telephone book. Imagine my surprise when I looked up my name and saw that, in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed!
N: Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young adult years.
C: HARVEY
D: I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar... My middle name is Lawrence... He was listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle initial... Therefore, his was a purer listing.
N: We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.
C: HARVEY
D: Then, in the seventies, I noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book! This filled me with curiosity.
C: HARVEY
D: How could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?!
N: Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the V.A. Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his boss, Harvey and Toby, etc.
C: HARVEY
D: Then one day, a person I worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father. She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of his sons was named Harvey. These were the other Harvey Pekars.
N: The comic images fade out. Harvey is once again alone in the empty room.
C: HARVEY
D: Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr. died. Although I'd met neither man, I was filled with sadness. "What were they like," I thought. It seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way.
N: We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close. As close as the camera can get.
C: HARVEY
D: But the story does not end there. For two years later another Harvey Pekar appeared in the directory. What kind of people are these? Where do they come from, what do they do? What's in a name?
N: END DREAM SEQUENCE
S: INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY
N: BACK TO BEDROOM: We are close on HARVEY'S face as he lays passed out and delirious on the floor. Over this WE HEAR...
C: HARVEY
D: Who is Harvey Pekar?
N: His face slowly fades to black. A MOMENT OF BLACK, AND THEN...
S: INT. TOWER BOOKS - 1980'S - DAY
T: FADE IN:
N: CLOSE UP: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR, NOVEL-SIZED COMIC COVER. Scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, "Our Cancer Year." The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help him up. A hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf. JOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about with copies.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Here's our man a year later. Somehow I made it through the treatments, an' the doctors are optimistic. I guess Joyce was right about doin' the big comic book. We published the thing as a graphic novel -- our first collaboration -- and ended up with rave reviews. We even won the American Book Award. Go figure...
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY
N: The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe than it had before. This might be due to the presence of DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry out of beads. JOYCE guides her. HARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as Joyce and Danielle play. ANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them.
C: HARVEY
D: Hey Joyce.
N: Joyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide something.
C: JOYCE
D: What is it Harvey?
C: HARVEY
D: That was the doctor.
N: Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's every word.
C: HARVEY
D: He said I'm all clear.
N: Tears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CLEVELAND ICE RINK - 1980 - DAY
N: HARVEY sits in the bleachers, watching JOYCE teach DANIELLE to ice skate. Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his shirt.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle. With her real mother runnin' around who knows where, an' seein' how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd have a better life with us. I was scared at first but then I thought, what the hell. She's a good kid. So we ended up takin' her an' raising her as our own.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY
N: HARVEY and DANIELLE lie on the futon together. Harvey's comics are strewn around the room everywhere. Danielle flips through one.
C: HARVEY
D: Ya keep readin' 'em backward.
C: DANIELLE
D: I like reading them backward. Is that you?
E: holding up a comic
C: HARVEY
D: I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man.
C: DANIELLE
D: You look like a monster.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're gonna look like.
C: DANIELLE
D: Me??
C: HARVEY
D: Sure. Yer part of the story too, now.
C: DANIELLE
D: What story?
C: HARVEY
D: The story of my life.
N: Danielle makes a face.
C: HARVEY
D: Yeah, I know I'm not as interesting as The Little Mermaid and all that magical crap...
C: DANIELLE
D: Maybe I want to write my own comic.
C: HARVEY
D: Oh yeah? What about?
C: DANIELLE
D: I don't know yet. But not about you. You have enough already.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY
N: HARVEY walks towards the bus stop to send DANIELLE to school. He holds her hand.
C: HARVEY
D: Ya know, you should write about things in your own life. Like school and... ponies... I don't know, girl stuff...
C: DANIELLE
D: Do you have to hold my hand?
E: to Harvey
C: HARVEY
D: What, are you embarrassed a' me? I know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father.
E: wounded
N: Danielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy.
C: DANIELLE
D: No Harvey. You're just squeezing it too hard. Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive.
E: shaking her head
N: Danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other kids. Harvey waves and watches as it pulls away. He turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street -- -- a familiar image from the opening. He's still hunched over. He's still Harvey.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a lot. But don't think this is some sunny, happy ending. Every day is still a major struggle. Joyce an' I fight like crazy, an' she barely works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a real handful. My expenses have gone up so much that I'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills. My life is total chaos.
E: V.O.

N: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM NOW THE REAL HARVEY walks down the same busy Cleveland street towards his job.
C: REAL HARVEY
D: With a little luck, I'll get a window of good health between retirin' an dyin'. The golden years, right? Who knows. Between my pension and the chunk of change I got for this movie, I should be able to swing somethin'. Sure I'll lose the war eventually, but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way. Right?
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - PRESENT - DAY
N: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM THE REAL HARVEY slumps at the desk now, flipping through a comic book. ANGLE ON DOOR THE REAL TOBY comes into the file room, carrying a cake with sparklers. He's followed by a group of Harvey's REAL COWORKERS and JOYCE and REAL DANIELLE. Harvey moves the comic off his desk so Toby can put the cake down. ANGLE ON CAKE The festive cake reads "HAPPY RETIREMENT HARVEY." REAL JOYCE cuts the cake and passes slices to the group. ANOTHER WORKER pops a bottle of champagne. CLOSE on a glass of champagne getting filled. The glass sits next to the comic Harvey was reading. CLOSE UP ON COMIC BOOK COVER HARVEY'S new edition of AMERICAN SPLENDOR is subtitled, "OUR MOVIE YEAR." It features an illustration of HARVEY, JOYCE and DANIELLE surrounded by cameras, lights and crew.
