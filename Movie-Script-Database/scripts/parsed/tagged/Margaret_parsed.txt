S: EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY.
N: From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the curb. She steps off the curb toward us -- A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to and fro through the frame. CREDITS BEGIN OVER:
S: EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY.
N: The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the mid-day work crowd crosses the street.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY.
N: MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all kinds, going all different ways, all over the city. CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags, walking among the crowds.
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY.
N: An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School, one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids. The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.
C: MR AARON
D: Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly.
C: MR AARON
D: Bernstein... Cohen... At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk. LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face as she reaches out her hand --
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER.
N: AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures for Lisa to take a seat.
C: MR AARON
D: Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute.
N: LISA (SITTING) Sure.
C: MR AARON
D: Now...I know you had a little help...
C: LISA
D: Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
C: MR AARON
D: I'm just saying I know you had a little help.
C: LISA
D: A lot of people did.
C: MR AARON
D: Be that as it may --
C: LISA
D: I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life...
C: MR AARON
D: Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in?
C: LISA
D: Um, no, not really.
N: Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.
C: LISA
D: Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me.
E: CONT'D
C: MR AARON
D: Oh no?
C: LISA
D: No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
C: MR AARON
D: Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK?
C: LISA
D: You are so fair.
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY.
N: TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past her fellow students. She walks through a door --
S: EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS.
N: -- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.
C: BECKY
D: What did he say to you?
C: LISA
D: Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.
C: LISA
D: He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRSTEN
D: OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.
C: KURT
D: What'd he do, call on you?
C: KIRSTEN
D: Fuck you., Kurt.
C: LESLIE
D: Kirsten is really upset.
C: KURT
D: I'm sorry.
N: KIRSTEN (TO LESLIE) Let me have one of those, will you? Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.
C: BECKY
D: Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.
C: KIRSTEN
D: I don't. -I'm just really angry. Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them.
E: to Leslie
C: LESLIE
D: Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps.
C: MONICA
D: .I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.
S: INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY.
N: The class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."
C: KLEIN
D: .So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care!
C: LEWIS
D: And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say.
E: low, rumbling
C: KLEIN
D: All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.
C: BECKY
D: Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students.
C: KLEIN
D: I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President?
C: LIONEL
D: Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
N: - LEWIS Lisa?
C: LISA
D: Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.
C: ANTHONY
D: Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class.
S: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY.
N: School is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her.
C: DARREN
D: Hey, how'd you do?
C: LISA
D: Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so much.
C: DARREN
D: So he didn't give you a hard time or anything?
C: LISA
D: Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything...He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
C: DARREN
D: Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.
C: LISA
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: DARREN
D: Nothing. The man is very lovable. They stop at the corner.
N: - DARREN (CONT'D) What are you doing now?
C: LISA
D: I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
C: DARREN
D: Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
C: LISA
D: Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things.
C: DARREN
D: That is a definite possibility.
C: LISA
D: Anyway... Thanks again...
C: DARREN
D: Before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...?
C: LISA
D: Yes, Darren?
C: DARREN
D: .what are you up to later? Like tonight.
C: LISA
D: I don't know.
C: DARREN
D: You wanna go to a movie?
C: LISA
D: What do you mean, like on a date?
C: DARREN
D: No, not on a date, just go to amovie. I don't know if it's a fucking date!
C: LISA
D: All right. Calm down. What do you wanna see?
C: DARREN
D: I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit.
N: They're all bullshit!
C: LISA
D: OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm sorry!
C: DARREN
D: What if it was a date, anyway? Would that
N: be so horrendous?
C: LISA
D: Oh my God. Are you like -- are you asking me out? Are you? Hello...? Earth to Darren.
E: Pause Pause
C: DARREN
D: I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like we're already really close...
C: LISA
D: Oh my God...
C: DARREN
D: .and I think we'd be a really good match - - What?
C: LISA
D: Nothing. This is -- Nothing.
C: DARREN
D: So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.
N: Yes I am.
C: LISA
D: Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship.
C: DARREN
D: I view this as a way of strengthening our friendship.
C: LISA
D: It would definitely change it...
C: DARREN
D: I know: It's a fairly dangerous move.
C: LISA
D: Well...I would definitely have to think about this...
C: DARREN
D: Absolutely. Give it some thought.
C: LISA
D: OK, I will. Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.
C: LISA
D: Why do you look like that?
E: CONT'D
C: DARREN
D: Like what?
C: LISA
D: What do you want from me?
C: DARREN
D: Not a thing!
C: LISA
D: All right. I'll see you later.
C: DARREN
D: All right. She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.
S: EXT. LISA'S STREET -- WEST '80S. DAY.
N: Lisa walks down her street and lets herself into the prewar apartment building.
S: INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY.
N: She lets herself into the narrow apartment. A long hall covered with framed pictures, photographs and play posters opens onto a cramped living room crammed with books, plays, and magazines. A stereo, TV and computer are stuck in the corners. Beyond this is the kitchen and another hallway leading to the bathrooms and bedrooms.

C: LISA
D: Yeah, that's because I know what it means.
C: CURTIS
D: So do I.
C: LISA
D: Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for it.
C: CURTIS
D: What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
C: LISA
D: It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. Pause.
C: CURTIS
D: No it's not.
C: LISA
D: Yes it is.
C: CURTIS
D: Gross.
N: LISA (RESUMES EATING) It is gross. She eats. He watches her.

S: EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS.
N: The BUS DRIVER is wearing a cowboy hat. He is in his 30s and kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store. ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut -- LISA (TO DRIVER) Hey! The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it. IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who we can see out the door and window, falling behind. ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and Lisa catches up. IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back. ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus.
C: LISA
D: Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat? IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at her with good-natured flirtatiousness. ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW. THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the light. THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas. He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it. The LIGHT turns RED. Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as.-- LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT --

D: THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward. POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him. POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her. THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES. POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled tumbling underneath. LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around. MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble. Everything stops. TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking out from under the bus. Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak. She is making choking sounds. Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where to put her hands. Other people start converging. IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the door and rushes out. WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA, holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several other people are shouting and talking all at once.

C: KLEIN
D: Uhhhhhh...Monica!

N: MONICA (TO LISA) But I'm not even saying I disagree with you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic the way people in this class treated Angie just for saying something they don't agree with.

D: Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close -- like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore.
C: LISA
D: Becky. Give me a break. Pause.
C: BECKY
D: I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
C: LISA
D: Can we just go please?
N: BECKY (SARCASTIC) Fine. Would you like to smoke any more of my pot before we leave or have you had as much as you want now? LISA (SARCASTIC BACK) Oh, I'd like to have a little bit more please.
C: BECKY
D: Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house!
C: LISA
D: Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party.
S: INT. PARTY HOUSE -- BATHROOM. NIGHT.
N: The door opens and we catch a glimpse of a big party in a brownstone full of circulating kids. LISA and PAUL cram into the bathroom and shut the door again. A MOMENT LATER - She is sitting on the toilet. He is on the hamper unscrewing a small vial of coke-.
C: LISA
D: It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances.
C: PAUL
D: You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
C: LISA
D: I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.
C: PAUL
D: And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and closes the vial. _
C: PAUL
D: Symmetry.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: You are so funny...! So what do we do now?
E: Pause
C: PAUL
D: Now we make out.
C: LISA
D: Paul...! What about your girlfriend?
C: PAUL
D: I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.
C: LISA
D: Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away.
C: PAUL
D: You're not serious.
C: LISA
D: Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him.
S: INT. PARTY HOUSE -- STAIRWELL. NIGHT.
N: Lisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace. She sees Darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of a dark hallway. She walks over' to him and crouches down.
C: LISA
D: Hey... You know I really love you, right?
C: DARREN
D: Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.
C: LISA
D: I guess I'm not very consistent.
C: DARREN
D: I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.
N: - LISA I gotta go home. DARREN OK...
S: INT. RAMON'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.
N: Joan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps.
C: RAMON
D: Joan? Are you all right?
E: O.C.
C: JOAN
D: Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.
N: OMIT
S: INT. GEOMETRY CLASS. DAY.
N: The. last students file out except Lisa. Mr. Aaron is erasing the blackboard.
C: MR AARON
D: Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?
C: LISA
D: Are you still mad at me about the test?
C: MR AARON
D: What's going on, Lisa?
S: INT. GEOMETRY CLASS - A FEW MINUTES LATER. DAY.
N: Lisa and Mr Aaron sit at his desk.
C: LISA
D: .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place.
C: MR AARON
D: What does your being rich have to do with anything?
C: LISA
D: You know what I mean.
N: - MR AARON No, I don't.
C: LISA
D: Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver.
C: MR AARON
D: OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed.
C: LISA
D: Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door.
C: MR AARON
D: Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.
C: LIONEL
D: I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe.
C: MR AARON
D: You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door.
C: MR AARON
D: All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school...
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little.
N: 64A TIME PERMITTING. 64A
S: EXT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY.
N: Through a window we see Mr Aaron and Lisa talking (MOS).
S: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Lisa is watching TV. Joan comes in dressed for the opera.
C: JOAN
D: Does this-make me look fat?
C: LISA
D: Um, a little.
C: JOAN
D: Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
C: LISA
D: Where are you going?
C: JOAN
D: The opera...!
C: LISA
D: Why are you going to the opera?
C: JOAN
D: It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime.
C: LISA
D: Uh, no thanks.
C: JOAN
D: Why not? I bet you'd like it.
C: LISA
D: I don't like that kind of singing.
C: JOAN
D: But you like classical music.
C: LISA
D: Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing.
C: JOAN LISA
D: But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting.
C: JOAN
D: Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
C: LISA
D: OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it.
C: JOAN
D: What is the matter with you?
C: LISA
D: Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera!
C: JOAN
D: Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!"
C: LISA
D: I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
C: JOAN
D: OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.
E: Pause
C: LISA
D: Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think.
C: JOAN
D: Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
C: LISA
D: I guess you would. Withdrawn.
C: JOAN
D: Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you?
C: LISA
D: Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!
C: JOAN
D: Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll respond the way you've been responding to me this whole conversation.
C: LISA
D: No...!
C: JOAN
D: Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me -- Why not?
C: LISA
D: Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point!
N: JOAN (LIKE LISA) "OK, uh, whatever."
C: LISA
D: Was that supposed to be an imitation of me?
N: JOAN ("") "Um, OK: Withdrawn."
C: LISA
D: Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.
C: JOAN
D: Are you coming to my opening night?
C: LISA
D: I will if I have to. Pause.
C: JOAN
D: You're a little cunt, do you know that?
C: LISA
D: Yes. You're a big cunt.
C: JOAN
D: OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way.
C: LISA
D: You just called me a cunt, Mom!
C: JOAN
D: OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!
N: SAYING --
C: JOAN
D: -- If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me -- and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say --!
C: LISA
D: Not really.
C: JOAN
D: if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father --
C: LISA
D: Oh my God!
C: JOAN
D: -- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane!
C: LISA
D: Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.
C: JOAN
D: Now what am I supposed to do?!
N: LISA JUST --
C: JOAN
D: What am I supposed to do?!
C: LISA
D: Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week --
C: JOAN
D: I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years!
C: LISA
D: But I don't care about any of this! It doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't matter! Your play doesn't matter, except to you! I don't care about New Mexico, because to tell you the truth I'm probably not even going --
E: CONT'D
C: JOAN
D: What do you mean?
C: LISA
D: -- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in
N: the world than our relationship! There's a whole city out there full of people who are dying! So who cares if I like your fucking boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you bothering me about all this? It doesn't matter!!! Pause. The intercom buzzer buzzes. Joan hesitates.
C: JOAN
D: Well -- should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs...?
C: LISA
D: Do whatever you want. I don't care!
C: JOAN
D: I don't even know what we're talking about.
C: LISA
D: I know you don't. That's the problem.
C: JOAN
D: Oh give me a break.
S: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT.
N: Ramon and Joan walk toward the Metropolitan Opera House.
C: RAMON
D: Everything is all right?
C: JOAN
D: Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times!
C: RAMON
D: Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go.
N: - JOAN (A JOKE:) What if we just went to see something else instead?
C: RAMON
D: You don't want to hear Norma?
C: JOAN
D: No -- I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead.
C: RAMON
D: I think you will enjoy this.
S: INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT.
N: Joan and Ramon sit in the audience listening to Norma. Joan leans in toward Ramon and whispers:

C: PAUL
D: Yeah, how's it going?
C: LISA
D: OK. What have you been up to?
E: Pause
C: PAUL
D: Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college...
C: LISA
D: Sounds good... So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity?
E: Pause
C: PAUL
D: Um...all right.
C: LISA
D: Really? God, I'm so flattered.
C: PAUL
D: To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?
C: LISA
D: Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.
C: PAUL
D: That's pretty much what I figured... So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...?
E: Pause
C: LISA
D: Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.
C: PAUL
D: All right. Do you want to give me your address?
E: Pause
C: LISA
D: It's 252 West 85th Street...
E: blushing almost to death
N: Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50
S: INT. DARREN'S ROOM/LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Darren lies on his bed, depressed. He dials the phone.
C: LISA
D: Hello?
E: on the phone
C: DARREN
D: Hey. What are you up to?
C: LISA
D: Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.
C: DARREN
D: Really? That's impressive.
C: LISA
D: Not really.
C: DARREN
D: I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before.
C: LISA
D: Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.
C: DARREN
D: You're not gonna fail Humanities.
C: LISA
D: No, probably not.
C: DARREN
D: So what did you do tonight?
C: LISA
D: Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause.
N: DARREN OK. LISA OK?
C: DARREN
D: Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
N: LISA OK.

S: INT. HALL. NIGHT.
N: Lisa, dressed up a little and wearing some makeup, opens the door for Paul. He's not dressed up at all. He's smoking.
C: PAUL
D: Hey.
C: LISA
D: Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
C: PAUL
D: I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
C: LISA
D: Oh really? What did they say?
C: PAUL
D: She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator.
C: LISA
D: That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room...
C: LISA
D: So this is the living room.
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Very livable.
C: LISA
D: We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way.
C: PAUL
D: Have you?
C: LISA
D: Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.
C: PAUL
D: This book is a very cool book.
C: LISA
D: Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now.
C: PAUL
D: It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. -
C: LISA
D: Do you want anything to drink?
C: PAUL
D: I'd take a beer.
S: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
N: Lisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers.
C: LISA
D: OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. -
C: PAUL
D: Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this.
C: LISA
D: Thanks.
C: PAUL
D: Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
C: LISA
D: Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.
C: PAUL
D: Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"
C: LISA
D: How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny.
C: PAUL
D: It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer.
C: LISA
D: So...do you want to see my room?
C: PAUL
D: Sure.
S: INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT.
N: They come into her room. She closes the door.
C: LISA
D: This is my room. Ta da.
C: PAUL
D: Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.
C: LISA
D: And these are my stuffed animals.
C: PAUL
D: Always important to meet the stuffed animals.
C: LISA
D: These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right?
C: PAUL
D: I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
C: LISA
D: Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it... He looks at her pictures.
C: LISA
D: So...can I ask you a question?
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: Yes?
C: LISA
D: This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you? OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
E: Pause
N: OK.
C: PAUL
D: Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's basically like, the world's greatest
N: activity, but it's not actually worth getting nervous about.
C: LISA
D: Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me.
C: PAUL
D: There is that philosophy.
C: LISA
D: You are so funny...!
C: PAUL
D: Do you have an ashtray?
C: LISA
D: Oh you can just chuck it out the window. Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette. He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.
C: LISA
D: Are we starting?
E: CONT'D
C: PAUL
D: I was thinking about it, yeah.
C: LISA
D: And am I being really dorky right now?
C: PAUL
D: You're not suave.
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore.
C: PAUL
D: Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna be a great experience for you. You're gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms at least. He kisses her. They make out.
C: PAUL
D: OK, let's talk about your kissing. Don't panic. It's just a technical thing. Lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: What are you like the nicest guy in the world?
C: PAUL
D: No...
S: INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. LATER.
N: It's dark. Their clothes are off, but we don't see much. She is giving him a handjob.
C: LISA
D: Like that?
C: PAUL
D: Yes...
E: Not quite but close enough
C: LISA
D: in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, but we're gonna move on before
C: THAT-HERE:
D: He shifts around and tries to go down on her.
C: LISA
D: You don't have to do that.
N: PAUL I know. I want to. Pause. She slides up away from him.
C: LISA
D: Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you.
C: PAUL
D: All right.
S: INT. LISA'S ROOM. LATER.
N: He is positioning himself on top of her.
C: PAUL
D: Are you ready?
C: LISA
D: Yeah.
C: PAUL
D: OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better...Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
C: LISA
D: OK: You sound insane. They laugh.
C: PAUL
D: OK, ready?
N: LISA (SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) Yeah. PAUL OK? LISA (IN PAIN) Mm hm.
C: PAUL
D: OK, hang on...
C: LISA
D: Ow!
C: PAUL
D: OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?
C: LISA
D: Kind of, yeah.
C: PAUL
D: OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in a second...
C: LISA
D: Did you bring a condom?
C: PAUL
D: Uh huh...
C: LISA
D: Shouldn't you put it on?
C: PAUL
D: I will in a second.
C: LISA
D: This is really kind of hurting.
C: PAUL
D: OK -- one second.
C: LISA
D: I love you.
C: PAUL
D: What?
C: LISA
D: Nothing.
C: PAUL
D: OK -- hold on -- Shit --
C: LISA
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry -- He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.
C: PAUL
D: Sorry about that. Kind of got away from me.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Did any of it get inside me?
C: PAUL
D: I don't know.
N: LISA (FEELING AROUND) Yeah. It definitely did.
C: PAUL
D: Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings.
C: LISA
D: That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.
C: LISA
D: Hi, Curtis.
E: CONT'D
C: CURTIS
D: Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.
C: PAUL
D: Hey.
C: LISA
D: Hey. Can I have a drag? Thanks.
E: sits down takes a drag of his cigarette
N: (MORE)
C: LISA
D: I'm actually kind of mad at you...
E: CONT'D gives it back to him
C: PAUL
D: Why? Why? Because we didn't use birth control?
E: Pause Pause
C: LISA
D: I guess so.
C: PAUL
D: It was at the ready...
C: LISA
D: Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day.
N: PAUL Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After The Guy Came Too Fast Pill?"
C: LISA
D: Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?
C: PAUL
D: Well...that's the Canadian name.
C: LISA
D: Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...!
C: PAUL
D: Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --
C: LISA
D: How do you know? Have you been tested?
C: PAUL
D: No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one.
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions. Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me.
E: Pause
C: PAUL
D: You're welcome.
C: LISA
D: Did it freak you out that I said I love you?
C: PAUL
D: No...It didn't freak me out.
C: LISA
D: You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me.
C: PAUL
D: I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you.
C: LISA
D: You should probably go now...
S: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Lisa walks Paul past Curtis who is practicing the piano.
C: PAUL
D: Yo.
C: LISA
D: That's my brother.
C: PAUL
D: What's up?
C: CURTIS
D: Hi. Lisa walks Paul to the front door.
S: INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT.
N: She changes into her pajamas.
C: LISA'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.
D: She washes her face and brushes her teeth.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
N: She comes out and settles down next to Curtis to watch TV.
S: INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT.
N: The audience applauds the opera cast thunderously. Near Joan and Ramon a male opera enthusiast is standing. OPERA FAN BRAVIL BRAVIL
S: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT.
N: Joan and Ramon walk arm in arm away from Lincoln Center.
C: JOAN
D: Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!
N: RAMON ' Good! We should go again!
C: JOAN
D: But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!"
C: RAMON
D: How do you mean?
C: JOAN
D: It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?"
C: RAMON
D: Well, it's the plural.
C: JOAN
D: I know --
C: RAMON
D: It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble.
C: JOAN
D: No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people?
C: RAMON
D: Pretentious?
C: JOAN
D: I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all?
C: RAMON
D: Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
C: JOAN
D: Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.
C: RAMON
D: You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer.
C: JOAN
D: Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
C: RAMON
D: We'll have to go again.

S: INT. SCHOOL THEATER -- LIGHTING BOOTH. DAY.
N: Lisa is on a headset. Below, on the stage MATTHEW is singing to a girl. MATTHEW (SINGS) "My time of day is the dark time..."
C: LISA
D: Cue thirty-six, go.
N: GARY THE THEATER TEACHER (O.C.) OK, hold up a second. LISA (INTO HEADSET) OK, we're gonna do that one more time please. Let's back it up please...
C: MATTHEW
D: Why are we stopping?
S: INT. SCHOOL THEATER. NIGHT.
N: All the kids in the show are sitting more or less in a circle. GARY the theater teacher, 30s, has the floor.
C: GARY
D: Now I know there's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room..But I wanna tell you something: You've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit I know has been going on around here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one person working on this show who hasn't got somebody they want to say something to, including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?
N: MATTHEW (SLOWLY) By "Matthew," I assume you mean me?
C: GARY
D: Yes. I mean you. Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.
C: MATTHEW
D: Yes?
C: GARY
D: You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
C: MATTHEW
D: So you'd like me to memorize them. Everyone laughs.
C: GARY
D: Yes, I'd like you to memorize them! Now. Your turn!
E: Brightly
C: MATTHEW
D: But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want everyone to think I'm a great guy. Everyone laughs.
S: 83A INT. SCHOOL THEATER. NIGHT. LATER. 83A
N: BECKY and LISA are in the circle,'both crying.
C: LISA
D: But I'm jealous of you...
C: BECKY
D: Why would you be jealous of me...!
C: LISA
D: Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends!
C: BECKY
D: Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!
N: 83A CONTINUED: 83A
C: LISA
D: Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.
C: LISA
D: Darren...? Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in the circle with her.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: I know that I'm not who you want me to be to you. And I know how much I've hurt you. But I still can't believe it means we can't be friends anymore! So much has been happening to me this semester --
E: CONT'D
N: DARREN (WITH UNDERSTANDING) I know. I know. LISA (IN TEARS) -- and it's like I can't even talk to you about it because I hurt you so bad!
C: DARREN
D: Yes you can. Of course you can. You can talk to me about anything.
C: LISA
D: I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend!
C: DARREN
D: I love you too. I really do...! They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.
C: GARY
D: Leslie?
C: LESLIE
D: Can I just say, I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing, and if we could all just work together, instead of being AT each other all the time, I think we could all just be incredible. Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.
N: Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 64 83A CONTINUED: (2) 83A
C: ANGIE
D: Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna say it. I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them. And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over. And I don't know if I can get over it. I don't. That's all. Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.
E: Long pause
C: GARY
D: Yes, Paul?
C: PAUL
D: Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you know? This is hicrh school. You know? I don't really feel a strong need to like, all be on the same team with everybody. I just want to come to rehearsals, do the show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot, and then like, go on home. I don't really wanna cry and hug anybody. There are laughs and some cheers.
C: GARY
D: Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you Paul?
C: PAUL
D: OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug. No kissin' though. Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps. Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone is laughing. Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.
S: INT. COHEN KITCHEN. DAY.
N: Lisa is at the breakfast table, looking through a stack of back issues of The New York Times. She finds the item she WANTS: UPPER WEST-SIDE WOMAN KILLED IN BUS ACCIDENT.

C: LISA
D: Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago...
C: MITCHELL
D: Yeah, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?
C: LISA
D: Well, this is probably gonna sound a little weird, but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman's family? I'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral, but I really wanted to send some flowers or something.
C: MITCHELL
D: Yeah, I can --
C: LISA
D: Or is that like classified information?
C: MITCHELL
D: No no. Family's been notified...Lemme see what I got.
C: LISA
D: She mentioned she had a daughter...
C: MITCHELL
D: Lemme just... OK: I don't have anything for a daughter. The only contact I have is a cousin, Abigail Berwitz. I got a number in Arizona...
C: LISA
D: So did you have the trial, or whatever? Or did you make the -- did they have a ruling yet?
C: MITCHELL
D: Yes. It was, uh, No Criminality found.
N: OK?
C: LISA
D: No Criminality.

D: This is Abigail.
C: LISA
D: Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I...
C: ABIGAIL
D: Yes? Hello?
C: LISA
D: Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson?
N: ABIGAIL OK...?
C: LISA
D: I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died...
N: ABIGAIL OK...?
C: LISA
D: Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time...
C: ABIGAIL
D: Yes? What can I do for you?
C: LISA
D: OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because --
N: ABIGAIL
C: )
D: No. As far as I know they're doing something or other next week. But --
E: ON "ASSUME"
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter?
C: ABIGAIL LISA
D: No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago.
C: LISA
D: Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was
N: IT --
C: ABIGAIL
D: She had leukemia.
C: LISA
D: Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa?
C: ABIGAIL
D: Yes...?
C: LISA
D: OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought --
C: ABIGAIL
D: Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number?
C: LISA
D: Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to --
N: ABIGAIL (ON "IF") Well they really shouldn't be giving out my number. (blurts out) This is harassment! LISA (SHOCKED) I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass YOU --
C: ABIGAIL
D: I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me.
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to
N: CONTACT --
C: ABIGAIL
D: Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop.
C: LISA
D: Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
C: ABIGAIL
D: Yes, all right.
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT/COHEN APARTMENT. DAY.
N: EMILY MORRISON, 40s, is on the phone in her Upper West Side apartment. She's on the phone with Lisa.
C: EMILY
D: I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine...
C: LISA
D: Oh so was she a lawyer?
C: EMILY
D: Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers.
C: LISA
D: Were you really good friends with her?
C: EMILY
D: Yes I was.
S: INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY.
N: Joan is reading audition sides. Lisa passes through, dressed somberly.
C: JOAN
D: Where you going, sweetie?
C: LISA
D: I'm going to that woman's funeral.
C: JOAN
D: Are you sure you don't want me to come?
C: LISA
D: Why? I don't even know her.
C: JOAN
D: I would be coming for you.
S: INT. EMILY'S CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT. DAY.
N: EMILY opens the door for LISA. In the b.g. about thirty people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients.
C: EMILY
D: Hi. Are you Lisa?
C: LISA
D: Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come.
C: EMILY
D: Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
C: LISA
D: Oh -- Um -- no thanks.
C: EMILY
D: We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres.
C: LISA
D: Oh - that's quite all right, thank you.
S: INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.
N: Everyone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs.
C: EMILY
D: Well-thank you all for coming.
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: Thank you for doing this, Emily.
C: THE MOURNERS
D: Yes, thank you, Emily.
C: EMILY
D: As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly.
E: She stops. Gets a hold of herself
C: EMILY
D: I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can you stand it?" And she said. "First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't." So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs.
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: As most of you know, she had more than her share of trouble over the years. But that never diminished her compassion or stopped her from embracing life to the absolute fullest -- measure.
E: CONT'D
C: 2ND MOURNER
D: She sure did.
C: EMILY
D: So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one. Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence.
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: It's OK, Emily.
C: EMILY
D: I know...! And I was nineteen! Even though it's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young. Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at her from across the room.
E: She waits
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT. LATER. DAY.
N: Everyone is milling around. Lisa is talking to Emily.
C: LISA
D: Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here.
C: EMILY
D: Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
C: LISA
D: Didn't she have any family?
C: EMILY
D: No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number...
C: LISA
D: Yeah...
C: EMILY
D: Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.
C: EMILY
D: Listen. I still can't believe this is happening...! I mean what the fuck is wrong with her?
E: she starts crying
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: I don't know!
C: EMILY
D: I don't understand why she didn't kill herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always. OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming. Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?
E: noticing LISA
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.
E: startled, embarrassed
C: EMILY
D: It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet.
C: LISA
D: Goodbye.
E: to Woman Mourner
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: Goodbye. As Lisa-goes out she hears:
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: Who is that?
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I wouldn't have done that at her age, would you?
C: WOMAN MOURNER
D: No...
N: TIME PERMITTING. TIME PERMITTING. TIME PERMITTING.
S: EXT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Lisa is on the phone.- The Times article about the accident is on her bed. O.C. we hear Curtis practicing his scales.
C: LISA
D: No -- M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you.
N: She writes down the number and hangs up. Looks at the number. Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up.
S: INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY.
N: Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion. John is walking back and forth, reading aloud from King Lear. JOHN (READING) "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." (Pause) We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa?
C: LISA
D: I don't know.
C: JOHN
D: Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here?
C: LISA
D: I don't know. Sorry.
C: JOHN
D: You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it.
C: LISA
D: I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me.
C: JOHN
D: Matthew?
E: Pause. Then:
C: MATTHEW
D: I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.
N: (MORE) Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 74
C: MATTHEW
D: Like as far as the gods are concerned we're just ants. Nothing. Darren? The class laughs.
E: CONT'D like a newscaster turning to his colleague
C: DARREN
D: Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view.
E: responding in kind
C: JOHN
D: OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David?
C: DAVID
D: Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to
N: BOYS
C: JOHN
D: OK...I don't think that's what he's getting at...I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
C: DAVID
D: But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint.
C: JOHN
D: Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous.
C: DAVID
D: Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is.
N: 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 75
C: JOHN
D: OK, but -- I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um...
C: DAVID
D: No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport?
N: JOHN (LOST) I don't know ...Um -- Monica?
C: MONICA
D: I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun --
C: MATTHEW
D: Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody?
C: MONICA
D: Yeah...1
C: DAVID
D: But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything?
C: JOHN
D: David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here --
C: DAVID
D: Scholarly opinion...:
C: JOHN
D: And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black -- pretty bleak --
C: DAVID
D: But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?
N: 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76
C: JOHN
D: No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on --
C: DAVID
D: I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped.
C: JOHN
D: No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively.

C: LISA
D: No...Don't worry.
C: KARL
D: OK good. That was a good answer,.
C: LISA
D: Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship...
C: KARL
D: OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK?
C: LISA
D: Well, I think he already knows I like him.
C: KARL
D: Uh huh? OK...
C: LISA
D: .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little --
C: KARL
D: That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough.
C: LISA
D: Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him.

D: OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be.
C: LISA
D: You mean to protect myself before I go back?
C: KARL
D: There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house.

N: LISA OK. KARL (TO ANNETTE) Yes.
C: ANNETTE
D: Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time
C: KARL
D: Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something.
C: ANNETTE
D: Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do?
C: KARL
D: OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now.
C: ANNETTE
D: -- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu.

C: LISA
D: I just...Well, I just want you to know...
C: MARETTI
D: Yes? What? Speak!
C: LISA
D: Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident...
C: MARETTI
D: Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident.
C: LISA
D: Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose.

N: Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 85A
C: LISA
D: I am --
C: MARETTI
D: Don't drag me outta my house on a Saturday afternoon and then make me stand here pullin' teeth to find out what you're talkin' about.
N: (MORE) Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 86
C: MARETTI
D: I've got my kids inside: You're an attractive young lady, you show up at the house -- Please! Get to the point or go home. Because I don't care enough, frankly, to stand around here tryin' to figure out what you're doin' here! What! What! What! What!
E: CONT'D Pause
C: LISA
D: All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat --
C: MARETTI
D: Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What.
C: LISA
D: If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it --
C: MARETTI
D: No Criminality, that's right.
C: LISA
D: -- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman.
C: MARETTI
D: OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here.
C: LISA
D: Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened.
C: MARETTI
D: OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...?
C: LISA
D: No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your --
N: Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 86A
C: MARETTI
D: Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, "Step away from the bus," if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be.
N: Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87
C: LISA
D: You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again.
C: MARETTI
D: No. Not really. No.
C: LISA
D: Well ...I think we both remember something different.
C: MRS MARETTI
D: Your brother's on the phone.
C: MARETTI
D: Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside.
C: LISA
D: I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
C: MARETTI
D: I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it.
C: LISA
D: So you're just gonna leave it?
C: MARETTI
D: I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back.
C: LISA
D: I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened.
C: MARETTI
D: But you already talked to them!
N: Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 88
C: LISA
D: I know that. But I lied.
C: MARETTI
D: You lied.
C: LISA
D: Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.--
C: MARETTI
D: Then how come nobody else saw it?
C: LISA
D: I can't help what other people saw --
C: MARETTI
D: You would think somebody else would see it.
C: LISA
D: I just know what I saw!
C: MARETTI
D: Then why didn't you say something right then?
C: LISA
D: Because -- when they were asking me what happened -- it seemed like you were kind of looking at me -- like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
C: MARETTI
D: Oh, now I really don't know what you're talkin' about.
C: LISA
D: I can't prove that you were doing that -- Mrs Maretti comes back outside.
C: MARETTI
D: What did I say anything to you? Did I threaten you?
C: LISA
D: No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without --
N: MARETTI (AFTER "HAPPENED") But you told 'em what you saw! You told 'em what you saw! And so did I! Only I'm the one behind the wheel! Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 89
C: MRS MARETTI
D: Gerry! Take it easy!
C: MARETTI
D: No, it's all right. Leave it alone. You wanna ruin my life, start tellin' 'em about looks, and you waved at me and I had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're gonna go back to school and do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you gonna do it? And for what! She's dead! She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to bring her back!
E: To MRS MARETTI To LISA
C: LISA
D: I just want to say what really happened.
C: MARETTI
D: Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.
C: MRS MARETTI
D: Gerry -- !
C: MARETTI
D: But those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin' face because this was not my fault!
C: LISA
D: It was both our fault.
C: MARETTI
D: What'd you say?
C: LISA
D: It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.
C: MARETTI
D: Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a lawyer. Gimme your phone number.
C: MARETTI
D: What's your number? Gimme LISA your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it? come to my house like some anonymous person, I can't get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy! Lisa Cohen!

E: Pause
C: LISA
D: My mother hasn't really been that helpful.
C: EMILY
D: What do you mean?
C: LISA

D: What could she possibly have going on?

D: Her show is opening.
C: EMILY
D: What do you mean, her show? What show?
C: LISA
D: She's in a play.
C: EMILY
D: My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it, and your mother can't be bothered because she's in a play?
C: LISA
D: Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part.
C: EMILY
D: I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but, that is pretty shocking.
C: LISA
D: I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something.
C: EMILY
D: OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin - you talked to her -- And you're gonna go talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go with you?

C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: Could I help you?
C: LISA
D: Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: No he's not.
C: LISA
D: Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three...
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: Yeah, he's not back yet. Could I help you with something?
C: LISA
D: Um, well, do you know when do you expect him?
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: What's this about?
C: LISA
D: I was involved in an accident a few weeks
N: AGO --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: Uh huh?
C: LISA
D: And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: What do you mean amend the report? How do you want to amend it?
C: LISA
D: Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: So wait, I don't understand. You wanna change your statement?
C: LISA
D: Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement. Yes.
E: Pause. Calmer
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: Well, you'd usually have to talk to the investigating detective on the case...
C: LISA
D: Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So...
N: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE (ON "SO") You remember the case number?
C: LISA
D: No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway -- it was in a lot of the newspapers...
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: OK, yeah, sure OK. Sit down, sit down.
N: LISA (SITTING) Thank you. I ---
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: You know the case is closed.
C: LISA
D: I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: Because of your statement?
N: Another male detective walks by, behind LISA. The two men exchange a glance referring to Lisa being a cute girl.
C: LISA
D: Yes.
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: What do you mean it was closed because of your statement?
C: LISA
D: I mean --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: The DA's office closes the case. You don't close the case. The DA's office closes the case.
C: LISA
D: I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the --
C: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
D: What's your name, honey?
C: LISA
D: Lisa Cohen.
N: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE OK --

C: MITCHELL
D: This guy been givin' you a hard time?
C: LISA
D: No...
C: MITCHELL
D: What's this guy been sayin' to you?
C: LISA

C: MITCHELL
D: Sure I do. What's up?
S: INT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION - MITCHELL'S DESK - LATER
N: Lisa sits across from Mitchell.
C: MITCHELL
D: So now you're sayin' he ran the light.
C: LISA
D: Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his attention...
C: MITCHELL
D: No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene...the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
C: LISA
D: I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it.
C: MITCHELL
D: And what do you think I should do with you? Just gimmeâ¢a clue. 'cause I'm just a little bit lost over here...:
C: LISA
D: Do whatever you want. I know what I did.
C: MITCHELL
D: OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa, anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence.
C: LISA
D: Even if he kills someone?
N: MITCHELL (SIMULTANEOUS) Even if you cause an accidental death, that's right. For this to be a criminal offense, the law says you need two aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red light and he was --
C: LISA
D: So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder?
E: On 2nd "red"
C: MITCHELL
D: No. He could be charged with reckless driving, and fillip' out a false police report. Which, that's no joke --
C: LISA
D: That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose?
C: MITCHELL
D: Yes. Because that's the definition of murder. Killin' somebody on purpose. You're not sayin' he ran her over on purpose, are you? Pause.
C: LISA
D: No. Pause.
C: MITCHELL
D: All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,
N: OK?
C: LISA
D: You're kidding.
C: MITCHELL
D: No. I'll go over it with my sergeant, probably pull this guy in again. Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on him. See what he says.
N: LISA (VERY GRATEFUL) Thank you...! Thank you.
S: 120A INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM. DAY. 12 OA
N: Lisa and her coed class watch BONNIE, the young, tall beautiful, no-makeup gymnastics teacher.
C: BONNIE
D: OK, so we're just gonna start with a_couple of simple stretches.
N: She stretches. Lisa notices the boys looking at Bonnie.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK. DAY.
N: Lisa and Becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench.
C: LISA
D: .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint.
E: holding in smoke
C: BECKY
D: We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause.
C: LISA
D: Hi John.
C: BECKY
D: Hi John. Want some? They giggle.
E: Pause
C: JOHN
D: Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on!
C: LISA
D: Sorry.
C: BECKY
D: We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away.
N: LISA (STAGE WHISPER) OK: How about how he's like, "Smokin' a j." Like, "You can't be smokin' a j." They all burst out laughing. CU on the angry embarrassed back of John's reddening grown-up neck as he keeps walking away.
S: EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- WEST OF THE GREAT LAWN. DAY.
N: Lisa walks through the park, somewhat stoned, enjoying the sunshine. She sees MR AARON approaching on a bike. He bikes up to her and stops.
C: LISA
D: Hi, Mr Aaron...!
C: MR AARON
D: How are you, Lisa?
C: LISA
D: I'm pretty damn good. How are you?
C: MR AARON
D: I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that situation?
C: LISA
D: Oh...â¢I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime... Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
E: squinting at him in the sunshine
C: MR AARON
D: Um, a Trek.
C: LISA
D: I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?
C: MR AARON
D: As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no...
C: LISA
D: But you must have ridden a lot of horses.
C: MR AARON
D: What makes you say so?
C: LISA
D: Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that?
C: MR AARON
D: Someplace like what?
N: - LISA You know: Not New York.
C: MR AARON
D: I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details.
C: LISA
D: God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews?
C: MR AARON
D: Is that a real question, or a Lisa question?
C: LISA
D: What's a Lisa question?
C: MR AARON
D: A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...?
C: LISA
D: About half and half.
C: MR AARON
D: In that case --
C: LISA
D: Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second?
C: MR AARON
D: All right.
C: LISA
D: Thanks.
N: Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high for her.
C: MR AARON
D: You want me to adjust the seat?
C: LISA
D: No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly.
C: LISA
D: I like your bicycle...! Can I have it?
E: CONT'D
C: MR AARON
D: No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her.
C: MR AARON
D: OK. Off.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me.
C: MR AARON
D: Lisa...!
C: LISA
D: I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
C: MR AARON
D: I can't even be having this conversation with you.
C: LISA
D: Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here.
C: MR AARON
D: You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike.
C: LISA
D: It's not my fault if I revere you as a god!
N: He laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself.
C: LISA
D: Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy right now.
E: CONT'D
C: MR AARON
D: I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.
S: INT. COHEN APARTMENT - FRONT HALL. NIGHT.
N: Lisa walks in as Joan is putting on her coat.
C: JOAN
D: Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if you wanted dinner.
C: LISA
D: Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.
C: JOAN
D: Someone named Emily called. And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad. Is that the one you talked to?
C: LISA
D: Yeah, did he say anything?
C: JOAN
D: Just to call him back. What's going on? Did you ever go back and see him?
C: LISA
D: I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK.
C: JOAN
D: Of course it is. Who's Emily?
C: LISA
D: She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral...
C: JOAN
D: Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the phone.
C: LISA
D: OK. How's Ramon?
C: JOAN
D: Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like him. He's really nice.
N: (MORE) Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 106
C: JOAN
D: But I'm not sure he actually ever understands a word I say.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the guy.
C: JOAN
D: But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
C: LISA
D: You feel lonely when you're with him?
C: JOAN
D: Yeah. You never felt that way when you were with someone?
C: LISA
D: I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it.
C: JOAN
D: Well ...I don't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way.
C: LISA
D: So don't get serious. That's my advice. Pause.
C: JOAN
D: All right. I'm gonna go.
C: LISA
D: Have a good show.
C: JOAN
D: Thank you. Goodbye Curtis!
E: calling
T: INTERCUT -- LIVING ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS
N: Curtis, busy with his computer, doesn't answer. BACK IN THE FRONT HALL -- Joan shrugs it off.
C: JOAN
D: 'Bye sweetie.
S: INT. BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT.
N: She hits the elevator button. Sees her reflection in the little round elevator window. She looks old to herself, and haggard. She touches under her chin.
S: INT. ELEVATOR. CONTINUOUS.
N: Joan gets in. The door shuts. She leans her head against the wall and bursts into tears., The elevator stops with a DING. She wipes her eyes quickly. A woman NEIGHBOR comes in.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Hello...!
N: JOAN (SMILES) Hello.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Congratulations on the show...!
C: JOAN
D: Thank you.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: That was such a wonderful review...! And I read somewhere it might be going to Broadway?
C: JOAN
D: Supposedly. In March.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: God! Exciting...!
C: JOAN
D: Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.
S: INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT. DAY.
N: Lisa, Emily and DAVE, a good natured intelligent 35ish lawyer, are at a window table.
C: EMILY
D: Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends. He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't know what to do himself he'll certainly know someone we can talk to.
C: LISA
D: OK, great.
C: EMILY
D: So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told me, if you don't mind repeating
N: YOURSELF --
C: DAVE
D: Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
C: LISA
D: Are you guys gonna order something?
S: INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT. DAY. LATER.
N: They are drinking coffee. Lisa smokes.
C: DAVE
D: When someone is killed it's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory case, which just means there's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case.
C: LISA
D: As opposed to what?
C: DAVE
D: As opposed to common law, which is law made by judges. Which is why the damages are limited.
C: LISA
D: I don't understand.
C: EMILY
D: Look, just skip that part. We don't care about that.
C: LISA
D: I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy...!
C: DAVE
D: No -- the police are not, uh --
C: LISA EMILY
D: Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the were gonna look into it police are gonna -- again.
C: DAVE
D: I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why --
N: LISA (ON "THAT'S") So what can we do?
C: DAVE
D: Well. I'm --
C: LISA
D: Sorry.
N: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109
C: DAVE EMILY
D: That's OK -- That's OK, honey...
C: DAVE
D: I'm just getting to that. You can't do anything unless you're a relative --
C: EMILY
D: She didn't have any relatives, except for those idiots in Arizona --
N: DAVE (ON "EXCEPT") -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're
T: executor of her estate --
C: EMILY
D: I am the executor of her estate.
C: DAVE
D: -- which is Emily. I know.
C: EMILY
D: So good.
C: DAVE
D: Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore...
C: LISA
D: You can really sue for that?
C: DAVE
D: Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
C: LISA
D: So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver?
C: DAVE
D: Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company.
C: LISA
D: But do you think the driver would get fired?
N: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109A
C: DAVE
D: No. Not necessarily.
C: LISA
D: Even if all the facts came out at the trial?
C: DAVE
D: Maybe. I don't know.
C: EMILY
D: But how much could they be liable for?
C: DAVE EMILY
D: It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them?
C: DAVE
D: -- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that.
C: LISA
D: I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.
C: DAVE
D: And I gather in a lot .of pain?
C: LISA
D: Her leg was cut off.
C: DAVE
D: Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time?
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry, Emily. Yeah, awake.
E: To DAVE
C: EMILY
D: That's OK.
C: DAVE
D: Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ¢ three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case.
C: LISA
D: Why not?
C: DAVE
D: Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case.
N: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 111
C: EMILY
D: Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here.
C: DAVE
D: I understand that --
C: EMILY
D: We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy.
C: DAVE
D: I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer.
C: LISA
D: Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself.
C: DAVE
D: That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias.
C: EMILY
D: Impeached for what?
C: DAVE
D: She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win.
C: LISA
D: So that's'something, isn't it?
C: EMILY
D: But do you really think we know what that means?
C: DAVE
D: I'm sorry. That's what its called.
C: EMILY
D: But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating.
C: DAVE
D: I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud.
C: EMILY
D: OX. All right. I'm sorry...I

C: DAVE
D: Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity.
C: LISA
D: Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --
C: EMILY
D: Is to fucking get this guyl
C: LISA
D: No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus!
C: DAVE
D: Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages.
C: LISA
D: I think she had a pretty good idea.
C: DAVE
D: If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to...
C: EMILY
D: I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak:
C: DAVE
D: I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you.
C: EMILY
D: I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened.

N: Mitchell picks up the phone. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
C: MITCHELL
D: Detective Mitchell.
C: LISA
D: Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.
C: MITCHELL
D: Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?
C: LISA
D: Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver...
N: MITCHELL Yes, we did:.We brought him back in --
C: LISA
D: You did? What happened?
C: MITCHELL
D: Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point.
C: LISA
D: But how did you ask the questions?
C: MITCHELL
D: Excuse me?
C: LISA
D: He's obviously not gonna change his
N: statement if you just ask him like really politely: Why would he? We already know he's a liar.
C: MITCHELL
D: Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore --
C: LISA
D: Yeah, not to white people.
C: MITCHELL
D: Excuse me?
C: LISA
D: You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you --
C: MITCHELL
D: We don't do it to who?
C: LISA
D: Oh my God...
C: MITCHELL
D: First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city --
C: LISA
D: Yes, thank you, yes.
C: MITCHELL
D: -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case. Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --
E: Pause
C: LISA
D: Yes, I would.
S: INT. COHEN HALLWAY/KITCHEN. DUSK.
N: Joan, dressed to go to work, drops her keys in her purse as she comes down the hall and lingers in the kitchen doorway to find LISA on the phone, listening, then:
C: LISA
D: So there's no way to appeal --
C: SERGEANT V.O.
D: There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case.
E: over the phone, flat
C: LISA
D: But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there?
C: JOAN
D: What's going on? LISA waves her away.
S: EXT. RAMON'S TERRACE. NIGHT.
N: Joan and Ramon are having drinks and looking at his great view of the Upper West Side. Joan is smoking.
C: JOAN
D: -- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before.
C: RAMON
D: But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance.
C: JOAN
D: No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience.
C: RAMON
D: Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
C: JOAN
D: I love this view... You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
E: Pause
C: RAMON
D: What do you mean?
C: JOAN
D: Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam?
C: RAMON
D: I don't think we should talk about that, Joan.
C: JOAN
D: You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
C: RAMON
D: Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends.
C: JOAN
D: My friends...!
C: RAMON
D: Yes.
N: 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116 He sips his drink. Joan doesn't know what to say. Pause.

S: 132A INT. RAMON'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 132A
N: Ramon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures.
C: RAMON
D: That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
C: JOAN
D: Uh huh...
C: RAMON
D: I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now.
C: JOAN
D: Yeah...I haven't really been following it.
C: RAMON
D: It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution.
C: JOAN
D: Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something?
C: RAMON
D: Of course not.
C: JOAN
D: Why are you interested in me?

C: RAMON
D: You don't think I should be?
C: JOAN
D: I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world...
C: RAMON
D: You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things?
C: JOAN
D: Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?

C: RAMON
D: Not for me.
C: JOAN
D: I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life.
C: RAMON
D: You should travel more.
C: JOAN
D: I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater...
C: RAMON
D: Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it.
C: JOAN
D: I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband --
C: RAMON
D: Karl.
C: JOAN
D: Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
C: RAMON
D: I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting?
C: JOAN
D: I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age.
C: RAMON
D: She would prefer the world with no plays? No films?
C: JOAN
D: Oh... Who knows.

S: EXT. MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.
N: Lisa and Emily meet in front of Dave's office building.
S: INT. DAVE'S LAW FIRM - STAIRCASE/OFFICE. DAY.
N: Dave walks Lisa and Emily into his office.
C: DAVE
D: So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to --
N: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 118
C: EMILY
D: You called a what? A what?
C: DAVE
D: Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver --
C: LISA
D: Really?
C: DAVE EMILY
D: Yeah: So he -- Dave!
C: DAVE
D: Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms...
C: EMILY
D: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
C: DAVE EMILY
D: And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?!
C: DAVE
D: -- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car --
C: EMILY
D: What?
C: DAVE
D: -- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts --
C: EMILY
D: Are you fucking kidding me?
C: LISA
D: Why does this not shock me?
C: DAVE
D: Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union --
N: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 119
C: EMILY
D: O-Kay...l
E: i.e., "I get it."
C: DAVE
D: And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
C: LISA
D: This is making me sick.
C: DAVE
D: I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case.
C: LISA
D: We do?
C: DAVE
D: What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody.
C: EMILY
D: And you can prove that?
C: DAVE
D: Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway.
N: LISA YOU'RE AWESOMEL
C: EMILY

Then Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak to her. She's a dream.
E: CONT'D

C: LISA

C: LISA
D: Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
C: DEUTSCH
D: Yes, sure, why not?
C: LISA

S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT -- FRONT DOOR. DAY.
N: Emily opens the front door for Joan and Lisa.
C: JOAN
D: Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.
C: EMILY
D: Nice to meet you too. Come on in.
N: - LISA (SARDONICALLY) Hi Emily.
S: INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM. DAY.
N: Emily, Joan and Lisa settle on the sofa and chairs.
C: JOAN
D: .I had a friend who used to live on this block, at 262...?
C: EMILY
D: Oh...?
C: JOAN
D: Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
C: EMILY
D: No, I don't know her.
C: LISA
D: I think about a thousand people must...
C: JOAN
D: What?
C: LISA
D: Nothing...
C: EMILY
D: Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
C: JOAN
D: Oh -- Yeah...
C: LISA
D: You should go see it, it's really good.
C: JOAN
D: Well, the play is great, and it's a really nice cast..-.
C: LISA
D: She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York.
C: JOAN
D: Oh -- all that stuff's a long way off.
C: EMILY
D: I don't go to the theater very much.
C: JOAN
D: Well, it's just nice, because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of recognition. And even though you don't necessarily do it for that as your primary motive, it is very nice when people do notice something you've done.
C: EMILY
D: Uh huh...
C: JOAN
D: I was on a television show a few years ago, and I had been doing theater all my life, and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It. And it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while...
C: LISA
D: That show was so stupid.
C: JOAN
D: It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because you've frankly become such a big part of Lisa's life, and I don't want to be intrusive, but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
C: LISA
D: That's not true...!
C: JOAN
D: Well, I can't...! And I want you to know, Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have.
N: (MORE)
C: JOAN
D: But I can't let you pursue it to the point where it's taking over your life or interfering with your school work. It's really come down to a question of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship at her school. And I know she feels a real sense of responsibility about what happened
E: CONT'D To EMILY
C: LISA
D: Yeah, I do.
C: JOAN
D: I know you do. I know you do. But you can't not do your homework, and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it.
C: LISA
D: I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop.
C: JOAN
D: All right --
C: LISA
D: We didn't need to have a big conference about it.
N: JOAN (EMBARRASSED) It's not a big conference, I just want to know what's going on. And I wanted to meet Emily... (to EMILY) I know it's a little awkward!
C: EMILY
D: Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been keeping you apprised of what's been going on, I think she should. You should.
C: LISA
D: There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference.
C: JOAN
D: Now what is that?
C: LISA
D: Mom? It really doesn't matter.
C: EMILY
D: A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order. authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records, interviewing witnesses, talking to Monica's cousin...
C: JOAN
D: OK, now where does she fit in?
C: EMILY
D: She gets the money.
S: EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL. DAY.
N: ABIGAIL BERWITZ, 40s, gets out the taxi as the driver comes around with her matching luggage.
S: INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: Abigail sits with Deutsch.
C: DEUTSCH
D: How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits --
C: ABIGAIL
D: I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me...
C: DEUTSCH
D: And what were the nature of these conversations?
C: ABIGAIL.
D: Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my kids...
C: DEUTSCH
D: And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
C: ABIGAIL
D: Oh, I would say so, yes.
C: DEUTSCH
D: Would you have any phone records? Or --
C: ABIGAIL
D: I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations...
C: DEUTSCH
D: No no --
N: ABIGAIL (PRODUCES BILLS) You'll see we talked on the phone quite frequently.
C: DEUTSCH
D: OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1
C: ABIGAIL
D: Well, I wanted to bring everything.
C: DEUTSCH
D: Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship...
C: ABIGAIL
D: Uh huh?
C: DEUTSCH
D: Kind of advice she used to give you...
N: ABIGAIL OK...?
S: INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY.
N: Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is drinking a white wine.
C: ABIGAIL
D: Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?
C: EMILY
D: He was recommended by a friend.
C: ABIGAIL
D: I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of --
C: EMILY
D: My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good..
C: ABIGAIL
D: I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky...
N: 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128
C: EMILY
D: He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you.
C: ABIGAIL
D: No, if you all think he's good...
C: EMILY
D: I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is.
C: ABIGAIL
D: All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle?
C: LISA
D: I just wanted to...I was just there.
S: INT. EMILY'S DINING ROOM. DAY.
N: Emily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee. Lisa is standing over the table looking at some of Monica's photos and belongings which are spread out all over the table. Emily starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes.
C: LISA
D: Oh my God, is that you?
N: EMILY That's me. LISA And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my God. Is that her daughter? EMILY Uh huh.
C: LISA
D: God... So how old was she when she died?
N: EMILY Twelve.
C: LISA
D: God. I can't even imagine.
C: EMILY
D: Neither could we.
N: Emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put them in the box. Lisa sits down too. 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128aA
C: LISA
D: You know Monica asked about her when she was dying?
N: 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128A-129 Emily looks up.
C: EMILY
D: No. I didn't.
N: LISA Yeah. I think she was confused... like, I think she thought I was her daughter for a minute. And then she was asking me to call her, like to tell her what happened: You know, like she didn't remember she was dead.
C: EMILY
D: What do you mean? What did she say?
C: LISA
D: She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond.
C: LISA
D: But I couldn't tell if what I was saying
E: CONT'D
N: was registering with her. Emily does not respond.
C: LISA
D: But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died.
E: CONT'D
N: EMILY (VERY DRY) I see. And is she still inhabiting your body? Or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over?
C: LISA
D: I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all.
N: EMILY I don't give a fuck what you believe in. 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 129aA CONTINUED: ( 3)
C: LISA
D: Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?
C: EMILY
D: Because this is not an opera!
N: LISA (FLUSHING) What? You think I think this is an opera? 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 129A-130 CONTINUED: ( 4)
C: EMILY
D: Yes!
C: LISA
D: You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
C: EMILY
D: I think you're very young.
C: LISA
D: What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before!
C: EMILY
D: No, it means you care more easily! There's a big difference! Except that it's not you it's happening to!
C: LISA
D: Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over --
C: EMILY
D: That's right, you weren't. And you're not the one who died of leukemia, and you're not the one who just died in an earthquake in -- Algeria! But you will be. Do you understand me? You will be. And it's not an opera and it's not dramatic --
C: LISA
D: I'm well aware of that!
C: EMILY
D: And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing.
C: LISA
D: Oh wow.
C: EMILY
D: Do you understand? It's not worth anything, because it'll be troweled over in a month or two. And then when you get older, and you don't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over, then, then we'll find out what kind of a person you are! But this is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start this conversation and I don't play these games.
N: 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 131 CONTINUED: ( 5)
C: LISA
D: I am not --
E: drawing herself up
C: EMILY
D: And don't look so outraged! Because I'm not
N: saying anything very outrageous! I'm telling you to knock it off! You have every right to falsify your own life, but you have no right to falsify anyone else's. It's what makes people into Nazis! And I'm sorry, but it's a little suspicious that you're making such a fuss about this when you didn't know her, and you're having troubles with your own mother --
C: LISA
D: Oh my God!
C: EMILY
D: But this is nm life we're talking about, much more than it is yours! Because it's my real friend who got killed, who I'm never going to see again, really! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- dramatization!
C: LISA
D: I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
C: EMILY
E: not having it
N: OK --
C: LISA
D: I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking strident?
C: EMILY
D: Strident?
C: LISA
D: Yeah.
C: EMILY
D: OK. Um, you should leave.
C: LISA
D: Why? Because I called you strident?
N: CONTINUED: ( 6)
C: EMILY
D: Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks. I don't wanna be called strident and you're deliberately misunderstanding me!
C: LISA
D: No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid too!
C: EMILY
D: Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
C: LISA
D: OK! I will.
N: EMILY NOW!
C: LISA
D: OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
C: LISA
D: Does this mean we're dropping the whole inquiry?
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: It means you're leaving. I don't know what else it means.
C: LISA
D: All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word!
C: EMILY
D: Look it up when you get home.
C: LISA
D: Jesus Christ. You're amazing.
C: EMILY
D: Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.
C: LISA
D: Why are you doing this... .!
E: bursts into tears
C: EMILY
D: Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human being! Monica was a human being! So was her daughter! And so is your mother!
N: (MORE) 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 133 CONTINUED: ( 7)

D: We are not supporting characters in the fascinating story of your life!
E: CONT' D
C: LISA
D: I never said or thought you were...! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I
N: totally misused the word! I wasn't trying to insult you, Emily, I really wasn't! I feel so bad about what happened and I'm trying so hard to do something about it! And I don't understand why if I say something wrong you can't just give me a break! I didn't mean I thought her daughter took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was just this feeling I had because she was holding onto my hand so hard before she died, and because we had the same first name! EMILY OK...
C: LISA
D: But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
N: EMILY OK. I believe you. And look up "strident."
C: LISA
D: I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.

D: Dig in everybody... They start eating.
C: LISA
D: I was thinking about spending next year with Dad.
N: JOAN (SHOCKED) Oh?

S: INT. HISTORY CLASS. DAY.
N: On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO?
C: KLEIN
D: OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.
C: KIRSTEN
D: I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes.
C: KLEIN
D: All right: Lisa?
C: LISA
D: I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.--
C: LEWIS
D: Such as what?
C: LISA
D: Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth?
C: KLEIN
D: OK... Hitler Youth.
C: LISA
D: Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties?
N: (MORE) Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 137

C: LEWIS
D: OK, OK! Monica?
C: MONICA
D: Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.
N: WHEREAS 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138
C: ANGIE
D: Yes. Yes!
C: LISA
D: I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement!
C: ANGIE
D: Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country?
C: LEWIS LISA
D: Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it!

S: INT. THEATER LOBBY. NIGHT.
N: Ramon CLAPS as Joan comes out to greet him, Lisa and Emily.
C: RAMON
D: That's the best show yet! Every time it's a better performance.
C: JOAN
D: God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much for coming...
C: EMILY
D: Oh, thank you for the tickets. Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.
C: JOAN
D: Shall we go?
S: INT. RESTAURANT/BAR. NIGHT.
N: Joan, Lisa, Emily and Ramon are having drinks.
C: LISA
D: -- and I guess I lost my cool a little, but I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis...
C: JOAN
D: But who is running these discussions...?
C: RAMON
D: Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo.
C: JOAN
D: Mmm.
N: - EMILY How do you mean, Ramon?
C: RAMON
D: I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it's his law and his order. He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law. But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he's called a criminal and a terrorist, and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down, and once again it's called the rule of law. In
N: COLOMBIA --
C: EMILY
D: I see. And what would you like them to do? Pause.
C: RAMON
D: "They" meaning --
C: EMILY
D: The Jew oppressors. What would you like them to do? Pause.
C: RAMON
D: I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't.
E: i.e. "You didn't have to."
C: LISA
D: Um, I just spent the whole day arguing about this: I didn't really mean to bring it up again.
C: EMILY
D: Don't handle me.
E: turning on her
C: LISA
D: I'm not handling you.
N: JOAN (GENERALLY) What did you think of the play?
C: RAMON LISA
D: And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom.
N: the extreme that the victims of Nazis find it essential EMILY -- find it essential to If the Israelis were like use the Nazi tactics to Nazis there wouldn't be sustain their occupation. any Arabs left, and I'm leaving.
C: LISA
D: That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
E: agreeing with Emily
C: JOAN
D: That seems excessive, Emily, come on --
C: RAMON
D: That's the response. That's the Jewish response.
C: EMILY
D: It's the what?
C: RAMON
D: It's the Jewish response. You don't like what I am saying or what I do, so you --
C: EMILY
D: That's my Jewish response. Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.
C: JOAN
D: Oh my God...!
C: RAMON
D: It's all right... That's all right... It's a perfect little .encapsule...It's the Jewish response. A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.
E: Wiping off his face
S: INT. JOAN'S ROOM. NIGHT.
N: Joan is getting ready-for bed. Lisa appears in the doorway.
C: LISA
D: Sorry about all that tonight.
C: JOAN
D: Yeah. Your friend is a delight.
C: LISA
D: She's a really passionate person. She really cares about things.
C: JOAN
D: She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --
C: LISA
D: So what? Why is it so JOAN important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in an exchange of ideas. As it happens Ramon said a few things I wasn't too crazy about either, so I guess that's the end of that...
C: LISA
D: Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault too?
C: JOAN
D: I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
S: INT. RAMON'S OFFICE. DAY.
N: Ramon is on the phone in his big midtown corner office.
C: RAMON
D: Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I
E: on the phone
N: meant was, that was the typical response you will get from someone who will take that position that that woman was taking. But if you like to break up with me because I used the wrong adjective, what I'm going to do? I'm not going to beg you.
S: INT. COHEN KITCHEN/KARL'S HOUSE. DAY.
N: Joan enters slowly and checks the water on the stove. Lisa is eating a carrot and reading a magazine. Silence.
C: LISA
D: Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?-
C: JOAN
D: Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.
C: LISA
D: Hello?
N: KARL (ON PHONE) Yeah. It's Dad.
S: INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY.-
T: WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
C: LISA
D: Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip...
C: KARL
D: Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen.
C: LISA
D: Really? What's the matter?
C: KARL
D: Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel.
C: LISA
D: I never said I didn't want to go.
C: KARL
D: Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so --
C: LISA
D: I think-he's really looking forward to it --
C: KARL
D: Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year.
N: (MORE)
C: KARL
D: It looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the Fall, which means I'm probably not gonna be around the house all that much, and since you and Annette detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't think that's what I want to come home to after a fourteen hour day.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: We don't detest each other
C: KARL
D: OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being?
N: LISA OK.
C: KARL
D: OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever.
N: LISA OK...
C: KARL
D: Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
C: JOAN
D: What's wrong?
C: LISA
D: Dad's cancelling the trip.
C: JOAN
D: What? Why?
C: LISA
D: He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money.
C: JOAN
D: Did you say you didn't want to go?
C: LISA
D: No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip.
C: JOAN
D: Oh boy.
C: LISA
D: I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.
S: INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY.
N: Karl sits holding the phone in a savage depression.
S: INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. DAY.
N: Lisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee.
C: LISA
D: Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.
C: MR AARON
D: That's all right...
C: LISA
D: You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it.
C: MR AARON
D: It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on?
C: LISA
D: I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know.
C: MR AARON
D: Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you...
C: LISA
D: You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself.
N: (MORE)
C: LISA
D: And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all?
E: CONT'D
C: MR AARON
D: Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised...
C: LISA
D: Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not.
C: MR AARON
D: That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they -- I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with...
E: Pause
C: LISA
D: No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.
C: LISA
D: Just a little hot...A little warm .Is this all right?
E: CONT'D
C: MR AARON
D: Sure.
C: LISA
D: Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
C: MR AARON
D: You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.
C: LISA
D: I like your apartment.
C: MR AARON
D: Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away.
C: LISA
D: Sorry.
C: MR AARON
D: That's all right.
C: LISA
D: This is terrible.
C: MR AARON
D: What is? What's terrible?
C: LISA
D: I just like you so much... Sorry. What a moron.
E: Smooths her ash on the ashtray.
C: MR AARON
D: Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change.
E: taking her hand
C: LISA
D: Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times.
C: MR AARON
D: Lisa...
C: LISA
D: Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment she slides her hand onto his leg.
C: MR AARON
D: OK, look...
C: LISA
D: Don't stop me yet, OK? They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.
C: MR AARON
D: Please don't do that.
C: LISA
D: Just let me for one second... She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.
S: INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER.

C: MR AARON
D: Are you all right?
C: LISA
D: Nothing. It's OK.
N: - MR AARON Maybe we should stop.
C: LISA
D: Don't stop. It's OK.
C: MR AARON
D: Are you all right?
C: LISA
D: Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that.
C: MR AARON
D: I think we should stop.
C: LISA
D: No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him.
S: INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER.
N: AT THE DOOR. She is leaving. He is burning with guilt and shame. Silence. Then:
C: LISA
D: All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year. Lighten up! I'm kidding.
E: Pause
C: MR AARON
D: Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to react.
C: LISA
D: Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
N: (MORE)
C: LISA
D: Anyway, it's just sex. You're acting like a little kid. I'll see you in school. She walks out. He is very flummoxed.

N: QUESTIONS -- Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150
C: ROB
D: Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more...
C: ABIGAIL

C: DEUTSCH
D: .Could I interject?
C: ABIGAIL
D: But if they responded so strongly based on one story...
C: ROB
D: Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.
C: DEUTSCH
D: They are responding to the story in the paper...
C: ABIGAIL
D: .That's just common sense.
C: DEUTSCH
D: But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper.
C: EMILY LISA

D: If I could finish my thought -- They're jumpin' at the bait right now, but if another six months goes by we run a serious risk of losing our momentum. You see what I mean? Now I'm gonna hit 'em very very hard, I guarantee you. That's why I wanted all of us together on the phone, so we could talk about your other terms, besides the
E: CONT'D
N: damages. I promise you, we'ere gonna be very very aggressive --
C: ABIGAIL
D: What other terms would there be?

D: What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?
C: DEUTSCH
D: A what?
N: ROB Some kind of fund? For the kids?
C: DEUTSCH

E: to ABIGAIL

E: CONT'D
C: JOAN
D: No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think?
C: LISA
D: Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him.
C: JOAN
D: I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it.
C: LISA
D: No shit. You're on your own, Mom.

D: OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
C: JOAN
D: I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.
C: RODRIGO
D: Excuse me. Joan?

C: JOAN
D: He did?
C: RODRIGO
D: Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died.
C: JOAN
D: Really?
C: RODRIGO
D: I don't know if this is appropriate...
C: JOAN
D: No it's OK...!
C: RODRIGO
D: .but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with.

D: Um, I'll go.
C: JOAN
D: OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.
N: LISA OK.
C: JOAN
D: What did you make of that?
N: LISA (STILL TYPING) People don't relate to each other, Mom. They're totally disconnected. And if they have any time for each other at all, it's either like a biological imperative or like some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I make of it.
C: JOAN
D: Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that you think that. Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well.
C: LISA
D: I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just a general observation.
C: JOAN
D: OK...Hey, could I get a hug?
C: LISA
D: Sure. Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.

D: But I gotta -- obviously I gotta bring the offer to you, get your approval --
E: CONT'D
N: ROB Mr Deutsch...? DEUTSCH Now, I know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit --
C: ROB
D: That's OK --
C: ABIGAIL
D: We're only --
C: EMILY
D: Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to
N: what Russel has to say, and then talk about it once he's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation...
C: ROB
D: Yes. Sorry. Fire away.
C: DEUTSCH
D: I was gonna say I know there was a concern
N: after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit --
C: ROB
D: That's OK --
C: ABIGAIL
D: We were just --
C: EMILY
D: Would you let him talk please?!
C: DEUTSCH
D: It's OK.
C: ABIGAIL
D: We're sorry.
C: DEUTSCH
D: I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer.
N: (MORE)
C: DEUTSCH
D: I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher --
E: CONT'D
C: ABIGAIL
D: Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars...
C: ROB
D: OK, now let me just --
N: ABIGAIL .that's nothin' to sneeze at.
C: ROB ABIGAIL
D: I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me?
C: DEUTSCH, EMILY, LISA
D: Yes!
C: ABIGAIL
D: Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:
C: LISA
D: What about --
C: ABIGAIL
D: -- Emily? What do you think?
C: EMILY
D: I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the --
N: ABIGAIL (ON "BUT") Hey, if that's the vote...
C: ROB
D: Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more.
C: DEUTSCH
D: I think it would be a big mistake.
C: ABIGAIL
D: Robbie, what do you think?
C: ROB
D: Sold!
C: ABIGAIL
D: Sold!
C: DEUTSCH
D: OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that
N: the bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver. LISA & EMILY What?
C: LISA
D: What do you mean?
C: ROB
D: The driver?
C: LISA EMILY
D: Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver?
C: DEUTSCH
D: Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!
C: ABIGAIL
D: It's just a blast in our ears.
N: EMILY (TO LISA) Let him finish.
C: LISA
D: Finish what? Forget it!
N: DEUTSCH (TO EMILY) Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa, I pressed them very very hard on this, but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement because it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the MTA --
C: LISA
D: What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean?
C: DEUTSCH
D: Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
N: NOW:
C: LISA
D: Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.'
C: DEUTSCH
D: I know that's your reaction...
C: LISA
D: It's the only reason we're here.
C: ROB
D: Can I jump in here? Russel?
N: DEUTSCH (TO LISA) .but it's really not your decision.
C: ROB ABIGAIL
D: Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
C: LISA
D: It's Emily's decision.
C: EMILY
D: No.
C: DEUTSCH
D: No.
C: ROB
D: Hello?
C: LISA
D: It's not?
C: ABIGAIL
D: They're not listening, Robbie.
C: DEUTSCH
D: It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin.
C: LISA
D: But she didn't even know about it!
C: EMILY
D: That doesn't matter.
C: ABIGAIL
D: Could we get back in this conversation please?
C: DEUTSCH
D: Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this --
C: ABIGAIL
D: Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna --
C: ROB
D: Exactly.
C: ABIGAIL
D: we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
C: LISA
D: The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else -- !
C: DEUTSCH
D: Lemme just clarify --
C: LISA
D: -- it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like... !
C: ABIGAIL
D: This is a distortion --
C: LISA
D: And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street --
C: EMILY
D: For getting him, Abigail!
C: ABIGAIL
D: Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now.
N: (MORE)
C: ABIGAIL
D: And rather than being abused over the telephone and cursed at for having the courtesy to involve you in these discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm wrong about that.
E: CONT'D
C: LISA
D: None of that matters --
C: ABIGAIL
D: Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this?
C: LISA
D: Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before!
C: ABIGAIL
D: Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was --
C: LISA
D: Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears.
N: DEUTSCH & EMILY Lisa!
C: LISA
D: You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out.
S: EXT. STREET. DAY.
N: TRACKING in front of Lisa as she walk-runs down the busy street. A city bus appears behind her and goes by. She cranes to see the driver. It's not her guy. She keeps going.
S: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY.
N: Lisa stands against a car, smoking, as the kids flow out of the building. Mr Aaron comes out, talking with BONNIE, the gymnastics teacher. They walk away from the school together. Lisa catches up with them.
C: BONNIE
D: Hey, Lisa. What's Up?
N: - LISA Hey, did you guys know I had an abortion last week? Pause.
C: MR AARON
D: No. I didn't know that.
C: LISA
D: Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.
C: BONNIE
D: Um, should I...
C: MR AARON
D: No, no, don't go anywhere.
C: LISA
D: Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks steadily at Lisa.
C: MR AARON
D: Do you want to tell us about it?
C: LISA
D: Yeah. I do.
C: MR AARON
D: OK. -Go ahead.
C: LISA
D: Well... She doesn't speak. Pause.
C: BONNIE
D: Do your parents know about this, Lisa?
C: LISA
D: Yes.
C: BONNIE
D: Have you told the father, honey?
C: LISA
D: No...There's a couple of people it could be.
C: MR AARON
D: I think you better tell them. Whoever they are.
C: LISA
D: No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
C: MR AARON
D: I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this.
C: LISA
D: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone.
C: BONNIE
D: We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be --
C: LISA
D: That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry...! She shakes her head and runs away.
E: On have to"
C: BONNIE
D: What was that...?
S: INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY.
N: Lisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table.
C: CURTIS
D: Mom's looking for you.
C: LISA
D: What for?
C: CURTIS
D: She thinks you're going out with her tonight.
C: LISA
D: Where are we going?
C: CURTIS
D: I don't know. Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.
C: JOAN
D: Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to the opera?
C: LISA
D: Yes.
C: JOAN
D: I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you.
C: LISA
D: It's OK.
S: EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK.
N: Lisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes her arm.
C: JOAN
D: Don't get run over. A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is approaching.
C: LISA
D: Wait. I want to see if that's him.
C: JOAN
D: What. They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.
C: LISA
D: It is him. Mom, that's the one... Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave. Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.
C: JOAN
D: Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.
S: EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT.
N: Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her, but Lisa won't look at her or interact.
C: JOAN
D: Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I ever heard.
C: LISA
D: What do you mean? It's OK. The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in. Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.
S: 172A INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA - GRAND STAIRCASE. NIGHT 172A
N: Lisa comes down the stairs and goes into --
S: INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT.
N: Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. Lisa stares straight ahead. The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful. Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry, but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and wipes them away, but they keep coming. Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her. Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely, clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts crying too out of sympathy. As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that the spell has been broken. The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK. THE END
