T: FADE IN:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY
N: Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an efficient man with a good case. The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been carefully rehearsed.
C: BARBARA
D: ... we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something.
T: PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
N: And is that what you did on the day in question?
C: BARBARA
D: No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: What happened next, Barbara?
C: BARBARA
D: Mr. Gettys closed the door.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Everyone else had gone?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes. He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.
N: MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: In your own words, Barbara, can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes? KEVIN LOMAX. Defense counsel. Taking it all in.
C: BARBARA
D: I told him I was afraid I would miss my bus. He promised I would get to the bus on time if I would help him to do something...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom -- taking inventory -- assessing damage --
C: BARBARA
D: ... Then he put -- before I could say anything -- he placed his hand inside my blouse...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin -- checking the jury and --
C: BARBARA
D: ... I was so frightened I didn't move. I thought if I was just quiet it would be okay...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops him cold --
C: BARBARA
D: ... Then his other hand went up under -- inside my skirt...
E: O.S.
N: Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair --
C: BARBARA
D: ... his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth -- farther and farther inside my skirt...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --
C: BARBARA
D: ... he said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings I had...
E: O.S.
N: Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg -- absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --
C: BARBARA
D: ... I didn't know what to say, I was trying to think of something to say but I was confused and he just kept on -- with his hand -- moving it -- under my dress -- higher and higher...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin is rocked. Trying not to show it.
C: BARBARA
D: ... then I, I was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me -- he just kept on --
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --
C: BARBARA
D: -- and then I screamed...
E: O.S.
N: Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him. Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --
C: BARBARA
D: ... then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: And did he try again?
C: BARBARA
D: Not with me.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: With friends of yours?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: And when you told them what he had done to you, they told you what he had done to them, isn't that true?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: I have nothing further.
C: JUDGE
D: Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
E: finding Kevin
C: KEVIN
D: Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE HALL - DAY
N: Kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom. Gettys right on his heels.
C: KEVIN
D: Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm advising you to get the fuck away from me.
C: GETTYS
D: Why? What are you talking about?
C: KEVIN
D: The wife. The kid. The outrage. You definitely had me fooled.
C: GETTYS
D: You're my lawyer! You're here to defend me!
C: KEVIN
D: You know what I'm thinking? Why don't we put you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge.
C: GETTYS
D: You know she's lying.
C: KEVIN
D: Get the hell out of my way.
N: Gettys standing aside, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - DAY
N: An ancient upstairs facility. Kevin standing at the mirror. Frozen there. Identity crisis. Morality crisis. He takes off his wedding ring. Letting cold water run in the sink. His eyes never leaving the mirror. Behind him, the door opens. A local REPORTER enters, moves to the urinal.
C: REPORTER
D: Well, hell, there you are. Rumor was you were out wandering in traffic.
C: KEVIN
D: Not now, Larry.
C: REPORTER
D: What's the game plan, Kevin? I got a four-thirty deadline. I need a quote. Gimme a quote.
C: KEVIN
D: Fuck off.
C: REPORTER
D: 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events. Speculation, however, was widespread that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this courtroom.'
N: Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly, becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...
C: REPORTER
D: It was a nice run, Kev. Had to close out someday. Nobody wins 'em all.
N: The Reporter exits. Kevin alone with the mirror. And then it's over. He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
N: Kevin walking through. His game face. A court officer opening the doors and --
T: CUT TO:
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 6.
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY
N: Barbara on the stand. Everyone in place.
C: KEVIN
D: Math hasn't exactly been your subject this year, has it?
C: BARBARA
D: No.
C: KEVIN
D: Any theories on why you've done so poorly in math this year?
C: BARBARA
D: It's not my fault.
C: KEVIN
D: Would you say Mr. Gettys is the problem? You're not sure. Have you had any discipline problems in math class this year?
E: as she shrugs
C: BARBARA
D: No.
C: KEVIN
D: No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior? Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class?
C: BARBARA
D: No.
C: KEVIN
D: Have other teachers ever asked you to stay after class?
C: BARBARA
D: Once or twice.
C: KEVIN
D: Did they want to talk about your behavior?
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Objection. Immaterial.
C: KEVIN
D: Goes to motive.
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 7.
C: JUDGE
D: Overruled. You may answer the question.
C: BARBARA
D: I don't know what the other teachers wanted. You'd have to talk to them.
C: KEVIN
D: You ever pass notes in class, Barbara? Maybe a note that made fun of Mr. Gettys?
C: BARBARA
D: No.
C: KEVIN
D: No? Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'?
C: BARBARA
D: No.
N: Kevin handing out paperwork.
C: KEVIN
D: Your Honor, I've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit A...
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Objection, Your Honor, we've had plenty of time for discovery here. The Judge quickly studying his copy of the note.
C: JUDGE
D: I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax, I'm also gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a timely fashion or not at all.
C: KEVIN
D: I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong, it's 'huge hog beast'. This is your handwriting, isn't it?
E: right to the note
C: BARBARA
D: Yes, but --
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 8.
C: KEVIN
D: You wrote this in his class.
C: BARBARA
D: It's a joke.
C: KEVIN
D: 'He's a huge hog beast. He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast.' You're writing here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
C: BARBARA
D: It was meant to be a joke.
C: KEVIN
D: Have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away? Yes or no?
E: waiting
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Objection. This is way out of...
C: KEVIN
D: Credibility and bias.
C: JUDGE
D: Overruled. Answer the question.
C: BARBARA
D: Yes.
E: rattled
C: KEVIN
D: The word special came up in your testimony earlier. You claimed that Mr. Gettys asked you whether you had special feelings, if you felt special. Have you ever heard of a game called 'Special Places?' You're under oath, Barbara. A man's career -- his reputation -- his life is on the line. This is not a joke. Have you ever played the game Special Places?
E: beat waiting
C: BARBARA
D: Yes.
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 9.
C: KEVIN
D: Is this game sexual in nature? Is this game sexual in nature?
E: waiting
C: BARBARA
D: We only played it once.
C: KEVIN
D: This special party, Barbara, this was the first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys.
C: BARBARA
D: Yes.
C: KEVIN
D: I've spoken to the other children who were there that day. Can you think of anything else, Barbara, they might have told me about that party?
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Objection. Your Honor, if he has other witnesses let him call them.
C: KEVIN
D: If I need to call those other children, I will.
E: right at Barbara
C: JUDGE
D: I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax. Rephrase your question.
C: KEVIN
D: You threatened those children, didn't you?
C: BARBARA
D: That's not the way it happened --
C: KEVIN
D: You told them to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn't you?
C: BARBARA
D: These things did happen!
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 9A. CONTINUED: (3A)
C: KEVIN
D: Because if they didn't go along you were going to tell everyone about this special party.
C: BARBARA
D: They happened to me.
C: KEVIN
D: So you made up a story. A special story, about a math teacher -- a disgusting pig monster -- you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it?
C: BARBARA
D: I didn't want to be the only one!
N: BARBARA'S FATHER can take it no longer -- suddenly on his feet -- charging --
C: BARBARA'S FATHER
D: You son of a bitch!
N: The bailiff making a diving grab --
C: KEVIN
D: I have no further questions, Your Honor.
N: Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting there, staring at the floor, completely drained, emotionally, morally, physically and -- In the back of the room, a man. He's black. Elegant. Amused by the scene. His name is LEAMON HEATH. MARY ANN LOMAX leans in behind her husband. She is a doll. We love her.
C: MARY ANN
D: Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
N: It's a rock and roll joint. Florida style. But it's early and empty. Kevin at the bar with Mary Ann, two LAWYER friends, the Reporter and someone's girl friend. 12 shot glasses, two rows of six. A perfect tequila pour and -- LAWYER #1 (O.S.) In the event we all get drunk and forget, I suggest we frontload the ceremonial bullshit... (a toast) To the best damn trial lawyer in Alachua County. Kevin, subdued, watches the rest of them drink.
C: REPORTER
D: So, Kev, off the record, how's it feel to squeeze a man like Gettys through the door of reasonable doubt?
C: MARY ANN
D: No. I told you already, we're not gonna discuss that damn case anymore. Done. Am I right?
E: waving him off to Kevin
C: KEVIN
D: I'll drink to that. No shop talk.
E: as he does
T: CUT TO:
N: MONTAGE Tequila pours. As the night goes on.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Drunk frat boys laughing as they exit. A BAR BAND in the distance. Kevin done pissing. Moving for the sink, when he suddenly stops. Freezes. A mirror above the sink. There he is. The guy that set Gettys free.
C: HEATH
D: Mr. Lomax?
E: O.S.
N: Kevin turns -- Leamon Heath standing beside him.
C: HEATH
D: Helluva job today. I didn't want to disturb your party.
E: quickly presenting his card
C: KEVIN
D: Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Never heard of it. What're you gonna do? Sue me?
E: looking up
C: HEATH
D: Actually, we were hoping to retain your services. We've been following your progress.
C: KEVIN
D: From New York.
C: HEATH
D: You've never lost a case.
C: KEVIN
D: I've had some sympathetic juries.
C: HEATH
D: That's exactly what we're looking for. We want you to come to New York. Help us pick a jury.
C: KEVIN
D: Really. I'll tell you, man. You're pretty damn good. And the card is great. And the black thing -- you being black -- whose idea was that? Paul's? 'Cause that's just brilliant. I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.
E: amused now as he's walking
C: HEATH
D: You'd have to start next week. All expenses. First class travel and lodging. You and your wife. A lump sum payment, regardless of verdict in the amount of, well... Here. Take a look.
E: waiting as Kevin stops there in his hand
N: Kevin takes the check. Still looking at it, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FLORIDA CINDERBLOCK CHURCH - DAY
N: Two dozen cars parked. MUSIC and SINGING from inside. A sign reads: "SEMINOLE CALVARY CHURCH OF THE REDEEMER"
S: INT. FLORIDA CINDERBLOCK CHURCH - DAY
N: Inside the church. Plain and functional. Poor but faithful. A trio -- electric guitar, accordion, tambourine -- playing a hymn. Forty-five voices raised in song. The tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky, but the feeling is strong. They mean it. The CAMERA FINDS -- MRS. LOMAX. Kevin's mother. Forty- six. Singing her heart out. A woman with faith, in the presence of her Lord. The CAMERA FINDS -- Kevin. In the very back. Standing in the doorway. Halfway in. Halfway out. Shadow. Light. Waiting.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FLORIDA CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Post-service. Mrs. Lomax and Kevin walking to her car.
C: KEVIN
D: It's two weeks at most.
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: You've never been to New York.
C: KEVIN
D: Every dog gets a day.
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: Pick a jury... I feel the hand of Mary Ann on this adventure.
E: ridiculous
C: KEVIN
D: Mom.
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: New York is not a good idea.
C: KEVIN
D: Look, how you fixed for cash?
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: I have my bad feeling.
C: KEVIN
D: I put a couple hundred in here...
E: an envelope
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: Sounds like more than two weeks.
C: KEVIN
D: Mary Ann typed out the numbers for you -- phone, the flights -- it's all in there.
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: Let me tell you about New York.
C: KEVIN
D: Babylon.
E: with a smile
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: Forewarned is forearmed. 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. It has become a dwelling place of demons.' Revelation Eighteen. Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.
E: half-serious
C: KEVIN
D: Couldn't forget it if I tried.
E: rolls with it
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: And what happened to Babylon?
C: KEVIN
D: 'Thou mighty city. In one hour hast thou mighty judgement come.'
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: 'And the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more.'
N: Kevin gathers her in. Kissing her good-bye, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: Darkness. Where are we? A door opens in another room -- VOICES -- KEVIN and MARY ANN. They're LAUGHING. Coming in from a big night out. For an instant -- light -- we glimpse a great hotel suite -- and then --
C: KEVIN
D: -- wait -- leave 'em off --
E: O.S.
C: MARY ANN
D: -- what are you... I can't --
E: O.S.
C: KEVIN
D: -- close your eyes -- do it --
E: O.S.
N: More LAUGHTER. Stumbling shadows moving PAST us and --
C: KEVIN
D: Okay. Stop.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. HOTEL SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT
N: Kevin behind Mary Ann with his hands over her eyes. He takes his hands away, but her eyes stay closed...
C: KEVIN
D: Okay. Open your eyes.
C: MARY ANN
D: Wow.
E: as she does
S: EXT. HOTEL SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT
N: The view. Wham. The definitive New York skyline.
S: EXT. HOTEL SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT
C: KEVIN
D: 'Go ahead...' '... bite the Big Apple.'
E: in her ear
C: MARY ANN
D: '... Rats on the West Side, bed bugs uptown, I can't give it away on Seventh Avenue. This town don't look good in tatters...'
E: she's dancing
C: KEVIN
D: I don't know... looks to me like that dress is in your way.
C: MARY ANN
D: Why, counselor... Surely you don't think a small- town girl changes overnight just because a man buys her dinner in the big city.
E: shocked, stops her best drawl
C: KEVIN
D: No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever think at all.
C: MARY ANN
D: Well, that's different, then. You're my kind of guy.
N: Kevin smiles. She's taking off the dress. Babylon.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOLEY SQUARE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
N: Six huge courthouses. All those courtrooms.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JURY COURTROOM - DAY
N: Criminal court. Voire dire. Potential jurors fill the benches. A bored judge. MEISEL, defense counsel, is a sour, New York veteran. The juror being questioned, a PIE-FACED MAN with bad vision. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 16.
C: MEISEL
D: Do you think as a juror you'd be able to set aside any prior opinions you might hold about the savings and loan industry? That was a question, sir.
E: long pause
C: PIE-FACE
D: What? Do I like bankers?
N: Heath catches Meisel's eye. Waves him over.
C: MEISEL
D: Your Honor, may I have a minute to speak with my colleagues.
N: ANGLE ON DEFENSE TABLE Kevin and Heath. And the defendant -- a well-tailored reptilian banker. Meisel joins them. Sotto voce.
C: KEVIN
D: Dump him. While you're at it let's get rid of number six, eight, and I'd say lose number twelve, except the prosecutor's gonna fuck up and do it for us.
C: MEISEL
D: Number six? You're kidding, right? She's my first choice.
C: KEVIN
D: She's my first pass.
C: MEISEL
D: And eight? With the dreadlocks? That's crazy. He's a defendant juror if I ever saw one.
C: KEVIN
D: You see his shoes?
C: MEISEL
D: Look, kid, maybe down in Florida you're the next big thing, but this is New York. Manhattan. We're not squeezing oranges here.
C: KEVIN
D: He polishes those shoes every night. He makes his own clothes. He may look like a brother-with- an-attitude to you, but I see a man who's got a shotgun under his bed and woe betide the creature who steps into his garden. And number six? Your favorite? She's damaged goods.
E: beat
C: MEISEL
D: She's a Catholic schoolteacher. She believes in human frailty.
E: to Heath
C: KEVIN
D: No. There's something missing from her. She's wrong. She wants on this jury. Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.
E: eyes to the pool
C: MEISEL
D: How the hell do you know that?
C: KEVIN
D: I don't know.
E: honestly
C: MEISEL
D: Look, either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk.
E: to Heath
C: HEATH
D: Walk.
C: MEISEL
D: All right. Here's the deal. I lose with your jury? You do the explaining.
E: a pause to Kevin
N: The defendant staring a hole into Kevin, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOLEY SQUARE JURY COURT - DAY
N: Kevin leaving court. In no hurry to get home. He likes it here. Across the street, a man, one of many passing on the sidewalk. Except this man turns as Kevin passes. Watching him. Seeing something that pleases him. This is JOHN MILTON. And now, as Kevin disappears, Milton joins the flow of people heading down into a subway station -- down -- and gone, as we PULL BACK TO --
S: EXT. FOLEY SQUARE - DAY/NIGHT (TIME LAPSE)
N: As day becomes night. 19A NIGHT BECOMES DAY 19A 19B AND AGAIN 19B 19C AND THIS TIME LIGHTNING SIZZLES THROUGH THE SKY 19C
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
N: Mary Ann watching TV alone. Remnants of a room service dinner. They've been living here for weeks now. The maids have started to give up. Kevin enters looking beat. Grabs a cold french fry.
C: MARY ANN
D: Your mother called. She has her bad feeling.
E: into her show
C: KEVIN
D: Every now and then she gets one right.
C: MARY ANN
D: What's up? You okay? Something's up.
E: looks over
C: KEVIN
D: They deliberated for thirty-eight minutes.
C: MARY ANN
D: Oh shit...
E: MORE
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 19.
C: MARY ANN
D: Oh, Kevin... I'm sorry, honey. What the hell did they expect? The man is guilty as can be. Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.
E: CONT'D turns off the TV, comforting him
C: KEVIN
D: Yeah. Except one.
C: MARY ANN
D: Kev....
C: KEVIN
D: Not fucking guilty.
E: a big ole smile
C: MARY ANN
D: Omigod...
C: KEVIN
D: Thirty-eight minutes. My jury.
C: MARY ANN
D: You did it! Omigod, Kevin...
C: KEVIN
D: Put on something that's gonna be easy to take off later. We are going out, girl!
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LAW FIRM LOBBY - DAY
N: Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Those words written in stone on the wall. The decor is stark, dramatic, awesome. The receptionist is simply stunning. Kevin, wearing his best suit, walking with Heath.
C: HEATH
D: Sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia a little longer than expected. Not bad, huh? You can play it cool if you want, but the first time I walked in here, my jaw was on the floor.
E: quietly as they hit the view
S: INT. LAW FIRM HALL - DAY
N: The firm offices. A large central atrium. Offices rim this space. Lawyers come in all shapes and sizes. Assistants -- male and female -- are uniformly attractive. The HUM of serious BUSINESS in the background.
C: HEATH
D: We've got forty partners vested at the moment. Close to six hundred associates. This is the home office, but we've got quite a few international arrangements, so Mr. Milton spends a good deal of his time in the air. In addition to our corporate clients, we're currently representing about twenty-five foreign countries. Mid-East, Balkans, Central America, West Africa. Interesting work, but travel intensive.
E: as they walk
N: Kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway --
C: HEATH
D: He's got you scheduled for fifteen minutes, which is a good sign, so make the most of it...
E: O.S.
S: INT. LAW FIRM - CHRISTABELLA'S OFFICE - DAY
N: THROUGH a large window we see a woman pacing her office. She's wearing a headset and arguing in machine-gun Italian. She is a goddess. Her name is CHRISTABELLA. She is beautiful beyond propriety. She will also turn out to be a brilliant EUC lawyer. She turns. Sees us staring -- like that -- Venetian blinds close tightly.
S: INT. LAW FIRM HALL - DAY
N: Heath is now far ahead. Kevin rushing to catch up --
S: INT. LAW FIRM - ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Kevin about six steps into it when suddenly, he looks down. Stops. Completely spooked.
C: HEATH
D: Gotcha. Man, I just love that...
E: smiles
N: The floor is nothing but glass. Sixty stories above the world. A bridge between two skyscrapers.
C: HEATH
D: I watched a Senator piss his pants right where you're standing.
C: KEVIN
D: Great.
E: nonplussed
C: HEATH
D: He's waiting for you. Good luck.
N: Kevin sucks it up. Starts walking. Up ahead, nothing but an open door.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY
N: First of all it's round. And large. The walls are made of stone. No windows. There are dramatic shafts of natural light from above. Stark and clean to the extreme. No paper anywhere. Kevin standing there. Taking in the space.
C: MILTON
D: Behind you.
E: O.S.
N: Kevin turns. There he is.
C: MILTON
D: Sorry. Didn't mean to...
C: KEVIN
D: No. Please. Kevin Lomax.
E: his hand
C: MILTON
D: John Milton.
E: they shake
C: KEVIN
D: Nice to meet you.
C: MILTON
D: Have we been treating you well?
C: KEVIN
D: Very well. Thank you.
C: MILTON
D: Your wife, she's had a good time?
C: KEVIN
D: She sure has. It's been great. The whole thing's been great.
C: MILTON
D: Good. That's our secret. We kill you with kindness. What's your secret?
E: walking the room, circling
C: KEVIN
D: I couldn't say.
C: MILTON
D: You were a prosecutor.
C: KEVIN
D: Out of law school. Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.
C: MILTON
D: Sixty-four straight convictions. What a number.
C: KEVIN
D: I like to be in court. I didn't plea out a lot.
C: MILTON
D: What's that like? One day you're putting them away and the next you're setting them free?
C: KEVIN
D: Takes a little getting used to.
C: MILTON
D: Pays better though, doesn't it?
C: KEVIN
D: Yes it does.
C: MILTON
D: The math teacher. The Gettys case. I hear you were brilliant.
C: KEVIN
D: Prosecutor dropped the ball.
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 23.
C: MILTON
D: Really. So you think your guy was guilty.
C: KEVIN
D: I didn't say that.
C: MILTON
D: What did you say?
C: KEVIN
D: How's this? I began the case with a clear conscience.
C: MILTON
D: I was sure you had a secret.
E: quiet a moment
C: KEVIN
D: The men's room. Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse. There's a hole in the wall. Straight through to the next room. I spent five years listening to juries deliberate.
E: beat smiles
C: MILTON
D: I love it.
C: KEVIN
D: Love it all you want, just don't repeat it. I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.
C: MILTON

N: A reflecting pool. Water right to the edge. A narrow walkway straight through the middle. And we're fifty stories above the city. The effect is staggering. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 24.
C: MILTON
D: What do you think? Some people can't handle it.
C: KEVIN
D: It's peaceful.
C: MILTON
D: Exactly. Fill in the resume. Tell me about your family. What does your father do?
E: pleased
C: KEVIN
D: I never got to know my father. He passed away before I was born. My mom raised me. Just the two of us.
C: MILTON
D: She never remarried?
C: KEVIN
D: She wasn't married the first time.
C: MILTON
D: That can't be easy in Gainesville.
C: KEVIN
D: I don't think it's easy anywhere. Holy shit...
E: re the view
C: MILTON
D: Little different when you're looking down, isn't it? Tell me about her. Your mother. What's she like?
E: beat
C: KEVIN
D: She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough. She's worked in the same poultry plant for as long as I can remember. I think she's up to eight-fifty an hour. She's got a church she really likes, so she's usually either there or they go out, they do a lot of volunteer work.

D: So they say.

D: Didn't rub off on you? The book? The church?

C: KEVIN
D: Are we negotiating?
C: MILTON
D: Always.
C: KEVIN
D: Why do you need a criminal department?
C: MILTON
D: Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I'm tired of sending their business across the street.
C: KEVIN
D: Are you offering me a job?
C: MILTON
D: I'm thinking about it. You have the talent. I knew that before you got here. It's the other thing I wonder about.
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 26.
C: KEVIN
D: What thing is that?
C: MILTON
D: Pressure. Changes everything. Some people, you squeeze them, they focus. Some people fold. Can you summon your talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night?
C: KEVIN
D: When do we talk about money?
C: MILTON
D: Money's the easy part.

D: Please. We live across the hall.

D: What am I picking?
C: JACKIE
D: Palette. Your colors.
C: HEATH
D: I need to warn you about one thing. There are going to be some very envious people at the firm. These apartments, there aren't many of them, it's really a partner's perk. You must've made quite an impression.

C: MARY ANN
D: Sure. Let's go back to Gainesville. You can keep scrounging for clients and pumping out the basement and I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian. Maybe, if we kill ourselves, in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores. Are you shitting me?

C: MILTON
D: There you go, Kevin. The whole team. I'm trying to think how long it's been since we were all together. All of us. Too long. I'm looking around, I know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today. It's appreciated. This room we're in was built -- architecturally designed -- to promote healthy group dynamics. A psychic centrifuge. Makes you want to reach out, doesn't it? Inclusion. Commonality. Synergy. All that good shit. That's what I'm looking for today. Because when I hear stories -- the kind of stories I've been hearing -- about backbiting, about partners not working together, departments cutting each other's throats over clients, or worse... I feel drained. It drains me. I feel empty. I feel as though I've let you all down. We need something. A gesture. What do I need, Eddie?
E: pacing the window off dead silence across the table
C: BARZOON
D: How about a public flogging?
C: MILTON
D: Wait a minute. I got it. It's perfect. It's intimate. It's quick. Doesn't cost a thing. There's a power to it. What is it? Let's hold hands. All of us. Together.

E: CONT'D as they shake to Pam

D: I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.
N: She moves aside. Kevin enters --
S: INT. DAHOUMEY BAKA - DAY
N: It's dark. Oil lamps and candles for light. The air thick with incense. Jars and bags and boxes are stacked on shelves everywhere. Powders. Oils. Bones. Skins. Potions. Dried herbs.

N: Kevin waiting as the last light goes on --
C: MOYEZ
D: I thought I would recognize you, but I do not.
E: O.S.
N: Kevin, spooked, wheels around -- PHILLIPE MOYEZ squatting in the corner. Skinny and intense. His eyes opaque and piercing at the same time. At once unassuming and terrifying. A plastic bag of fresh green roots in his lap. Ghat. Miraa. African cocaine. His teeth black from chewing it.
C: KEVIN
D: Mr. Moyez? We've never met. I'm a lawyer. I'm here about the animals.
E: as he nods
C: MOYEZ
D: As you wish.

C: MOYEZ
D: We have papers. At your firm. We have the tax exemption.
C: KEVIN
D: Okay. I'll get right into that. The animals. Let's start with that, then.
E: scribbling away
C: MOYEZ
D: We have an investment in blood. Think of it as spiritual currency.
N: Moyez stands. Starts slowly across the room.
C: KEVIN
D: Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need your help with this.
C: MOYEZ
D: Yes. That's very clear.
C: KEVIN
D: Perhaps we could start at the beginning?
N: Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez goes to a workbench near the wall --
C: KEVIN
D: Mr. Moyez?

D: What is the name of the man who will prosecute us?
C: KEVIN
D: Merto. Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

N: The Boy already running up the stairs. The sound of NAILS FALLING onto the workbench --

D: What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?
N: Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers. A huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are scattered around it.

C: KEVIN
D: That's a veal roast, Your Honor. U.S.D.A. approved and stamped. Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun into the animal's skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find it bizarre.
E: O.S. MORE
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 38A/39.
C: KEVIN
D: It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone. It's not as common as, say, circumcision. It's certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood. It's not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove one's faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't two thousand miles away in a stockyard. He doesn't use electricity to kill. And worst of all... Phillipe Moyez is not shrink- wrapped.
E: O.S.CONT'D holding up the roast
N: Merto begins to cough. Quietly at first, but...
C: KEVIN
D: Your Honor, the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious freedom.
N: Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop...
C: JUDGE SKLAR
D: This is a law protecting Kosher butchering.

Seriously, what I like, you got in there with him. Inside the cage. That's instinct. Can't be taught. You gotta hear that on your own. It's gotta be in your blood. It's molecular. I bet I've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet. I couldn't name ten -- couldn't name three -- I'd trust with Moyez.
E: buzzing here
C: KEVIN
D: So what the hell are they doing?
C: MILTON
D: What are they doing? They're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They're doing needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk. You, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. You can't help but smell your clients.

The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me -- I've been underestimated from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That's your only weakness as far as I can tell.

It's me. And she smiles -- it's like a veil coming down across her face -- and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the whisper in Nefertitti's ear. I'm a surprise. They never see me coming. That's what you're missing.
N: Milton escaping across the street.
C: KEVIN
D: So why did you come down today?
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 43.
C: MILTON
D: Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine -- that we would take this walk -- that we'd really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth? I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I'm warming my hands on your talent -- Where's the chicken?

E: back to Kevin, as they walk suddenly catching himself
C: KEVIN
D: I believe in the presumption of innocence.

N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 44.
C: KEVIN
D: Something like that.
C: MILTON
D: No. Exactly like that. It's faith. You're either in or out. You can't believe a little bit.
C: KEVIN
D: I was kidding.
C: MILTON
D: You're not here to amuse me. See, that's why people hate lawyers. So many of us have lost our faith. Don't let that happen to you. Token?

N: SERIES OF SHOTS - PARTY Faces -- some of them strangers. Some of them familiar from the conference room scene. KEVIN huddled with Jackie and Mary Ann as Heath brings them drinks from the bar. PAM and two lawyers near the terrace doors -- the smoking section -- talking with nicotine-driven intensity. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 47. CHRISTABELLA simply walking through the room. EDDIE AND DIANA BARZOON They've found Kevin and Mary Ann.

C: MARY ANN
D: Deadbeats. I mean, that's what it comes down to. You can call yourself a finance trainee, or a financial resources adviser, or whatever, you're still spending most of your day trying to hammer car payments out of deadbeats. No deadbeats here tonight.
E: looking around
C: MILTON
D: You'd be surprised. There's a lot more fear in this room than you'd think.
C: MARY ANN
D: What do these people have to be afraid of?
C: MILTON
D: Each other. Themselves. Why? What scares you?
C: MARY ANN
D: Not knowing who the deadbeats are.
C: MILTON
D: You'll figure that out. There's only one thing worth being frightened of anyway, and that's being alone. Truly and finally alone.
C: MARY ANN
D: Yes. I think you're right.
C: MILTON
D: You know what terrifies me? Responsibility.
C: MARY ANN
D: For what?
C: MILTON
D: For what. For you. Let's be honest, I've changed your life. Changed it forever. There's been a seismic shift in your existence and I'm responsible. And you've never even met me. We're talking for the very first time. How insane is that?

C: MARY ANN
D: I'm not leaving a lot behind.
C: MILTON
D: You must have family.
C: MARY ANN
D: Bad subject. I haven't spoken to my folks in a long time. My sister ran all the way to Germany.
C: MILTON
D: Whoaa... I gotta think about that. I had you down as daddy's little girl, you know? The princess. Sugar plum snapshots. Pastel bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies.
C: MARY ANN
D: I tell Kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine.
C: MILTON
D: So you've got a lot at stake here. You've made a real commitment.
C: MARY ANN
D: I guess I have.

N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96 51.
C: MILTON
D: If it isn't, will you come to me? Let me help? I'd feel a lot less responsible. Will you do that for me?
C: MARY ANN
D: Sure.
C: MILTON
D: The worst vice is advice, right? But can I make a suggestion? It's about your hair, some people are sensitive, that's why I ask.
C: MARY ANN
D: No. I mean, go ahead. You don't like it?
C: MILTON
D: You have shoulders nobody can see. Pull it back.
C: MARY ANN
D: You mean, you want me to pull my hair back?
C: MILTON
D: If I do it, everyone in this room that's pretending not to watch us will assume we're fucking or something. Pull back your hair. Take a look. See. That's it. Isn't that incredible? You need to cut your hair.
E: there's the mirror
C: MARY ANN
D: You're kidding.
C: MILTON
D: A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique. And her neck, if she's alive, has the very mystery of a border town. It's the no man's land in the battle between mind and body. You know, your natural color would really bring out your eyes...

Carved into the marble are human forms -- young, naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds. Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's going back and forth between Korean and Russian -- brokering some emergency deal. Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar. Kevin just standing there gaping at the space.

They know you and your wife were living separately. They see this maid -- Elucinda -- a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children.

E: stunned
C: MILTON
D: We'll find someone new. You consult. You live to fight another day.
C: KEVIN
D: I put together a great jury.

D: It's a disappointment. We all have them. Embrace it. Use it. You move on.
C: KEVIN
D: Hang on, we gotta talk about this.
C: MILTON
D: What's to talk? It's your wife, man. And she's very sick. And that's gotta come first. Are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind?
E: beat
C: KEVIN
D: You know what scares me? I quit the case. She gets better. And I hate her for it. I don't want to resent her, John. I've got a winner here. I gotta nail this fucker down, do it fast, and put it behind me. Just get it done. Then put all my energy into her.

N: Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement --
C: BROYGO
D: ... And when all that evidence is laid before you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude -- you will know -- that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought.
N: Done. The courtroom is silent. The jury liked him.
C: JUDGE POE
D: Mr. Lomax... We can break for lunch now, or you can do a stop and start...
E: checking his watch
C: KEVIN
D: If it's a choice, I'll go now. I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.
C: JUDGE POE
D: Proceed.
C: KEVIN
D: We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

C: KEVIN
D: The state is going all out here. They've got a whole team over there. They're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case. I need one thing from you. That's it. One thing. I need you to ask yourself, 'Is not liking this man reason enough to convict him of murder?' Enjoy your lunch. We'll talk again.

D: Listen to me like you've never listened to anybody before. I'm going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you. Because as long as you're out boning Melissa, you're not home killing your wife.

D: Let me put it this way, then: can you tell from a blood sample if the person were alive or dead?
C: TECHNICIAN
D: The victim? Of course not.
C: KEVIN
D: And there's a two hour window in which to place these murders.
C: TECHNICIAN

N: But someplace completely different. Older. Dark. Empty. Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out. FOOTSTEPS approaching... It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead. There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects. More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination. Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out. Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase.
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: I could've packed that up for you.
N: Kevin sits. If he loses his steel he'll drown. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 1/18/97 130.

C: KEVIN
D: Finish the story. Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in New York. There's a waiter in a restaurant. Finish the story.
E: off silence waiting
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: He talked to me. Nobody'd ever really talked to me before. Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, somebody takes an interest... Working so hard, putting himself through school, I'd never met anybody like that. Knew the Bible, every word, just knew it by heart. Every meal, there he was, at my ear and I just... I didn't want that week to ever end. But it did. He came to say goodbye, it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.' And that just stopped me cold because we'd spent that whole day at Bible study reading Matthew Ten and there was just no way for him to know about that, so I was... I took it as a sign. I let him in. And then everything was different. He was cruel. He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I'd die...
N: Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase. Mary Ann...
C: MRS. LOMAX
D: I promised right there if God would let me back into His grace I would never leave again. I prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened. There had to be a reason. And there was. It was you. You were my blessing. You were reason enough to endure anything. How much I love you.

E: O.S.
N: Milton appears out of nowhere. Walking past Kevin.
C: MILTON
D: ... I don't make things happen. Doesn't work like that. Free will -- it's like butterfly wings -- one touch and it never gets off the ground. I only set the stage. You pull your own strings.
N: Kevin has a gun -- Cullen's gun, in his hand --
C: KEVIN
D: What did you do to Mary Ann?
C: MILTON
D: A gun? In here?
C: KEVIN
D: What did you do to my wife?

D: Never lost a case. Why? Why? Because you're so fucking good? Yes. But why?
C: KEVIN
D: Because you're my father.
C: MILTON
D: Well, I'm a little more than that. Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?' 'It was a nice run, Kevin. Had to close out someday.'

D: Call me Dad.
C: KEVIN
D: Mary Ann, Barzoon, Weaver...
C: MILTON
D: Come on. You're not listening. Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope you're kidding. You could've saved her any time you liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here.
C: KEVIN
D: That's a lie.
C: MILTON
D: Hey, it's not that you didn't care for her, it's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else. Yourself.
C: KEVIN
D: What the hell do you know about love?
N: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 1/18/97 135.
C: MILTON
D: Bio-chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate. Don't be such a fucking chump. There's only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self- delusion. I told you to take care of your wife -- that the world would understand. And you made a choice. 'You know what scares me, John? I leave the case, she gets better and I hate her for it...' Remember?
E: sharply now
C: KEVIN
D: You set me up. It's entrapment.
C: MILTON
D: Who told you to pull out the stops for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the direction you took -- Snake handlers, Popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough -- whose ideas were those? And then Cullen -- knowing he's guilty -- seeing those pictures -- putting that lying bitch on the stand... What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was time to lose, right? You didn't think so.
C: KEVIN
D: That's my job. That's what I do!
C: MILTON
D: Exactly! Vanity is definitely my favorite sin. Self love. It's so basic. What a drug. Cheap, all-natural, and right at your fingertips. Pride. That's where you're strongest. And believe me, I understand. Work for someone else? -- Hey, I couldn't hack it. 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.'
E: gotcha
C: KEVIN

He gives you this extraordinary gift and then, I swear to you -- for his own amusement -- his own private, cosmic gag reel -- he sets the rules in opposition. It's the goof of all time. Look but don't touch. Touch but don't taste. Taste but don't swallow. And while you're jumping from one foot to the other he's laughing his sick fucking ass off! He's a tight-ass. He's a sadist.

S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
N: The mirror. And Kevin's face. As THUNDER ECHOES AWAY and becomes nothing more than a FLUSHING URINAL. We're back in Florida. Where we started. Kevin touches his face. His body. His head. He's alive. He touches the mirror. He's insane. He's here. It's now. WATER RUNNING in the sink.
C: REPORTER
D: It was a nice run. Kev. Had to close out someday. Nobody wins 'em all.
E: O.S. behind him
N: The Reporter exits. Kevin alone with the mirror and his reflection. And then it's over. He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Kevin walking through. His game face. A court officer opening the doors and --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY
N: Kevin entering. Standing there a moment. Searching for Heath in the back of the courtroom. He's not there. A single empty seat. Kevin moving quickly down the aisle. Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin comes in behind her. Embracing her. Holding her tightly to him with a fervor that we alone will understand.
C: MARY ANN
D: Honey, what are you doing? Are you okay?
E: quietly
N: Kevin nods. Smiles. Backs away. Into his seat. Gettys there beside him. Kevin will not look at him.
C: BAILIFF
D: All rise for the honorable Justice Garson Deeds.
N: The Judge enters. Takes his seat.
C: JUDGE
D: You're still under oath, young lady.
E: to Barbara MORE
C: JUDGE
D: Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
E: CONT'D to Kevin
C: KEVIN
D: Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry, but I can no longer represent my client. I need to be replaced as counsel.
N: Another silence. But this one isn't very long. There will be chaos in the courtroom. Gettys will freak out and the press will start running for the phones and the Judge will be banging that gavel, as we --
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: As the doors open and the chaos begins to spill into the hallway. Kevin trying to rush away with Mary Ann but right behind them --
C: REPORTER
D: Kevin! -- Hey! Listen, this story -- this is the one, pal -- this is the one you dream about --
E: catching up
C: KEVIN
D: There is no story.
C: REPORTER
D: Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis of conscience? You gotta be kidding. It's huge!
C: KEVIN
D: They're gonna disbar me, Larry. You can cover that.
C: MARY ANN
D: Can they do that?
C: REPORTER
D: Not when I get through with the story. You gotta talk, Kevin. You gotta gimme an exclusive.
E: still walking MORE
C: REPORTER
D: This is wire service. This is 'Sixty Minutes'. This is a story that needs to be told. It's you! You're a star!
E: CONT'D
C: KEVIN
D: Call me tomorrow.
C: REPORTER
D: You got it. First thing.
N: Kevin nods. Holding Mary Ann's hand as they escape.
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The Reporter watching them go for a moment. Then turning back.
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: (EFX) And as he does, his features change, transforming - - like that -- into Milton.
S: INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: It's Milton. Always there. And he smiles. And we FREEZE FRAME.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
