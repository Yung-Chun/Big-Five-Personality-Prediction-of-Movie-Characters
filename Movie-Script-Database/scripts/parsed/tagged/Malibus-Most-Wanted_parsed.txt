C: BILL
D: ... And so if you elect me governor, I promise to take care of California the same way I take care of my own family; with compassion, caring, kindness, and most of all, with an interest in everyone.

N: Bill is instantly flustered and TOM GIBBONS, Bill's campaign manager (African-American, but the soul of William F. Buckley) steps in front of Bill.
C: TOM
D: Thank you for all your questions, but we've run out of... Just then the ground shakes with a frightening RUMBLE. Everyone quiets down -- is it an earthquake? As the RUMBLE HITS again, the surface of the water in the koi pond ripples, a la Jurassic Park. Reporters look around anxiously as another RUMBLE HITS; Bill's face falls as he sees...
N: The Escalade rolls into the driveway, hopping up and down on its amped-up hydraulics like something from Crenshaw Boulevard on a Friday night. The rear doors pop open and MOCHA (a.k.a. CHADWICK VAN PELT), dressed head to toe in hip-hop gear, steps out of the passenger side.

E: CONT'D

D: How the hell did this happen?
C: BILL
D: I have no idea. I thought he was out of town.

N: Brad holds out his fist and Bill reluctantly hits it. On his way out, Brad chest-bumps Tom.
C: TOM
D: Bill, you've got to shut this down, now. Tell Brad he can't work with you, period.
C: BILL
D: No, no. I love his enthusiasm... It's just a little misguided. There must be something he can do for the campaign, where he can't hurt us.

C: TOM
D: What are you going to do?
C: BILL
D: Set up an appointment with my shrink. CUT TO:

N: Brad leaves, slamming the door behind him.
C: BESS
D: What can we do, doctor?
C: DR. FELDMAN
D: Well, his lack of parental guidance left Brad wide open to outside influence, allowing hip- hop culture to firmly imprint on his psyche.
C: BILL
D: Do you think we can bring him back?
C: DR. FELDMAN
D: I don't know. This is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia I've ever seen.

C: JEN
D: We hire actors to play gangsters.
C: TOM
D: They car-jack Brad, then take him on a 'tour' of the 'hood... give him a little taste of what thug life's really like. It might just scare the black out of him.
N: Tom gets strange looks from everyone.
C: AFRICAN-AMERICAN AIDE
D: Excuse me?
C: TOM
D: Look, I'm as down as the next brother, guy... fellah. I grew up in Compton, okay? But let's get over the P.C. thing and face facts. Unless we do something soon, Brad's gonna cost us this election.
N: The team all nods.
C: BILL
D: I don't know... it sounds so drastic.
C: TOM
D: Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean, what's he gonna do for a living, rap? They all chuckle. Bill sighs.
C: BILL
D: Who do we get for the gangsters?

D: Fellas, instead of thinking of yourselves as what set you're from, or what crew you're rolling with, why can't you both be brothers. What do you say?
E: V.O.
C: SEAN
D: I guess we never thought of each other like that.

D: Me neither, dawg. PJ and Sean think is over, nod and shake hands.

E: V.O. turning to camera
C: BILL
D: If we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go.
E: V.O.
N: Bill flies by, obviously from an O.S. trampoline, and soars over the gangbangers for a monster dunk. Freeze on: the two awestruck "gangbangers."

E: incredulous
C: TOM
D: Don't think you can handle it?

C: TOM

C: SEAN
D: So we hold him for ransom?
C: TOM
D: Right. But when you see him acting ghetto and all, it pisses you off so much, you tour him around the 'hood to show him what things are really like. I had my guys brainstorm a few ideas...

C: BRAD
D: Keep the change.
C: KOREAN GUY
D: Thank you very much. Come again. As Brad looks out to make sure PJ and Sean haven't seen anything, the Korean Guy sticks the receipt in between two of the 40s. Unaware, Brad gathers his stuff and heads to the door.

C: A47 CONTINUED: A47
D: He is then dragged up onto the stage. He misinterprets the ANTAGONIZING CHANTS as encouragement and tries to high-five the crowd -- no takers. The MC and Young Dre laugh at him.
C: YOUNG DRE

D: What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white?
C: BILL
D: It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore.
C: BRAD
D: You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response.

Everyone looks at the MUSKET, then suddenly it EXPLODES and a rusty musket ball FIRES OUT, slamming Monster in the middle of her Kevlar breastplate. She flies back and slams into the wall, causing her spear gun to fire -- a SPEAR SHOOTS OUT and lands directly into Brad's left ass cheek. Brad howls and drops the MISSILE
