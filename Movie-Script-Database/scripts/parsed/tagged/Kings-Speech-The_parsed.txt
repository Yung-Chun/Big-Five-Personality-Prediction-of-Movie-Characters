M: THE KING'S SPEECH
M: Written by
M: David Seidler
M: OPEN ON:
S: INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)
N: A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs - bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet Volunteer". A head emerges. White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels.
S: INT. DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY
N: The ritual continues with crisp military precision. CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp, thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown. This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white shirt. Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted. Mirror-polished boots are laced tight. Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received. Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions. Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted. Polished buttons are fastened. Multi-coloured collar clasped shut. White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair. PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked. Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 3.
C: BERTIE
D: You look like a Christmas tree.
N: He smiles wanly.
S: EXT. INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY
N: THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill. Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess. Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos. Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave. Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and four, wave back from their nursery window.
S: INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY
N: Bertie nervously lights a cigarette. Elizabeth pats his hand.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't rain.
N: BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of the day. A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants. REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back. The first drops splatter against the glass. Elizabeth sighs.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Never trust the wireless.
E: CONT'D
N: Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour, which segues into a GARGLING sound. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 4.
S: INT. BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY
N: A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the control room. The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three... two...
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This is the BBC National and World Programmes taking you to Wembley Stadium.
N: He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones. There's no higher creature in the vocal world.
S: EXT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY
N: ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas hiding the spectators from view. Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded chairs with the other dignitaries. They are: KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and uniform, accompanied by his wife. QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame. DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed, balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority. WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition. STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed. His hair, as always, parted down the middle. NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin, lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk. A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening, even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a blow. Elizabeth sees his terror. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 5.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Why wasn't he told?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Ten million people listening around the world, Mam. Possibly more. His brother, and father, have been broadcasting since last year.
E: as though Bertie didn't exist
N: The King, growing impatient, hisses:
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Get on with it. Show what you're made of!
N: Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots, chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.
C: BERTIE
D: Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.
N: It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter. A man who cannot speak in public. Lang whispers to Churchill. When Lang whispers, everyone can hear.
C: COSMO LANG
D: I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage for all the world. And on such an important occasion.
N: Lang really is a piece of work. For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this point on in the script.
C: BERTIE
D: No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was standing before you today.
N: POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going to be a torment for him, and his audience.
S: INT. BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY
N: A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio. Everyone listening intently. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 6.
C: BERTIE
D: Be that as it may...my brother David is attending to other duties in the furthest parts of this vast Empire...
E: ON RADIO stuttering profoundly
N: The radio falls silent. Eyes widen in concern.
S: EXT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY
N: Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked. He knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for public life. Elizabeth is devastated.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Just needs more practice.
S: EXT. HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY
N: TRACKING SHOT - rain splatters on brass plaques denoting Dr This or Dr That, specialists in various maladies. Halt at a plaque that reads: LIONEL LOGUE, SPEECH SPECIALIST.
S: INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY
N: Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all. The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her features. She waits. Coughs. No response. Calls imperiously:
C: ELIZABETH
D: Are you there?
N: From behind a door:
C: LIONEL
D: In the lav.
E: O.S.
N: Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed, and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 7.
C: LIONEL
D: "How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Pardon?
C: LIONEL
D: Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist.
N: He offers to shake hands. She doesn't take it, even though she's gloved.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'd be more comfortable in your office.
E: with sang froid
C: LIONEL
D: That's for clients. Where's Mister J?
C: ELIZABETH
D: He doesn't know I'm here.
C: LIONEL
D: That's not a promising start.
C: ELIZABETH
D: My husband's seen everyone. They were all useless. He's given up hope.
C: LIONEL
D: A bit premature.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Because he hasn't seen you?
N: Lionel doesn't disgree.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You're very sure of yourself.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Of course my husband wants to be cured! His position requires public speaking upon occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement may grow more frequent.
C: LIONEL
D: He should change jobs. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 8.
C: ELIZABETH
D: He can't.
C: LIONEL
D: Indentured servitude?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Something of that nature.
C: LIONEL
D: Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history. I'll make a frank appraisal.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Doctor...
N: Logue tries to object but she over-rides.
C: ELIZABETH
D: ...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'. You must come to us.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules.
N: The lady lifts her veil.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Perhaps you'll make an exception?
N: He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet refuses to be intimidated.
C: LIONEL
D: I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
C: ELIZABETH
D: A name used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard.
C: LIONEL
D: I'm considered the enemy?
C: ELIZABETH
D: You will be, should you continue to be un- obliging. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 9.
C: LIONEL
D: For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality. That process takes place in my consultation room. No exceptions.
C: ELIZABETH
D: In which case... I should have kept my pledge. I promised my husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure." I've wasted your time. And mine.
E: re-lowering her veil
N: She exits, closing the door firmly behind her.
C: LIONEL
D: Bloody hell, I buggered that.
N: WACK! The sound of something solid meeting leather.
S: EXT. SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a well-known fixture locally. Some lads are playing footie. One of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and entering a modest brownstone.
S: INT. LOGUE'S ENTRYWAY AND STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON
N: As Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys - VALENTINE, IAN, and PETER - with handkerchiefs tied around the lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords.
C: VALENTINE
D: Stand and deliver!
C: LIONEL
D: `ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?!
E: falling into the game
N: The boys scream with delight and a sword fight ensues - Lionel using his brolly.
C: LIONEL
D: Beware, Highwaymen, or I'll run yee through.
E: CONT'D
C: PETER
D: We're Swagmen, not Highwaymen, Dad. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 10.
C: LIONEL
D: Oh. Beware, jolly Swagmen, I'll skewer yer gizzards.
E: then
N: Lionel wife - MYRTLE - appears at the head of the stairs; a sweet-faced, down-to-earth woman.
C: MYRTLE
D: You'll all hang from the gallows if you don't come for tea.
C: LIONEL
D: Boys, I think we'd best go up.
S: INT. LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: Logue, Myrtle, and the boys are finishing at the table.
C: LIONEL
D: Had a visit from a lady today.
C: MYRTLE
D: Another spoiled silly?
C: VALENTINE
D: May we be excused?
C: LIONEL
D: You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
C: THE BOYS
D: Thanks, dad!
E: grinning
C: LIONEL
D: And mum.
C: THE BOYS
D: And mum!
N: They start to leave.
C: MYRTLE
D: Take your plates.
N: The boys grabs their plates and exit. After a moment...
C: MYRTLE
D: No wonder about the silly. You're so good at what you do. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 11.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: At what I do. Twas a Lady with a capital L.
E: then, deliberately being `theatrical'
C: MYRTLE
D: Oh, Lionel, that'd get us home in grand style wouldn't it?!
C: LIONEL
D: She came on behalf of her husband. Which is not the proper way. I told her I was fully booked.
N: Myrtle is clearly disappointed
C: LIONEL
D: She was...too high and mighty. Know what I mean.
E: CONT'D
N: She does. There's an unspoken code between them.
C: MYRTLE
D: We wouldn't want that.
N: Covers her letdown.
C: MYRTLE
D: Hard to feel sorry for that sort.
E: CONT'D
N: Silence, then:
C: LIONEL
D: Had a call. Wish me luck?
C: MYRTLE
D: Course, Lionel. Loads and loads.
S: INT. CHILDREN'S NURSERY, 145 PICCADILLY - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled on a bearskin rug reading "Peter Pan" to the girls.
C: ELIZABETH
D: "Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown."
N: Bertie enters, handsome in a tuxedo. Elizabeth closes the book.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Tomorrow, Chapter IV, `The Flight'. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 12.
E: CONT'D
N: The two little girls clap with joy.
C: MARGARET ROSE
D: Oh, to fly away!
C: BERTIE
D: Weren't they lucky.
N: Within his family, Bertie's stutter is virtually absent.
C: LILIBET
D: One would have to learn to fly properly of course.
C: MARGARET ROSE
D: Now a Daddy story!
C: BERTIE
D: Can I be a penguin instead?
N: He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred.
C: LILIBET
D: The horsie story, please.
C: BERTIE
D: Ah well.
N: Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor
T: impediment, and it fades.
C: BERTIE
D: Once upon a time there were two horsies. A white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The white horse said "neigh". The black horse said, "neigh". The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the end of the story. Now off to bed.
E: CONT'D
N: As the girls exit:
C: LILIBET
D: A silly story really. But Father tells it rather well.
N: The girls have gone. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 13.
C: BERTIE
D: David called. He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Will she be there?
C: BERTIE
D: I suppose.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Seriously?
C: BERTIE
D: Seriously, she'll be there.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I think I meant... is David serious?
C: BERTIE
D: About our coming?
C: ELIZABETH
D: About her!
C: BERTIE
D: A married American? Twice divorced? He can't be.
C: ELIZABETH
D: She can.
S: INT. STAGE OF A LONDON THEATRE - NEW DAY
N: Movements behind a curtain.
C: MUFFLED VOICE
D: Now?
E: UNSEEN
N: From the auditorium:
C: DIRECTOR
D: Now!
N: Someone pushes through a gap. Its Lionel.
C: LIONEL
D: "Now..."
N: Falters, begins again. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 14.
C: LIONEL
D: "Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York..."
E: CONT'D
N: His elocution is crisp and flawless. His acting, however, is unconvincing.
C: LIONEL
D: "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths..."
E: CONT'D
C: DIRECTOR
D: Thank you. Beautiful diction...but I don't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
E: interrupts crisply
N: Lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity.
C: LIONEL
D: What do you suggest?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction.
N: Crushed, Lionel retreats behind the curtain.
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW EVENING
N: Cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights. On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands are beginning to fill. The King's voice is heard:
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare it square in the eye, and talk to it as you would to any decent Englishman.
E: O.S.
S: INT. THE KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING
N: The King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin. Both men are uniformed for a state occasion. Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 15.
C: BERTIE
D: I d-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can.
N: In the presence of his father, Bertie's stuttering returns in full form, his breathing short and shallow, the muscles in spasms.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Show who's in command. If you don't, this devilish device will change everything. Used to be, all a King had to do was look reasonable in uniform and not fall off his horse. Now we must creep cap in hand into people's homes that smell of boiled cabbage, and speak nicely to them. We're reduced to that lowest, basest of all creatures...we've become...actors! Don't give me a look of defeated pathos. This is a family crisis!
C: BERTIE
D: Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.
N: His father shoots Bertie a surprised look. Does the lad have a brain after all?
C: KING GEORGE V
D: We're the oldest, most successful, corporation in the world and sitting on thrones is our business! But any moment now we may be out of work. Your brother came to me the other day, livid a certain lady has been refused an invitation to my Silver Jubilee. I pointed out she wasn't a lady and most definitely wasn't his wife.
C: BERTIE
D: What did David say?
C: KING GEORGE V
D: She made him sublimely happy. I said: that was probably because she was sleeping with him. "I give you my word we've never had immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear your friendship with this woman is an absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said. "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my honour" he said. Stared straight at his father... and lied.
C: BERTIE
D: Oh my brother... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 16.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's friend, Oswald Mosley? His black-shirt British Union of Fascists are marching through London. Hitler terrorizing half of Europe, Stalin the other half. Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss? You?
N: A red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning blinks.
C: BERTIE
D: What're you going to say?
C: KING GEORGE V
D: The usual guff. The Archbishop writes it. My people love to hear me say it. Spoken fluently, of course.
N: They're interrupted by the entrance of the BBC News Reader and Technicians.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: That's the chap who taught me how to use this contraption. You touch your chin with your thumb and the `thing' with the end of your little finger. Splendid fellow.
E: CONT'D
N: SQUISH. Assisted by the Technicians, the News Reader sprays his throat.
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is the BBC, broadcasting direct from Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the Royal Silver Jubilee. His Majesty: King George the Fifth.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: "I can only say to you, my very very dear people, that the Queen and I thank you from the depths of our hearts for all the loyalty and - may I say so? - the love with which this day and always you have surrounded us. I dedicate myself anew to your service for all the years that may still be given to me."
E: to the mike
N: The News Reader, terribly moved, whispers to his Technicians: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 17.
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: That's how a King speaks. I showed HM how to do it.
E: adds with splendid false modesty
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
N: The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes tumultuous.
S: EXT. BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
N: The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.
C: BERTIE
D: They didn't come to see us, Father.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Pretend.
C: BERTIE
D: Where's David?
C: KING GEORGE V
D: Bedding his American whore. Come, join the fun! You'll have to do a lot more of this. I'm sending him to the Midlands. With all the factory noise they won't hear a word he says.
E: aside to Elizabeth
N: The King goes back to waving. Elizabeth is stunned at the prospect. The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.
S: INT. MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY
N: Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief. Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals. The machinery halts, the factory falls silent. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 18. At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries Bertie forward.
C: BERTIE
D: What's needed is cooperation...
N: Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory brings Bertie's stutter back in full form.
C: BERTIE
D: ...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...
E: CONT'D
N: One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out.
S: EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS DRIVING THRU HYDE PARK - NEW DAY
N: THE ROYAL STANDARD fluttering.
S: INT. AUSTIN PRINCESS - DAY
N: Elizabeth and Bertie in the back.
C: BERTIE
D: Is this necessary?
C: ELIZABETH
D: You know perfectly well.
N: As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads: PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"
C: ELIZABETH
D: Neglects to tell them what must be done, how its to be done, and who's to do it.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: David has `the touch'. They adore him.
N: As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's inside. Some point.
C: BERTIE
D: I'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 19.
C: ELIZABETH
D: There's no receptionist.
N: Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.
C: ELIZABETH
D: The Johnsons.
E: CONT'D loudly
N: From the inner office.
C: LIONEL
D: Not finished yet.
E: O.S.
N: Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav.
C: BERTIE
D: How'd you find this physician?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Classifieds; next to "Saucy model, Shepherd's Market".
E: poker-faced
N: Bertie smiles despite his mood.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Comes highly recommended. Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor. Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
E: CONT'D realizes
C: BERTIE
D: I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm not sure he wants to see you.
N: The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman - ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She retreats rapidly back into the consulting room.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Perhaps this was a mistake.
E: CONT'D
N: After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be properly formal, and stutters:
C: ANNA
D: You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
C: BERTIE
D: I'm not actually Mr ... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 20.
C: ANNA
D: I know. Dr Logue says...
E: whispers, terrified then to Elizabeth
C: LIONEL
D: Lionel!
E: O.S.
C: ANNA
D: Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it being a pleasant day, take a stroll. Was that alright?
E: to the consultation room
C: LIONEL
D: Bloody marvellous.
E: O.S.
C: ANNA
D: Thank you...Lionel.
E: choking up
N: Anna flees quickly.
C: LIONEL
D: Mr. Johnson, do come in.
E: O.S.
N: The Yorks look at each other.
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY
N: A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey and smoky blue.
C: BERTIE
D: My wife's favorite colours.
N: Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns.
C: LIONEL
D: Glad we have something in common.
N: Bertie's head bangs into one of the models.
C: LIONEL
D: My lads build them. Make yourself comfortable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 21.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: Please...
C: LIONEL
D: What?
C: BERTIE
D: You're too close. Five paces is the rule of thumb.
C: LIONEL
D: That might be difficult in this office.
N: Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.
C: LIONEL
D: Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner. The perfect woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: I can't discuss that.
C: LIONEL
D: What can we talk about?
C: BERTIE
D: That's better. When speaking with a Royal one waits for the Royal to start the conversation and chose the topic.
C: LIONEL
D: Your joking. That won't work here.
C: BERTIE
D: I admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time.
N: Silence. They stare at each other.
C: BERTIE
D: You call this making me comfortable?
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: You call this being forthcoming?
C: BERTIE
D: Aren't you interested in treating me? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 22.
C: LIONEL
D: Only if you're interested in being cured.
N: More silence.
C: LIONEL
D: Cuppa tea?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: No thank you.
C: LIONEL
D: I need one.
N: Turns on the hot plate.
C: LIONEL
D: Any idea what you're letting yourself in for?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor Logue.
C: LIONEL
D: Call me Lionel.
C: BERTIE
D: I prefer Doctor.
C: LIONEL
D: I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far worse. What shall I call you?
C: BERTIE
D: The Duke of York is appropriate.
C: LIONEL
D: Oh please.
C: BERTIE
D: Your Royal Highness then.
C: LIONEL
D: Much more informal.
C: BERTIE
D: Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur? George? I've lots of names to choose from.
C: LIONEL
D: How about Bertie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 23.
C: BERTIE
D: Only my family uses that.
E: flushes
C: LIONEL
D: That's what I'll call you then. We must be true equals.
C: BERTIE
D: If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be at home with my family and no-one would give a damn.
N: Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.
C: LIONEL
D: Don't do that.
N: Bertie gives him an astonished look.
C: LIONEL
D: Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: My physicians say it's good for stuttering, relaxes the throat.
C: LIONEL
D: They're idiots.
C: BERTIE
D: They've all been knighted.
C: LIONEL
D: Makes it official then. House rules: no smoking.
C: BERTIE
D: I thought here we're "equal".
C: LIONEL
D: As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate these are my digs and here I rule. No smoking. What was your earliest memory?
C: BERTIE
D: I beg your pardon?
C: LIONEL
D: First recollection of the world? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 24.
C: BERTIE
D: I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
E: stutter growing in intensity
C: LIONEL
D: Why're you here then?
C: BERTIE
D: Because I bloody well stutter! And you bloody well can't fix it!!!
E: exploding
C: LIONEL
D: Temper.
C: BERTIE
D: One of my numerous faults.
C: LIONEL
D: Do you stutter when you think?
C: BERTIE
D: Don't be ridiculous.
C: LIONEL
D: One of my many faults. How about when you talk to yourself?
C: BERTIE
D: I don't talk to myself!
C: LIONEL
D: Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie.
C: BERTIE
D: Stop calling me that!
C: LIONEL
D: Shan't call you anything else.
C: BERTIE
D: Then we shan't speak!
N: Silence. The jug has boiled. Lionel makes himself a cup of tea.
C: BERTIE
D: Must I pay for this?
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 25.
C: BERTIE
D: Of course not!
C: LIONEL
D: Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture.
C: BERTIE
D: When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!
C: LIONEL
D: Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
C: BERTIE
D: Easy money. You're on.
E: bitterly
C: LIONEL
D: See your shilling then.
C: BERTIE
D: Royals don't carry money.
C: LIONEL
D: How convenient.
N: Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.
C: LIONEL
D: I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: If there is a next time.
C: LIONEL
D: Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.
N: During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.
C: BERTIE
D: I certainly can't read The Bard.
C: LIONEL
D: `Easy money'.
N: Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.
C: BERTIE
D: "To be or not to be, That is the question. Whether it is wiser..." There! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 26.
N: Reaches for the coin.
C: LIONEL
D: Not so fast.
C: BERTIE
D: I proved I can't read.
C: LIONEL
D: You proved you can't listen.
N: Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones. Bertie doesn't want to take them.
C: LIONEL
D: A princely bob is at stake.
E: CONT'D
N: Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial. LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music stops.
C: BERTIE
D: You're playing music.
C: LIONEL
D: I'm aware.
C: BERTIE
D: How can I hear what I'm saying?!
C: LIONEL
D: Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
C: BERTIE
D: You're not well acquainted with Royal princes, are you?
C: LIONEL
D: I want to demonstrate that when you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus proving your impediment is not innate.
C: BERTIE
D: Rubbish.
N: Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His lips move as he reads, but all that can be heard is the music. Finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the music ceases. He reaches for the coin, but Logue snatches it.
C: BERTIE
D: I was terrible. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 27.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Flawless.
C: BERTIE
D: I know how I sound!
C: LIONEL
D: Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
C: BERTIE
D: I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
N: Logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it to Bertie.
C: LIONEL
D: Souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter.
N: Bertie glances at the record. POV - the label: HMV His Master's Voice.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Elizabeth, trying to be gracious, has been cooling her heels with a working class MOTHER and her young son WILLIE.
C: LIONEL
D: I'm finished with your husband.
C: BERTIE
D: I'm finished with Doctor Logue!
C: LIONEL
D: Lionel.
N: They exit curtly.
C: WILLIE'S MUM
D: Was that...?
C: LIONEL
D: Certainly not. How's it going, mate?
C: WILLIE'S MUM
D: William isn't trying hard enough.
C: LIONEL
D: Willie? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 28.
C: WILLIE
D: Ddddddoooing ggggggggood.
C: LIONEL
D: Why am I not surprised?
S: INT./EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS ON LONDON STREET - DAY
N: The Yorks are being driven home. As they pass Speakers' Corner, Oswald Mosley's blackshirt British Union of Fascists are out in full force.
C: BERTIE
D: The bloody man did parlour tricks and cheated me out of a shilling.
N: In fury he rolls down the window and is about to throw away the record. Elizabeth stops him.
C: ELIZABETH
D: They'll see.
N: He quickly rolls up the window. The sound of an approaching aircraft engine.
S: EXT. PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - NEW DAY
N: A grass strip cut into the moors. Bertie waits beside a shooting break, the stiff breeze whipping his coat, as a small plane lands and taxis. The cockpit canopy slides back and the pilot leaps out, removing his leather helmet and goggles, revealing hair gleaming like gold, perfect teeth flashing a dentist's smile. This is - DAVID - the Prince of Wales, Prince Charming, the media's darling, a sun god descended from the skies accustomed to being worshipped by all.
C: DAVID
D: Hello, B-b-bertie. B-b-been waiting long?
E: teasing with a false stutter
C: BERTIE
D: Three days. Where've you been?
N: Bertie stutters badly in the presence of his brother.
C: DAVID
D: I was busy.
C: BERTIE
D: So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 29.
C: DAVID
D: She'll recover.
N: Bertie shoots him a look.
C: BERTIE
D: Father won't.
S: INT./EXT. SHOOTING BREAK ON SANDRINGHAM LANE - CONTINUOUS
N: David drives. Badly.
C: DAVID
D: He's doing this on purpose.
C: BERTIE
D: Dying?!
C: DAVID
D: Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a quickie divorce and we're going to make our marriage a fait accompli. As an act of pure spite, Father's trying to depart prematurely in order to complicate matters.
N: The break almost careens off the lane.
C: BERTIE
D: You believe that?
C: DAVID
D: Wallis explained it. She's terribly clever.
S: INT. KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - DAY
N: The King is propped up in bed, wrapped in his favorite faded Tibetan dressing gown, hooked to an oxygen tank. He's surrounded by his wife, Queen Mary, his two eldest sons, his Secretary - CLIVE WIGRAM - his personal physician - DR DAWSON, and a NURSE. Wigram presents a tray with papers and pen.
C: WIGRAM
D: The Instruments Of Succession, Your Majesty.
N: The King is so feeble he can barely make his mark. Glares at David.
C: KING GEORGE V
D: You're next? God help us. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 30.
N: He waves them out of the room, but beckons Wigram to come close, and whispers something in his ear.
C: WIGRAM
D: At the appropriate moment, Your Majesty.
N: The King nods.
S: INT. DINING HALL, SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT
N: Clear soup is being served at the immense table. Places set for five, but only Bertie and his mother are seated. The clinking of silver and china. Finally:
C: QUEEN MARY
D: I want my jewelry divided equally. Elizabeth gets first choice. She's not greedy.
C: BERTIE
D: May I remind you, you're not the one who's dying, Mother.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: Where are the others?
C: BERTIE
D: Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making arrangements.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: What sort of arrangements?
C: BERTIE
D: They didn't say.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: And David? Fetch him.
S: INT. LIBRARY, SANDRINGHAM - CONTINUOUS
N: David, hunched over a table, appears to be sobbing. He doesn't hear Bertie's discreet knock. Seeing his brother crying, Bertie is deeply moved, puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. David pulls away as though touched by a leper and covers the receiver in his hand.
C: DAVID
D: I'm on with Wallis! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 31.
E: as though Bertie didn't exist MORE
C: DAVID
D: I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy. Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately. Til then, sweet love. Wally misses me terribly
E: CONT'D kisses the phone hangs up
C: BERTIE
D: Mother says you're late for supper.
N: David glares at a clock.
C: DAVID
D: Clocks set five minutes in advance, so as not to be late. When I'm King I shall set them back!
S: INT. DINING HALL, SANDRINGHAM - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie and David enter to find Wigram and Dawson with their mother.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: Lord Wigram has requested permission to order the coffin.
N: Nobody wants to take responsibility. The Queen looks to David. He nods. They're interrupted by a BUTLER.
C: BULTER
D: The Archbishop of Canterbury.
C: DAVID
D: Who the hell invited him?!
C: QUEEN MARY
D: Nobody. Don't swear.
C: DAVID
D: Somebody should bloody well dis-invite him. Father swears.
C: WIGRAM
D: That would be rash.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: You're not your father. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 32.
C: WIGRAM
D: His Grace can be a persistent enemy. We need friends.
N: David knows he's referring to the Simpson affair.
C: DAVID
D: Show the toad in.
N: Lang is already sweeping towards them.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Whatever can I contribute in this dreadful hour?!
S: INT. LIBRARY, SANDRINGHAM - LATER
N: The men are huddled, with cigars and port, composing a news release. Bertie acts as secretary.
C: COSMO LANG
D: "Tranquilly"? "Serenely"?
C: WIGRAM
D: Peacefully.
N: The others nod.
C: COSMO LANG
D: "The King's life is moving peacefully to its..." "Termination"?
C: WIGRAM
D: Close.
C: COSMO LANG
D: "...to its close."
C: WIGRAM
D: As a man of letters you're heaven-sent to assist in the editing of our press communique.
N: Lang beams.
C: WIGRAM
D: I'll telephone this through to the BBC and alert The Times to hold the morning edition. The problem is...if we're to keep to schedule...time is running out.
E: CONT'D
N: The clock is approaching midnight. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 33.
C: DAVID
D: Is my father late for death?
C: WIGRAM
D: We wouldn't want the news delivered by the disreputable afternoon press, would we?
N: The brothers look at him. He expains:
C: COSMO LANG
D: Who knows what sensational side issues those tabloids might report.
C: DAWSON
D: Perhaps a peaceful termination?
N: All eyes on David.
S: INT. KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT
N: The nurse looks aghast as Dr Dawson administers an injection.
C: DAWSON
D: Three quarters of a gram of morphia and a gram of cocaine injected into the distended jugular vein.
C: NURSE
D: No! that's...
C: DAWSON
D: You may leave.
N: She does so, sobbing. Everyone watches silently as the King's breathing slows, the twitching jugular subsides, then all movement ceases. Dawson takes the pulse, and consults his watch. David sets the hand of the room's big clock back by five minutes.
C: DAWSON
D: Time of expiration, 11:55 pm. On schedule.
E: CONT'D
N: Queen Mary curtsies in homage to the new King, taking her eldest son's hand and kissing it. When she looks up...her eyes are chilling.
C: QUEEN MARY
D: Long live the King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 34.
S: INT. BERTIE'S STUDY - NIGHT
N: Bertie, in despair and grief, has been describing to Elizabeth what happened.
C: BERTIE
D: The look in mother's eyes, it was...ghastly.
N: He notices something on his desk, the record Logue made. POV: the label - His Master's Voice - stares up at him. He releases his emotions in an outburst of anger.
C: BERTIE
D: What's this bloody thing doing here?!
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Bertie...
C: BERTIE
D: The man was a total fraud!
N: He picks up the record and is about to smash it against the edge of his desk, then realizes the mess that would make and tosses it into a waste paper basket. Then changes his mind.
C: BERTIE
D: Would you like to hear?
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Not particularly.
C: BERTIE
D: Well I think you should. You should know what goes on. Telling me he could help me read flawlessly. Lying bastard! Listen to this babble!
N: Bertie takes the record from the trash and walks to a Victrola stand, lifts the arm, places the steel needle, expecting to hear his stuttering voice. Instead, what he hears is flawless and flowing:
C: BERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE
D: "To be, or not to be, - that is the question: - Whether `tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them?" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 35.
E: the needle sticks MORE
C: BERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE
D: "...sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? And by opposing end them? And by opposing..."
E: CONT'D
N: Bertie lifts the needle. He and his wife stare at each other; there are tears in her eyes. The ROAR OF A HUGE delirious crowd is heard, growing in volume. The roar becomes chillingly recognizable: "Zeig Heil! Zeig Heil! Zeig Heil!" GO TO BLACK: Hitler, giving one of his mass rally speeches, continues. The brass numbers 10 appears on the blackness. It is:
S: EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET - NEW NIGHT
N: The black front door of the Prime Minister's residence. The Fuhrer's tirade continues as CAMERA moves through the door into 10 Downing Street itself.
S: INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: CAMERA explores the dwelling, during which Hitler grows louder and more shrill, until:
S: INT. BALDWIN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
N: The glowing light of an illuminated dial of a radio, listened to by Churchill and Baldwin. They wear black armbands.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Turn that devil off!
N: The hysteria stops.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: If only one could do that so easily in real life.
E: CONT'D
C: BALDWIN
D: Chamberlain thinks that Hitler can be reasoned with.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Neville is an old woman. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 36.
C: BALDWIN
D: That's the direction its going, Winston. You're out of step.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: We'll see who trips and falls.
C: BALDWIN
D: Enough pleasantries. I've asked you here because you seem to be the only sensible member of the King's camp.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Nice of you to say so, Stanley.
C: BALDWIN
D: Is he willing to be reasonable?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Depends on the definition.
C: BALDWIN
D: Has he seen the light?
E: bluntly
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: He has.
N: Baldwin brightens.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Our Monarch basks in the warming rays of a celestial orb. Her name is Wally.
E: CONT'D
N: Baldwin's face clouds once again.
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY
N: A headline screams: HITLER RATTLES SABRE. Lionel is at his desk reading the newspaper as his sons sprawl on the floor building a model airplane.
C: VALENTINE
D: Dad?
C: LIONEL
D: Mmmm?
C: VALENTINE
D: Time for a Shake, dad. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 37.
C: LIONEL
D: You sure?
E: pleased
C: THE BOYS
D: Shake! Shake! Shake!
N: Clearly this is a much loved ritual. Lionel disappears into a closet.
C: IAN
D: Bet its the Scottish Play.
C: VALENTINE
D: Othello!
C: PETER
D: Perhaps something with Falstaff?
N: Ominous thumps within the closet. LIONEL (FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET) "Art thou afeard?"
C: THE BOYS
D: Caliban!
N: Lionel lumbers out of the closet, a pillow stuffed into his jacket to create a monstrous hunchback. His acting, performed just for his children, is quite magical.
C: LIONEL
D: "Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again."
N: The lads are enthralled. The DOOR BELL RINGS. Lionel is not expecting anyone.
S: EXT. ENTRANCE TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY
N: The Austin Princess waits at the curb. Bertie is at the door. He rings the BELL again. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 38.
C: BERTIE'S VOICE
D: Doctor Logue?
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Lionel is stunned, covers:
C: LIONEL
D: Must be a tradesman. Off you go, lads. Mum should be home from work.
N: The boys gather their things, deposit the model plane on a chair, stow the building materials in a box, and exit the back way. Lionel goes to the door, but doesn't open it.
C: BERTIE'S VOICE
D: Logue...?
N: Logue, expressionless, doesn't respond.
S: EXT. ENTRANCE TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie is torn: part of him wants to flee, yet he desperately needs to be let in. He knows what must be done. This is a huge step for him.
C: BERTIE
D: Lionel...it's Bertie.
N: The door opens.
C: LIONEL
D: My condolences. I didn't expect you.
C: BERTIE
D: Thank you. I didn't expect to be here. May I come in?
C: LIONEL
D: No.
C: BERTIE
D: What?
C: LIONEL
D: My wife doesn't think it's a good idea.
C: BERTIE
D: Your wife?
C: LIONEL
D: Myrtle. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 39.
C: BERTIE
D: Myrtle? Myrtle's never met me. I've never met Myrtle. May we discuss Myrtle in private? Its not proper talking about our women on the street.
N: Lonel gives him a look, but lets him him.
S: INT. WAITING ROOM TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
N: As they enter Bertie notices:
C: BERTIE
D: What happened to your shoulder?
N: Lionel hastily removes the pillow, tosses it away.
C: LIONEL
D: Sore back.
C: BERTIE
D: What's your Myrtle got to do with me? Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either, but here I am.
C: LIONEL
D: That woman has style.
C: BERTIE
D: Which is why she dislikes you. You're far too familiar. May we discuss this properly?
E: referring to the consultation room
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: They enter:
C: LIONEL
D: You look dreadful.
C: BERTIE
D: Another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're too close.
C: LIONEL
D: But you're not Royal in this room. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 40.
C: BERTIE
D: Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you.
N: He starts to sit.
C: LIONEL
D: Not there!
N: CRUNCH. A model airplane was nestling in the armchair.
C: LIONEL
D: Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your lads I'll buy a new one.
N: Lionel takes out the box of model building gear the boys left.
C: LIONEL
D: You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So, Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's death?
N: Bertie is silent.
C: LIONEL
D: Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you bastard!
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: What was he angry about?
C: LIONEL
D: I was a great disappointment.
C: BERTIE
D: Thought he'd be proud of you.
C: LIONEL
D: So did I.
C: BERTIE
D: A man of stature?
C: LIONEL
D: A clerk.
C: BERTIE
D: Oh. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 41.
E: pause MORE
C: BERTIE
D: I was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together." Couldn't say that to my face. Your mother?
E: CONT'D pause then
C: LIONEL
D: Coughed herself to death when I was young.
C: BERTIE
D: Oh.
C: LIONEL
D: I remember going to the theatre with her. Not real theatre...traveling players.
C: BERTIE
D: I've been to Australia.
C: LIONEL
D: Not where I lived.
C: BERTIE
D: My brother. That's why I'm here.
E: blurts
C: LIONEL
D: What's he done?
C: BERTIE
D: Can't say.
C: LIONEL
D: I'm going home now.
C: BERTIE
D: You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh...
N: His jaw and throat muscles constrict.
C: LIONEL
D: Try singing it.
C: BERTIE
D: Pardon?
C: LIONEL
D: Know any songs?
C: BERTIE
D: "Swanee River". TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 42.
C: LIONEL
D: Very modern.
C: BERTIE
D: Happens to be my favorite.
C: LIONEL
D: Sing it.
C: BERTIE
D: Certainly not. May I help? Always wanted to build models. Father wouldn't allow it. I had to collect stamps. He collected stamps.
E: fascinated by the plane repairs
C: LIONEL
D: Only if you sing. Goes like this... "Way down upon the..."
E: sings
C: BERTIE
D: I know the words! "Way down upon the Swanee River. ..." Etcetera.
E: sings
C: LIONEL
D: You didn't stutter.
C: BERTIE
D: Of course I didn't stutter, I was singing! One doesn't stutter when one sings! ) Oh... Well I can't waltz around on State occasions warbling!
E: realises then
C: LIONEL
D: You can with me.
C: BERTIE
D: That's because you're peculiar.
C: LIONEL
D: I take that as a compliment. Cut some struts from the balsa. Sorry, hard to show you what to do at five paces. Would you like a cup of tea?
C: BERTIE
D: No. Yes. Thank you. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 43.
N: Lionel fires up the hot plate.
C: LIONEL
D: You were about to sing an aria concerning your brother.
C: BERTIE
D: I'm not crooning to the tune of "Swanee River!"
C: LIONEL
D: Try "Camptown Races" then. "The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo- dah..." That sort of thing.
E: sings
C: BERTIE
D: I can't talk, or sing, about your future King, doo-dah, doo-dah...
C: LIONEL
D: My future King? He's your future King too. Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow up to be King, but you wouldn't.
C: BERTIE
D: Certainly not. I've always looked up to David. Water's boiling.
N: Lionel makes the pot.
C: LIONEL
D: Two lumps or one?
N: Bertie, a bit abashed, holds up three fingers.
C: BERTIE
D: I've a sweet tooth. To tell the truth...
C: LIONEL
D: Always preferable. Cover it with tissue.
E: referring to plane wing
C: BERTIE
D: ...it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be King.
C: LIONEL
D: Why's that?
N: Lionel hands him a mug of tea. Bertie realizes it's chipped and possibly none too clean. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 44.
C: BERTIE
D: I wouldn't have to give speeches!
N: Reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case.
C: LIONEL
D: No smoking. What's the age difference?
N: While Logue isn't looking, Bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim of the mug with his handkerchief.
C: BERTIE
D: Eighteen months.
C: LIONEL
D: But for eighteen months you would've been King?!
C: BERTIE
D: We didn't think about it that way, doctor. Doo-dah doo-dah. David and I were very close.
E: sings then
C: LIONEL
D: As you said: eighteen months.
C: BERTIE
D: As brothers!
C: LIONEL
D: How close?
C: BERTIE
D: Young bucks... You know.
C: LIONEL
D: I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go after the same girls?
C: BERTIE
D: Upon occasion.
C: LIONEL
D: Princess Elizabeth?
C: BERTIE
D: What an extraordinarily rude thing to say! David did try to be her beau at one point. Before I met her. She wouldn't have him. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 45.
E: flares quickly under control MORE
C: BERTIE
D: Not like my father...he and his brother, when they were young, kept a girl in St John's Wood and shared her on alternate nights.
E: CONT'D
N: An uncomfortable silence. Too much has been said.
C: LIONEL
D: Now dope the other wing. Did David tease you?
C: BERTIE
D: They all did. "Buh-buh-buh-Bertie". Father encouraged it. "Spit it out, boy!" Thought it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!
C: LIONEL
D: Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue.
C: BERTIE
D: I mean the damn questions!
C: LIONEL
D: Mandatory. Tell me more about your storybook childhood. What was your earliest memory?
C: BERTIE
D: You asked that before.
C: LIONEL
D: This time I'd like an answer.
C: BERTIE
D: Being born.
C: LIONEL
D: How can you remember that?
C: BERTIE
D: December 14th.
C: LIONEL
D: I don't understand.
C: BERTIE
D: "Mausoleum Day". Prince Albert departed on that date. I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 46.
E: stutter growing in intensity MORE
C: BERTIE
D: Let's stick to medical history please. I'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: And?
C: BERTIE
D: I was punished. Now I'm right handed.
C: LIONEL
D: Anything else?
C: BERTIE
D: Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate.
N: Lionel waits.
C: BERTIE
D: Metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. Now I have straight legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it be: "Myrtle says no?"
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: You sound angry.
C: BERTIE
D: Yes, I told you, I have a temper.
C: LIONEL
D: Angry at me, or at your brother?
N: Bertie remains stubbornly silent. Then blurts:
C: BERTIE
D: He's fallen in love!
C: LIONEL
D: How dreadful.
C: BERTIE
D: With the wrong sort of woman!
C: LIONEL
D: What's wrong with her?
C: BERTIE
D: She's American.
C: LIONEL
D: Some of them must be lovable. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 47.
C: BERTIE
D: This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be happy, but the family, the Church, the nation, won't have it.
C: LIONEL
D: Can't they fornicate privately like adults?
C: BERTIE
D: If only! David used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. But now...
C: LIONEL
D: "Queen Wallis of Baltimore"?
C: BERTIE
D: Please.
C: LIONEL
D: Does sound a bit iffy.
C: BERTIE
D: I made a smudge!
C: LIONEL
D: Touch it up.
C: BERTIE
D: You want me to beg for help?
C: LIONEL
D: I advise you never to beg. Especially if you might be King.
C: BERTIE
D: Don't say that!
C: LIONEL
D: I see. For reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? You already owe me a shilling.
N: Bertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it to Logue.
C: BERTIE
D: I brought it along. You won, fair and square. I'll pay you generously.
N: Lionel pockets the coin. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 48.
C: LIONEL
D: I'll continue to ask questions.
C: BERTIE
D: That's what I was afraid of.
C: LIONEL
D: Nice job.
E: admires the plane
N: Bertie sees Lionel glance at his watch.
C: BERTIE
D: You've someone waiting?
C: LIONEL
D: I do now.
C: BERTIE
D: I'd apologize to them in person, but...
C: LIONEL
D: You don't wish to be seen? Slip out the back way.
C: BERTIE
D: After the funeral...it may be even more difficult. To remain unobserved.
C: LIONEL
D: You're having second thoughts.
N: Bertie's silence is confirmation.
C: LIONEL
D: I ask too many questions?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: Perhaps the wrong sort.
C: LIONEL
D: We live in South Kensington, small apartment, but no one would see you. Lots of planes.
E: writes an address added incentive
C: BERTIE
D: You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
C: LIONEL
D: Australian. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 49.
C: BERTIE
D: ...I've ever really talked to. Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see a `bloke' I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine. Cuts both ways.
N: As Bertie is about to leave, Lionel requests casually:
C: LIONEL
D: And if you decide to come, bring the Duchess. She might be helpful.
C: BERTIE
D: She might. If I asked. Very nicely. And how will Myrtle take to our coming into your home?
E: at back door
C: LIONEL
D: Not sure. She isn't speaking to me. Wants to go home. After the funeral then?
E: pause pause
N: Bertie doesn't answer. Exits. Logue is left holding the plane. He goes to the waiting room door.
C: LIONEL
D: How're you doing, Willie?
E: CONT'D
C: WILLIE'S MUM
D: Still can't say a sentence.
E: speaking for her son
C: LIONEL
D: Willie?
C: WILLIE
D: Iiiiiii'm much bbbbbbbetter.
C: LIONEL
D: Well done.
N: A drum roll is heard. Thrum. Another... Thrum! Thrum!
S: EXT. ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR CASTLE - NEW DAY
N: Funereal bagpipes wail, joining the measured drum-rolls. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 50. On the balcony of the Castle, decorated with black bunting, is a huge BBC microphone, and arrayed in front of it a row of uniformed dignitaries wearing Naval hats of the Napoleonic Wars, replete with ostrich feathers. One of the dignitaries reads a declaration:
C: DIGNITARY
D: Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call to His mercy our late Sovereign, King George the Fifth of blessed and glorious memory...
N: During this, INTERCUT to the REVERSE ANGLE, showing a massive military parade, mainly Navy personnel, wending its way through the main street of Windsor towards the Castle, accompanying a gun carriage on which rides the King's coffin, draped with the Royal standard, on which rests the Royal Crown topped by a Maltese Cross. David is seen - very serious.
C: DIGNITARY
D: ...that the High and Mighty Prince Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David is now become our only lawful King.
E: CONT'D
N: Canons are fired. Startled by the salute, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and streak across the wintery sky. A MURMUR, then a shocked GASP, as the gun carriage transverses a tram track and tilts precipitously. Suddenly the Royal Crown tumbles and falls, knocking off the Maltese Cross.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Oh bloody Hell!
E: O.C.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: A bad omen, Your Grace?
E: O.C.
N: The Archbishop and Churchill are watching the events from the shadows at one end of the balcony. Below - a scramble to restore the Cross to the Crown, and replace both atop the coffin.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Don't be disingenuous. For our late King's crown to fall from his coffin is not a fortuitous portent. What ever is going to happen next? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 51.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Is that be the motto of the new reign? Indeed, will there actually be "a new reign"?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Winston! I'm deeply shocked.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: You don't look it.
C: COSMO LANG
D: My function requires me to appear serene.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: That may be increasingly difficult to maintain. I've been informed by no less an authority than the Prime Minister that our populace has no objection to Royal fornication, but will never tolerate adultery.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Well, since we cannot acquire a new populace, perhaps we need a new King?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: My turn to be profoundly shocked.
N: Neither look the slightest traumatized.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Scoff, Churchill! Go on... scoff! But you more than others know full well we'll soon be under siege from the forces of darkness.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: The winds of war...a gathering storm?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Oh, you do have a way with words. And who would you suggest to rally the troops, the nation, the Empire, the world?
N: INTERCUT to Bertie in the funeral cortege, looking frail and pale.
C: COSMO LANG
D: A man who cannot speak? In Nuremberg stadium, Herr Hitler mesmerizes millions, whilst the Duke of York cannot successfully order fish and chips. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 52.
E: CONT'D
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Would you prefer the next brother?
N: INTERCUT to Henry, the Duke of Gloucester.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: A bi-sexual former drug addict? The unwashed moralistic populace will adore that!
E: CONT'D
C: COSMO LANG
D: The youngest, perhaps?
N: INTERCUT to George, the Duke of Kent.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Now there's dimness.
C: COSMO LANG
D: I must admit...unburdened with brain.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Thus we're left with David, the rightful heir, who speaks beautifully, even if he talks nonsense.
N: Below, the coffin is entering the Chapel.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Come, let us bury one king, before we attempt to bring another to his knees.
E: CONT'D
N: They exit.
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW DAY
N: Re-establishing shot. The Royal standard flies bravely.
S: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie waits at a table with a group of immaculately attired courtiers and dignitaries. This is the Coronation Committee. The chair at the head of the table is empty, everyone waiting for its occupant. He finally arrives. David. He gestures for Bertie to come into the corridor, but deliberately leaves the door open so the committee can hear snatches of Bertie's ensuing humiliation. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 53.
S: INT. CORRIDOR, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
N: David has a habit of constantly fingering his tie.
C: DAVID
D: Hear you're taking elocution lessons, lad.
C: BERTIE
D: Pardon?
C: DAVID
D: Diction. Speechifying. That's the word around Town.
C: BERTIE
D: Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment...
C: DAVID
D: I'm the brother who speaks. Or do you wish to have a go?
E: OVER-RIDES
C: BERTIE
D: Good lord no! I hope to...
C: DAVID
D: Replace me? Well...today's your chance.
N: He thrusts a document into Bertie's hands, then pokes his head into the conference room.
C: DAVID
D: My brother will read the Coronation Plans.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: I'm not prepared!
E: whispers urgently
C: DAVID
D: As a Boy Scout...and you are one, aren't you, very much a Boy Scout...you must always be prepared. Nice and loud, so everyone can hear.
E: whispers back
N: Bertie looks at the pages, his throat constricts, his chest tightens and his hands begin to shake.
C: BERTIE
D: I...I...I thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document.
N: He attempts to return it to David, but his brother won't accept. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 54.
C: DAVID
D: Tell the others how Mrs Simpson is to be accommodated in a special alcove above the altar. Now I'll be off. See you at Balmoral this weekend, Buh-buh-Bertie.
N: In the room, they are appalled. Bertie stands frozen and shattered.
S: 49 INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS ON SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - NEW DAY49
N: The lion rampant flutters on the bonnet of the Austin. Inside, Bertie, wearing a black armband, gestures for the driver to stop. Pulling his homburg over his brow, Bertie wraps his scarf around the lower portion of his face. Then catches his reflection in the rearview mirror. Tells his driver:
C: BERTIE
D: Wait down the road.
S: EXT. SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - CONTINUOUS
N: Not wanting to draw attention to his destination, Bertie has disembarked several buildings away from Logue's address. He makes his way hurriedly. WACK. A soccer football hits him on the back. He wheels around. The group of local lads look at him unabashed.
C: LOCAL LAD
D: Kick it `ere, aye, Guv?
N: Bertie kicks it. A fine high shot.
C: LOCAL LAD
D: Nice one.
E: CONT'D
N: They go back to their game. Bertie rings Logue's bell. A brief pause. Bertie glances nervously, hoping not to be recognized. Lionel opens the door.
C: LIONEL
D: To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you.
C: BERTIE
D: I wasn't sure either. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 55.
C: LIONEL
D: Something happened?
N: Bertie stares at his mentor. Nods.
C: BERTIE
D: Do I look like a spy?
E: as they enter, referring to his hat and scarf
C: LIONEL
D: With a toothache.
N: They disappear inside.
S: INT. STAIRWELL, LOGUE'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie has to pick his way through discarded toys and sporting equipment, explaining to Logue:
C: BERTIE
D: I was totally unable to speak.
C: LIONEL
D: You seldom stutter with me anymore. The boys are a bit untidy.
E: referring to the mess
C: BERTIE
D: Because you're paid to listen!
C: LIONEL
D: Like a verbal geisha girl?
S: INT. LIVING AREA, LOGUE'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie looks around the cluttered, but pleasant room: comfortable furniture a bit battered by the boys, antimacassars to hide the wear spots on the arms, family photos everywhere, well-used Turkish rug on the floor.
C: LIONEL
D: Home.
C: BERTIE
D: What more does a man need,eh?
N: Lionel stares, unsure if he's being patronized.
C: LIONEL
D: Coming from a man who's lived all his life in castles and palaces. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 56.
C: BERTIE
D: Somebody has to live in them.
C: LIONEL
D: Somebody does.
N: Ushers Bertie into his study.
S: INT. LOGUE'S STUDY - NEW DAY
N: Bertie stands shattered, lost in his painful memory.
C: BERTIE
D: I couldn't say anything!
C: LIONEL
D: You could've refused. Don't you know any rude words?
C: BERTIE
D: What a bloody stupid question! I just said one. Bloody. Bloodybloodybloody!
C: LIONEL
D: Perhaps a touch more vulgar?
C: BERTIE
D: Certainly not.
C: LIONEL
D: To prove you know how.
C: BERTIE
D: Bugger!
C: LIONEL
D: A public school prig could do better.
C: BERTIE
D: Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard!
C: LIONEL
D: Hardly robust.
C: BERTIE
D: Shit then. Shit, shit, shit!
C: LIONEL
D: See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue? You don't stutter when you swear. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 57.
C: BERTIE
D: Because I'm angry!
C: LIONEL
D: Get angry more often. Do you know the f- word?
C: BERTIE
D: Fornication?
C: LIONEL
D: Oh Bertie...
C: BERTIE
D: Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!
C: LIONEL
D: Bravissimo! Now a resounding chorus of...
C: BERTIE
D: Bloody, bloody. bloody! Shit, shit, shit! Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
N: A pounding on the wall.
C: MYRTLE
D: We have children...!
E: O.S.
C: BERTIE
D: This is your fault!
E: whispers
C: LIONEL
D: Sorry, pet! Won't happen again!
C: MYRTLE
D: I should hope not!
E: O.S.
C: BERTIE
D: Apologies, Mrs. Logue.
C: LIONEL
D: First time I've heard you laugh.
C: BERTIE
D: Royals aren't allowed emotions in public.
C: LIONEL
D: Which explains a lot.
N: Bertie is in no mood to be provoked. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 58.
C: BERTIE
D: What do you want me to do, dammit!? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta?!
C: LIONEL
D: Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed.
N: Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie supportively on the shoulder. Bertie pulls back in offended shock. All the warning signals instilled in him are going off.
C: BERTIE
D: Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous man, Logue. Who sent you?
C: LIONEL
D: Anyone in mind?
C: BERTIE
D: The lurking shadows. Courtiers and peers...the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased.
C: LIONEL
D: Your wife was the one who sought me out.
C: BERTIE
D: Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me!
C: LIONEL
D: But you don't share her belief? Why come here?
C: BERTIE
D: I'm beginning to ask myself that very same question. Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue.
C: LIONEL
D: Lionel.
C: BERTIE
D: I came here because I was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve. Duty is our sole justification for privilege. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 59.
E: MORE
C: BERTIE
D: I came here because I was under the illusion you might help me perform that function!
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Not to worry. They say the King can do no wrong.
C: BERTIE
D: He can bugger things up! And I am not the King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce. The Coronation is set for the 12th of May. Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April. That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest.
C: LIONEL
D: And if Mr Baldwin stops them?
C: BERTIE
D: That would be a tragedy. I pray to The Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne.
C: LIONEL
D: Does that include debasing yourself?
C: BERTIE
D: If necessary!
C: LIONEL
D: Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning...
C: BERTIE
D: Are you saying he wanted me to fail?
C: LIONEL
D: Are you insisting he didn't? In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases. You can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence...
N: Bertie doesn't want to hear.
C: BERTIE
D: Growing confidence? Growing dread!!! You're a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother. Trying to get me to commit treason! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 60.
C: LIONEL
D: Trying to get you to realize you need not be governed by fear. Again, why did you seek me out? To take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties?!
C: BERTIE
D: How dare you! I'm the brother of a King...the son of a King...back through untold centuries. You presume to instruct me on my duty? A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback? The disappointing son of an embittered clerk! You're a monster, Doctor Logue. I'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother. And these sessions are over!
S: INT. STAGE OF SMALL REGIONAL THEATRE - NEW DAY
N: Closed curtains. Someone fumbles behind it.
C: LIONEL
D: Now?
E: BEHIND CURTAIN
N: Lionel pushes his way through the gap in the curtain. A PROVINCIAL DIRECTOR replies from a seat in the auditorium. (Not the same Director as in the earlier audition scene.)
C: DIRECTOR
D: Were you told? We aren't for London. Playing the provinces.
C: LIONEL
D: Outer Mongolia?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Available, are we?
C: LIONEL
D: Nothing prevents.
C: DIRECTOR
D: I believe that's called "desperate for a part!" Previous experience?
C: LIONEL
D: Australia.
C: DIRECTOR
D: You have played the provinces. Righto! Let's hear what you can do. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 61.
C: LIONEL
D: Caliban?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Make him deformed. Audiences like that.
C: LIONEL
D: Of course. "Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not."
E: rallies himself
N: As magical as Lionel was when he performed for his boys, here he's stiff and painfully stilted.
C: LIONEL
D: "Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices..."
E: CONT'D
C: DIRECTOR
D: Thank you! Don't abandon your day job. Next!
E: interrupts
N: Logue bows his head.
S: INT. LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Lionel enters and sits dejectedly at the table. Myrtle and the boys eat in silence. Finally:
C: LIONEL
D: You may leave.
C: VALENTINE
D: Haven't finished yet, Dad. Oh! Right!
E: realizes
C: THE BOYS
D: Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mum.
N: They exit. Myrtle knows something has happened.
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel?
N: Lionel takes five slim folders out of his jacket pocket and puts them on the table in front of Myrtle. She studies them, stunned. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 62.
C: MYRTLE
D: Tickets? Home?
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: First class.
N: A long pause as Myrtle digests this.
C: MYRTLE
D: What about your...
C: LIONEL
D: Willie's a problem...not much progress. The others have been referred.
C: MYRTLE
D: What'll you do when we get home?
C: LIONEL
D: Try not to act the toff. Teach perhaps.
C: MYRTLE
D: You could...
C: LIONEL
D: No! I'm not good enough!
C: MYRTLE
D: You gave it a try, Lionel.
C: LIONEL
D: Yes, I had a go. Thanks to your patience. I just bloody well wasn't good enough!
E: grief overwhelms him
C: MYRTLE
D: Oh Lionel! This must've cost you.
E: studying the tickets
N: CHOP! CHOP! CHOP! The sound of an axe.
S: EXT. GROUNDS AND TERRACE, BALMORAL - NEW DAY
N: A woodsman's axe CHOPS into the thick trunk of a massive tree. Nearby, a bulldozer cuts into the green turf and rich soil. The felling and earth removal are being watched by Churchill and Lang from a distant terrace. In the background a jazz band in white tuxedos syncopates pertly. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 63.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Five hundred year old oaks! Part of the hill! Removed to improve the view!
C: COSMO LANG
D: How ever does she do it?
N: Inside the ballroom, seem through open French doors, an afternoon dance is being held. Churchill and Lang look in.
S: INT. BALLROOM, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS
N: At the epicenter, a dashing couple: David, the very picture of insouciance, and clinging to his arm, dripping in jewelry, a rather small, angular, dark haired woman, with a high brow and square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical feature is her back, displayed fully by a dress that plunges to her nates. Surrounded by their entourage, they are the apex of chic. Watching from the sidelines:
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination? I realize of course, that may be outside your personal experience.
N: Winston exchanges his empty champagne flute for a full one from the tray of a passing footman.
C: COSMO LANG
D: You've the Devil in you today.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: If anyone should know, it would be Your Grace.
C: COSMO LANG
D: All aspects of mankind are within my venue. Did you know, HM has trouble with his glands?
N: Churchill almost chokes on his champagne.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: I'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular!
C: COSMO LANG
D: They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 64.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Apparently it affects the quality, although not the quantity, of HM's endeavors.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: And the brother?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Unscathed. Two daughters. I shepherd my flock in all matters, Winston, including multiplication.
N: They make their way inside. In the distance an Austin Princess can be seen making its way up the stately tree-line avenue.
S: INT. AUSTIN PRINCESS, BALMORAL ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie and Elizabeth are dressed for the party.
C: BERTIE
D: We must try to be pleasant.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Your father not dead six months, and That Woman throws, "A garden potty." P-o-t-t-y. She's sleeping in your mother's bedroom. And I know perfectly well she calls me `the Dowdy Duchess", and "Cookie".
S: INT. BALLROOM, BALMORAL - DAY
N: At the buffet table Churchill helps himself copiously.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Has it occurred to you, as it has only occurred to me, that a Monarch with a gland problem, who realizes he cannot produce issue, might not wish to be King...? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed.
C: COSMO LANG
D: A dazzling concept...beautifully phrased.
N: A FOOTMAN announces: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 65.
C: FOOTMAN
D: Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
N: Wallis sweeps forward to greet them, but Elizabeth sails past, announcing to no one in particular:
C: ELIZABETH
D: I came at the invitation of the King.
N: David turns and bows formally. Elizabeth cursties in return. Wallis quickly returns to David, taking him forcefully onto the dance floor. The Yorks go in the other direction. To the side, Churchill and Lang watch David and Wallis do a brisk Turkey Trot.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: According to the F.B.I.... she is, after all, one of their citizens...our Monarch does not possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's sexual favours. Hitler's Ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, has been sending her 17 carnations every day...one for each time they've slept together.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Good Lord, Winston, we must see to it this Empress of the Night does not become Queen of England!
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Vividly put.
N: Churchill has spotted Elizabeth in a side room.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Allow me to test new waters.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PORTRAIT GALLERY, BALMORAL - CONTINUOUS
N: Churchill makes his way to Elizabeth, who is standing in front of a portrait of George IV.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't need to be told I behaved badly.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: On the contrary, Mam. Court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host. In this case: the King. You behaved impeccably. As always. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 66.
E: MORE
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: A relative?
E: CONT'D referring to the painting
C: ELIZABETH
D: Distant.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: You're well aware, of course, George IV's wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common indeed...and previously married. She signed an agreement that she could never become Queen, and their children could not be Royal. A rather sensible morganatic arrangement.
E: referring again to the painting
C: ELIZABETH
D: That was a very long time ago. You're stirring with a rather large spoon, Winston. Keep in mind, I'm also a distant relative of Lady Macbeth.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: I would disremember at my peril.
N: David is coming briskly down the corridor, struggling to open a champagne bottle, followed by Bertie determined to catch up. Elizabeth and Churchill leave the brothers alone.
C: BERTIE
D: David...
C: DAVID
D: Wally wants more champagne. I have to fetch it. She prefers that.
C: BERTIE
D: Been trying to see you...
C: DAVID
D: Been terribly busy.
C: BERTIE
D: Doing what?
C: DAVID
D: Being King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 67.
C: BERTIE
D: Where did you get that American accent? David...Father's not dead six months, yet you've put Mrs. Simpson in the suite used by our mother?
C: DAVID
D: Mama's not still in bed, is she?
C: BERTIE
D: That isn't funny.
C: DAVID
D: Ssssssorry, d-d-dear b-b-oy!
C: BERTIE
D: Please. No more of that.
N: A moment of silent confrontation. David backs down. Sort of.
C: DAVID
D: Didn't realize you cared.
C: BERTIE
D: This could end in disaster.
C: DAVID
D: This will end splendidly. With Wallis as my wife.
C: BERTIE
D: Whatever will she call herself?
C: DAVID
D: Queen of England, I suspect. Kings do marry. Empress of India. The whole bag of tricks.
C: BERTIE
D: David! The upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous. Hunger marchers are singing the "Red Flag" in front of Westminster...demanding a republic...I've seen them...
C: DAVID
D: Herr Hitler will sort that out.
C: BERTIE
D: Who'll sort out Chancellor Hitler? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 68.
C: DAVID
D: He's much maligned. By the Jews, according to Wallis. And she's very clever about politics.
C: BERTIE
D: The man's a monster! Our position must remain clear.
C: DAVID
D: Why's that, old chap?
C: BERTIE
D: We are a German family!
C: DAVID
D: Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser Willie was our uncle.
C: BERTIE
D: Because we took an English name! Windsor. Because we are England. We are the heart and soul of this nation. That must never change.
C: DAVID
D: Are you already in charge?
C: BERTIE
D: I'm trying to warn you.
C: DAVID
D: Am I being threatened?
C: BERTIE
D: David, your role is to consult and to be advised.
C: DAVID
D: Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
C: BERTIE
D: Sounds like you haven't.
C: DAVID
D: I won't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like Stanley Baldwin!
C: BERTIE
D: He's your Prime Minister.
C: DAVID
D: And I'm his King! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 69.
C: BERTIE
D: If you refuse to listen to our Government, they have no choice but to resign.
C: DAVID
D: I'll form another. There's Winston. He'd love to be P.M. We'll create a King's Party.
C: BERTIE
D: To fight a general election in which your marriage is the only topic?
C: DAVID
D: I'd risk anything and everything for Wallis. Don't I have rights?
C: BERTIE
D: Privileges.
C: DAVID
D: Not the same thing.
C: BERTIE
D: No.
C: DAVID
D: Yet an ordinary man may marry for love.
C: BERTIE
D: We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred to be profiles on a coin. If you were ordinary, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?!
C: DAVID
D: What's the point then? Just to look posh? You know...your speech is much improved tonight. Hardly a hesitation. Yearning for a larger audience, are we?
C: BERTIE
D: Don't say such a thing!
C: DAVID
D: Is my young brother trying to push me off the throne? Sounds positively medieval.
C: BERTIE
D: I beg of you, don't do this to my wife, my daughters, to me. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 70.
C: DAVID
D: The politicians will give in. See you at my Coronation...Bertie.
N: The champagne cork finally POPS. He strides off.
S: EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET - NEW DAY
N: Establishing shot of the Prime Minister's residence.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Nice of you to invite me to your digs, Stanley.
E: O.S.
S: INT. BALDWIN'S STUDY, 10 DOWNING STREET - DAY
N: Baldwin and Churchill are alone together. No love lost between these two men.
C: BALDWIN
D: As you may have guessed...
N: Churchill is silent. Balwin waits, then:
C: BALDWIN
D: ...I intend to resign. The Royal scandal has weakened my position considerably.
E: CONT'D
N: Churchill, on the edge of his seat, can't suppress an anticipatory grin. Baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it.
C: BALDWIN
D: No need to volunteer your services, Winston. Neville Chamberlain will take my place, once this Royal matter is settled. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he already lives next door.
E: CONT'D
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: My opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough, Stanley.
C: BALDWIN
D: Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The question of a morganatic marriage, as a possible solution, has been put to the Dominion Prime Ministers. After all, HM is their King too.
N: Baldwin has a sheath of telegrams in hand. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 71.
C: BALDWIN
D: Australia: no.
E: CONT'D
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: David feels there aren't that many people in Australia.
C: BALDWIN
D: Canada: no. Union of South Africa: an inappropriate marriage would create a permanent wound. The Irish Free State: states it is not really their affair, and, bluntly, our English King may marry any whore he wants, they'll be well out of it.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Bloody Irish.
C: BALDWIN
D: New Zealand...wavers.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Ah, the Kiwis!
C: BALDWIN
D: Being rather remote, they've not even heard of Mrs Simpson. Hardly a winning hand.
N: Silence.
C: BALDWIN
D: This is not about true love, Winston. This is about who's in charge. Does the King do what he wants, or what his people want him to do? Does the King own his nation, or does the nation own their Monarch?
E: CONT'D
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: He won't budge.
C: BALDWIN
D: Nor will we.
S: INT. PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Winston Churchill is incongruously inspecting a rocking horse. Unable to resist, he sits on it gingerly, rocking back and forth lost in a reverie. Eyes closed he extends his right arm as though holding a cavalry saber. Bertie enters startling him.
C: BERTIE
D: Don't dismount. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 72.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Good of you to see me at this late hour.
C: BERTIE
D: Thought you were in David's camp?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: I was. "I am now free to tell you how I was jockeyed out of the Throne."
E: takes a piece of paper from his pocket and reads
C: BERTIE
D: Good Lord! My brother wrote that?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Wallis wrote it for him. I'll burn it. I fear your brother is like the child in a fairy story, given everything in the world, but they forgot his soul. Quite happy to bring his nation to the brink of civil war just as we face global conflict.
C: BERTIE
D: We're not coming to that?!
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Oh, there'll be war, alright. Your brother held conversations with the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, your cousin, a ranking member of the Nazi party. I have the Scotland Yard intercept: "Who is King here? Baldwin or I? I myself wish to talk with Hitler, and will do so here or in Germany." I doubt England is ready to return to absolute monarchy.
E: takes out another piece of paper
C: BERTIE
D: Surely his motives are misunderstood?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: "If I don't get my way, when the war comes, Hitler will crush everyone, including the Americans. The British may not want me as their King, but I'll soon be back as their leader." His intent seems crystal clear.
C: BERTIE
D: Winston?! Don't take him seriously! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 73.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Mugs for his cancelled Coronation will soon be on clearance sale.
C: BERTIE
D: You're willing to go along with this?! Changing horses in mid-stream is a perilous maneuver!!!
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Depends how badly the horse you're on stumbles.
C: BERTIE
D: It's not too late, Winston, you could form a government on his behalf.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: I must decline. Reluctantly.
N: The rocking horse CRACKS. Churchill gets to his feet.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Sorry. I've written a new speech for him.
E: CONT'D starts to exit, then
C: BERTIE
D: I don't want to hear it! Ever!
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: It does have a rather nice turn of phrase.
S: EXT. MONTAGE OF BRITISH STREETS - DAY
N: It is December 11th, 1936. If practical use the actual recorded broadcast (truncated). In London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, country hamlets and cathedral towns...the streets are deserted. Stragglers hurry indoors to be near: THE GLOWING DIAL OF A RADIO
C: DAVID
D: At long last I am able to say a few words of my own. Until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak. A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 74.
E: V.O. RADIO FILTER
S: INT. PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie and Elizabeth listening to the radio with the two princesses royal sitting at their parents' feet. Bertie battles his emotions.
C: DAVID
D: Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
E: V.O. RADIO FILTER
C: MARGARET ROSE
D: Daddy, who broke our rocking horse?
E: whispers
C: BERTIE
D: A giant.
E: whispers
N: Elizabeth holds a finger to her lips: shush. DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) This has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home with his wife and children.
S: INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT
N: The glow of a radio dial. Lionel and Myrtle sit in armchairs, the radio on a side-table between them.
C: DAVID
D: I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
E: V.O. RADIO FILTER
N: Lionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D) We all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all! God save the King! Logue strokes Myrtle's hair.
C: LIONEL
D: I too "married the woman I love." TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 75.
C: MYRTLE
D: You married a shop girl.
C: LIONEL
D: A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to heart to heart.
C: MYRTLE
D: Using simple words and short sentences. I'm very ordinary.
C: LIONEL
D: That's why we're suited. I'm just an ordinary bloke.
C: MYRTLE
D: Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams, Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's all I ever wanted.
C: LIONEL
D: Me too.
C: MYRTLE
D: Is that why, every day, you've spent hours with a man who's about to be King?
C: LIONEL
D: That relationship is now past tense.
C: MYRTLE
D: Yet, for as long as you could, you did what you wanted.
C: LIONEL
D: I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I wanted.
C: MYRTLE
D: And failing that...
C: LIONEL
D: I certainly failed!
C: MYRTLE
D: A great healer. Always...'great'. Where does a shop girl fit in?
C: LIONEL
D: Very snugly, into my heart! Always have, always will. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 76.
C: MYRTLE
D: Trouble is, Lionel, when you say that, I still believe it.
S: INT. INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE - DAY
N: The Royal standard on a gleaming car's bonnet. Bertie stands uneasily in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet as the driver opens the door. Bertie realizes its a Rolls.
C: BERTIE
D: Where's the Austin?
C: DRIVER
D: The Palace changed it, Your Highness.
C: BERTIE
D: I liked the Austin.
C: DRIVER
D: So did I, sir.
N: The two girls wave from their open playroom window, and call:
C: MARGARET ROSE
D: You look like a chicken.
C: LILIBET
D: A rooster.
N: He waves, and gets in.
S: EXT. ST. JAMES PALACE - THAT DAY
N: A formal voice announces: MASTER OF THE COUNCIL (O.S.) His Majesty will address the Accession Council and take his oath.
S: INT. ANTECHAMBER, ACCESSION COUNCIL - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie looks at himself in a full length mirror, making last minute adjustments to his uniform. Staring at his reflection:
C: BERTIE
D: How did this happen to you? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 77.
S: INT. ACCESSION COUNCIL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
N: Bertie walks to the podium like a man to the gallows faced with an array of the Privy Councillors, members of the House of Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the Aldermen of the City of London and the High Commissioners of the Commonwealth countries. All the old symptoms reappear: the tightening of the neck muscles, the protruding Adam's apple, the jaw locking.
C: BERTIE
D: My Lords, members of the Accession Council, I meet you today in circumstances which are without parallel in the history of our Country...
N: Its going to be a terrible performance. He bows his head in humility. And shame.
S: INT. PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - THAT DAY
N: Elizabeth is playing quietly with her daughters when the door opens and Bertie appears, still in full regalia, straight from the Accession Council. He holds his arm out, expecting them to run to him for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal. They remain where they are.
C: BERTIE
D: Daddy's home.
N: They curtsy formally. LILIBET & MARGARET ROSE Your Majesty. Bertie is devastated. Elizabeth takes him quickly out into the corridor.
S: INT. BERTIE'S STUDY, YORK HOUSE - DAY
C: BERTIE
D: I don't want to lose you.
C: ELIZABETH
D: How could you possibly?
C: BERTIE
D: Being what we both dread most. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 78.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Dear, dear, man, I refused your first two marriage proposals because, as much as I loved you, I couldn't abide the thought of living in the Royal gilded cage. Then I realized...you stuttered so beautifully...they'd leave you alone.
N: She takes his face in her hands tenderly.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If I must be Queen, I will be a good Queen. The wife of a very great King indeed. You know what you must do.
E: CONT'D then
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM & WAITING ROOM - NEW DAY
N: Logue is working with Anna. She's reading smoothly and with great intensity.
C: ANNA
D: "Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths Enwrought with golden and silver light, The bbb..."
N: Gets stuck.
C: LIONEL
D: We haven't much more time together. Give it a go.
N: The doorbell RINGS. Logue is annoyed.
C: LIONEL
D: There weren't any more appointments today.
E: CONT'D
N: The bell RINGS again. He yells:
C: LIONEL
D: Piss off! Anna?
E: CONT'D gently
C: ANNA
D: "The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light..."
N: The door opens and Bertie enters the waiting area. Hearing Anna he stops outside the consultation room and listens. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 79.
C: ANNA
D: "I would spread the cloths under your feet, But I, being poor, have only my dreams. I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."
E: CONT'D
N: Silence.
C: LIONEL
D: Read it to him. If he doesn't profess his love, he's not a man.
E: softly
N: Anna nods earnestly.
C: ANNA
D: Thank you...Lionel.
N: She exits via the Waiting Room and almost runs into Bertie. On recognizing him, she bobs her head.
C: BERTIE
D: That was lovely. Don't take any guff.
C: ANNA
D: Can I tell my Harold that's what you said?
C: BERTIE
D: I'd be honoured.
N: She dashes off. Logue comes to the door of the Waiting Room, in effect blocking Bertie's way in.
C: LIONEL
D: Johnson, isn't it? Have you an appointment?
C: BERTIE
D: Want me to beg?
C: LIONEL
D: I told you, Kings don't beg.
C: BERTIE
D: I believe this time a bit of begging might be required. Elizabeth says I must eat humble crow.
C: LIONEL
D: Its "crow" or "humble pie". Take your pick. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 80.
C: BERTIE
D: I was frightened and took refuge in being `Royal'. What I said was unforgivable. And...
E: gathering resolve
C: LIONEL
D: And?
C: BERTIE
D: What's the one essential thing a King must do? He must believe he is King. How can I possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I beg you: get me through! I'll pay you another shilling.
E: blurts out
C: LIONEL
D: What're friends for?
N: Logue steps aside, letting Bertie in.
C: BERTIE
D: I wouldn't know.
S: INT. LOGUE BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The double bed is piled high with clothing, a suitcase at its foot. Myrtle is sorting. She hears Lionel enter behind her. At first, she doesn't turn. Lionel remains silent.
C: MYRTLE
D: I've got the boys sorting their things. Your office will be a chore...
N: Realizing something is amiss, she turns, and knows instantly what Lionel's going to tell her. Her hand goes to her mouth to stifle her emotions.
S: INT. BERTIE'S STUDY - DAY
N: Bertie is with visitors: Churchill and Lang. There's a slight but discernible change in his demeanor.
C: COSMO LANG
D: We asked to see Your Highness because there's the urgent question of what to call your brother. Aside from the obvious.
N: Bertie is not pleased with His Grace's joke, but lets it pass. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 81.
C: BERTIE
D: What do you suggest?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Mr. Edward Windsor? All he deserves.
C: BERTIE
D: What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne?
N: They look at each other, unsure.
C: BERTIE
D: Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me? He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke. Which makes him a Lord at the very least.
E: CONT'D
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Very well, Lord E.W. it is.
C: BERTIE
D: And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons. Heading a King's Party.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Unacceptable!
C: BERTIE
D: So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's Party? Is that acceptable?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Certainly not.
C: BERTIE
D: But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Oh I say...
E: realizing
C: BERTIE
D: The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen.
N: He exits abruptly. Churchill and Lang gather their things stunned. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 82.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Not exactly a dummy, is he?
S: 76 EXT. FACADE OF D.HENRY LTD. LEATHERGOODS, KNIGHTSBRIDGE - DAY
N: Myrtle is in the shop window, arranging handbags, luggage, and briefcases.
S: INT. D.HENRY LTD. - CONTINUOUS
N: In the store Myrtle can be seen dressing the window, while in his glass office the OWNER, a portly bald gentleman with a Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's direction. The two men nod, shake hands. The fellow in the trench-coat leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers something to her. She heads towards Myrtle.
C: BERTIE
D: "Let's go gathering hearty heather with the gay brigade of grand dragons."
E: O. S.
S: INT. LOGUE'S STUDY AND PARLOUR - DAY
N: A wall divides the study from the living area, allowing the action in both spaces to be viewed. IN THE PARLOUR: Elizabeth waits, ill at ease. IN THE STUDY:
C: LIONEL
D: Splendid. Here's another. "She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves." At home, twenty-five times, in rapid succession.
C: BERTIE
D: Those are my hardest sounds.
N: Lionel gives him a look.
C: BERTIE
D: Oh.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Shall we invite your wife in now? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 83.
N: Logue goes to the door and starts to open it. He shuts it quickly.
C: LIONEL
D: I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several hours!
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle has entered, definitely unhappy. Seeing Elizabeth, she's even less happy, and flabbergasted.
C: MYRTLE
D: Milady?
C: ELIZABETH
D: "Your Majesty", the first time. After that, "Ma'am". Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in ham. I'm informed your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel. I trust, however, you won't attempt to call me Liz.
N: IN THE STUDY: Lionel stands listening, ear to the door.
C: BERTIE
D: How're they getting on?
C: LIONEL
D: As to be expected.
N: IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle announces:
C: MYRTLE
D: You may call me "Madam Logue".
N: Myrtle's at a loss knowing what to do with a Duchess.
C: MYRTLE
D: May I offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am?
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thank you, Madame Logue, but I'm waiting to be summoned.
N: Silence.
C: MYRTLE
D: You don't like my husband. That's what I was told.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I was told the same.
C: IN THE STUDY:
D: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 84.
C: BERTIE
D: Do we remain in hiding?
C: LIONEL
D: I'm not going out there!
N: IN THE PARLOUR:
C: MYRTLE
D: What do you dislike about my Lionel?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't wish my husband to be demeaned. What don't you like about mine?
C: MYRTLE
D: I don't want my Lionel getting hurt.
C: ELIZABETH
D: There's only one thing can save him now: success.
N: IN THE STUDY: the men are growing increasingly nervous.
C: BERTIE
D: We're being cowards.
C: LIONEL
D: Of course. We're sensible men.
C: BERTIE
D: You should go in.
C: LIONEL
D: Me? You.
C: BERTIE
D: Why me?!
C: LIONEL
D: You're the Royal.
C: BERTIE
D: Being a monarchist, I recognize these are your digs. Therefore: here you rule. Therefore: you go in.
N: Urged by Bertie, Logue opens the door. IN THE PARLOUR: Logue enters, pretending total innocence and surprise, followed by Bertie, also trying to keep the pretense. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 85.
C: LIONEL
D: Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello, Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.
N: Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge.
C: MYRTLE
D: Will the Yorks be staying for dinner?
N: Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken. Elizabeth comes to the rescue.
C: ELIZABETH
D: A previous engagement.
C: LIONEL
D: Some other time, love.
N: Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous little wave. She glares and exits. IN THE STUDY:
C: LIONEL
D: Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.
E: CONT'D
N: Bertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him.
C: LIONEL
D: Good of you to come.
E: CONT'D to Elizabeth
C: ELIZABETH
D: Harley Street is far too public. What is my function here?
C: LIONEL
D: For me to show you how to pitch in.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type.
C: LIONEL
D: Piece of cake. Please assume a supine position on the floor.
E: to Bertie
C: ELIZABETH
D: What?!
C: LIONEL
D: Firm support is needed. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 86.
N: Bertie dutifully lies on the floor.
C: LIONEL
D: Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: Full of hot air.
C: LIONEL
D: Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again...
N: Bertie inhales deeply.
C: LIONEL
D: ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Good grief.
C: LIONEL
D: Gently of course.
N: Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking solicitously:
C: ELIZABETH
D: Are you alright, Bertie?
N: Bertie nods.
C: LIONEL
D: Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part.
C: ELIZABETH
D: There's actually more?
N: Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 87.
C: LIONEL
D: You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On a public street?
C: LIONEL
D: Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech.
C: ELIZABETH
D: They can also be considered quite dotty. Don't even contemplate it!
C: BERTIE
D: Sorry, dear, doctor's orders. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... She's right, those two chaps are staring at me.
E: stops
C: ELIZABETH
D: They're always looking at you.
C: LIONEL
D: You're followed?
E: startled
C: ELIZABETH
D: Royal scrutiny, Doctor, best get used to it.
C: BERTIE
D: ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Are you timing this? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... ooooooooooooooooooooooooo... uuuuuuuuuuu.
E: to Elizabeth
S: INT. LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - LATER
N: The family eat in tense silence TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 88.
C: VALENTINE
D: May we be excused?
C: LIONEL
D: No.
N: The unhappy meal continues.
C: PETER
D: We don't want to hear you fight.
E: mumbles
C: LIONEL
D: We're not fighting. Your mother isn't talking.
C: MYRTLE
D: You wish me to speak my mind?
C: LIONEL
D: Boys, leave.
C: THE BOYS
D: Thank you, Dad! Thank you, Mum!
N: They exit hurriedly.
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel...without warning, I arrive home to find the Queen in my parlour.
C: LIONEL
D: A Duchess, she hasn't been crowned yet.
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel, don't quibble!
C: LIONEL
D: What'd you think of her?
C: MYRTLE
D: Does it matter!? She's the Queen and he's the King forgodsake! What're they doing here?!
C: LIONEL
D: Why'd you come home so early?
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel...
C: LIONEL
D: They came for help. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 89.
C: MYRTLE
D: What role are you auditioning for now? Royal saviour?! Who's going to help us?! This will bring us down, Lionel. You know it will.
C: LIONEL
D: When that poor chap first walked into my office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign. You saw him today; once more there was hope.
C: MYRTLE
D: You're not listening to me!
N: She gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen. He follows her back and forth.
C: LIONEL
D: Myrtle, I love you.
C: MYRTLE
D: You say that, but you don't listen when I say, in so many ways, how desperately I want to go home, how I never, ever, intended to stay here. This was to be a holiday trip to see `Mother England', and you turned it into quite something else. What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our tickets.
N: He's silent.
C: MYRTLE
D: Very well, I shan't talk of this ever again. I will, as always, be supportive of your endeavours.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Myrtle... I don't deserve a wonderful woman like you.
C: MYRTLE
D: How right you are.
C: LIONEL
D: But why'd you come home so early?
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel...I was let go. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 90.
N: He's stunned.
C: MYRTLE
D: Inquiries were made...Mr Falkoff wouldn't say who...afterwards it was: `With your hubby treating a personage that high and mighty, you won't be needing employment with us, will you, Mrs Logue?'
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Why?!
E: anguished
C: MYRTLE
D: They're frightened, Lionel. Of what seems so far above them. I sympathize. I'm frightened too.
C: LIONEL
D: Oh, Myrtle. My love...
N: WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NEW DAY Establishing shot of this architectural icon.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Winston, you do read the newspapers?
E: O.S.
S: INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
N: A massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass. The center piece of this particular section is the throne of Edward the Confessor. Scaffolding is in the process of being erected to supply lighting for the Coronation. Archbishop Lang and Churchill inspect it with satisfaction.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Only the vulgar ones.
N: Churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a hip flask.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: To our new King.
E: CONT'D
C: COSMO LANG
D: Let's sincerely hope.
N: They look at each other in silence.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Is this a `slightly pregnant pause'? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 91.
C: COSMO LANG
D: They say he is dim.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Demonstrably untrue.
C: COSMO LANG
D: They say he has epilepsy.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Patently erroneous.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Fragile, prone to illness...
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Some correctness in that.
C: COSMO LANG
D: ...and will die prematurely. They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony? Or no ceremony at all?
C: COSMO LANG
D: My idea exactly!
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: I believed so. But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world.
C: COSMO LANG
D: What we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things. Did you hear his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council? He'll never be able to speak in public.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet? Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war? Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire, rallying all to our defense?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Well...
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: The Head of our Church? Is that what you have in mind? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 92.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Would it be such a calamity?
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Best ask our new King.
N: Bertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Your Majesty.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Excuse me, sir, duty calls.
N: He exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters.
C: BERTIE
D: Is this the scene of the crime?
C: COSMO LANG
D: What a peculiar thing to say.
C: BERTIE
D: Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box. I have, however, categorically said no to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures" gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.
C: BERTIE
D: Radio with pictures?!
C: COSMO LANG
D: It is called..."television". Happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this "TV" thing has no future. We shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which I shall personally edit.
C: BERTIE
D: That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 93.
C: BERTIE
D: What exactly do you mean?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Something...discreet...private. We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. Or even find an actor with a similar voice.
N: Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows.
C: LIONEL
D: A King based upon deception?
N: Cosmo takes Bertie aside.
C: COSMO LANG
D: If your gentleman from Security would give us space, we could discuss this in private.
C: BERTIE
D: You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?"
N: Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie confidentially.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks." You see, I've paved the way. But should you wish to avoid further stress...
C: LIONEL
D: Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Pardon?!
C: LIONEL
D: If you wish to call attention to his anxiety.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking? He certainly doesn't know his place! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 94.
C: BERTIE
D: Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your Majesty was seeking assistance I would've made my own recommendation.
C: BERTIE
D: Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor.
C: LIONEL
D: Just Lionel.
C: BERTIE
D: Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.
C: COSMO LANG
D: The Royal Box!? Your Family will be seated there.
C: BERTIE
D: Which makes it most suitable.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Perhaps I might be able to add a very small stool.
C: BERTIE
D: Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The Queen.
C: COSMO LANG
D: I'll have someone attend to it.
C: LIONEL
D: And now, if you don't mind, we need the premises.
C: COSMO LANG
D: My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey! The Church must make preparations.
C: LIONEL
D: So must Bertie.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 95.
C: LIONEL
D: I do. During waking hours we'll need the facilities. It'll be a closed set. No observers.
C: BERTIE
D: Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
N: Lang nods curtly and exits.
C: BERTIE
D: You've made a dangerous enemy.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: Wouldn't want him as a friend.
C: BERTIE
D: And don't ever call me Bertie in public.
N: A moment of confrontation. Lionel knows he's overstepped.
C: LIONEL
D: Tell me...
C: BERTIE
D: I sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon.
C: LIONEL
D: Do you really want to be King?
C: BERTIE
D: Knew it! I haven't any choice.
C: LIONEL
D: You can be a wounded King who stumbles through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all. Always a choice.
C: BERTIE
D: What's this, you wait til Westminster Abbey, then ambush me?
C: LIONEL
D: I'm simply asking questions... which you seem unable to answer.
C: BERTIE
D: I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter! Damn you! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 96.
C: LIONEL
D: Quite possibly. But at least I know what I want. You haven't the foggiest.
C: BERTIE
D: I WANT TO BE HEARD!
E: explodes
N: His words reverberate through the empty abbey.
C: LIONEL
D: That's quite different. Let's get down to work then, shall we?
N: Bertie glares at him.
C: LIONEL
D: As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time.
E: CONT'D
N: Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'.
C: LIONEL
D: You'll then show yourself to the various sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop announces four times in a loud voice, "Sirs, I here present unto you..." Have you decided your name for when you become King? For when you become a different person?
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: George.
C: LIONEL
D: Like your father?
C: BERTIE
D: Like my father.
C: LIONEL
D: Not Albert?
C: BERTIE
D: Given the current situation...too Germanic.
C: LIONEL
D: "Sirs, I here present unto you, GEORGE, your undoubted King!" TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 97.
N: "George, your undoubted King!" echoes through the Abby.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
N: Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone:
C: COSMO LANG
D: I've made inquiries.
S: INT. LOGUE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him.
C: MYRTLE
D: A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm.
C: LIONEL
D: Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely.
C: MYRTLE
D: You look done in.
C: LIONEL
D: I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation.
C: MYRTLE
D: I've news for you. I'm not!
C: LIONEL
D: You must.
C: MYRTLE
D: Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse?
C: LIONEL
D: Royal Box. You and I.
N: Stunned silence, then.
C: MYRTLE
D: Lionel...I'd need a new dress.
C: LIONEL
D: Rather thought you might.
N: Valentine calls from the next room: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 98.
C: VALENTINE
D: Dad! Phone! For you!
E: O.S.
C: LIONEL
D: Won't be a sec.
N: He exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey.
S: INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT
N: The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang. He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:
C: COSMO LANG
D: "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of a King."
N: He exits. THE CAMERA explores various elements: The Throne of Edward the Confessor. Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone. Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next Coronation rehearsal. Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs. Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use. Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. This Abbey holds the history of a nation. Footsteps resonate. Lionel enters. Trips over one of the gravestones.
C: LIONEL
D: Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...?
N: Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral.
C: BERTIE
D: This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 99.
C: LIONEL
D: Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock.
C: BERTIE
D: "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve.
E: barely controlled
C: LIONEL
D: Want to hear my side of the story?
C: BERTIE
D: There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life!
C: LIONEL
D: Wembley Stadium...
E: softly
C: BERTIE
D: You dare remind me?!
C: LIONEL
D: I was there.
C: BERTIE
D: Then you knew from the start I was hopeless?!
C: LIONEL
D: My son, Valentine, asked, "Could you help that poor man?" I replied, "He's too old for me to manage a complete cure, but I could very nearly do it, I'm sure of that."
C: BERTIE
D: Lying bastard!
C: LIONEL
D: I knew I could help you. You refuse to believe?
C: BERTIE
D: In you?! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 100.
C: LIONEL
D: In yourself.
C: BERTIE
D: Who the hell do you think you are?!
C: LIONEL
D: A failed actor.
C: BERTIE
D: Actor?
C: LIONEL
D: Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I couldn't cut flesh. So I worked in the mines, recited in pubs...
C: BERTIE
D: An actor?!
C: LIONEL
D: When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine.
C: BERTIE
D: I know nothing of those poor men!
C: LIONEL
D: I think you do. They had cried out, and the universe had not listened. So they'd lost faith in their voice. My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: "I have the right to be heard!"
C: BERTIE
D: I suppose that helped them, did it?
C: LIONEL
D: Make inquiries.
C: BERTIE
D: Inquiries have been made! No credentials.
C: LIONEL
D: But a lot of success. No training was given. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 101.
E: MORE
C: LIONEL
D: Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: To Harley Street?!
C: LIONEL
D: Cashed in our return tickets. I had three months rent.
C: BERTIE
D: So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors!
C: LIONEL
D: The plaque says, `L. Logue. Speech Specialist'. No mention of a medical degree. No mention of any degree. Some of the diggers I'd helped had come to England. They made referrals. My practice flourished. My acting, however, did not.
C: BERTIE
D: Well enough to deceive me.
C: LIONEL
D: Lock me in the Tower.
C: BERTIE
D: I would if I could!
C: LIONEL
D: What crime?
C: BERTIE
D: You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist!
N: Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor. Leaning against it is the great two-handed sword of St. George.
C: BERTIE
D: What're you doing? Get up! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 102.
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: I'm tired.
C: BERTIE
D: You can't sit there!
C: LIONEL
D: Why not? It's a chair.
C: BERTIE
D: It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned.
C: LIONEL
D: It's falling apart. People have carved their initials into it. Needs a stone to keep from blowing away.
C: BERTIE
D: That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow.
C: LIONEL
D: You believe such ballocks I don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached. You're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real.
C: BERTIE
D: Listen to me... !
C: LIONEL
D: Listen to you?! By what right?
C: BERTIE
D: Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
C: LIONEL
D: Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself. Said you didn't want it. So why should I listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another? Why waste my time listening to you?
C: BERTIE
D: Because I have a right to be heard!
C: LIONEL
D: Heard as what?!
C: BERTIE
D: A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 103.
C: LIONEL
D: Well then...you're cured.
E: quietly
C: BERTIE
D: Stop trying to squirm off the hook.
C: LIONEL
D: Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And you know it.
N: Bertie stares at him. A familiar voice is heard from the shadows.
C: VOICE
D: Your Majesty?
N: The Archbishop of Canterbury.
C: COSMO LANG
D: You'll be relieved to learn I've found a replacement specialist. Impeccable credentials.
N: There's a long silence.
C: BERTIE
D: That won't be necessary.
C: COSMO LANG
D: The matter's already been settled. For your own well-being.
C: BERTIE
D: What did you say?
C: COSMO LANG
D: Your Majesty's function is to consult...and to be advised. You didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
C: BERTIE
D: Now I advise you, so listen carefully. ...in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
C: COSMO LANG
D: May I remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head.
C: BERTIE
D: And may I remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 104.
C: COSMO LANG
D: This will end badly.
N: Lang turns on his heel. Lionel ignores what has just happened.
C: LIONEL
D: In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King!
N: The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard.
S: INT. ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S SCREENING ROOM - NEW DAY
N: On the screen: archive footage of the Coronation, capturing the pomp and ceremony. Cigar smoke rises up. The voices of Churchill and Lang can be heard.
C: COSMO LANG
D: I was much moved
E: O.S.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: There were tears in my eyes too, Your Grace, particularly when I saw you and the Dean of Westminster cannoning into each other.
E: O.S.
C: COSMO LANG
D: That's been edited.
E: O.S.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: More tears when our new Monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops treading on his robe.
E: O.S.
C: COSMO LANG
D: To the world, all went splendidly.
E: O.S.
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms.
N: The footage freezes momentarily. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 105.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Now, Winston, I have something which will bring tears to your eyes.
E: O.S.
N: The archive footage continues, but it is not of the Coronation. David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute. FREEZE FRAME. The lights come on. For once, Churchill is speechless.
C: COSMO LANG
D: There's no doubt: David is planning a comeback. And will succeed if our King continues to falter. Though Bertie miraculously survived the Coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed. Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler will be listening. David will be listening. Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening. Everyone will be listening. God help us.
E: CONT'D
C: BERTIE
D: "In this grave hour... "
E: V.O. stuttering very badly
S: INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY
N: Bertie and Logue are rehearsing.
C: BERTIE
D: "In this grave hour... " Sorry.
C: LIONEL
D: Try again.
C: BERTIE
D: "In this grave hour... "
C: LIONEL
D: Turn the halts into pauses, during which you say to yourself, "God save the King".
C: BERTIE
D: I say that all the time, but apparently no one's listening.
C: LIONEL
D: Use the silence. Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions.
C: BERTIE
D: Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived. Lionel, I can't do this! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 106.
N: Logue tries to protest, Bertie over-rides.
C: BERTIE
D: If I am to be King...where is my power? May I form a Government on my own, appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war? None of these things. Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak, I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak!
E: CONT'D
N: Logue totally ignores the outburst.
C: LIONEL
D: Take it from the top. "In this grave hour..."
C: BERTIE
D: "In this grave hour, p-p-perhaps..."
E: hesitates, then
C: LIONEL
D: Go on...
C: BERTIE
D: The letter`P' is always difficult.
C: LIONEL
D: Get a running start, put the words all together. `Perhaps-the-most-fateful...'
C: BERTIE
D: "In this grave hour...perhaps-the-most- fateful...in our history..."
C: LIONEL
D: Beaut.
C: BERTIE
D: "... I send to every household of my peoples...both at home and overseas..."
C: LIONEL
D: Doo-dah, doo-dah.
E: SINGS
C: BERTIE
D: "...this message... "
C: LIONEL
D: Five miles long... TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 107.
E: SINGS
C: BERTIE
D: "...spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you... as if I were able..."
C: LIONEL
D: In your head, now: "Bugger, bugger, bugger! Damn, damn, damn! All those bloody blighters are going to have to listen to me!" Can you dance?
C: BERTIE
D: What?
C: LIONEL
D: Helps relax the body. Waltz?
E: goes to record player
C: BERTIE
D: I prefer pipes.
C: LIONEL
D: Thought you might. Dance with me. One, two, one-two-three- four. One, two, one- two-three-four. "For the second time..." one-two-three-four "... in the lives of most of us..." one, two, one-two-three- four "... we are at war." Three, four.
E: starts a bagpipe record of "Scotland The Brave"
N: Dancing at arm's length with Logue, Bertie repeats:
C: BERTIE
D: "For the second time... in the lives of most of us... we are at war." One-two- three. "Over and over again... we have tried to find a peaceful way... out of the differences... between ourselves... and those who are now our enemies." Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
E: continues on
C: LIONEL
D: You'll be ready.
C: BERTIE
D: The shilling you won... still have it?
E: pause
C: LIONEL
D: Of course. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 108.
N: Bertie holds out his hand, demandingly. Somewhat hurt, Lionel hands it over.
C: BERTIE
D: I'll return it.
N: Bertie leaves with the shilling, exiting the back way. Logue opens the waiting room door.
C: LIONEL
D: Willie! Where's your mum?
C: WILLIE
D: She had to work.
E: stuttering painfully
C: LIONEL
D: You've been waiting here, alone, all this time?
N: Willie nods again. Then, haltingly:
C: WILLIE
D: I heard the King.
C: LIONEL
D: Did you?
C: WILLIE
D: He sang. And shouted rude words.
C: LIONEL
D: He did.
N: Willie beams.
C: LIONEL
D: Would you like to sing, dance, and shout rude words?
E: CONT'D
C: WILLIE
D: I would!
E: NO STUTTER
C: LIONEL
D: Why am I not surprised?
S: INT. KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW NIGHT
N: The dreaded BBC microphone. The room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio for this all-important occasion. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 109. The BBC News Reader and Floor Manager are there, along with a small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their equipment.
C: FLOOR MANAGER
D: Think he'll manage?
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: I've heard he may not even show.
N: The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes. Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth watch nervously.
C: BERTIE
D: `Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man.'
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: If you'll be so kind, to let me show you...
E: placating
C: BERTIE
D: I already know. My father taught me.
N: He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with the little finger, thumb to chin. The Reader scurries off and tells the others.
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: His father taught him. I taught his father.
C: BERTIE
D: Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody bloody...
E: testing the microphone
C: ELIZABETH
D: Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on!
C: LIONEL
D: You're going to be splendid. And if you're not?
C: BERTIE
D: They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 110.
C: LIONEL
D: Bloody right.
N: Lang and Churchill have entered. Elizabeth forces herself to greet them graciously.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of you to join us.
C: COSMO LANG
D: Wouldn't miss this for the world. Congratulations. Neville didn't last long, did he? Talking to Hitler.
E: to Churchill
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight.
N: Bertie and Logue speak privately.
C: BERTIE
D: No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense?
C: LIONEL
D: I've always wanted to be knighted.
E: lighty...yet seriously
C: BERTIE
D: Sorry. That would raise too many questions.
C: LIONEL
D: Understood.
E: pause, then
N: Bertie takes something from his pocket.
C: BERTIE
D: Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back.
C: LIONEL
D: Keep it for good luck.
C: BERTIE
D: No, you won this, fair and square.
N: The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 111.
C: BERTIE
D: Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that?
E: CONT'D
C: LIONEL
D: My greatest honour, Bertie. One final question.
E: then
C: BERTIE
D: Oh dear.
C: LIONEL
D: Do you believe you're King?
N: A very long pause.
C: BERTIE
D: Almost.
N: The red light on the microphone starts to blink. Logue joins the others. The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast booth. Five, four, three, two...
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: Good evening, this is the BBC National and World programme, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.
N: During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms reappear. Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished. It seems an eternity. Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles. Lang's eyes roll heavenward. Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach. Bertie and Logue stare at each other. Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's worked with. His confidence is contagious. Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's practiced. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 112.
S: INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT
N: The luminous dial of a wireless. Unbearable silence. Then:
C: BERTIE
D: In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas...
E: V.O. RADIO FILTER
N: This is being listened to by Myrtle and the boys. The boys look at their mum. Suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio address continues:
S: INT./EXT. MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN ENGLAND AND AROUND
C: THE
D: WORLD - NIGHT OR DAY, DEPENDING ON LOCATION
N: In homes, pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose), clubs, hotels, boarding houses, factories, mines, prisons, a shearing shed in New Zealand, cattle station in Australia, sites in India, South Africa, loci around the Commonwealth and Empire. China. Japan. The Kremlin. The White House. Hitler's mountain top wolf den. The South of France (where David and Wallis listen dolefully.) During this, the address continues, with dramatic pauses to be sure, but no real hesitations.
C: BERTIE
D: ...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 113.
E: V.O. ON RADIO MORE
N: BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D) But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us. End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham Palace. Outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech on loudspeakers. PAN THEIR FACES, the faces of England, stalwart and resolved.
C: BERTIE
D: For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. THE PRINCESSES PLAYROOM - NIGHT
N: The two girls listen to their father on the radio.
C: BERTIE
D: If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's help, we shall prevail.
E: V.O. ON RADIO
N: Lilibet's expression tells it all - she can hear it, her father is truly King.
S: INT. KING'S STUDY/BROADCAST ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE -
N: CONTINUOUS Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly magnificent. Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 114.
C: BERTIE
D: We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, I would like to say to you: `I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and uphold us all.
E: CONT'D
N: IN THE AD HOC `CONTROL BOOTH' AREA - the Manager makes a `cut' gesture to Bertie, he's off the air, the red light on the microphone goes out. The Manager points, and the red light on the Reader's microphone goes on.
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: This concludes the BBC broadcast of the King's Speech.
N: Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes out and the transmission is concluded. The Floor Manager looks to the Reader.
C: BBC NEWS READER
D: He wasn't perfect. Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.
E: CONT'D softly barely controlling his tears
N: AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his peers. Churchill first:
C: WINSTON CHURCHILL
D: Couldn't have said it better myself.
N: The ultimate compliment. Lang next.
C: COSMO LANG
D: I'm speechless.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thank God.
E: softly
N: She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes his hand, then Logue's. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 115.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Well done, Bertie. Well done... ...Lionel. Well done.
E: CONT'D for the first time
N: She leaves the two men together.
C: LIONEL
D: I always called you Bertie. Today, I call you King.
N: He offers his hand. But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him by the shoulders and gives him a hug. This is a long way from the five pace rule. The last barrier has fallen. Scroll: CARD 1 - KING GEORGE VI RALLIED HIS NATION DURING WWII, UNITING THE COMMONWEALTH, REFUSING TO LEAVE LONDON DURING THE BLITZ. HE DIED ON FEBRUARY 6TH 1952. HE WAS KNOWN AS 'THE GOOD KING'. CARD 2 - LIONEL LOGUE PASSED AWAY SHORTLY AFTER HIS FRIEND BERTIE. HIS STORY REMAINS UNKNOWN. EVEN IN AUSTRALIA. THE END
