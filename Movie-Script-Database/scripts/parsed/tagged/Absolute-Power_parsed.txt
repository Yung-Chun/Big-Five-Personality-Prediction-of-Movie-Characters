S: INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
N: The saddest eyes you ever saw. We are looking at an El Greco drawing. It is a study for one of his paintings. PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes, the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so brilliantly. Most of the students are around 20. A couple of suburban housewives are there too. And one older man. This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
T: successful company executive.
N: As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss nothing: He has pilot's eyes. We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the hero of this piece. As we watch him draw -- Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff. Luther. It's not good enough for him. He looks at his work a moment, shakes his head.
C: GIRL STUDENT
D: Don't give up.
C: LUTHER
D: I never do.
C: GIRL STUDENT
D: May I?
N: She's indicated his sketchbook. He nods. She starts thumbing through. The sketchbook as the pages turn. Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good. The hands are better. Very skillful. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 2. The GIRL hands it back. Impressed.
C: GIRL STUDENT
D: You work with your hands, don't you?
N: CLOSEUP - LUTHER * An enigmatic smile. Now, from that --
S: EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY
N: A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the houses neat and well tended. Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.
S: INT. RED'S BAR - DAY
N: Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.
C: LUTHER
D: Redhead.
E: as they nod to each other
C: RED
D: Luther. Your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a V.C.R.
E: as Luther hands him a videotape
C: LUTHER
D: My only failing.
N: As he turns --
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: A street of small row houses. Clean, well tended. Luther walks toward one. Later in the afternoon. He carries half a dozen small shopping bags, from the market, the hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.
S: EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door. Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly, bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front door.
S: INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer, lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food away --
S: INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT
N: Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle. Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it down. A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young. Luther studies the photo a moment. Then he turns, looks out the window. POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON is visible. Lovely. Peaceful. LUTHER Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the hands and eyes and faces -- -- we are looking at something totally different: a mansion. HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion. KEEP HOLDING. PULL BACK to reveal --
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing. But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and power. We're in rolling hill country. The mansion is dark. Totally deserted. Silence. Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides to a stop. Again, silence... HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away. There is a small field between the car and the estate. Now --
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
N: A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars, begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream -- -- it's Luther, and he's been a professional thief his entire life. He's a three-time loser, but his last sentence was so long ago and his skills are now so vast, so refined, that it is unlikely he will ever get caught again.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
N: The grounds as Luther glides through it. He wears a backpack. The night is cool. He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't gorgeous -- it's no-man's land. One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off, in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground. He makes no sound at all.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
N: Thick wood with reinforced steel. Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT
N: The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down: forty, thirty-nine, thirty --
T: CUT TO:
N: LUTHER -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more than six inches long -- -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside in the foyer next to the front door. The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --
T: CUT TO:
N: SECURITY DETECTOR Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --
T: CUT TO:
N: SCREWDRIVER Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts the security panel away. The BEEPING sound is constant -- -- and getting louder. A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.
T: CUT TO:
N: SECURITY DETECTOR Eighteen, seventeen --
T: CUT TO:
N: LUTHER probing with the wires into the heart of the security panel. The BEEPING is LOUDER still. The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe with the wires and --
T: CUT TO:
N: SECURITY DETECTOR Eleven, ten --
T: CUT TO:
N: LUTHER and he's got it attached! COMPUTER Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers -- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out clearly.
T: CUT TO:
N: SECURITY DETECTOR Four, three, two --
T: CUT TO:
N: FACE OF TINY COMPUTER as five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 -- The BEEPING sound dies.
T: CUT TO:
N: LUTHER A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security detector go from red to a warm looking green. Safe. He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again, unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work quickly, precisely.
S: 25A INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT 25A
N: The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack, moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place. It's as if he hadn't been there at all...
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
N: Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight. A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. Very sad. Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment -- -- then surprisingly he raises his hand, and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was done, as if getting ready for his next museum session -- -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
N: Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an overpowering sense of being alone -- -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow," moves on.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor. The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three. We watch the child grow up in these photos. At ten she is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 8. Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into, if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader. These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a shot in front of a Burger King at twenty. CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH * Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil here. Now -- PULL BACK to reveal -- A glorious and expensive white wedding dress. Christy holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking. KEEP PULLING BACK. And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride. Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old. Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head. Now he moves on.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside, closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down, takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up. Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied bed. A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop the other, several more photos of the happy couple -- -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle. Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large full-length mirror across from the canopied bed. Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself, he's studying the mirror itself. He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large TV and VCR. Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at the large mirror, clicks once -- -- and the mirror swings silently open. A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this: There is an armchair in the middle facing where the mirror had been. Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote held in his hand. The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together. Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed room --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT
N: It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally, piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables we'll get around to. Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for. He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it that is identical to the one he replaced at the side table. Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work. First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of slender boxes -- The first box as Luther opens it. Jewelry. Into the duffel it goes. Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel. And still more. As he continues to do this --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a friendly green. Now, from somewhere, a distant sound. LAUGHTER? Was it laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 10.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds. Into the duffel they go. He takes a breath, glances around. Perfect. Coins. Antique ones. They disappear into the duffel. Stamp books. Gone into the swelling duffel. Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER. Not so perfect.
S: 33 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 33 *
N: He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two people. A man and a woman. Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: -- Luther is alone in the darkness. A burst of LAUGHTER now. Growing nearer still. Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down, doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped, Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe... Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened. HOLD.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside the open bedroom door. Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER. The Woman closes the bedroom door. Darkness again. And now the LAUGHING sound increases. GIGGLING, really.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED but it is there. He is starting to perspire.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and it's over. Luther blinks, confused, looks around -- -- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught. The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is staring straight into the goddamn bedroom. Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen. Just a few feet away, just outside the door. Where things are clearly starting to heat up. Luther moves to the armchair, sits. There is nothing to do now but wait. He settles in.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: They are staring at each other. We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN. But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice. This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman. Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered black dress. An expensive necklace. One more thing: she is staggering drunk. The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit. Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she is. Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers. He fills them, gives one to her. They touch glasses. Down the hatch. Tight laughter. He looks at her. She looks at him. There's a lot of sexual tension in the air. But now he begins looking around, checking things out. She spots this.
C: CHRISTY
D: It's okay -- I told him I was sick -- anyway, he's gone -- relax...
E: drunk
N: He nods then, more at ease. And he blows her a kiss. She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him. Her body moving very slowly. He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches. Now --
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the room -- What she's looking at: the side table with the remote that opens the vault.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The table and the remote waiting there.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, mouth dry... )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 13.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him; he takes her by the hand -- -- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get fancy, spin her with one arm -- -- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose balance, separate. They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in * the drawer of the nightstand -- *
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther. A genuine sigh of relief -- -- which suddenly dies --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with the necklace in her hand.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into his tumbler, chugging it down and now... The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther dead in the water because -- CHRISTY'S pointing the goddam thing at him -- -- and as she CLICKS it -- )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 14.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught in the headlights -- -- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find out why.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer. * Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her breasts -- -- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to say, "naughty, naughty" -- -- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a smile. She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples. Christy moans.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes. But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more insistent.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket, reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at themselves.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces are just a couple of feet away -- )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 15.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - CHRISTY - NIGHT
N: as Richmond's hands move across her wondrous body and she is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes close and -- CLOSE ON RICHMOND * as his eyes are open -- -- the look on his drunken face is scary.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND
N: IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied bed.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him like that, her eyes shut tight --
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut, they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the awful look from before is back, only worse, and then without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly -- -- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond smiles at her sweetly. Christy. Shaking her head. Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology. Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him. Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully- handsome man. Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger, reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth. It's a sweet moment. They smile. Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously, right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor. Christy sits there stunned.
C: CHRISTY
D: You fucking bastard.
E: slurred
N: And on that -- Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up. Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as she is on her feet -- Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, silently applauding.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Richmond, the air momentarily out of him, falling drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just a moment and clearly in pain, but he is a big man and he is strong and he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both are laboring on the floor and Christy kicks him again and again -- -- but he will not release her ankle. Each kick only inflames his drunken rage.
C: RICHMOND
D: You little whore --
E: very slurred --
N: And now they both try and stand. Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her. Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her fingers scratching deeply -- -- but he will not let go. She twists and jerks her body -- -- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her throat -- -- and spreads his legs for better balance. The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches around for something, anything -- her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she slashes his right arm. Now he lets go. And stares, stunned, at his bleeding arm. Then he crunches her flush in the mouth, a brutal blow, and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she weren't so scared, maybe it would have stopped her, but it doesn't -- because somehow she manages to maintain balance -- -- and knees him all she has, in the nuts. It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless. He lies on his back, holding his crotch. But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face, stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her hand. And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage -- -- and she drops to her knees beside him -- -- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her -- -- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener -- -- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her -- -- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high above her head, the point aimed at his heart -- -- and Richmond screams one time -- -- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway, GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before the opener reaches Richmond's heart...
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does -- -- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack, mouth open -- -- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has prepared him for this -- -- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body loses strength, he tries to look away, can't -- -- and this is what he sees --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Christy, fighting for another instant of life -- -- no chance -- -- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the rug, she collapses like a rag doll -- -- and blood is everywhere.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther. Back in regular motion now. Pale, barely able to breathe.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The two well-dressed men in business suits. BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating. But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He puts his gun away, goes to Richmond. TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He puts his gun away, goes to Christy. Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages to pick up the bloody letter opener.
C: RICHMOND
D: Kill her?
N: Collin, by the body, nods.
C: BURTON
D: No choice in the matter.
N: His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked. Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't. Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he passes out cold. Burton and Collin look at each other now.
C: BURTON
D: Jesus, Tim, what did we do?
C: COLLIN
D: No choice in the matter.
E: echoing Burton
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but so is something new: anger. And on that --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door. Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart. Now she sees what's happened, stops dead. Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin. It's very clear from the outset: these three are not friendly. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 20.
C: RUSSELL
D: Do you realize what a shitstorm we're in? Go on -- tell me.
E: to Burton and Collin beat
C: COLLIN
D: Nothing to tell. He screamed.
C: RUSSELL
D: And you heard no sounds of violence 'til then?
C: BURTON
D: Nothing we haven't heard before.
E: beat
N: Richmond, on the bed, out. Russell studies his face as Burton moves toward the telephone.
C: BURTON
D: Maybe I should call the police now.
N: CLOSEUP - RUSSELL *
C: RUSSELL
D: Bill? Why don't you think about that? Take a second and just think about that. Think... real... fucking... hard.
E: soft beat -- starting to move toward him closing in on Burton, furious
N: BURTON * He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.
C: BURTON
D: Probably not a good idea.
E: backing away
C: RUSSELL
D: Okay -- here's what happened tonight -- poor Christy came home alone and interrupted a burglary. That sound logical?
E: taking charge
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther in the closet. He nods.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Burton and Collin nod, too.
C: RUSSELL
D: We're going to have to sanitize this place. Alan, did you have sex with her?
E: shaking Richmond
N: Richmond, eyes barely open.
C: RICHMOND
D: ... Don'... 'member...
C: RUSSELL
D: Bill, you're going to have to examine her.
C: BURTON
D: I'm no gynecologist.
C: RUSSELL
D: I just made you one.
E: she takes nothing from nobody
N: End of discussion.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
N: A clock on the side table beside the three clickers. There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now. The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has been made with clean sheets. There is a large black garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug. Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom. Everyone wears gloves. Everything that is incriminating is gone -- -- except the letter opener, which has been put in a clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.
C: RUSSELL
D: I'll take that.
C: COLLIN
D: It's got their prints on it.
E: surprised
C: RUSSELL
D: Thanks for sharing.
E: she holds out her hand
N: Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table when suddenly -- Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying out --
C: RICHMOND
D: Gloria -- I killed her --
N: Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down -- -- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall, uses the bed table to try to steady himself.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, stunned, staring.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight. Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him from the room --
C: RUSSELL
D: It's all going to be fine, Alan.
C: RICHMOND
D: ... But she's dead...
C: RUSSELL
D: ... I'll take care of everything just like I always do. Gentlemen?
E: to Burton and Collin
N: She gestures to leave. Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then -- Collin stops dead. He stares across at the bed table.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: Luther, holding his breath.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT
C: COLLIN
D: Shit.
C: BURTON
D: What?
N: In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm and leaves. Burton flicks the light out, closes the door. The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.
S: EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
N: It's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway. Burton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly -- it makes a loud, solid sound.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - LUTHER - NIGHT
N: The sound is barely audible. He has been looking at his watch -- The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top. Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence. The WATCH face: the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell free to open the back door. Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it, moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the road. The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond comfortably stretched out on the back seat.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he moves into action. -- He points the clicker at the door -- -- the door starts to swing open -- -- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the clicker back inside.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - ARMCHAIR - NIGHT
N: as the clicker lands -- dead-solid perfect --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand, carrying his backpack -- -- he slows as he circles the body of Christy Sullivan, looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO... )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 25. The bed table. First, Luther opens the drawer and * pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind * the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener! In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it. He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house. He looks out, grimaces.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: The cars are still there. Burton is visible helping Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the door. He and Burton move to the front doors.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers -- -- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the window.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - TOWNCAR - NIGHT
N: Collin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat. Russell -- -- a moment of relief. She breathes deep. And as Russell starts to open her purse --
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - KNOTTED ROPE - NIGHT
N: as it snakes down the brick mansion -- it reaches the ground.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther, putting his backpack on securely. The window -- Luther glances out and down. HIS POV - GROUND OUTSIDE SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT Forty feet below. And it's dark. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 26.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and the backpack wedged against the corner of the window -- -- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.
S: 91 EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT 91 *
N: Gloria Russell, as every nightmare she has ever had comes true -- the fucking letter opener isn't in her purse and as she screams again --
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - WINDOW - NIGHT
N: Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he is in serious trouble and...
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: The Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come barrelling out.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again, starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT
N: Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the lead.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster -- -- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten, so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly flying.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: Russell, standing by the Towncar, staring in at the house and from the look on her face, you know she thinks her life might be over.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
N: Burton and Collin, racing up the second floor staircase toward the top.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther, halfway down.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Burton and Collin, tearing along the third floor corridor.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther, ten feet off the ground now.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: The bedroom door, flying open.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the rest of the way, hits the ground running.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Burton, racing toward the window, Collin goes to the night table.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT
N: Luther, at the end of the house, turning a corner.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Burton, staring out the window and Luther is gone. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 28.
C: BURTON
D: Shit!
N: Collin, looking around the table and the letter opener is gone.
C: COLLIN
D: Shit!
N: And without another word, they bolt out the door.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
N: Luther, crashing through the field. He is in wonderful shape -- -- for a man his age. And he gives it all he has but is it going to be enough?
S: EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: The Towncar as Collin yanks something out of the glove compartment, and then he is racing off into the night after Burton who is a few steps ahead.
S: 109 EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT 109 *
N: Russell staring after them -- in the back seat, Richmond is in a half-slumber.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT
N: Luther, bursting out of the underbrush -- -- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him -- -- one hundred yards of open field. He runs on.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT
N: as Collin catches up to the other man, tosses what he took from the glove compartment. Thermal goggles. They put them on, on the fly and... THERMAL POV The world ahead of them as they see it: their FIELD OF VISION now resembles a rough computer game. THERMAL IMAGES register in red, everything else is dark green.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - LUTHER - NIGHT
N: Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through the open field and... Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but they are moving faster -- -- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight -- -- but Collin can fly. And he begins to leave Burton behind. Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and his breath coming in gasps and... Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just ahead is the open field and as he starts into it -- THERMAL POV What Collin sees: a THERMAL figure; a man running out of the open and then disappearing into the woods.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT
N: The sight of the figure is enough to kick Collin into overdrive and he has never run this fast as he crosses the open area.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
N: Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances back -- -- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it rocks him, drops him to his knees --
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - OPEN AREA - NIGHT
N: Collin and he could be jet propelled.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
N: Luther, forcing himself back to his feet and running again, giving it everything he has left and he's dodging through the trees now.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NEAR WOODS - NIGHT
N: Burton, behind Collin, but he draws his gun anyway -- Collin, in the woods, and his gun's drawn too -- Luther, out of the woods and now his car is visible -- Collin, in the woods but they're coming to an end. THERMAL POV The figure up ahead is approaching a car.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Luther, throwing the car door open, ripping off his backpack, tossing it inside, jumping in behind the wheel.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
N: Burton. Pulling up, gasping terribly. He sinks to one knee. Collin, out of the woods! -- Still amazingly without the least sign of tiring -- -- and now there is a sound: a CAR MOTOR STARTING.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Luther in his car, wheels spinning.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
N: Collin has his pistol ready but it's impossible to hit anything when you're running like this.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Luther, in the car, GUNNING AWAY.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT
N: Collin. Slowing.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT
N: The car. A swirl of dust. The dust clears. The car rounds a corner, is gone.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN GROUNDS - NIGHT
N: Collin. He stands there, rips off his thermal goggles -- -- and surprisingly, he smiles. Burton, getting to his feet, his breath still not steady. He takes his goggles off too as Collin approaches.
C: COLLIN
D: I got his license number.
E: still the smile
N: Now on that --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Russell -- back in the bedroom, with Burton and Collin who are moving around constantly, checking the place out. Things are just amazingly tense.
C: RUSSELL
D: Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman -- don't forget to check under the bed -- -- You may have buried us! --
E: close to losing it exploding
C: COLLIN
D: -- relax, I got his license number, remember? --
C: RUSSELL
D: -- you think he's going to just sit around waiting for us? -- Asshole --
E: whirling on him
C: COLLIN
D: -- take it easy, Miss Russell --
C: BURTON
D: -- everybody shut up, all right?
E: trying for calm
N: He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror. He crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug. The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet.
C: BURTON
D: Oh boy...
N: Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror. The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT
N: All three going inside, looking around. The chair, the looted shelves. The truth thuds home. Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door.
C: RUSSELL
D: A two-way mirror.
E: dead
N: Silently, they move out into the bedroom.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
C: COLLIN
D: -- I better get cracking on that license number --
C: RUSSELL
D: -- it's all we've got -- and he's got the letter opener -- blood, fingerprints -- Jesus, think what he can do --
E: no anger now
C: BURTON
D: -- the man is a thief -- a thief who witnessed a murder --
E: a powerful man who speaks softly MORE
C: BURTON
D: -- it looks like he stole a whole bunch of money -- I'll tell you what he's going to do. He's going to run like hell.
E: CONT'D gesturing around beat
N: And on that --
S: INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
N: The saddest eyes you ever saw. It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are there too. So are the suburban housewives. Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful -- -- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning the room. Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not calm and peaceful. The guard checks the room again. Edgy, Luther still works away. The guard leaves. Luther gets set to do the same.
S: INT. RED'S BAR - DAY
N: Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee. It's before the place has opened for the day. Luther comes in the back. Red slides the videocassette over, Luther pockets it.
C: RED
D: Jordan beat us at the buzzer.
C: LUTHER
D: Bad night.
N: And as he turns, goes --
S: EXT. JOGGING PARK - PARKING AREA - DAY
N: A YOUNG WOMAN parking her car -- a high rocky area above the Potomac. Below, a jogging path is visible, full of runners. The Young Woman gets out, locks her car, starts down a narrow walk toward the joggers. She's in her mid-thirties. A good face. And there's something familiar about her.
S: EXT. JOGGING PARK - DAY
N: Luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path, studying the runners. Now he registers something: and smiles. The Woman in her mid-thirties as she comes jogging along. She runs well. Luther. An imperceptible straightening of his clothes. The jogger. We realize who she is: the little girl in the photo on Luther's dining room table. All grown up. Now her face registers something: his presence. Her eyes go down to the path, she increases her speed. Luther. Waving, calling out.
C: LUTHER
D: Kate. Kate.
E: as she runs on
N: She slows, hesitates, stops. Kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge of the path as he approaches. The river flows behind them. Runners pass by. Beat.
C: LUTHER
D: Probably too late for me to take it up.
N: She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.
C: LUTHER
D: The jogging.
C: KATE
D: Ahh.
E: YOUNG WOMAN
N: Beat.
C: LUTHER
D: Dumb way to start this, I guess.
N: Beat.
C: LUTHER
D: Wanted to talk to you.
C: KATE
D: About?
C: LUTHER
D: Believe it or not, the weather. Nights are starting to get cold.
E: as she waits
C: KATE
D: That happens this time of year.
N: Luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.
C: LUTHER
D: I was thinking of maybe relocating. Someplace with a kinder climate. I just wanted to check it out with you first... ... you're the only family I've got.
E: nothing shows on her face still nothing
N: And on that -- Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.
C: KATE
D: Luther, you don't have me.
N: The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you can't tell from his face.
C: LUTHER
D: Kate --
C: KATE
D: -- you know what it's like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?
C: LUTHER
D: This move -- I'm talking permanent, you understand.
C: KATE
D: We don't see each other anyway -- we haven't seen each other since Mom died and that's a year. Look, you chose your life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have no plans to be around for you.
E: a step toward him
N: And now she stops, turns away toward the path -- -- Luther can say nothing, watches her -- -- then she spins back --
C: KATE
D: -- wait a minute -- you're lying about something, aren't you? --
E: louder now
C: LUTHER
D: -- no --
C: KATE
D: -- are you active again? -- is that why you're here now?
C: LUTHER
D: -- no --
N: Kate moves in close now --
C: KATE
D: -- I don't believe you -- -- Christ, Father, what have you done?
E: big
N: And on those words --
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
N: Christy Sullivan's body. We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The place is covered with black fingerprint powder. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 37. SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright, funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at him. He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies Christy; sadly shakes his head.
C: SETH
D: Christy Sullivan?
C: MEDICAL EXAMINER
D: Wife of Walter -- most likely came home and stumbled onto a burglary --
E: nods
C: WOMAN
D: -- some burglary.
E: O.S.
N: LAURA SIMON. Laura is early 30s, and the best lab technician Seth has ever known, and he knew some good ones in New York.
C: LAURA SIMON
D: I wish my carpets were this clean. And I can't find a single decent * fingerprint.
C: SETH
D: You serious, Laura?
C: LAURA SIMON
D: It's like Mary Poppins was here.
E: bewildered
C: SETH
D: Could someone have let him in?
C: LAURA SIMON
D: Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago.
C: SETH
D: Thank you for your support.
C: LAURA SIMON
D: Wait -- it gets worse -- -- the shots came from here. If she interrupted a burglary, she should have been here -- -- she was killed where she is -- all the blood patterns indicate that. But she was looking toward the bed -- what in hell was she looking at?
E: moving to the door moving to the bed now
S: INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - DAY
N: Seth says nothing as he and Laura go in the vault. Seth stares at the chair.
C: LAURA SIMON
D: Looks like someone sat here -- but I couldn't find any prints. You think Sullivan holed up in the chair and watched his wife perform?
E: lowering her voice -- indicating the one-way mirror
C: SETH
D: I hope not -- -- he's such a great man.
E: shakes his head
N: He moves back into the bedroom.
S: INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
N: Another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible.
C: SETH
D: Careful digging that out.
E: as he moves past
N: The cop nods.
C: MEDICAL EXAMINER
D: Looks like he tried to strangle her.
C: SETH
D: So he tried to strangle her, then went to the door and shot her from behind?
C: MEDICAL EXAMINER
D: He also inspected her vagina.
N: Seth. Stunned.
C: SETH
D: He did what? Why?
C: LAURA SIMON
D: Maybe he couldn't remember if he fucked her.
C: SETH
D: A strong burglar with a weak mind -- obviously another open and shut case...
E: has to laugh
N: As he stares around, baffled.
S: EXT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APT. BUILDING - DAY
N: A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than we've seen thus far. Afternoon now. An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears a battered hat. As he goes inside --
S: INT. BUILDING - FOYER/MAIL AREA - DAY
N: The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name "Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer, heads toward the elevator.
S: INT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys -- -- there are three locks on the door... he takes out keys --
S: INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY
N: Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his hat toward a long sofa -- -- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished, modern and clean. Now he moves quickly -- -- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full backpack from the robbery -- -- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the dial --
S: INT. LUTHER'S SAFE HOUSE APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)
N: -- the TV ON in the living room as he slides the video cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has been put away. The TV as Michael Jordan is introduced to the crowd -- Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...
S: INT. MORGUE - DAY
N: An old man silently weeping. This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era. A self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few enemies. At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man. We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy. He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and desolate, stares at her once joyous face. PULL BACK to reveal --
S: INT. MORGUE - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
N: Seth Frank, studying Walter THROUGH a two way mirror. Seth is moved at depth of the old man's grief. Anyone would be. Walter slowly rises --
S: INT. MORGUE - DAY
N: SANDY LORD waiting in an anteroom as Walter enters... Sandy Lord is Walter Sullivan's lawyer. He is 60, abrasive, powerful. Sandy moves to Walter, gestures toward the front door. Seth appears through another door, intercepts them.
C: SETH
D: Mr. Sullivan? -- I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide detective for Middleton County --
C: SANDY LORD
D: -- my client is in no mood for conversation, sir.
E: protectively
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: It's all right, Sandy -- -- you're in charge of the case?
E: looks at Seth
C: SETH
D: I have to ask some questions, but it can be tomorrow.
E: nods

D: You want what, positive identification? Yes, that was my wife. Anything else?
C: SETH
D: You'd been in Barbados for two days?
E: notebook in hand
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: I took the entire staff down -- always do this time of year.
E: nods
C: SETH
D: But Mrs. Sullivan didn't come.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: She was, had it all planned, but you know women, they change their minds.
E: MORE
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: I'd been married to my Rebecca for forty-seven years and when she died, I decided I never wanted that pain again. One thing I knew about Christy: she was going to outlive me.
E: CONT'D to Seth, softly
C: SANDY LORD
D: I think that's enough for today.
N: Takes Walter's arm.
C: SETH
D: I have to ask about the vault.
E: beat
N: And on that -- Walter. Holds to Sandy for a moment, then lets go.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: You mean the contents of the vault of course -- -- Sandy, you go on, I'm all right. Really. Go to the reception -- obviously I can't make it, but I'm sure everyone will understand.
E: turns to Sandy as Sandy looks at him a moment
N: Sandy nods, exits. Seth and Walter are alone. Beat. Then --
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: I know it's not the contents -- You mean the chair. You have to ask about the chair.
E: as Seth embarrassed, stands there
C: SETH
D: Yessir, I do.
E: soft
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: But why? Are they connected?
N: )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 43.
C: SETH
D: I think someone sat in it -- and I think that someone may have been involved in the murder. You were my father's hero, Mr. Sullivan, I promise you this won't make my highlight reel.
E: beat
N: CLOSEUP - WALTER * Humiliated.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: I'd hoped I could satisfy her... but you know... she had needs and she didn't want to go behind my back... she suggested the chair... she hoped I might get to like sitting there... ... I didn't... I've tried for eighty years to live a decent life. I've given a billion dollars to charity. If this comes to trial, none of that will be remembered -- I'll just go out as the joke of the world.
E: beat takes a breath
N: Seth. He closes his notebook.
C: SETH
D: I understand, sir; I'll do what I can.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: Will you listen to me whine? Please forgive me, Mr. Frank. Just do your job. And I'll do mine.
E: beat beat
N: Walter slowly moves to the door. Seth watches him. Sadly...
S: EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR
N: A gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place. The sun is setting. It all looks magical.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - NIGHT
N: A room filled with well-dressed men and women. Formal attire. The rich and the famous. But the only one we recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with several other men. Now, someone says his name.
C: MAN
D: Sandy. Is there anything I can do?
E: O.S. as Sandy turns
C: SANDY LORD
D: Mr. President.
N: And on those words -- The 44th President of the United States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is, also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in American history, three years into a brilliant first term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes. His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of a dark Towncar.
C: RICHMOND
D: Take a walk with me.
N: He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is GLORIA RUSSELL. Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are their names and they are the best the Secret Service has to offer.
S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: The group, as they leave the room, come to a wide corridor.
C: RICHMOND
D: Tell me about Walter -- how is he?
C: SANDY LORD
D: Eighty and alone, Mr. President.
C: RICHMOND
D: He understands officially my hands are tied?
C: SANDY LORD
D: Mr. President, he's touched at your concern.
N: )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 45.
C: RICHMOND
D: Any news of the killer? Well, why isn't there? Who's in charge of the case?
E: as Sandy indicates "no"
C: SANDY LORD
D: Top man -- eight years homicide work in New York. But I understand how you feel -- it's hard to be patient.
C: RICHMOND
D: No one understands how I feel -- I'm supposed to have all this power but I can't help my oldest friend -- you know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here -- and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned.
E: terribly upset
N: CLOSEUP - RICHMOND * On fire --
C: RICHMOND
D: -- I'll hold a press conference -- and I'll have Walter come -- and I will embrace him before the world.
N: Sandy. Listening. Moved.
C: SANDY LORD
D: He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you.
N: And he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks embarrassed.
C: RICHMOND
D: Damn tennis elbow is killing me.
E: quick smile
N: And on that --
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Richmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton and Collin hurrying to keep up.
S: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Burton opens the door for them, closes it once they're inside.
C: RICHMOND
D: This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor.
E: throws off his jacket, turns on Russell
C: RUSSELL
D: The country would have to be informed, Mr. President.
C: RICHMOND
D: What happened to my right to privacy? I think she nicked a tendon.
E: rolls up his sleeve, studies his cut
C: RUSSELL
D: Burton says it's a flesh wound --
C: RICHMOND
D: -- when did you become such an expert, Bill? -- Ever been wounded? --
E: to Burton
C: BURTON
D: Yes, sir. Many times.
E: quietly
N: The fireplace. Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares at the flames.
C: RUSSELL
D: Are you serious about that press conference, Alan?
C: RICHMOND
D: Of course I am -- Walter's been like a father to me.
C: RUSSELL
D: Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it?
N: Richmond, turning from the fire now, quietly.
C: RICHMOND
D: I think Mrs. Richmond's mission to help the poor in Asia should not be interrupted. We know anything yet?
E: takes a breath, starts to button his shirt
C: RUSSELL
D: We checked his license plate -- he stole the car from a police impoundment lot.
C: RICHMOND
D: We're not dealing with a fool here. Has he initiated contact?
E: gestures toward his jacket, as Russell helps him into it
C: RUSSELL
D: Burton doesn't think he will.
C: RICHMOND
D: I agree. Sorry about my behavior -- won't happen again; think of it as a blip on the screen. And as far as I'm concerned, so is he.

N: Richmond. Big.

S: INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - TINY KITCHEN - DAY
N: A stove with one burner on high. A tea kettle is over the flame. It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington Post. She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the kitchen -- INSERT - WASHINGTON POST Huge headlines -- as big as you can get without a war. WALTER SULLIVAN'S WIFE MURDERED BACK TO SCENE Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then starts to turn her attention to another section of the paper -- -- she doesn't get that far. Kate: she has seen something she didn't catch before -- The front page again. And the headline is still there -- -- but there is a smaller headline beneath it: Jewel Thief Sought Kate sits down hard. Trying for control. Entering a nightmare. She stares at the paper. The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter smiling on his wedding day, of Christy. But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline: Jewel Thief Sought She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes -- in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate does not move.
S: EXT. VALERIE'S MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
N: (EARLY AFTERNOON) Kids riding bicycles. Very Norman Rockwell.
S: INT. VALERIE'S BASEMENT - DAY
N: A bald man. There is the sound of a CLICK. We realize after a moment that the bald man is Luther. Another SHOT of Luther looking very different -- full beard. Again, a CLICK. Luther again -- elegant beard this time. CLICK. PULL BACK to reveal -- We are in the basement game room of one of the suburban homes. But our attention is on a whole string of Polaroids of Luther. Two people are present: Luther and VALERIE. Valerie is very small, and doesn't miss much. She has been photographing him, and as the last photo slides out of the camera, she blows on it, puts it alongside the others.
C: VALERIE
D: You always did disappear good, Luther.
E: as they study the pictures
C: LUTHER
D: You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val.
C: VALERIE
D: You're lucky is all -- some of my customers, they stand out no matter what.

D: How many passports you need?
C: LUTHER
D: Four should cover it.
E: thinks
C: VALERIE
D: Now you'll want different looks, and matching international driver's licenses -- I'll throw in some dummy credit cards, seeing it's you. How the rugs I made you holding up?

C: VALERIE
D: Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it.
C: LUTHER
D: Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you.
N: Valerie puts the order book down, studies him.
C: LUTHER
D: What?
C: VALERIE
D: I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever...
C: LUTHER
D: Finish it.

D: Five years doesn't sound so bad to me just now.
E: kisses her forehead

C: SETH
D: I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar.
N: Seth moves to the "vault door," mimes closing that, makes a grunt.
C: LAURA
D: Now you're the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised.

E: aims his finger like a pistol
C: LAURA
D: -- then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just shoot?
E: cutting in
C: SETH
D: That's nothing -- why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on?
C: LAURA
D: There I can help you -- see, before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes.
C: SETH
D: And I dress her because?

C: LAURA
D: Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.
C: SETH
D: You saying the burglar drove her home? I hate this case.
E: pissed

D: -- hi, Seth Frank --
C: BURTON
D: -- I know you must be going crazy -- but the boss is very interested in your progress. Maybe we can help each other.
C: SETH
D: What did you have in mind?
C: BURTON
D: You know how close he and Sullivan are? The minute anything breaks, if you'd call me, I'd tell the President. That way, he'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan -- it would mean a lot to him. And any red tape you want cut -- done. Here are my numbers.
E: as Seth nods as he takes out card
N: He turns, opens his front car door.
C: BURTON
D: Leads?
E: getting in

S: 161 INT. SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - NIGHT 161 *
N: Quietly elegant. Two men are finishing dinner. Walter Sullivan we know. MICHAEL McCARTY, his dinner companion, is 35, fit, handsome, beautifully dressed. He is, at present, torn by a silver tray of small French pastries.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: The chef makes them especially for me -- I promise you they're sinful.
E: noting McCarty's temptation
N: McCarty grabs one, downs it, grins sheepishly. McCARTY You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan. Sullivan nods as they rise.
S: 162 INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 162 *
N: Tastefully appointed, as one would expect.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: This is a new arena for me, but from what I'm told, you have a flawless reputation, Mister McCarty -- which is why I need to employ you.
N: McCARTY Understood.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: I have no idea who I'm after. Until I do, you will have to wait in Washington for instructions.
N: )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 57. McCARTY Out of the question, I'm afraid. (explaining as they walk) Mine isn't particularly creative work -- I only do it because I enjoy living beyond my means. I can't afford to just sit around. A sofa. Walter gestures for them to sit.
C: WALTER SULLIVAN
D: When I was 10 my father died -- he was a miner and lung disease killed him. I became rich at 25 and the first thing I did was purchase that mine, close it, and give every miner there fifty thousand dollars to retire on. You will come to Washington, Mr. McCarty. You will put one million dollars expenses into the Swiss * bank account of your choosing. And, when the time comes, two million dollars a bullet.

D: Luther Whitney -- -- one of the great thieves of the world.
E: beat
N: Seth. The words pour out.
C: SETH
D: Been going nuts with this thing, up all night and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn't two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? Called a buddy at the Bureau -- they keep track of this stuff internationally -- he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job -- I'm tracing all six -- -- but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington.
E: faster beat
N: Laura. Looking at Seth now. Starting to get excited, too.
C: LAURA
D: Why haven't I ever heard of him?
C: SETH
D: Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years.
C: LAURA
D: This his graduation picture from Harvard?
E: indicating mug shot

N: Seth. Outside -- and he knows Luther was watching.
S: INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
N: El Greco. The usual group has gathered, sketching away. Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors. Seth enters the room, casually taking it all in. He approaches the group, ends up behind Luther who is intent on getting the hands right.

D: Boy, you must be smart.
E: not looking
C: SETH
D: Sorry?
E: really taken aback
C: LUTHER
D: Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney.
E: turns, smiles
N: He reaches out to shake a surprised Seth's hand --
S: INT. MUSEUM - COFFEE SHOP - DAY
N: They walk in, go to the food line. There is, throughout, a bantering tone. Not that it matters, but these two, in a different world, would like each other -- they're both, in their own ways, deeply moral men.
C: LUTHER
D: So, do you want my confession now or after coffee?
N: As Luther draws some coffee from an urn --
C: SETH
D: Before I send you away for life, I should probably check out your alibi.
E: doing the same
C: LUTHER
D: Watched the Bullets game with Red Bransford. Prison buddy of mine -- runs a bar -- want to question me about the game? I'm probably lying.
N: They each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet table in the corner as they head for it.
C: SETH
D: You been following the case?
C: LUTHER
D: I love true crime --
E: nods vigorously
C: SETH
D: -- F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. I've got a list here; you're on it.
E: touches his notebook
C: LUTHER
D: I wish it was true. Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? If only I could do stuff like that -- I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. meetings.
E: nothing shows shakes his head as Seth nods; Luther sighs
N: Luther and Seth as they sit. Seth smiles, looks at Luther.
C: SETH
D: Luther? Why was this so hard?
E: beat
N: Luther. Now he's surprised. He kind of smiles.
C: LUTHER
D: You want me to help solve your case?
C: SETH
D: Just looking for insight. How would you -- scratch that -- how would one go about it? What kind of person do you think I should be looking for?
C: LUTHER
D: Older fella. Like me.
E: like a shot
C: SETH
D: Because?
E: now he smiles
C: LUTHER
D: Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research -- from everything I've read.
N: Seth. This hasn't gone at all the way he thought -- and he's starting to get fascinated.
C: SETH
D: Research for what?
C: LUTHER
D: Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning.
E: as Seth nods
C: SETH
D: Not just steal them?
C: LUTHER
D: Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office. You know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company? I wonder how those guys do it?
E: beat shakes his head
C: SETH
D: Why go to all that trouble?
C: LUTHER
D: Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it --
E: as Seth nods

D: -- clicker --
E: casually
C: LUTHER
D: -- explain --
E: fascinated
C: SETH
D: -- gizmo -- looked like a V.C.R. remote --
C: LUTHER
D: -- amazing -- -- must have been a lot of money inside.
E: shaking his head beat
C: SETH
D: Five million.
E: sipping casually; a pause
N: And on those words -- Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing.
C: SETH
D: Why's that funny?
C: LUTHER
D: The way you said it -- as if you were trying to surprise me.
C: SETH
D: I was trying to surprise you.
E: smiles
C: LUTHER
D: There you go.
E: smiles back
N: Seth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it.
C: SETH
D: Would the burglar use a disguise?
C: LUTHER
D: Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy -- most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird loner?
C: SETH
D: Maybe like you.
C: LUTHER
D: I'm the perfect prototype. But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that.
E: couldn't agree more sipping away
C: SETH
D: Go on about the wigmakers.
E: flipping a page
C: LUTHER
D: I'd love that but I'm late as it is -- got to get my pacemaker checked. -- all this excitement, you understand.
E: glancing at his watch he likes Seth

S: INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A place we've seen briefly before. Dark. Moonlight through the windows. The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR. Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one largish room, books all over. The home of someone who doesn't care a whole lot about their home.
S: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still water, sparkling water, carrot sticks.
C: LUTHER
D: Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime.
E: sadly, muttering
N: He closes the door, moves back into the room --
S: INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a fingertip, moves on through the silence.
S: INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around -- -- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The mandatory lamp. And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture. The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman with a kind face. )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 66.

E: V.O. beat
N: Luther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed -- -- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning for Walter Sullivan to join him. Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself -- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward. Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving the stool, walking close to the television. Richmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace.
C: RICHMOND
D: Dear friend, old friend, we shall fight that battle.
E: V.O.
N: Sullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod.
C: RICHMOND

N: She is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the Common- wealth of Virginia. Her office is a zoo. On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling -- but there is something a little different about it. Seth enters and they shake. He glances around -- -- sees the photograph, glances away. Kate has risen now -- and in the silence it's clear that even though they are both standing still, they are both circling.

D: For a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, Miss Whitney.
E: trying for a smile

D: Is that good or bad?

D: Wow -- that never crossed my mind -- you think there might be some connection? -- Like maybe I'm somehow compensating? -- I better write that down.
E: just amazed

D: -- Luther disappeared.
N: No reaction. A banged-up couch. Kate sits, shrugs.
C: SETH
D: I think you can help me.
C: KATE
D: Lieutenant -- I don't know the man -- he was in jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him all of once this past year.
C: SETH
D: When?
C: KATE
D: Couple days ago. He said he might be going away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work now?
C: SETH
D: Any idea where he might have gone?
E: shakes his head
N: Seth and Kate realize something: In a different world, under different circumstances, they'd probably be starting an affair.
C: KATE
D: Quit wasting my time -- if he doesn't want you to find him, you're not going to find him.
E: snappishly
C: SETH
D: You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?

A large blowup of the same picture Kate had in her office, the one of Kate and her mom -- -- with one startling change: Luther is in this shot, standing there proud and smiling.

N: They enter. Clothes tossed all over.
C: SETH
D: He sure took off in a hurry. What scares a professional thief like that?
N: Kate. No reply. She has seen something across the tiny room and is drawn to it -- Luther's bed table -- -- and here it is! Call it a montage, call it a collage, call it what you will, we are looking at dozens of photographs -- -- all of them featuring Kate. Many of them we saw in her apartment -- only here, as in the photo over the mantle, Luther is there with Kate and her mom. We are looking at a shrine! And there are newer photos too -- Kate at her college graduation, Kate at her law school graduation, Kate and her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, Kate alone on the steps of Middleton County Courthouse -- -- these are not posed shots. She looks wonderful and alive in all of them -- Kate. She looks dead now. All energy gone. She sits heavily down on the bed.
C: KATE
D: ... but he wasn't at those places... ... college graduation; law school graduation; the night Mom and I celebrated when I got a job; and me alone on the steps? -- I'd just won my first case, I was so proud... ... I used to think... sometimes I'd come home and I'd sense he'd been in my apartment, checking the fridge, shaking his head because he never thought I ate right... It's crazy but I just knew Daddy was watching over me...
E: fighting tears pointing to the grown-up photos still fighting
N: And now she loses it, starts crying silently. Seth kneels alongside her, gives her a handkerchief.

S: INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT
N: A beautiful necklace. Antique mostly likely. And tasteful -- we hear the sound of an ORCHESTRA PLAYING WALTZES. PULL BACK to reveal Gloria Russell, looking just splendid, the necklace around her throat, entering a large and very impressive White House dinner-dance. Clearly an important affair of state. We've never seen Russell quite like this -- relaxed, secure in her femininity. She nods distantly to Burton and Collin who are, as always, close the President. For the first time now, we realize something: Gloria Russell is hot for Alan Richmond. Richmond, on the edge of the dance floor, chatting with some elderly couples, several of them European, all of them wealthy.

E: now, to the others
N: Everyone at the gathering, watching them. Richmond and Russell, very much aware that all eyes are on them -- -- what we don't know is this: they are both wonderful dancers. And they seem to be reveling in their moves -- -- because throughout this, they never stop smiling.

Richmond acknowledges it with a smile as they come to climax.
C: RICHMOND
D: Well, now -- -- I need time to think -- come see me in my office in the morning -- This will certainly make for an interesting chapter in my memoirs.

S: EXT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
N: Luther in the night. Silence. He is moving across the rooftop of a home. He carries a briefcase -- Luther's making business calls. Ahead is an attic window -- as he slides it open --
S: INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT
N: Luther, slipping inside. Some stairs are just across. He goes down them, opens the door --
S: INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Luther stepping into the main part of the dark house. He stops. No noise at all except that of someone BREATHING DEEPLY, coming from an open bedroom door. Luther passes by -- for an instant we can see that Burton is asleep, an empty bottle by his head.
S: INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Luther rounding a corner -- -- and we can tell immediately he's in a different house now. Burton's had only old furnishings, these are modern and new. Luther pauses, listening. Nothing. He moves forward then, turns another corner --
S: INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: -- and now we can tell he's someplace else -- this is an apartment with a large window looking out on the city. Luther doesn't stop to admire the view. He moves silently on... HOLD ON the window. And suddenly: Dawn -- the sun is starting to rise. PULL BACK to reveal --
S: INT. RUSSELL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Gloria Russell, as the ALARM GOES OFF. She sits -- -- she stretches -- -- then she stares -- something has been taped to her lamp. We are looking at an issue of the Washington Post -- Russell's photo smiles out -- there is a headline that says simply: RUSSELL TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF. Written across her picture are the words: "This shitstorm is your fault -- if we go down, you go down!" Russell takes the paper down, stares at it. Furious.
S: INT. BURTON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Burton, hung over, staggering into the kitchen of his home, stopping dead. A newspaper is set beside his coffee pot. A front page of the Washington Post. Years back. The lead article reports that a siege has been successfully broken -- -- Burton, bloody and wounded, is being carried to an ambulance. A hero. Across the top these words have been written: HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, YOU GUTLESS FUCK? Burton stares. Steaming.
S: INT. COLLIN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
N: Collin, yawning, going into his bathroom -- -- across his mirror is taped a large white piece of paper, across which is written in thick black marker -- "If you could shoot for shit, we'd be out of this." Collin angrily rips it down.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN NEWSSTAND - MORNING
N: A bunch of commuters and businessmen are buying papers. The newspapers. Washington, New York, Philadelphia -- and they're all different front pages, of course, but one photo in all of them is the same -- -- every one of them is running the mug shot of Luther. And the sense of the stories is the same too: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
T: CUT TO:
N: COMMUTERS crowded around, making their purchases. Some of them are young, some of them are half asleep. One of them is in his 60's and very wide awake -- -- it's Luther -- -- as he buys a paper, looks at the headline -- fascinated.

S: INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
N: The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the letter opener. PULL BACK to reveal -- The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently watching him, their hatred of each other clear. The smell of death's in the room.
C: RICHMOND
D: Any idea who could have forged it?
E: holding the note now, his voice is, when he speaks, calm; to Burton

Kate turns a corner -- -- and so do they -- -- and as they do, they pass Luther, parked on the corner. Watching. Satisfied, he drives off in another direction.

N: Now a figure begins to appear in the window -- The figure holds something long and thin, like a rifle barrel -- -- it's a large woman with a long mop -- as she shakes it -- Afternoon and the sun is strong.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
N: Sunlight, streaming in an open bedroom window. Whose bedroom, though? Two maids are cleaning it -- -- and now we realize where we are: Walter Sullivan's bedroom, but it's all been changed, different rug, different fabrics, different furnishings. The maids work silently and well. A final sweep of a dust rag here, a last tug at the bedspread there. Done. They go to the door, take a last look around. Perfect. They go. HOLD ON the empty room. Keep HOLDING. Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps out, clicker in hand. The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it back inside -- -- the door starts to close -- -- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he took the night of the robbery. And as he moves silently toward the door.

Collin, stunned, trying to struggle -- The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the bed as the struggle goes on -- -- and Collin's in fabulous shape.
