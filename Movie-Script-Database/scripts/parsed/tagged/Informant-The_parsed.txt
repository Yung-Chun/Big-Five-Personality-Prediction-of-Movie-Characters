N: FREEZE ON CORN STALK
C: WHITACRE
D: That's right. C2rn. A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as does Whitacre...

E: V.0.
C: WHITACRE
D: .Bacon and eggs is really just corn and corn when you think about what they feed the chickens and the pigs. And when you're good and help with the trash, you know what makes the big green bags biodegradeable? We reach the end of a row. The combine turns to harvest another row REVEALING...

S: INTERIOR PORSCHE 911- CONTINUOUS
N: WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school. Whitacre is as happy as God makes creatures. Alexander sips his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE.
C: WHITACRE
D: Do you? Alexander hazards a guess.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Uh-huh. Corn.
C: WHITACRE
D: Corn starch. But, Daddy's company didn't come up with that one-- DuPont did... Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in his head...
C: WHITACRE
D: Ethanol is made of corn; that's ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But they also use it for scotch, gin and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn gimlet...corn on the rocks.
E: V.O.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 3. The car accelerates to pass a tanker truck with ADM: SUPERMARKET TO THE WORLD emblazoned on the side. The 911 is warped in the reflection...
C: WHITACRE
D: Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it both ways. Three years in Germany, I should know that. What's the German word for corn? The word I really like saying is "kugelschreiber." That's "pen"-- all those syllables just for "pen."
E: V.0.
N: A PEN SIGNS A LEDGER Whitacre signs in with the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial facility that makes most of what America eats. Grain elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks and a six story concrete bunker of an office building. He parks his car in a monogrammed space.
S: INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS-CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote board and into his glass walled office. He has a kind word for everyone. Smile flashing like a casino sign. He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting...
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we got to get out and hit some balls ...Morning...Guten Tag... Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF CORN made of gold.
C: WHITACRE
D: What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a guy like that get...100K...I bet he gets a 100. He's just going to sit behind that desk and ride it into the future...
E: V.O.
C: LIZ TAYLOR
D: Morning Mark...They have lysine results... She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. He nods.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 4.
S: INTERIOR LYSINE PLANT- A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters-- he's joined by a DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials showing proof of failure.
C: DISCOURAGED FOREMAN
D: We adjusted the dextrose again, but the vrus keeps showing up-Thought we had it surrounded this time. We're starting a new set of cultures...
C: WHITACRE
D: We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay after it. The things eat sugar and that's what we're giving them-- a warm place filled with sugar. They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients to the feed line.
C: WHITACRE
D: A positive mental attitude is a real important thing. They've done studies where heart patients who have people praying for them actually do better than ones who don't. There's science for you. The cheerleaders might make a difference in the game after all...How do you know what the electrical energy of a thought actually does when it's out there in the world? It's gotta go somewhere...so you might as well smile. Takes less muscles than frowning... Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room.
E: V.O.
S: INTERIOR ADM BOARDROOM- LATER
N: Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45, and TERRY WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the desultory performance of Whitacre's division.
C: AN DREAS
D: The fucking thing is supposed to produce 113 thousand tons annually.
N: (MORE) Draft: 1/15/03 5.
C: ANDREAS
D: We're not gonna get anywhere near that. We got 150 million dollars in costs over there guys. I can see the fucking thing from my swimming pool and it makes me want to drown myself every morning.
E: CONT'D
C: WILSON
D: Did the Japanese have these kind of problems with lysine?
N: AN DREAS (TO WHITACRE) I don't give a shit about the Japanese. You just gotta get the Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the dextrose and shit us out some money.
C: WHITACRE
D: We're still having problems with this virus.
C: ANDREAS
D: I don't want to hear about the damn virus anymore. Terry, what are we losing a month?
C: WILSON
D: We're off like seven million per.
C: ANDREAS
D: That's not gonna fly much longer. You want to go in there next quarter and tell the board that we're sucking hind tit on this...cuz' I sure don't. He gives Whitacre a cold, hard, we're--done-fucking-around- glare.
C: ANDREAS
D: Fix the Goddamn plant, or we're gonna shut it down. The last light goes out.
N: AN EAR OF CORN ON A DINNER PLATE A pad of butter melts.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION KITCHEN- EVENING
N: Whitacre stares at the EAR. His wife GINGER, 33, and Alexander dine with him. Draft: 1/15/03 6. Ginger and Mark have known each other since High School. She was Homecoming Queen then. Either would be hard pressed to envision a life without each other.
C: GINGER
D: You're not hungry, Corky. Whitacre is distracted. Ginger cuts up Alexander's food.
C: WHITACRE
D: The pilgrims loved the corn-- they came for the religious freedom but they stayed for the corn-- but its missing three of your eight essential amino acids-- especially lysine. That's why the Indians ate it with beans or lime. You feed a chicken corn and it gets sick. Yo feed it corn and lysine and it goes from egg to supermarket fryer in six months instead of eight... Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at his wife. She has gotten dressed up for dinner. She looks pretty.
E: V.0.
C: WHITACRE
D: Breasts and thighs in six months...
E: V.O.
C: WHITACRE
D: You look great.
C: GINGER
D: They got the first wall of the stables up today. You see that?
C: WHITACRE
D: They're doing this thing in hydroponics where they're feeding lysine to jumbo shrimp... Imagine you're a sh rimp and one day some corn goes floating by, what do you think about that? Alexander smiles.
C: GINGER
D: I don't know what I'd think about that.
C: WHITACRE
D: There's an opening in Mexico-- they might need me to go down there and get things set up...Alex, what do you think about Mexico?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 7.
C: ALEXANDER
D: I thought we were getting horses.
S: INTERIOR ADM- WEEKS LATER- EVENING
N: Whitacre is working late-- pouring over the failing lysine numbers.
C: WHITACRE
D: I would rather take a lot of pain killers in a. hotel room than jump off a bridge...Or use a gun. A gun on your temple-- why do that? what does that say? Pain killers, definitely... Lie down in a great big hotel bed-What's, that place in Hong Kong on the Kowloon side? The Regent? What a bed! If you think about it, that doesn't mean anything-- it's normal to think thoughts... His secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, buzzes him on the intercom.
E: V.O.
C: WHITACRE
D: r-- Yeah?
C: LIZ TAYLOR
D: There's a call, I can't pronounce his name, he said he works for Ajinomoto Corporation. Whitacre picks up.
E: on the intercom
C: WHITACRE
D: Mark Whitacre.
C: FUJIWARA
D: Hello, Dr. Whitacre? My name is Fujiwara from Ajinomoto Corp...I want to discuss with you lysine if you have a moment. Liz pokes her head into the office and mouths the words "Good Night" to her boss and leaves him alone with Fujiwara.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey, sure. . .How you guys making out over there?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 8.
S: EXTERIOR GAS STATION OUTSIDE OF DECATUR, ILLINOIS- NIGHT
N: Whitacre on his way home from work, this time in a JEEP CHEROKEE, fills up the tank. A SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEE is changing the price of gasoline. ANOTHER CUSTOMER gives a SUCKER to her TEETHING BRAT to pacify her.
C: WHITACRE
D: Sixth grade. Marty Blocker used to sell us Charm's Blow Pops for three cents, which was a great deal cuz at Valley Drug they cost a nickel. He said his Dad worked for Charms-- said he invented the Blow Pop and got a special deal-- like a life time supply. Then they opened his locker..cuz of all the ants... In a line.. .His Dad worked for the post office, he came down to the school in his uniform. Nothing ever happened to Marty-- just ants ...He blew off part of his thumb on the 4th of July with an M-80...
E: V.0.
S: INTERIOR MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE ADM- MORNING
N: At 6:30 the next morning Whitacre walks across the ADM trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas' office looking flustered.
C: WHITACRE
D: Mick you're not going to believe what the hell's happened. I think I know the reason why we've been having all these problems at the plant.
C: ANDREAS
D: Well, I've only been asking you to come up with one for the past eight weeks. I'm all ears. Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words. Andreas listens silently.
C: WHITACRE
D: It's not start-up problems like we thought. It's the Japanese. This guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's been calling me-- sometimes at work, sometimes at home cuz of the time difference-- you met him, he was here a couple of weeks ago.
N: (MORE) Draft: 1/15/03 9.
C: WHITACRE
D: Well last night he calls me at home just after 8, and Mick, he knew everything. He says to me, `You remember the total nightmare you had during May, June and July?' And before I can ask him what he means he says, `Those months when ADM was losing about seven million dollars a month in the lysine business?' Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.
E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: I couldn't believe it. But, Mick before I can even ask him how he got those numbers, he starts making little comments about us having microbe problems. Jokes, like he's toying with me. Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.
C: WHITACRE
D: And then he tells me that one of our highest paid employees is actually an employee of Ajinomoto and is sabotaging the plant. They're injecting some kind of virus into the dextrose and contaminating the whole deal. That's the problem. I'll tell you Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that Crichton book, it's just like it. Fujiwara even said that his boss, Ikeda, would have him killed if he knew he was calling. So I asked him why he was talking to me and he said-- he said-- he wants 10 million dollars. 10 million and he'll tell us who the saboteur is and give us a new lysine bug that's immune to the virus. We could be up and running in three days... Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...
C: ANDREAS
D: How well do you know this guy?
C: WHITACRE
D: Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks ago when he came over. And then, he called a couple of times...
C: ANDREAS
D: So, not very well?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 10.
C: WHITACRE
D: Very well? No, I can't really say that. Andreas ponders the situation.
C: ANDREAS
D: Okay, if you hear from him again-- talk him down on the price. I want you to find out the least amount of money he'd settle for. If we can get a bug that's resistant to the virus, it might be worth it...But, I want you to keep this quiet, if there is a mole, we don't want him to know we're onto him.
S: EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- EVENING
N: Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built across the road from the main house. There is not another home anywhere nearby. WHITACRE (V.0.) This'd be a great place for some outlet stores... People would come from all over Southern Illinois and probably Missouri, too. Famous name brand labels and appliances at savings of up to fifty per cent every day. Maybe a food court with a Mexican place. . .After the stables, maybe a tennis court or a little pitch and putt by the pool-- that adds to resale value like nobody's business... Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street light...
C: WHITACRE
D: The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat the birds, the rust eats the cars and the new construction eats the rust... Ginger interrupts Whitacre's grand plan from across the street...
E: V.O.
C: GINGER
D: Corky, Alexander says there's a bat in his room.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 11.
S: INTERIOR ADM- MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE
N: Whitacre shakes his head in disbelief. He paces nervously. Stunned by the news.
C: WHITACRE
D: The FBI! God, no. Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's version of a bouncer.
C: WHITACRE
D: I thought I was supposed to be getting him down on the price. That's what you told me to do and I was doing it.
C: ANDREAS
D: We're not gonna sit back and let the Japs fuck us sideways.
N: WHITACRE (OFF CHEVIRON) I just don't understand, we weren't going to mention it and now he's in on it?
C: ANDREAS
D: Of course he's in. If we got a mole then it's a security issue...
C: CHEVIRON
D: I'll be sitting in with the FBI.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, I already told you guys everything I know. What's the point? Cheviron is annoyed by Whitacre's histrionics.
C: CHEVIRON
D: We don't like the idea of talking to the FBI anymore than you do. Look, they're just going to tape the guy's calls-- and ask you a few questions. No big deal. Whitacre shakes his head, even more upset.
C: WHITACRE
D: Questions, Jesus.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 12.
C: ANDREAS
D: We know how the FBI works.. .We can control this. Whitacre has his doubts.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- DAY
N: GINGER is putting away groceries when the phone rings. GINGER (ANSWERING PHONE) Hello, Whitacres.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE'S OFFICE
N: Whitacre is on the phone-- pacing like a caged animal.
C: WHITACRE
D: Now, they've got the FBI in on it. First they tell me they're going to pay and be done with it, now they want me to talk to the FBI.
S: INTERIOR KITCHEN-CONTINUOUS
N: She sits down-- uneasy. This isn't like him to be so upset.
C: GINGER
D: The FBI? Why do you need to talk to the FBI? It's their factory. Let them talk to the FBI.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm really uncomfortable about this, baby. There are a lot of things going on here.
E: O.S.
C: GINGER
D: What does that mean, "things?"
C: WHITACRE
D: I just mean we have to be careful.
C: GINGER
D: Whatever you do, Corky, no matter what's going on, just be honest with them and tell the truth. Tell the truth no matter what the truth is.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 13. He considers her advice and hangs up the phone. Whitacre looks out the window at the cold, gray Autumn day and weighs his options. Leaves blow across the ADM parking lot.
C: WHITACRE
D: It's spring time in Nigeria-- you can bet they're loving that. Sitting around watching the days get longer; watching the afternoon go by on their Rolexes and Cartiers. Everyone's just waiting on the mailman... while the poachers make the elephants extinct.
E: V.0. he seems angry
N: ANGLE ON FBI FORM 302 The name "Mark Whitacre" is written across the top.
S: INTERIOR ADM CONFERENCE ROOM- EVENING
N: SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code. He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life. Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says nothing. Shepard writes down everything.
C: WHITACRE
D: He told me he wanted his payments deposited by wire transfer to numbered bank accounts in Switzerland and the Caribbean.
C: SHEPARD
D: And when was your last contact with him?
C: WHITACRE
D: Two days ago. But I think he's getting suspicious. I've dragged this out as long as I can. If we don't get back to him soon he may back out?
C: SHEPARD
D: And these calls, they've been coming in on your home line? Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and wrong answer here.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 14.
C: WHITACRE
D: I have an ADM line at my house-- a business line-- they've been coming in on that.
C: WHITACRE'S POV
D: Drifting from Shepard's face to his ADAM'S APPLE. The knot of his BLACK FBI TIE bobs up and down as he speaks.
N: SHEPARD WHITACRE (V.O.)
C: 
D: Well, we need to start by There's a sale at Bacarach's-- putting a recording device on they get those Oscar De La your phone. We should make Renta ties that nobody buys-- arrangements to do that as except maybe Wilson-- what soon as possible. We also are they two for one for need a list of everyone in another week... They never put the bioproducts division to the Brioni ties on sale... .I see if we can see who's should just get all the ties operating on the inside, in Paris, wear them once or we'll want phone records, twice. Shove them in a duty employment histories and any free bag. other background checks that ADM may have...
E: UNDER OVER
C: CHEVIRON
D: I can help with that.
C: WHITACRE
D: So, that's it then. I can go? Shepard hands Whitacre his card. They shake hands.
C: SHEPARD
D: I'd like to come out tomorrow and get on that phone.
C: WHITACRE
D: No problem. Thanks for your time.
S: 16 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION ENTRY WAY- NIGHT
N: Whitacre comes in from a long day at work. Ginger walks in from the kitchen. She gives him a welcome home hug-- but he doesn't let go-- holding on like a man caught in the current.
C: GINGER
D: You told them the truth, Mark. That's all you can do.
N: A- Draft: 1/15/03 15.
C: WHITACRE
D: They we're watching me the whole time. Cheviron was in the room. She slips from his arms-- disappointed.
C: WHITACRE
D: I never even got a chance. She doesn't accept his excuse and heads upstairs to bed.
C: GINGER
D: Tanya called from school-- she has homework questions for you. Whitacre stands in the vestibule alone. He walks through the big house shutting off lights-- he sits in a chair in the huge living room and leafs through an issue of NATIONAL
N: GEOGRAPHIC.
C: WHITACRE
D: I go to Cornell and get a Ph. D. and then to Northwestern and get an MBA-- Mick Andreas gets born with the vice president of the United States as his Godfather. He goes- to the Nixon's for Thanksgiving-- my parents died in a car accident when I was three. I wound up in an orphanage. That was my Thanksgiving ...These photographers must wait forever to get these shots... Although I heard a story that sometimes they'll throw a sandwich on the ground to get the panther to come down out of the tree.. .They're just trying to do their jobs.. .Where's the harm-- the panther gets to eat.

S: INTERIOR CHEVIRON HOUSE- NIGHT
N: Cheviron sits in bed with his wife watching TV. The phone RINGS
C: CHEVIRON
D: Jesus, it's late.. .Hello?
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- SIMULTANEOUSLY
N: Whitacre paces while on the phone-- frantic and rambling. Draft: 1/15/03 16.
C: WHITACRE
D: Now my family's being threatened, I can't put up with this.
C: CHEVIRON
D: What?
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: They're threatening my daughter. She got a call at school. She's fourteen!
C: CHEVIRON
D: Slow down, Mark.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: She said the guy sounded Asian. They told her Fujiwara couldn't wait.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Did you call the FBI?
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: It just happened. He wants an answer. Or, he said she's in trouble.
C: CHEVIRON
D: We'll talk about it in the morning.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm thinking about quitting. Moving my family out of here. I can't do this.
C: CHEVIRON
D: We'll talk in the morning. Whitacre puts down the phone and walks through the large, dark house. He opens the bedroom door and the wedge of light finds Ginger already half-asleep. He lies down next to her in bed fully clothed.
E: O.S.
S: INTERIOR ADM- MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE
N: Cheviron, Whitacre and Mick Andreas. Whitacre is still agitated.
C: ANDREAS
D: You ever mention to Fujiwara where your daughter went to school?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 17.
C: CHEVIRON
D: If the guy wants to threaten you-- why not just call you?
C: WHITACRE
D: He told her to write down the message.
C: ANDREAS
D: I want her to tell the FBI what they said. Andreas moves toward the phone.
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't want her talking to the FBI, definitely not.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Why not, Mark? Come on, if she's really in danger.
C: ANDREAS
D: Then I'll talk to her. Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that either.
C: WHITACRE
D: She's scared enough.
C: ANDREAS
D: If someone's threatening her... A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this.
C: WHITACRE
D: Don't call her...No one's threatening. I, uh... A long painful beat.
C: WHITACRE
D: I made it up. I lied. There wasn't any threat. Cheviron shakes his head in disgust.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Christ, what a waste of time. Andreas lowers his gaze at Whitacre-- he wants an explanation.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 18.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm no good at this. The FBI guy really got to me last night. He's twisting in the wind.
C: WHITACRE
D: I figured if you guys thought my daughter was in danger you'd just pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff would go away. It was a stupid move on my part. Whitacre's ashamed.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move. He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the lobby of ADM in a daze.
E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: What am I supposed to do? I didn't get the FBI involved-- I was told we were paying the money. It's like, `Whitacre go out for a long pass,' and then we run the ball. Look, I admitted I made a mistake, that's more than I can say for most people. Hey, when they found out that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a check to the Watergate Burglars-- did he admit it? Besides these guys probably own the FBI with the money they have. They probably wanted me to move into Dwayne's old house-- because they've got it wired like in a Crichton novel... He wanders into his office.

S: INTERIOR COUNTRY CLUB OF DECATUR- NIGHT
N: Whitacre and a very done-up Ginger dine with SID HULSE, 35, the used car version of a lysine salesman at the Club. Mauve draped tables, botanical drawings of the state flower on the wall. Bow-tied wait staff patrol the diners with pitchers of ice water. Sid and Ginger chit-chat-- Mark is distracted.
C: WHITACRE
D: Someone told me they bugged the dining room-- the John, too. Might be paying off the waitresses here at the club. That's how business get done. Clients go to relieve themselves. ADM knows...
E: V.O.

D: Mark got them abroad.
E: off her earrings
C: SID HULSE
D: Nigeria? Whitacre shoots him a look.
C: WHITACRE
D: Not funny, Sid.
C: SID HULSE
D: You're telling me. Sid laughs. Ginger doesn't get the joke.
C: GINGER
D: Mark's never been to Nigeria.
N: ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S HAND UNDER THE TALE He covertly slides a business card into Ginger's hand.
C: WHITACRE
D: So, where are you off to tomorrow?
E: O.S.
N: GINGER'S POV OF THE CARD On the back is scribbled, "The FBI is coming at 10 PM." Draft: 1/15/03 20.
C: SID HULSE
D: West coast swing-- I gotta get out there and kick some Japanese butt.
C: WHITACRE
D: So, I'll see you in a couple of weeks. She's still digesting what's on the card-- trying to act natural.
C: GINGER
D: Then you guys can maybe have a chance to play some golf. Whitacre throws an arm around her.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE'S LINCOLN TOWN CAR- LATER
N: Ginger and Mark drive home in silence.
C: WHITACRE
D: There should be a TV show about a guy who calls home one day-- and he's there. He answers-- he's talking to himself only it's someone else. He's somehow divided into two and the second one of him drives away and the rest of the show is about him trying to find the guy...

E: V.0.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- LATER
N: Ginger and Whitacre. Whitacre tries to plead his position to his wife-- it's not as black and white as she assumes.

E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: I may tell them at some point, but not now. Right now I'm going to follow the company line.
C: GINGER
D: Mark, ADM is not more powerful than the FBI. You can't tell me that.
C: WHITACRE
D: It's more complicated than that. Her face is a mask of determination.
C: GINGER
D: Mark, if you don't tell them I will. Behind him the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the drive. He is desperate-- he softly repeats.
C: WHITACRE
D: I can't, not now. The door bell rings. She opens the door.
C: WHITACRE
D: Good evening, Agent Shepard, this is my wife Ginger. Whitacre knows he has to keep the two of them apart.
C: SHEPARD
D: I know it's late. I'll be out of your hair in a minute, just show me where the, uh...The line in question...
C: WHITACRE
D: Right, the office line is upstairs. Shepard and Whitacre head upstairs leaving Ginger behind.

D: I'll give you a call tomorrow and we can test it out.
C: WHITACRE
D: Great. Hey, thanks for coming by, Brian. Have a good night.
C: SHEPARD
D: Good night. Good night, Mrs. Whitacre. Shepard walks toward his car. Ginger and Mark linger.
C: GINGER
D: Are you going to say something or am I? Ginger pushes past him.
E: to her husband
C: GINGER
D: Brian?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 23. Shepard stops. Whitacre has no choice-- he finishes her sentence.
C: WHITACRE
D: You gotta minute. Whitacre walks past his wife toward the car. Ginger squeezes his hand as he passes her on the steps.
E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: Most of what we do is to impress girls-- I bet there are guys-- like circus guys who fall off the tight rope and on the way down all they think about are girls until they hit the ground-- not even about growing wings real fast-- just girls going by-They were going to find out anyway cuz' of Mick... Who knows what Mick and Dwayne have been telling them about me already.

S: INTERIOR SHEPARD'S CAR- NIGHT
N: The two men speak in the dome light of Shepard's Dodge r Dynasty.
C: SHEPARD
D: You want to go back inside?
C: WHITACRE
D: I think they might have it bugged. We're safer out here. Shepard is confused.
C: SHEPARD
D: Bugged? What? Whitacre takes a moment-- but decides to go on.
C: WHITACRE
D: This used to be Dwayne Andreas' house, you know that?
C: SHEPARD
D: I'm aware of that.
C: WHITACRE
D: There are things I know, but if I decide to tell you what's going on, could I be prosecuted for it?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 24.
C: SHEPARD
D: I can't provide you with immunity, but any information you tell me about your involvement in criminal activity would be discussed with the US attorney's office in a favorable light. Whitacre stares forward-- a beat. Shepard gets out his notebook.
C: WHITACRE
D: Everything I told you yesterday about Fujiwara was true-- except one thing. I never received a call from him on the office line. Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused.
C: SHEPARD
D: Why did you tell me that you did?
C: WHITACRE
D: Before I spoke with you, Mick Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached me on what to say. They told me to tell you that the calls came in on my business line, instead of my home line.
C: SHEPARD
D: Why? Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.
C: WHITACRE
D: What I'm about to tell you involves something very large. This extortion attempt by Fujiwara is nothing compared to it. Shepard says nothing.
C: WHITACRE
D: It involves price fixing in the lysine business. I've been in several meetings with our Japanese and Korean competitors in the past few months where the sole purpose has been to fix prices. ADM made me go to these meetings. Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.
E: CONT'D
N: Draft: 1/15/03 25.
C: WHITACRE
D: That's why they wanted me to lie. Fujiwara's calling on my home line. But, so are the people we fix prices with. They didn't want you to hear those conversations so they told me to say the Fujiwara calls came in on the ADM line. But, I knew if you guys ever started looking at the records you'd see all these calls I have to Japan. And that's what scared me. Nobody has more calls than me. If you ever figured out about the price fixing, I'd be the fall guy. Shepard considers the explanation.
C: SHEPARD
D: Who told you to participate in these price fixing talks? Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm operating under the direction of Mick and Dwayne Andreas.
S: 26 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- ALEXANDER'S ROOM
N: Ginger checks on her son.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Who's Dad talking to?
C: GINGER
D: A friend who needs his help. She walks down the hall pausing by a window. She can see the two men talking in the car. She turns off the light and gets into bed-- staring at the ceiling.
S: 27 INTERIOR SHEPARD'S CAR- LATER
N: Shepard writes down everything.
C: WHITACRE
D: Mick and Cheviron had me call Fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off.
C: SHEPARD
D: They told you to tell him to stop calling?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 26. R-
C: WHITACRE
D: They're afraid of what you guys might find out. Can you give me a tape recorder? I can prove this if you give me a tape recorder. I'll take a polygraph if that helps. Shepard is out of pages in his notebook.
C: SHEPARD
D: I want to thank you for being honest with me tonight.
C: WHITACRE
D: You're not going to ask questions at ADM about all this? It'd be my job for sure.
C: SHEPARD
D: No, what was said here was confidential. I'm going to speak to my superiors Mark, and then we'll be in touch. Whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs-- he seems unburdened.
C: WHITACRE
D: He seems like a real good guy...I mean just a straight shooter. I think we really got along-- I bet he wouldn't mind if I called him "Brian" instead of "Agent Shepard." "Bri." "Hey, Bri..." This must be very different for him. Talking to a guy like me instead of a bank robber or a drug dealer...
E: V.0.
C: ANGLE ON SHEPARD
D: Struggling to read his notes in the car.
C: WHITACRE
D: I could see us fishing or whatever. What a good listener-- you don't meet one of those everyday. Shepard takes out his cell phone. We hear ringing on the other end. A sleepy voice answers.
E: V.0.

D: Yeah, hello. Paisley.
E: O.S.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 27.
C: SHEPARD
D: It's Brian. I just got done talking to Whitacre, there's something much bigger going on here.
S: INTERIOR ADM- THE NEXT MORNING
N: Whitacre tries to look natural as he walks to his office, his first day as a whistle blower. No sooner does he take his seat, than Cheviron appears baring down on him though his glass walled office. Cheviron enters.
C: CHEVIRON
D: What happened last night?
C: WHITACRE
D: They put a recorder on my line.
C: CHEVIRON
D: And that's it?
C: WHITACRE
D: Yeah, and I was instructed that when Fujiwara calls, I'm to record the conversation. Whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary.
C: LIZ TAYLOR
D: Your wife on two.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Well, make sure you do it because they have ways of checking to see if you're going to or not. Whitacre picks up the call and the big bully goes away. We hear Ginger very excited on the other end of the phone...
C: WHITACRE
D: OK...0K...slow down... tell me what happened... Whitacre listens, leafs through his mail.
C: WHITACRE
D: Does anyone win that Publisher's Clearing House thing? Someone must, right? Otherwise it's against the law...Someone gets a million dollars or someone goes to jail...

S: INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS- MORNING
N: A small conference room with bad green wall paper and a view of the Illinois Capital Building. Shepard briefs AGENT DEAN PAISLEY and AGENT IN CHARGE KATE MEDFORD. He searches through his large pile of notes for the most shocking of last night's revelations. Medford eats her morning yogurt.
C: WHITACRE
D: 60 minutes or someone would come after Ed MacMahon. You can't use the US mail that way...And a guy like Ed MacMahon would never get involved...
E: V.0.
C: SHEPARD
D: .a pound of bacon, a peanut butter sandwich, some vitamins- anything that ADM has a hand in-- it's all fixed, that's what he's telling me. Basically, everyone in this country is the victim of corporate crime by the time they finish breakfast... Medford studies the ingredients of her yogurt.
C: PAISLEY
D: So, what do we have? Anti-trust violations, providing false information...
S: INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre is still on the phone-- pacing-- the person at the other end of the line is doing most of the talking.

S: INTERIOR ADM HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre is headed down the hall with a full head of steam.
C: WHITACRE
D: You think the automobile companies can't make a car tomorrow that gets a hundred miles to the gallon... You think the TV networks don't know who's going to win the World Series before the season starts...
E: V.0.
S: INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS- CONTINUOUS
C: SHEPARD
D: One potential problem I see going forward with ADM is this guy Cheviron. He wants to be kept in the loop on everything we're doing.
C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE
D: Pissed off. He storms down the corridors of ADM.
C: WHITACRE
D: "Paranoid" is what people who are trying to take advantage call you in an effort to get you to drop your guard-- I read that the other day in an in-flight magazine...

S: INTERIOR ADM- CHEVIRON'S OFFICE- DAY
N: About a third the size of Whitacre's office with a view of the loading dock. Whitacre BURSTS in.
C: WHITACRE
D: You told me they were only going to tap one line!
C: CHEVIRON
D: They are only monitoring one line.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 30.
C: WHITACRE
D: That's not true. Not true. I just talked to my wife and some woman named Regina from the phone company called saying both our lines are tapped. My home phone! Cheviron is sick of Whitacre's antics. He doesn't believe a word. It gets a bit heated.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Come on, the phone company doesn't call people and say, `hello just thought we'd let you know, the FBI is tapping your phone lines.'
C: WHITACRE
D: Then why would Regina say that?
C: CHEVIRON
D: She didn't say it, you're saying it.
C: WHITACRE
D: Call my wife. Call Regina. Cheviron's tone becomes condescending-- like he's talking to a sick person.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Fine, Mark. I will. Whitacre storms out.
C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE
D: Walking away-- satisfied-- he passes A SECRETARY making copies. She tugs on her WOOL TURTLENECK.
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't like wool on skin. Not even that merino wool they have at Field's in Chicago. Ginger likes it, cuz it's form fitting, but she likes avocados and who wants that texture in their mouth?

S: INTERIOR FBI DECATUR- DAY
N: On the third floor of some mid-70's default architecture in the heart of downtown Decatur, Brian Shepard sits in an office big enough for himself, a small evidence safe, a picture of his family and the flag. Out the window the stacks of ADM send up great white plumes. Shepard is boning up on anti-trust law when the phone rings.
C: SHEPARD
D: FBI. Shepard.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Brian, it's Mark Cheviron at ADM.
E: O.S.
C: SHEPARD
D: Yeah, Mark.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Hey, I asked you guys a couple of days ago which lines at Mark Whitacre's house you were going to be monitoring and we agreed it would just be the business line. So, that's all you did right? Beat.
E: O.S.
C: SHEPARD
D: I really can't answer that.
S: INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- LATER
N: Whitacre stares out through the glass walls drinking a COKE. Mick Andreas and Cheviron are making a bee-line for him.
C: WHITACRE
D: It doesn't taste the same-- when Dwayne Andreas got the government to subsidize corn farmers-- it all changed. Corn syrup got to be cheaper than sugar-- so they went with the high fructose corn syrup from ADM.. .They said you couldn't tell the difference, but that's just a lie-Like when they replaced butter with topping at the movies.. .and you know who was behind that...
E: V.0. off the Coke Can
N: Draft: 1/15/03 32. Mick Andreas and Cheviron march into Whitacre's office on a mission.
C: ANDREAS
D: We've decided that we're not going to be cooperating with any further FBI requests. Whitacre puts it all together. He is outraged. He turns on Cheviron.
C: WHITACRE
D: I knew it! I knew it! I knew we should never have done this. I told you, but you wouldn't listen. They said just the office line... Cheviron has to eat shit here in front of Andreas.
C: CHEVIRON
D: Evidently, they were lying to us, too.
C: WHITACRE
D: Sounds to me like you can't keep track of what the FBI is doing. The phone buzzes.
N: LIZ TAYLOR (ON INTERCOM) The call you were expecting, Mark. Whitacre pauses-- then picks up.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm working on this deal in Sweden, I have to take this. Whitacre picks up the phone. Andreas and Cheviron continue.
C: CHEVIRON
D: I told Shepard we're done working with them as of now.
C: ANDREAS
D: Damn right. Whitacre picks up the phone. It's not Sweden.
C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, it's Brian can you talk? Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of Mick and Cheviron-- he puts on a phony cheerful voice.
E: O.S.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 33.
C: WHITACRE
D: Yeah, hey it's good to hear from you.
E: over the phone

E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: Great. Hey, I got Mr. Andreas in here right now. OK, I'll talk to you soon. He hangs up the phone and turns back to Mick and Terry. Whitacre smiles warmly, and then lies through his teeth.
C: WHITACRE
D: So, what do I do if this Shepard guy calls?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDREAS
D: You let me know and I'll pass it on to my Dad. But, you're done talking to them...
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- EVENING
N: Whitacre sits with FBI agents Shepard and Paisley in the converted barn. A large open room looking more like a theme restaurant than anything that might have once involved agriculture. Outside, RUSTY the gardener, fishes leaves from the pool. Shepard explains the misunderstanding with the phones.
C: PAISLEY
D: The only listening device was the recorder, Mark.
C: SHEPARD
D: We had a trap and trace device on the home line-- but we can't listen in with that.
C: PAISLEY
D: However, the phone company calling people and telling them about our Intel gathering is, well, our face is red on that one.
C: SHEPARD
D: Did you bring the expense reports we talked about? Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 34.

C: WHITACRE
D: January-- somewhere in Asia. Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre.
C: AGENT PAISLEY
D: Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you doing this? We know you lied to us about the phone line and you're afraid of that. But, now you're telling us all this other stuff out of the blue. I gotta ask you why? The light disappears from Whitacre's eyes.
C: WHITACRE
D: Things are going on I don't approve of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But, they pulled me into the business side and they're doing things that are illegal. They said...
C: ANGLE ON RUSTY
D: He takes the net for cleaning the pool and walks around the barn to the attached six car garage filled with a Range Rover, Ferrari, Mercedes Coupe, BMW, and a Lincoln Town Car.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 35.

S: 38 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- CONTINUOUS
C: WHITACRE
D: When they told me to lie, I had to lie. I lied to you guys and I feel real bad about it. This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in.
C: SHEPARD
D: You look at yourself as wearing a white hat and they're wearing black hats.
C: WHITACRE
D: That's a good way to put it. You know, when I was a kid my folks died in an automobile accident. I was maybe six at the time and this wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He owned amusement parks and he did real well for himself, real well. I got a big break-- went to a good school and all-- I adopted two kids of my own. I just want to do the right thing.
C: PAISLEY
D: Well, Mark, do you think you'd be willing to go a few steps further in helping us?
C: WHITACRE
D: What do you mean?
C: SHEPARD
D: Would you be willing to wear a wire? We don't have any other sources at this time. We need your help. Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 36.
C: PAISLEY
D: Now you realize that by doing this, sometime down the line you could be the guy who has to testify against your fellow executives, people you've worked with now for years. That won't be easy. He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed.
C: SHEPARD
D: I'll use my beeper to signal you when it's time to set up a meeting. Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- "BEEEEP."
C: SHEPARD
D: When you hear this-- you call me. Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to Whitacre.
C: PAISLEY
D: You'll be risking a lot. Whitacre picks up the recorder. The idea of being a White Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword.
S: EXTERIOR COORS BREWERY- GOLDEN, COLORADO
N: Whitacre, Wilson and Andreas get out of a Town Car in front of Coors Corporate headquarters. The Rockies loom in the background. The men walk toward the doors.

C: AN DREAS

C: ANDREAS
D: You can go over the limit-- it's just a small fine.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 37.
C: WILSON
D: That's what I was saying. If they want a thousand dollars-- you give a thousand. So what if it ends up costing us nine thousand after the fine.
C: WHITACRE
D: Twelve thousand after taxes. The men laugh.
C: ANDREAS
D: If the guy's asking you for money, try not giving it to him and see what happens. Just make sure Dad is behind it... Is Dad asking for them?
C: WILSON
D: Yeah.
C: ANDREAS
D: Okay then.

D: Uh, Mark... Whitacre's FOUNTAIN PEN has exploded in his shirt-- leaving a Rorschach across his chest. Richter gestures toward the stain. Whitacre stares at the STAIN.
C: WHITACRE
D: One of the Japanese guys told me a story-- this lysine salesman is in a meeting with someone from Conagra or some other company, I don't know-and the client leans forward and says, `I have the same tie as you... only the pattern is reversed."-- and then he drops dead. Face down on the

S: INTERIOR HAMPTON INN, DECATUR- EVENING
N: Shepard and Herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel rooms for Whitacre. They check their watches and peak out the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot. They've been there awhile. Herndon eats a Granola bar and reads the side of the package.
C: WHITACRE
D: .Maybe everyone has a sentence like that; a little time bomb..."I have the same tie as you... only the patterns reversed."
E: V.O.
C: HERNDON
D: There it is, "High Fructose Corn Syrup." Shepard isn't giving up on Whitacre, yet.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 43.
C: SHEPARD
D: He said Andreas called him into a marketing meeting.
C: HERNDON
D: The government ought to charge him for the room. Shepard's cell phone rings. Herndon sighs--

C: SHEPARD
D: FBI... .Uh...huh. You're being honest with me, here... It's been months Mark-- we need some tapes.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE BMW- NIGHT
N: Whitacre sits alone in the Hampton Hotel parking lot next to the mall, staring up at at a the lights of a room.
C: WHITACRE
D: I gotta go Bri, Andreas is coming. Whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro cassette recorder. He looks at it like it's a murder weapon.
C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, we could be tracing this phone call...
E: O.S. over the phone
C: WHITACRE
D: I can't live two lives. They just gave me a hundred thousand dollar raise. I can't risk my job for you guys. I've got a family. I'm building stables across the road.

C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, listen to me, the only logical thing for you to do is cooperate.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: And what if I don't?
C: SHEPARD
D: Then somebody else will and you'll end up being a defendant.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: For how long, Brian? How long does this go on for? Whitacre pushes the buttons on the recorder. He hits eject. There's no tape in the cradle.
C: SHEPARD
D: I wish I could answer that. Sometimes years. We'll need a lot of tapes-- maybe hundreds.
E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, the tapes won't say anything. It's over. Mick said.. .New policy.
C: SHEPARD
D: Fine, if that's what he said, then I want to hear the tape. We need tapes, Mark. A beat-- he finally admits it. The windows are completely fogged.
E: O.S.

D: I didn't make any, OK? I didn't make any because it's over. How can I prove it to you?
S: 47 INTERIOR HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT
N: Whitacre sits shirtless on the bed with the straps of a polygraph across his torso. Herndon fits him with a blood pressure cuff and puts electrical clips on his fingers.
C: WHITACRE
D: I like my hands. I think they're probably my favorite part of my body. I think that can be used to my advantage in social situations-- if I can get people focused on my hands then I can get a good result in the meeting.
E: V.0.
N: (MORE) Draft: 1/15/03 45. WHITACRE (V.0.) (cont'd) Eye contact is real important, too. I'll use the lotion in the hotel room on my hands-- the little bottles. Single serving portions.. .Bob has good hands, too. Herndon takes out a list of questions and watches Whitacre closely. Shepard watches the needle on the polygraph.
C: SHEPARD WHITACRE
D: Now, Bob's going to ask you What do we lose-- a liter of questions, Mark. And you perspiration while we sleep? just need to answer them with That all goes into the a "yes" or "no." That's all mattress? Incredible. you have to say.

C: HERNDON
D: Did Fujiwara ever telephone you at home and tell you there was a mole at ADM?
C: WHITACRE
D: Yes.
C: HERNDON
D: Before this year did you ever lie to someone you really trusted?
C: WHITACRE
D: No. Whitacre strains to see the read-out to see how he's doing.
C: HERNDON
D: Did Fujiwara say he would tell you who the mole was for 10 million dollars?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 46.

D: No.
C: HERNDON
D: Now, I'm going to ask you the same questions again to make sure the results are consistent. Whitacre nods and smiles. Watches the needle- rock steady.

S: INTERIOR HOLIDAY INN- HALLWAY
N: Shepard and Herndon step out of the room. Herndon speaks to Whitacre over his shoulder.
C: HERNDON
D: You can get dressed, Mark. The door closes and the agents look at each other.
S: INTERIOR HOLIDAY INN HOTEL ROOM- CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre buttons his shirt and puts his tie back on. He looks out the hotel room window at the snow. In the parking lot a high school kid drinks a beer while trying to write his name in urine in the snowbank.
C: WHITACRE
D: They're all different. Every flake is it's own one-of-a-kind version of itself. And some people still don't believe in God. I mean what more proof do you need than that-- Herndon and Shepard re-enter.
E: V.0.
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey, how'd I do?
C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, we have some problems...
C: WHITACRE
D: Wait a minute, I watched the machine, I didn't see any changes...
C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, you don't know how to read a polygraph.
C: WHITACRE
D: I've heard these things, they're not always 100 per cent accurate. I've been telling the truth. Definitely. Herndon plays the bad cop.
C: HERNDON
D: Mark, you splattered the walls with ink. Come on now, extortionists don't just leave their name and number then go away.
N: Draft; 1/15/03 48. Whitacre nods-- his eyes water, He sighs.
C: SHEPARD
D: I know it's tough keeping it all bottled up inside, keeping it a secret. But, there's only one good choice for you. That's all there's ever been. There's something you're hiding, something you're keeping from us. But, the only way to protect yourself is to be completely honest.
E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: Okay. Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic 302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.
C: SHEPARD
D: You realize this document can be used against you in a court of law. Whitacre nods grimly.
C: HERNDON
D: What happened with Fujiwara and the saboteur? A beat.
C: WHITACRE
D: I made it up. I had to... Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates open. Shepard transcribes the confession.
C: WHITACRE
D: .We've had problems at the plant with viruses, we're way behind projections. Dwayne was thinking about shutting us down and everyone was on me to fix it. 'Let's just blame it all on Whitacre.' That's how it is there. It was my job they were talking about. We just moved here from Europe-they made me VP.
E: CONT'D
C: SHEPARD
D: And the reason you agreed to help ADM purchase a new bug?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 49.
C: WHITACRE
D: I wanted to be part of the team. I thought it would help my relationship with Mick if he thought I would do something like that.
C: HERNDON
D: And what about the price fixing? It isn't over is it? There's no "new attitude."
N: WHITACRE (DEFEATED) There's been meetings all along-- in the past three weeks even. Nothing's changed... Again, Whitacre's mind allows him to be two places at once... WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.)

D: If there's anything else you want to add, now's the time. You need to tell us.

D: No, that's the full story.

N: Draft: 1/15/03 50.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'll give you all the tapes you want. Merry Christmas you guys.

C: TERRY WILSON
D: In 92 we did exactly what we told them we would do in terms of volume. Exactly. Right now, there's no promise.
C: WHITACRE
D: He said he'd like to talk to you at some point...
N: Draft: 1/15/03 51.
C: TERRY WILSON
D: Be right there lookin' at him. Say, "listen here you little mousy motherfucker." Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world.
C: WHITACRE
D: That was Terry Wilson talking about setting volume and price levels with our Japanese competitor-- Ajinomoto Corporation. Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself.
C: WHITACRE
D: By the way, there was no discussion with Mimoto last night. That was all for illustration purposes only. I wanna make that clear- no discussion with Mimoto last night. He turns off the tape recorder.
E: CONT'D
S: INTERIOR HAMPTON INN- EVENING
N: Whitacre paces while Herndon and Shepard listen to a tape. He's got three more recordings in his briefcase.
C: SHEPARD
D: Hey, Mark you don't really need to narrate the tapes for us when you're making them.
C: WHITACRE
D: Right. Absolutely. Not a problem.
C: HERNDON
D: And you can talk less.
C: WHITACRE
D: I think I did on this one. Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box.
C: SHEPARD
D: Don't force the conversation.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, they're good right? I mean, you guys wouldn't believe what goes on at these meetings.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 52.
C: WHITACRE
D: I've got well over two million frequent flier miles.. .maybe more. The equivalent of two trips to the moon. I'm pretty much platinum across the board. Free upgrades... sometimes they'll move me from business to first just cuz the computer tells them I'm there...

I'm probably one of the youngest guys ever to go over a million miles...I get a letter from the CEO every year thanking me...it's a form letter, but it looks like he's really signing it...They probably walk in one day and he signs like a hundred while he's on the phone... Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy. Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is hooked up to a recorder.
E: V.O.

C: WHITACRE'S POV
D: He follows Shepard's hands from Kleenex, to coffee cup, to pen, to a tug on his ear...
C: WHITACRE
D: Now what happens? Something you breathe in on an airplane. Some little bacteria and now it's on his hands, the cup, the phone... Probably got it from his kids and now I'll spend the weekend with it in bed...And I'll miss a few days next week, or Alexander'11 run a fever and who pays for that?

N: Whitacre walks down the concourse carrying a BLACK FOLDER with ADM emblazoned on it. He turns into the bathroom and stares at himself in the mirror. He checks his HAIR and then opens the FOLDER. He removes the legal pad to reveal a secret compartment holding a small TAPE RECORDER.
C: WHITACRE
D: This is tape seven, side two.. .Chicago, O'hare airport... He looks at himself in the mirror. And then down at his feet. A BLACK CHUCKLE'S CANDY lies on the floor swarmed by ants.
E: into tape recorder
N: Draft: 1/15/03 54.
C: WHITACRE POV
D: The black chuckle being carted away by ants inches from his wing tips.
C: WHITACRE
D: That's a big break, right there-- definitely. There's no choices to be made. No debate. It's there-- you're an ant-- you eat it-- you bring it back for the other ants.. .They don't say they'd rather have the cherry flavored one... Real- simple to live like that.

S: INTERIOR GASLIGHT LOUNGE, O'HARE AIRPORT
N: Wilson sits at a table with two FRENCH EXECUTIVES-- ROLLIER AND CROUY. Wilson wields the FOUNTAIN PEN. The lounge did well in the 70's and has decided to stay there-- most everything is covered in red velvet, except for the waitresses-- they're covered in sequined body suits and fishnets. Whitacre returns from the bathroom. He puts the TAPE RECORDER/FOLDER on the table. Wilson rests his cocktail ON IT.
C: WILSON
D: We cannot have one section of the world where it works and the rest of the world where it doesn't. It will not last...
C: WHITACRE
D: Debate and discussion. They just keep the black one from making it home...
E: V.O.
C: ROLLIER
D: We would obviously play the game. But, the Koreans and the Japanese...
C: CROUY
D: .They'll cheat.

S: INTERIOR HAMPTON INN DECATUR- EVENING

N: Draft: 1/15/03 56. A beat. Herndon thinks. He has an idea.
C: HERNDON
D: Give me your pants. Whitacre undoes the pants of his SAGE GREEN SUIT.
C: WHITACRE
D: Being able to do two things at once is a big part of success. I try and do abdominal exercises... isometrics... even when I'm at a meeting. Tensing. Holding. And then releasing. And there are leg ones I do in the car. I'll even floss in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair. During the part where you're just supposed to leave it in. Those things can really add up to a significant time savings.

C: WHITACRE
D: What do you think?
E: CONT'D
C: RUSTY THE GARDENER
D: It's a nice briefcase.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, wait. Whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to reveal a TAPE RECORDER. He couldn't be more proud.

D: She's getting married.
C: ANDREAS
D: My Tina is getting married?

C: WHITACRE
D: Uh.
C: ANDREAS
D: Nice body. It'd ruin her tits. She's got the greatest tits in the world... He leans in to Whitacre.
C: ANDREAS
D: In the world. Whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds.
C: WHITACRE
D: When polar bears hunt, they crouch down by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal to pop up. They keep one paw over their nose so that they blend in. Cuz' they've got those black noses. They'd blend in perfectly if not for the nose...

N: Whitacre descends the steps of the jet followed by Andreas and some other SUITS. Whitacre peels off the group.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm just gonna hit the head here.
C: WHITACRE
D: So the question is. How do they know their noses are black? From looking at other polar bears? Do they see their reflections in the water? And think, "I'd be invisible if not for that." That seems like a lot of thinking for a bear.

C: WHITACRE
D: Usually the hotel's name is embossed on the pencils and they have someone who sharpens them to perfect points like collie dog noses-- that's what they remind me of. Maybe they come from the factory that way. And there's always a plate of danish...danishes?-- an almond thing-- or a cheese danish with a big cherry blob in the middle...

S: INTERIOR MEN'S ROOM- CONTINUOUS
N: The AFRICAN AMERICAN AGENT finishes shaving Whitacre's chest. He takes out a roll of surgical tape and attaches a small NAGRA RECORDER to WHITACRE. Small wires attach to switches sewn into Whitacre's pants pockets.

C: ADM SUIT
D: Good luck with the Japs. And as your lawyer I'd advise you to pat `em down for wires. Andreas laughs at the suit, but Whitacre's not laughing. The limo pulls away.
C: WHITACRE
D: Uh, should we really pat them down?
C: ANDREAS
D: They don't have the balls to mess with ADM.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 60. Whitacre sighs.

C: SHEPARD
D: Look away, Mark, look away... Whitacre's face fills the wide angle lens. Shepard and Herndon huddle around the video monitor. HERNDON IS DRESSED LIKE A UNIFORMED HOTEL WORKER. SHEPARD is still dressed like a G-man from the 50's.

S: INTERIOR CONFERENCE ROOM- MARRIOTT HOTEL- CONTINUOUS
C: ANDREAS
D: We have a big board of directors. We have public shareholders. Like you, we've suffered. Prices are nowhere near where we hoped they would be. Now the question is, if the market grows, who gets it? Ikeda goes over to the easel and makes a PIE CHART as a visual aid for Andreas' proposal.
C: I ANDREAS
D: .If Kyowa Hakko, Miwon and Cheil Corporation each get two thousand tons, then we can divide up the rest. If we're going to have any stability at all... And under...

I admit I've done it a couple of times-but I don't tell people I'm a really good golfer when I'm not...I'm sure if I worked at it... took lessons... Whitacre is distracted by a CLICKING SOUND. He shifts uncomfortably. Andreas notices the sound and pauses.

N: Draft: 1/15/03 63.
C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE
D: He removes the panel concealing the tape recorder, fiddles with a pieces of the lining caught in the apparatus.
C: ANDREAS
D: You gotta remember we have a lot more capacity than we're using. We could be growing twenty thousand tons, isn't that right, Mark? Whitacre is still fiddling with the case.
E: V.0.
C: ANDREAS
D: Mark? What're you doing? Andreas crosses the room and, without looking inside at the recorder that is ruining his life, shuts the case.

N: Pull back to reveal Herndon and Shepard presenting their prized tape to ROBIN MANN ESQ, early 40's-- humorless and contrary. The tape plays...
C: ROBIN MANN
D: What did he say-- I can't understand him.
C: ANDREAS
D: I don't care what you call it, just as long as we get what we want. The men on the tape all laugh. Andreas walksaway.Whitacre and Ikeda shake hands. And then Whitacre ripsoffthe sheet of paper from the easel with the PIE CHART onit.
E: on the tape
N: Draft: 1/15/03 64.

E: on the tape
C: ROBIN MANN
D: Where's the agreement? There's just a discussion.
C: HERNDON
D: If this isn't an agreement, then what are they doing there?
C: SHEPARD
D: Don't get bogged down in the words, look at the actions.
C: ROBIN MANN
D: I've looked. I see a chart with a bunch of numbers. But, I can't pinpoint any agreement per se.
C: HERN DON
D: What do you want? The guy is standing there dividing up the market plain as day. Herndon opens up the evidence bag and shows her the flip- chart page that Whitacre took at the end of the meeting-- a smoking gun.
C: ROBIN MANN
D: It could just be a proposal. All the other companies weren't there. Nobody used the word "agreement." I'm just telling you-- as a lawyer-- what their lawyers are going to say. Herndon and Shepard look at Whitacre FROZEN ON THE MONITOR. They are discouraged.
C: HERNDON
D: I don't know how much more we can ask of the guy.
C: ROBIN MANN
D: I'm not going to move for indictments with this. I need more.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 65.

C: MARTY ALLISON
D: I feel like a real jerk here, but I need the dough.
C: WHITACRE
D: Nah, we'll figure something out.
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: I hope it's not a big deal, but I've been looking at a house and I need the cash back.
C: WHITACRE
D: Marty, when I hired you, what did you want?
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: Fifty grand.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, I went to Wilson and told him you wouldn't work here for less than seventy-five-- and I got it. You were the first guy I hired.
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: Mark, you've always been real generous with me and... Whitacre waves off the flattery.
C: WHITACRE
D: I gotta leave town for a couple of days, but when I get back, here's what I want you to do... And under...

C: SHEPARD
D: We got a problem, Mark. You can't take our equipment to Japan. We have no jurisdiction.

C: SHEPARD
D: Well, sure, but there's something else I'd like you to think about.
C: WHITACRE
D: Okay.
C: SHEPARD
D: Like I said, we can't give you any recording equipment.
C: HERNDON
D: But, if you taped the meeting on your own and than gave us the tapes...
C: WHITACRE
D: So you want me to make a tape.
C: HERNDON
D: We're not allowed to say that. But, the sooner we get enough evidence, the sooner you can stop the taping.
C: WHITACRE
D: What if I get caught there?
C: SHEPARD
D: I don't know anything about Japanese laws, but if you're arrested, we may not be able to provide much help.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 67.
C: HERNDON
D: That's why we need these lysine association meetings on US soil.. .Make it easier to wrap this up. Shepard picks up the recorder.

S: INTERIOR HICKORY POINT MALL- LATER
N: Whitacre walks out of the RADIO SHACK with a small bag.
C: WHITACRE
D: I wonder if Brian and Bob are really allowed to do that-- it seems kind of shady...I probably should've gotten them to sign something just in case. Turned the tables on them seeing how I'm the one going above and beyond the call of duty... He heads out of the mall.

C: MCDEERE
D: .And my brother out now.
C: TARRANCE
D: Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch.
C: MCDEERE
D: Then get yourself another snitch. Tarrance responds with a string of expletives and threats to knock McDeere's teeth down his throat. His verbal assault is put to a halt when his phone rings. It's Holly Hunter calling from the nearby parking lot. She plays Tarrance an incriminating tape of what he has just said. McDeere is wearing a wire. McDeere has him now.
C: MCDEERE
D: You want to reconsider?
C: WHITACRE

C: GINGER
D: Did you go again?
C: WHITACRE
D: I needed to unwind.
C: GINGER
D: You've seen that picture like five times now... She turns on the light to discuss her concerns. Mark is standing there without his shirt on-- A LARGE PATCH OF HAIR is missing from the middle of his chest.
C: WHITACRE
D: What's wrong with that?
C: GINGER
D: What's wrong? Why is your chest shaved, Mark? Why are there holes cut in your suit clothes? Why aren't you a part of this family anymore? Whitacre tries to laugh off her concern. He sits down on the bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 71.
C: WHITACRE
D: You know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder. They needed to... I'm a part...
C: GINGER
D: I need you at home, the kids need you to be their father.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm doing all this for you and the kids. I didn't ask for this-- but I want to give this family everything. That's why I'm working so much.
C: GINGER
D: I don't know who you work for anymore, Mark. Do you? A beat. He smiles warmly at her.
S: INTERIOR FBI DECATUR- DAY
N: Warm summer day-- out the window the smoke stacks of ADM send plumes of white smoke into the blue sky. Shepard and Herndon sit in their SHIRTSLEEVES transcribing tapes in the tiny office. There's a knock on the door. Shepard checks to see who it is through the eye-hole. Whitacre enters wearing the SAGE COLORED SUIT- full of confidence.
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey guys, I was in the neighborhood. I got some more tapes.
C: SHEPARD
D: Thanks, Mark. Come on in.
C: WHITACRE
D: And I've learned some important things recently. I've been told I'm probably going to be the next President of ADM. He glows.
C: HERNDON
D: Really?
C: SHEPARD
D: Who told you that?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 72.
C: WHITACRE
D: And that's not all. I'd say that ten of the products produced by ADM are price fixed.
C: SHEPARD
D: Ten?
C: WHITACRE
D: I would estimate that for all the companies involved, the total extra profit is in the range of 800 million to one billion dollars. That's just from the price-fixing.
C: SHEPARD
D: Can you tell us what products? Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind.
C: WHITACRE
D: You know, Brian, if all these companies are charged, they're going to be paying an awful lot in fines. Don't you think?
C: SHEPARD
D: I don't know, they might end up paying. But, nobody knows for sure how this will turn out.
C: HERNDON
D: We still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement before we have a case.
C: WHITACRE
D: Sure, sure I know that. But, I've taken a lot of risks and I need to think about my family.
C: SHEPARD
D: What do you mean?
C: WHITACRE
D: Well, I'd like it if, in their fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten year's salary.
C: SHEPARD
D: Well, Mark...
C: WHITACRE
D: It's only fair. Also, one other thing.
N: (MORE) Draft: 1/15/03 73.

E: CONT'D
C: SHEPARD
D: I can't grant you immunity Mark, you know that. Whitacre smiles wishfully like a big kid. Herndon senses that something's up.
C: HERNDON
D: Hey, Mark, it's kind of warm in here-- why don't you take off your jacket, sit down and we can talk about this.
C: WHITACRE
D: Oh, no, Bob, that's okay. Let me know if you want to reconsider. Whitacre leaves. Herndon looks at Shepard.
C: SHEPARD
D: What was that about?
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MARK'S OFFICE- EVENING
N: Whitacre labels the tape of the FBI agents and tosses it in a box-- with other tapes.
C: WHITACRE
D: These floods out on the Mississippi, you have to think about these. It just looks like some boy scouts and sand bags on the news-right until you have your stock plummet because of crop losses... Then it looks like someone's knee deep in your kids college education looking for their photo albums.. .Brian doesn't understand stock options. He doesn't see what can happen if they take those away from me.

Whitacre stands in his bathrobe in the rain with the LEAF BLOWER. There's one wet leaf stuck to the pavement and he's focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard, oblivious to the rain.
C: WHITACRE
D: We got a deer problem here. They're in the corn, they're eating the small trees, they charge into the road. Too many deer. Take away all the predators and that's going to happen.. .No bears, no coyotes...So now you have all these deer-- weak and desperate.
E: V.O.
C: ANGLE ON THE DEER
D: Close enough to hear the rain on their METAL BODIES. They are YARD STATUES.
C: WHITACRE
D: And then one gets sick and they all get sick. Because they're broke and hungry and they make mistakes. Who's fault is that? You can't blame the deer for not having predators...

D: Come inside Mark, what's happening to you? She takes his arm and tries to lead him toward the house, but he turns on her. His eyes are filled with terror. She turns off the blower.
C: WHITACRE
D: You want to be someone living in some small house? You want to be like those people who can't afford cars for their kids?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 75.
C: GINGER
D: You're not better than somebody else because you have more cars or a bigger salary. Or some stables across the road. You used to know that, you used to know what mattered. You need to find that out again-- you need to turn to God. Whitacre stares at the leaf, trying to move it with his will.
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't need God.
E: softly so God won't hear

D: We can overnight it.
C: WHITACRE
D: Nah, I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy. I'll just hand it to him.
C: SCHMIDT

D: Christ, how about this guy Whitacre? What's his story?
C: SHEPARD
D: What do you mean?
C: MUTCHNIK
D: What's his agenda? The guy's making 350 grand a year, he's moving up the ladder and he turns informer. When does that happen? Is the money going up his nose? Some woman somewhere with a kid that he's seeing on one of these business trips? What's his story? Shepard and Herndon are offended on behalf of Mark. Herndon reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a GREETING CARD.

C: WHITACRE
D: I'm gonna be the only one left. Dwayne will be gone. Mick will be gone. Terry will be gone. I'm going to be the only one who can run ADM.

C: WHITACRE
D: I'm next in line.
C: GINGER

C: WHITACRE
D: You want me to go and hire an attorney now?
C: HERNDON
D: No, not now...
C: MUTCHNIK
D: The first thing that's going to happen is the company lawyers are going to come to all the executives with a list of attorneys for you to pick from. You gotta understand, these attorneys are being paid by ADM. They don't represent you. Do not take one of these attorneys, that's when you say to them that you have your own attorney.

D: Tell them you've decided to cooperate with the government.
C: MUTCHNIK
D: It's perfectly reasonable for you to cooperate. It happens all the time.

C: SHEPARD
D: Why did you do that, Mark? Why did you tell Dougherty?

C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S OFFICE
D: From the trading floor. Dowd gets up and pulls the curtains shut. Through a crack in the drapes we see Whitacre and Dowd talk.
C: WHITACRE
D: It feels good to talk, to clear the air-- you get to be like a balloon after a while. A balloon looking for a pin to bump into and relieve the pressure. You could get sick from keeping it inside and get a tumor or something..I didn't ask for that. Why should I pay for my own legal fees when I'm not the one who started the price fixing.

C: JOHN DOWD
D: No question about it. Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable silence follows.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'm sorry for what's happened.
C: ANDREAS
D: Sorry? What's that? Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas' hand and walks away. The men are all stunned, they watch him leave.

C: SHEPARD
D: Not here, Mark-- on the phone we can set something up.
C: WHITACRE
D: You gotta help me. Whitacre looks around-- all the houses have eyes. A LITTLE NEIGHBOR BOY has stopped playing catch with his MOTHER and both are now staring at Whitacre and Shepard-- as are a group of CITY WORKERS fixing a telephone wire.
C: SHEPARD
D: If you need to talk, call me. Whitacre gets back in his car. Shepard watches him drive away-- over his shoulder we hear the phone ringing. Whitacre parks at the far end of the street.

C: EPSTEIN
D: So, there wasn't a saboteur in the beginning at all? You made that up?
C: WHITACRE
D: Maybe there was, there could've been-- ADM steals technology from the Japanese-- so I wouldn't put it past the Japanese to do the same thing. But after I told them that I made it up the FBI said I didn't have much of a choice.
C: EPSTEIN
D: And you began making tapes...How many tapes did you make? Whitacre again displays his gift to move his lips and mind in different directions. The interior monologue takes precedence-- the on-camera story we've heard before.

D: Uh, two and a half years. I was a VP and a cooperating witness. A moment of reflection and then...
C: WHITACRE
D: I've always thought when this was over there'd still be a place for me at ADM. I still got a lot of friends there. The lawyers look at each other.
C: EPSTEIN
D: Mark, it's very important to your case that you not discuss it with anyone else. These people you work with, your friends, they could end up being witnesses. So Bob and I are the only people I want you to talk to about this from now on and I want you to know you can tell us anything.
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate it. I feel a whole lot better. Whitacre leaves. Epstein and Zaideman try and absorb what they've just heard. Then they burst into hysterical laughter.

N: Whitacre is parked in his MERCEDES across the road staring through the chain link fence. Trucks rumble by.

E: O.S.
C: WHITACRE

C: HERNDON
D: Mark, you understand your lawyer has advised you not to discuss this matter?
C: SHEPARD
D: We're not asking you.
C: WHITACRE
D: Let me throw out some "hypotheticals." I'll talk about some financial situations and you tell me if they're wrong or how serious they might be, OK? For instance, suppose a company gave an executive a car, you know, a corporate car. But instead of driving it to work he drove his personal car and gave the company car to his daughter. Would that be a problem?
C: HERNDON
D: That's it? That's the hypothetical? The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.
C: SHEPARD
D: That shouldn't be a problem.
C: WHITACRE
D: What about if an executive used a corporate plane for personal use?
C: HERNDON
D: Basically, it's the same thing.
C: SHEPARD
D: There may be some IRS issues but...

D: Uh, is this conversation on or off the record?
C: SHEPARD
D: On. Definitely. Whitacre exhales.
C: WHITACRE
D: What if the company regularly accepted kickbacks to executives in the form of cash? Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.
C: SHEPARD
D: How much money are we talking about Mark? Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.
C: WHITACRE
D: Five hundred thousand.
C: HERNDON
D: How much??? Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just crapped on the rug.
C: WHITACRE
D: It's how things were done there.
C: SHEPARD

C: SHEPARD

C: WHITACRE
D: Maybe a couple. The agents try and control their anger.
C: SHEPARD
D: Who else knows about this?
C: WHITACRE
D: Nobody. Herndon loses it.
C: HERNDON
D: Come on, Mark-- you just said it's how things were done at ADM. Now, is there anything else you're involved in? Anything else you need to tell us?
C: WHITACRE
D: Just what I told you.
C: HERNDON
D: I'm asking you one more time.
C: WHITACRE
D: The 500 and that's it. Definitely. Whitacre nods. He asks hopefully...
C: WHITACRE
D: This isn't going to affect the price-fixing case, is it? The three men get up to leave.
C: WHITACRE
D: I feel good about that. Hey, I don't see what the big deal is. They said help us with the price fixing and I did-- the two things are totally unrelated...

E: V.0.
C: AUBREY DANIEL
D: Two point five million dollars. Deposited in a bank in Switzerland while Mark Whitacre was on ADM business. We have sworn testimony from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson of the ABP Corporation that he's never seen this contract before and that his signature has been forged. He and his company never received this check... As Daniel speaks one of the younger lawyers passes out a folder of affidavits and other documents supporting his claims.
C: AUBREY DANIEL
D: It is clear to us that Mark Whitacre, driven by his own boundless ambition to take over ADM, has attempted to frame his superiors in a price fixing conspiracy of his own invention so that he could seize control of the company...
N: Draft: 1/15/03 122. Mann and Mutchnik can't believe what they're seeing in the black folders.
C: AUBREY DANIEL
D: His cooperation with the government is merely a smokescreen for his lying and stealing. We have additional information that we are prepared to share with Attorney General Reno that the money has been moved to an account in Grand Cayman with the full knowledge and complicity of Whitacre's FBI partners...

C: SHEPARD
D: What are they accusing me of? I want the specifics? Are they saying I'm in cahoots with the guy? Medford and Paisley don't want to answer this.
C: MEDFORD
D: Paragraph eight in our agreement with Whitacre states that his actions are directly attributable to the FBI and the US...
C: SHEPARD
D: But, how could we know what he was doing? He came to us...
C: PAISLEY
D: The question they're asking isn't `how could we know?' It's `why didn't we know?'
C: HERNDON
D: The question is `were they fixing prices?' Medford and Paisley share a look.
C: MEDFORD
D: The investigation has shifted from ADM to Whitacre.
C: SHEPARD
D: Of course, ADM decides Whitacre's a thief as soon as they find out he's working for us.
C: HERNDON
D: Who's counting the money over there if they can just lose 2.5 Million dollars for a few years and then find it in a few hours?
C: SHEPARD
D: We gotta call Mark.
C: PAISLEY
D: I don't want you doing that. Shepard and Herndon are confused.

D: I only kept a million and a half-- and Mick knew about it, he knew these things went on. They taught me how to do it. Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads.
C: EPSTEIN
D: You can't bullshit these people tomorrow. Who knows what they know? If we're going in there we got to go in with the whole story. Because the way it gets bad for you is if you tell them you're confessing and you don't. Then you are sorely screwed. Whitacre looks at his shoe box. He nods.

D: Listen, I haven't been telling you the whole truth. I'll clear it up in there today.
C: ZAIDEMAN
D: What? OH, SHIT. Epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons to stop the approaching doom.
C: EPSTEIN
D: We got to get you out of here. But, it's too late the doors open. Whitacre steps out.
C: WHITACRE
D: No. I want to tell them. Hold on Epstein.
S: INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO
N: Whitacre surrounded by Epstein and Zaideman who can only imagine which way their loose cannon will roll. Across from the DOJ lawyers as far as the eye can see.
C: ROBIN MANN
D: Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes a breach of his agreement with the US government. He is no longer a cooperating witness.
C: EPSTEIN
D: My client has given you years of his life, clearly he made mistakes, but he made your case.
C: ROBIN MANN
D: We're not here to discuss the case against ADM.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 126. ED HERBST, early 50's, and MARY SPEARING, 40's, take over-- they take no prisoners.
C: HERBST
D: Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst and I'm with the FBI Economic Crimes Unit. I'd like you to tell me when your criminal conduct at ADM began.
C: WHITACRE
D: In early 1992. I learned how things were done there from Mick Andreas. He's the one who taught me how to use embezzlement and kickbacks to make money tax free. Epstein tries to do some damage control.
C: EPSTEIN
D: My client is...
C: WHITACRE
D: I know the frauds I committed are wrong, and I accept responsibility for them.
C: HERBST
D: How did you receive the money?
C: WHITACRE
D: Primarily by check. I deposited them in my bank account in Decatur. This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry--
C: MARY SPEARING
D: They paid kickbacks in checks? What company would pay kickbacks in checks? Come on... No one from the government has ever been aggressive toward Whitacre before-- he's thrown.
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't really remember the exact name... something like AgriConsulting and Trading, something like that...
C: MARY SPEARING
D: You don't remember the name of the company that paid you checks?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 127.
C: WHITACRE
D: I. .I've got a lot going on in my life. It's hard to remember.
C: EPSTEIN
D: Hey, we're coming to you guys. We're cooperating here and we're going to get the money back. Epstein looks at Whitacre-- this last part might be hard.
C: HERBST
D: This might help your memory. He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre.
C: WHITACRE
D: Where did you get that?
C: HERBST
D: These are ADM records showing the forging of signatures. Whitacre smiles and shakes his head. He sees the conspiracy plainly.
C: WHITACRE WHITACRE
D: See, that's how they keep Didn't these people see The people in the fold-- they Firm-- or read the book. tell you to take the money It's all there. Everything and then they use it against they did to me they did to you if you talk. It's how Tom Cruise... I'm not the one they control us. You gotta they should be mad at... realize who these people are...
E: V.0.
C: MARY SPEARING
D: Is there anything else you have a hard time remembering? Whitacre looks at Epstein. Epstein shakes his head "no" but Whitacre has other plans.
C: WHITACRE
D: Umm...I have a few other things to tell you about. Epstein sighs.
C: WHITACRE
D: There were some things I did in Mexico...
N: Draft: 1/15/03 128. PULL BACK FROM CONFERENCE ROOM As Whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in bewilderment ... The man is unhinged.
C: WHITACRE
D: I raised white mice, too. Chickens and goats and white mice in little cages. They couldn't come in the house. I took care of them-- that was my job outside. One got in one time, I don't know how, and he was found dead by my Mother. This had nothing to do with anything I had done-- he just had died and it was up to me to bring him back to life. I wanted to do the right thing and wear the white hat and that's why I tried to make it all right so he wouldn't have to be dead. All the things I did were for that-- but I couldn't.

S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- NIGHT
N: Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up-- his hair seems to be graying around the edges. In front of him are a pile of newspapers-- Washington Post, WSJ, Chicago Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement of his sins.
C: HERNDON
D: We can't see you anymore and if you call us and start to talk about it, we'll have to hang up...
C: SHEPARD

C: SHEPARD
D: Mark, please understand. This isn't what we want. We've got no choice here.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 129.
C: WHITACRE
D: I'll tell you what, my frustration and anger is all coming from my work with you guys. I mean, this stuff in the papers, my kids read that. It's all, "Dump on Mark Whitacre." It's not right. I'm harassed by the media and Mick and Terry are still going to work in the morning.
C: SHEPARD
D: Remember, Mark, we told you it was impossible to predict what would happen when the case went overt.
C: HERNDON
D: And you never told us about the Five Million Dollars you took... Ginger has heard this before and can't hear it again.
C: GINGER
D: He worked for you for two and a half years, he risked his career, his home.. .And now you turn your back on him and leave us out here.
C: WHITACRE
D: Ginger... But the damn has burst. She sobs.
C: SHEPARD
D: The reason we came today is because we are concerned about your and Mark's well being.
C: HERNDON
D: It's important that you tell the people in Washington everything tomorrow-- one hundred per cent. Whitacre nods. Ginger seethes.
C: GINGER
D: You'd have nothing without him and you know it. He's just been used by the government and then thrown away cuz' it's a lot easier to go after Mark Whitacre than anyone named Andreas. Whitacre stares at the newspapers.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 130.
C: WHITACRE
D: I think a lot of people would come-- a lot of friends... and people would be surprised by just how many there are. Even folks from ADM... The news media would be there for sure...

S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- DAWN
N: Whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm goes off. He lies across his wife on the bed-- more like a child than a husband.
C: WHITACRE
D: .Everything would come out. Brian and Bob would come and I bet one of them would say something about me. Rheinhard would come up from Mexico. Sid or Marty would tell people what kind of boss I was and how I always brought back presents...
E: V.0.

S: EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- MORNING
N: Whitacre opens the garage door and we see the entire fleet of cars he has amassed-- 5 Million dollars buys a lot of steering wheels. Ferrari, Range Rover, Jeep, etc. Whitacre selects the BMW convertible. He gets in the car and puts his brief case in the seat next to him. He opens it and we see the contents: HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES ABOUT WHITACRE. A scrapbook from a roller coaster ride. He starts the car and guns the engine.
C: ANGLE ON THE GARAGE
D: The Beemer does not back up-- THE GARAGE DOOR COMES DOWN.
C: WHITACRE

S: EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: RUSTY the gardener shows up for work. He gets out of his Pick-Up and kicks a few leaves off the driveway, he adds some chemicals to the pool and then walks toward the garage-- as he's fishing some keys out of his pocket he notices the sound of a car engine.

S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION GARAGE- CONTINUOUS
N: The air is thick with smoke. Whitacre is motionless sprawled in the backseat-- drenched in sweat clutching the PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY.
C: RUSTY
D: Jesus, no. Somebody help. Rusty throws the car in reverse and pulls out.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 132.
C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE
D: He opens an eye, but as Rusty looks down at him again he closes it-- plays dead. The car is outside now. Rusty turns off the engine. Whitacre sighs heavily.
C: WHITACRE
D: Bud, pull the car back into the garage. Pull back in before somebody sees me. Rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off. The smoke is still clearing.
C: RUSTY
D: Jesus, Mark, what are you doing? Whitacre still stretched out in the backseat stares up at the ceiling-- explodes.
C: WHITACRE
D: You...You fucking God. You owe me. You fucking God. After everything I did. Rusty is shocked by the outburst-- this is not the guy he knows at all. He backs away from the car and picks up the garage phone.
C: RUSTY
D: Ginger, can you come to the garage?
C: GINGER
D: Why? Rusty, what's wrong?
E: O.S.
C: RUSTY
D: I just need to talk to you.
C: GINGER
D: I'm not coming down there unless you tell me what's wrong.
C: RUSTY
D: Mark just tried to kill himself and... Ginger's piercing scream comes down the phone line. Whitacre is fetal in the backseat-- moaning. Ginger and HER MOTHER come flying out of the house screaming. They pull Mark out of the car toward the open air as he stumbles, coughing, the family picture clatters across the garage floor. Whitacre jumps on it like a grenade.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 133. Whitacre's kids come out of the house and stand clustered at a distance confused and terrified. Helpless in the face of a fallen parent.
C: ALEXANDER
D: Dad? Ginger turns to her MOTHER.
C: GINGER
D: That Goddam Dwayne Andreas did this to him, Mom. He ought to be killed.
N: WHITACRE (V.O.) (PRE-LAP) Sometimes I'd leave the country with a big suitcase full of cash. Walk right through customs...
S: INTERIOR PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE, CHICAGO- THE NEXT DAY
N: Whitacre lies on the couch talking to DOCTOR MILLER, 60's, genial, soft-spoken. This is not internal, it's therapy.
C: WHITACRE
D: .Walk back in with a bag full of jewelry.
C: MILLER
D: You never thought you'd get caught?
C: WHITACRE
D: That never occurred to me. I mean, I look respectable. Why would they search me? And now they're saying I stole 5 Million dollars. That's what I've been accused of.
C: MILLER
D: Did you?
C: WHITACRE
D: Yeah. They were paying me 500 grand, but it wasn't enough, I was spending more like eight. So, I took kickbacks. Like I said, it's just what you did if you wanted to be part of the gang at ADM.
C: MILLER
D: Is that how it was when you were a kid; you wanted to be part of the gang?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 134. Whitacre nods.
C: WHITACRE
D: One time I got a brand new, top of the line bicycle. And I bragged to everyone about it. I told everybody how much it cost. A beat. Then proudly.
C: WHITACRE
D: It cost ninety dollars.
C: MILLER
D: How did you come to work for the
N: FBI?
C: WHITACRE
D: They approached me. This doesn't make much sense to Miller.
C: MILLER
D: How is it that they came to you? Did they know about the price fixing?
C: WHITACRE
D: This agent, Brian Shepard came to a number of junior executives at ADM... That's why they approached me. The price fixing hadn't even started yet... Miller is confused by this.
C: MILLER
D: But, uh, if no crime was, then-Mark, I'd like to have you checked into the hospital. Whitacre looks over at a file cabinet.

D: He just kept buying things. We have eight cars-- three of them we never even use.
C: MILLER
D: Anything else?
C: GINGER
D: I was always the one with the temper and Corky was the happy one-- but that's changed too. Since he said he'd cooperate with the FBI-- he's become so intolerant of everyone...
C: MILLER
D: Why do you call him Corky?
C: GINGER
D: He's had that name since high school. He was like a champagne cork always flying off somewhere.
S: 161 INTERIOR DOCTOR MILLER'S OFFICE- ANOTHER DAY
N: Whitacre looks beaten. His voice is cracking-- he's distracted. Not very "Corky" right now.
C: WHITACRE
D: There's one in Hong Kong. And then there's the bank accounts in Switzerland and Grand Cayman...Other things-There's a lawyer in New York who has a million dollars of mine.
C: MILLER
D: And have you told your attorney the truth about all of these accounts?
N: Draft: 1/15/03 136.
C: WHITACRE
D: No, but I don't need to. The other assets are legal-- definitely.
C: MILLER
D: You need to tell your attorney...
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't know if I can trust him.
C: MILLER
D: Mark, has anybody in your family ever been diagnosed as bipolar or manic-depressive? Whitacre nods and leans in.
C: WHITACRE
D: I had an Aunt who they said that about, my real parents died when I was pretty young and I was adopted...
S: 162 INTERIOR LAWYER'S OFFICE- DAY
N: A woman we've NEVER SEEN BEFORE is giving a deposition to a ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS.
C: LAWYER
D: Have you ever heard that Mark told people he was adopted?
C: NEVER SEEN BEFORE
D: It was in the paper that he was adopted.
C: LAWYER
D: Mark is your natural born son; isn't that correct? MRS. EVELYN WHITACRE isn't dead after all-- she's being deposed.
C: WHITACRE'S MOM
D: Right.
C: LAWYER
D: According to the adoption story Mark told, his parents we're killed in a car accident. Is there any truth in that?
C: WHITACRE'S MOM
D: No. Mark knows he's not adopted. He grew up in our house.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 137.
C: LAWYER
D: Another aspect of the story is that his parents are wealthy. Do you consider yourself wealthy?
C: WHITACRE'S MOM
D: No.
C: LAWYER
D: And when did Mark first send you a check from the account in Switzerland?
S: INTERIOR CONFERENCE ROOM- EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN- CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre appears again with Epstein before another herd of LAWYERS.
C: EPSTEIN
D: My client is here to cooperate fully, so Agent D'Angelo, if you have any questions. AGENT TONY D'ANGELO, 35, relaxed-- more like Herndon than Shepard.
C: D' ANGELO
D: This is your chance to put everything on the table. This is the chance to redeem yourself, but if you're not going to be completely honest you should stop talking now.
C: WHITACRE
D: I understand that. And I want to tell you I feel bad. I'm so sorry, and I feel worst about letting down Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon. Last time we talked I was under a great deal of stress and I said some things that weren't true. I'd like to clear that up. Whitacre is more earnest than ever before-- he begins.
C: WHITACRE
D: The first kickback was in 1992, Mick knew all about it, he told me there'd be plenty of opportunities to take kick backs on Asian and European contracts at ADM.
E: CONT' D
C: D' ANGELO
D: Was anyone else involved?

D: The 419 Fraud? We see it every day.
C: ZENNER
D: You ever wonder who was dumb enough to fall for something like that? Hulse is flushed.
C: HULSE
D: This is really embarrassing. But, that's how Mark and I first got involved financially...
S: INTERIOR EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN CONFERENCE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
C: WHITACRE
D: Then there was Rheinhard Richter who I worked with in Mexico. We had some deal that involved...
S: INTERIOR AMERCIAN EMBASSY- MEXICO CITY- DAY
N: RICHTER, the guy from the Admiral's Club in Mexico city, is questioned by FBI AGENT BASSET. Richter's entire financial history is spread out on the table in front of them.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: So we have money leaving your account here and here and here and it's going to Whitacre's account...His wife Ginger's account. This one is going to Whitacre's parents account.
C: RICHTER
D: Like I said, those are loans. Agent Basset isn't buying it.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 139.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: Look we know you're sticking up for Mark here, but your story doesn't seem true. Mark is cooperating now. Richter folds.
C: RICHTER
D: You're right. It's not true. All the money went to Mark.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: When did it start?
C: RICHTER
D: Mark told me about this Nigerian thing he got in the mail.
S: INTERIOR EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN CONFERENCE ROOM- CONTINUOUS

C: MARTY ALLISON
D: Mark told you guys about Nigeria, right? Nobody says anything.
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: When I started at ADM, uh in 1990, Mark got a letter from Nigeria.
N: FLASHBACK- ADM, 1990- DAY The office as we've seen it-- bustling with business. Allison walks down the hall and is stopped by Whitacre.
C: WHITACRE
D: Hey, Marty, got a minute. He takes a seat across the desk from Whitacre. Whitacre shows him THE NIGERIAN LETTER.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 140.
C: ALLISON
D: He told me he'd been in touch with certain parties in Nigeria. Businessmen who had overbilled the government there for millions-- but now needed bogus invoices from legitimate US business men to make it all look above board. You put in ten grand you get a hundred back.
E: V.0.
C: WHITACRE
D: I know people who have made millions on this. My step-father cleaned up.
S: INTERIOR US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CHICAGO- CONTINUOUS
N: Basset and Allison.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: He'd never heard of the Nigerian scam?
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: Not until a couple years later when sixty minutes ran a piece on it showing how people had lost a fortune on the con.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: And the kickbacks?
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: He had me set up a company in Germany and send fake invoices. I'd get a check for like 200 grand and most of it would go back to Mark.
C: AGENT BASSET
D: You kept the rest.
C: MARTY ALLISON
D: He told me management knew about it. But, it seemed to me that he was doing the same thing to ADM, that the Nigerians had done to us.
S: INTERIOR EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN CONFERENCE ROOM- LATER
N: Whitacre has laid out an amazing litany of theft and deception. Draft: 1/15/03 141.
C: D' ANGELO
D: How much money did you receive through all your illegal activities? Whitacre takes a moment-- does the math in his head, mouthing to himself the various sources of his massive fraud.
C: WHITACRE
D: Uh...7.7 Million dollars. But, Mick knew. Like I said, he endorsed these things.
C: D' ANGELO
D: He endorsed you stealing 7.7 Million dollars?
C: WHITACRE
D: He might have though that was a bit much.
C: D' ANGELO
D: Is there anything else you want to tell us?
C: WHITACRE
D: Well, I think you did a real good job today-- I do know that ADM has been stealing microbes from the Japanese for years and that they use prostitutes to get information from the competition's facility in Iowa. I know that Mick Andreas uses cocaine and I have that on tape-- and there are illegal campaign contributions to both American and foreign politicians... And under...

S: 174 EXTERIOR GRANT PARK- CONTINUOUS
N: Whitacre gets up and walks toward a black sedan. He looks around, paranoid. He wouldn't make a good spy.
C: EPSTEIN
D: But, you guys shove him in there, you tell him 'go for it,' without anything to make sure he doesn't crack under pressure. You have to ask yourself, was the US government taken in by Mark Whitacre, or did it help create him? Whitacre leans into the car and hands off the envelope. He speaks to some HOODLUM we can't see.
E: V.O.
C: WHITACRE
D: Tomorrow, 3 O'clock... where we talked about.
S: 175 INTERIOR DOJ CHAMBERS- CONTINUOUS
N: Epstein's plea is moving-- he's reaching these people.
C: EPSTEIN
D: Mark committed a crime. He stole nine million dollars. It's indefensible. But these guys from ADM stole hundreds of millions of dollars from innocent people all over the world. Mark showed you that four white guys in suits getting together in the middle of the day, isn't a business meeting. It's a crime scene. And not only did he tell you about it, he got you the evidence to prove it. Now, we're not looking for the moon and stars. We're looking for something in the area of three years.. .Or we can take it to trial. And in that trial I'll lay out everything Mark Whitacre did-- good and bad...

S: EXTERIOR SHOPPING MALL- DECATUR
N: Whitacre stands in the parking lot reading the paper on a cool autumn day. No black sedan. The big clock outside the bank in the mall says: 4:25. Whitacre walks over to a trash can and removes a BOTTLE OF MEDICATION from his pocket. He empties it into the trash.
C: EPSTEIN
D: And somewhere a future whistle blower is going to pick up the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and read what Mark's life has become because he decided to cooperate. Whitacre gives up, gets in his car and drives away.
E: V.O.
S: INTERIOR DOJ CHAMBERS- CONTINUOUS

S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- A LITTLE LATER
N: Whitacre comes flying through the door-- his jacket is now ripped, his glasses are bent, he's holding his arm. He looks like he's been through hell ...he's frantic.

C: LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR
D: And where is the FBI in all this?
S: INTERIOR BLUE BIRD DINER- AFTERNOON
N: Shepard watches the interview on the TV in the corner in the crowded diner. GINGER (ON TV) What people have to realize is-- the FBI did the same thing. They locked my husband in an investigation and drove our family around for three years threatening him. You tell me, where are they now? He is stung by her words. WHITACRE (ON TV) I had a lot of faith in the guys at the FBI-- they always said they'd take care of me. Shepard throws some money down on the lunch counter and leaves. Draft: 1/15/03 145.
S: INTERIOR LAW OFFICES EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN- EVENING
N: Epstein brings a deal to Mark and Ginger. He believes he has saved his client, but the Whitacre's feel differently.
C: WHITACRE
D: Three to five years? But, ADM's the bad guys.
C: EPSTEIN
D: You've got to focus here. You stole nine million dollars. And then you lied about it. Maybe in your head you're one of the good guys but to them your a guy who stole a lot of money and lied about it.
C: WHITACRE
D: Ginger and I have been talking and we'd like to file a law suit against Brian Shepard and the IJS government.
C: EPSTEIN
D: Jesus Christ, for what, Mark?
C: WHITACRE
D: He hit me with a brief case. This is news to Ginger, but she believes it. Epstein doesn't.
C: EPSTEIN
D: Mark. . .Come on.
C: WHITACRE
D: And he told me to destroy certain tapes that didn't help the case. Epstein throws up his hands.

E: V.O.
C: ANGLE ON THE LETTER
D: Fragments of the contents "This is to inform you of your lithium levels"..."Exacerbated by stress"..."A strict drug regimen..."
C: WHITACRE
D: .and the study said that people had nice, sympathetic feelings about people who were adopted and treated them better. So I made up this adoption story-- and people did treat me better-- and when I got a job one of my professors told the people at Ralston Purina that I was this amazing guy that had accomplished all of this in spite of being adopted-- Whitacre takes out a pair of SCISSORS and goes to work on the letter.

D: .and so it was really other people who spread the story not me-- although I admit it was wrong to start it and everything, it was other people who kept it going. Even the people at ADM. My new lawyer sees that.
E: V.0.
S: INTERIOR CHAMBERS DOJ- DAY
N: BILL WALKER, 50, fat and ruled by fantasy is Whitacre's new lawyer. He sits in a golf shirt and tennis shoes facing a
T: squad of amazed DOJ PROSECUTORS.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 147.
C: WALKER
D: This all goes back many years, before most of us were born... It's bigger than any of us, and it's ongoing. I know you're skeptical, but I've seen it. My client Mark Whitacre has shown it to me. Maybe I'm just a personal injury lawyer from Taylorville- nowhere-Illinois, but I tell you I know the identity of the master puppeteer. The DOJ lawyers try not to laugh.
C: MARY SPEARING
D: The who?
C: WALKER
D: Master puppeteer, and it's not who you're thinking.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- EVENING
N: Mark sits splicing tapes of Brian Shepard from one tape recorder to another-- trying to piece together an incriminating tape to frame Shepard.
C: WHITACRE
D: Grandiosity and embellishment-- what they call it when you embellish things-- those are the major symptoms of bipolar disorder. And the other, the second major symptom is poor judgement. And that's something Brian Shepard should have known ; The bipolar disorder is what made me believe I'd be President when it was over... Although there was a time when Mick told me, on a trip to Nebraska, that I could be headed for the top.
E: V.0.
C: WALKER
D: Mark has tapes-- tapes the government doesn't want us to hear.
E: V.O.
S: INTERIOR CHAMBERS DOJ- CONTIUOUS
N: Walker is in full rant. He holds a letter up for all to see. Draft: 1/15/03 148.
C: WALKER
D: Tapes that outline the actions of Brian Shepard, who hit Mark Whitacre with a brief case when Mark was cooperating with the government. And he has a letter from his psychiatrist outlining and confirming the cruelty perpetrated on him by Agent Shepard. A letter from his psychiatrist, clearly exonerating him from all wrongdoing. Walker hands the letter over to Spearing.
S: INTERIOR WHITACRE BARN- DUSK
N: Winter. Gray snow on fields of dirt and broken corn stalks. An empty swimming pool and a FOR SALE sign in the yard. Inside Shepard sits with Whitacre and Ginger. Shepard holds THE LETTER
C: SHEPARD
D: I read the letter from Doctor Miller, Mark. It's not true.
C: WHITACRE
D: It's true. Definitely-- it's on his letterhead, he signed it...
C: SHEPARD
D: The area code ...Mark... He puts the letter in the middle of the table.
C: SHEPARD
D: .Area code 847. It says the letter was written in November 1995- - that area code didn't exist then.
E: CONT'D
C: WHITACRE
D: Well, everybody knew the area code change was coming. Lot's of people ordered new stationery early.
C: SHEPARD
D: I thought about that. So I asked the phone company. This is the press release announcing the 847 area code... He puts the release on the table.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 149.
C: SHEPARD
D: It's dated six days after your letter was written-- Doctor Miller couldn't have known about it. Whitacre stares at it-- then looks up.
N: THE MACHINE IN HIS HEAD THAT RECONSTITUTES REALITY GRINDS AND
S: SEIZES. HE'S FINALLY TRAPPED. THE INTERIOR MONOLOGUE IS THE
N: SAME AS THE DIALOGUE IN THE SCENE-- BUT PRECEDES WHAT WHITACRE IS SAYING OUT LOUD BY AN INSTANT. THERE IS AN ECHO ONLY WHITACRE CAN HEAR.
C: WHITACRE WHITACRE
D: Ron Henkoff from Fortune Ron Henkoff from Fortune called Doctor Miller and called Doctor Miller and Miller confirmed the Miller confirmed the letter... letter...
E: V.0.
C: SHEPARD
D: I called Miller, Mark. Ginger quietly starts to cry-- picks up the letter.
C: WHITACRE WHITACRE
D: He can't talk to you.-That's He can't talk to you... That's a violation of doctor patient a violation of doctor patient confidentiality... confidentiality...
E: V.0.
C: SHEPARD
D: Doctor patient confidentiality doesn't apply to forgeries. Ginger cries harder. Whitacre tries again.
C: WHITACRE WHITACRE
D: Then why did Fortune Magazine Then why did Fortune Magazine run the story... run the story... Ginger has had it, she breaks down.
E: V.0.
C: GINGER
D: Stop it...
C: WHITACRE SHEPARD
D: Call Henkoff... He never wrote the letter.
C: GINGER
D: Stop it, Mark. You have to stop doing this to yourself, please stop. Whitacre is done.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 150.
C: WHITACRE
D: I think maybe I should go back to the hospital.
S: INTERIOR FEDERAL COURT, URBANA ILLINOIS
N: Whitacre looks like shit. He sits with Walker in JUDGE HAROLD BAKER'S courtroom. SUPER: OCTOBER, 10TH, 1997
C: CLERK
D: Case 97-2001 United states of America versus Mark Whitacre.
C: JUDGE BAKER
D: You have the right to make a statement if you wish? Whitacre nods and stands.
C: WHITACRE
D: I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words, it's been a long five years. I apologize to a lot of people in this room...
N: ANGLE ON SHEPARD AND HERNDON They sit together in the back row.
C: WHITACRE
D: And to a lot of them who are not in this room for my actions. I realize I hurt a lot of people and I apologize greatly...I am here to accept my punishment. That's all.
C: JUDGE BAKER
D: To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the usual felon is a gross understatement. He is well educated, has a loving wife and family, is respected in the community. It is not inconceivable that in due course he may have become CEO of Archer Daniels Midland...
C: ANGLE ON WHITACRE
D: He smiles. He knew he could be CEO someday. . .We hear Whitacre in a calmer time.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 151.
C: WHITACRE
D: I like jail. I think it's been good for me... But, the judge isn't done with him.
E: V.0.
C: JUDGE BAKER
D: However, the court can find no clear connection between Mr. Whitacre's bipolar disorder and the 45 counts of criminal misconduct he has been charged with-- just garden variety greed. It is very difficult to tell when Mr. Whitacre is telling the truth...
S: INTERIOR ANOTHER COURTROOM- DAY
N: A larger courtroom. Mick and Terry stand for sentencing, surrounded by Aubrey Daniel and others.
C: WHITACRE
D: But, I don't think what happened is fair when you look at what happened to me compared to Mick and Terry. I mean, if you go and hold up your local grocery store you might get five years...
E: V.0.
N: SUPER: FIVE YEARS LATER ANGLE ON WHITACRE FULL SCREEN VIDEO
C: WHITACRE
D: Mick and Terry held up every grocery store in the world and they only got three... So you tell me how it makes sense that I get nine. I think that's something you should consider, Mr. President, when reviewing my request for pardon.
S: INTERIOR FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION, SC- DAY
N: Whitacre is in his green prison jumpsuit-- BALD-- his toupee, another deception, also gone. He sits in front of a video camera in the beam of ONE LIGHT. A CAMERAMAN records his PARDON APPEAL. Draft: 1/15/03 152,
C: WHITACRE
D: I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize to Special Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of myself and my wife Ginger, he never hit me with a brief case or told me to destroy tapes. The idea to sue him wasn't mine-- it came from someone at ADM and I shouldn't have listened. I can't remember who. when I was at ADM, I lived so many lives, I wasn't sure who I was. Today, I know more who I am and what I really want out of life. I've completed three post-graduate degrees while in detention. A J.D. which is, of course, a law degree and another advanced degree in the psychology of jury selection. I sleep better in prison than I have in years. My wife has forgiven me and believes that the ordeal with ADM has brought us closer together in a marriage of over 20 years. I hope you will allow me to leave here, so that I can re-join my life with my family and three kids. . .Two of whom are adopted... Especially when you consider that thanks in large part to my testimony the US government has been able to collect over a billion dollars in price- fixing fines from big business. That's it. Thanks. He smiles. The light goes out. The Cameraman starts packing up the equipment. Out of the shadows steps Bob Herndon.
E: CONT'D
C: HERNDON
D: Good luck with the appeal, Mark.
C: WHITACRE
D: Thanks for helping me remember everything Bob. I sure appreciate it. I wish Brian could've come.
C: HERNDON
D: He still pretty angry.
C: WHITACRE
D: You tell him, I'm real sorry. Can you do that for me? The funny part is if I'd never gone undercover I would have never stolen 11 million. It was my way out. My severance. What else could I do-- I wrote my own severance.
N: Draft: 1/15/03 153. Before Herndon can respond a CORRECTIONAL OFFICER approaches.
C: CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
D: Work detail.
C: WHITACRE
D: I gotta go, Bob. Herndon does some math.
C: HERNDON
D: 11 million? I thought it came out to nine.
C: WHITACRE
D: Did I say eleven? Boy, it was only nine. Definitely. The eleven is with interest.
C: HERNDON
D: Mark, are you still taking your medication?
C: WHITACRE
D: The doctor here says I don't need it anymore. I can manage without it now that there's less stress. It was just the stress of the FBI. Herndon turns to leave-- and then he pauses.
C: HERNDON
D: Mark, was it eleven? I mean there isn't something else we need to...
C: WHITACRE
D: I don't know Bob, you tell me. He smiles and turns his back on the agent and walks down the hall toward work detail. SFX: A drum roll explodes into the roar of the CLASH'S cover of "I FOUGHT THE LAW ." As Joe Strummer sings "Breaking rocks in the hot sun..."

HE HAS SOUGHT PARDONS FROM BILL CLINTON AND GEORGE W. BUSH. BUT, HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED. OVER 30 GRAND JURIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PRICE FIXING IN THE FOOD AND VITAMIN INDUSTRIES SINCE MARK WHITACRE STEPPED FORWARD. AS A RESULT, BY 1999, THE US GOVERNMENT HAD COLLECTED OVER $1 BILLION IN FINES. The combine harvests the husk we have been holding on-- clearing the frame. Leaving only BLUE SKIES. THE END
