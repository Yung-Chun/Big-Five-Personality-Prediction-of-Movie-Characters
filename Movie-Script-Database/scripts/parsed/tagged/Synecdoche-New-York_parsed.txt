S: A1INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BEDROOM - FALL 2005 - MORNING A1
N: Darkness. The sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging fades in. Caden, 40, opens his eyes in bed, and groggily looks at himself in the bureau mirror. The bedside clock reads 7:45.
S: 1 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - SAME1

E: CONT'D
C: CADEN
D: I don't feel well.
S: INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS
N: Caden passes the bathroom. Olive is staring into the toilet bowl. Adele can be heard chatting in the background.
C: OLIVE
D: Daddy, my poop is green. Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.

N: OLIVE (O.C.) (CALLING) Is poop alive?
S: 5EXT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - FALL 2005 - MORNING 5
N: Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper, pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen.
S: 6INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - MORNING 6
N: Caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee, reading the paper, dated Friday, October 14, 2005.

C: OLIVE CADEN
D: Sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry! They found Avian flu in Turkey. In the country Turkey not turkeys. It's in chickens. Adele is making a peanut butter sandwich for Olive.
E: CONT'D looking at paper
C: OLIVE

E: CONT'D

C: COW
D: There is a secret, something at play under the surface, growing like an invisible virus of thought. The sheep nods. Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout. He checks the date on the carton. It's October 20.
C: CADEN COW
D: Man. Milk's expired. Jesus. But you are being changed by it. Second by second. Every breath counts off time. Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter sandwich in front of Olive.
C: ADELE
D: Here. Now you better eat this.
C: OLIVE CADEN
D: I will. The first black graduate of the University of Alabama died. Vivian Malone Jones. Stroke. Only 63. Adele stares out the window at the rain.
S: INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - FALL 2005 - DAY
N: Caden is in the dentist's chair, a bloody bib around his neck. The dentist, in surgical mask, probes his open mouth, calls out numbers to an assistant, who records them. DENTIST 2, 2, 1.3, 4, 2.3, 4, 4. (to Caden) Family coming for Thanksgiving?
S: INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - WINTER 2005 - NIGHT
N: Caden shaves. A faucet explodes and smacks him in the forehead. He is sent staggering backwards with a yelp, into the far wall, his razor flying and blood pouring from a jagged cut above his right eyebrow. Off-screen, we hear the pounding footsteps of someone running toward us. Half of Caden's face is covered with shaving cream. Rivulets of blood intermingle with it. Water shoots out where the tap was, spraying the mirror, which is spattered with blood. Adele, dressed in heavily paint-splattered clothes, hurries in and takes in the scene: the wet, the mess, the blood. SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 6. 8CONTINUED:8
C: ADELE
D: Jesus! Caden! What the fuck -- ?! Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her curled toes clenched. She holds a large stuffed owl.
C: CADENADELE
D: Um. I was shaving and -- My God! Jesus! Look at your head! Dumbly, Caden tries to look up at his forehead, then squints nervously at himself in the mirror.
C: ADELE

C: ADELE
D: Put pressure. Press. Press!
E: CONT'D
C: CADEN
D: Do I press above or below it?
C: ADELE
D: I don't know! Just... both! Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.
C: ADELE
D: I can't turn it! It's gonna flood! Olive hugs the owl tightly and it speaks.
E: CONT'D
C: OWLADELE
D: Whooo. Whooo. Whooo areI can't -- Oh wait, got it! you? Adele turns off the water. Olive looks back into the room.

S: 9INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - WINTER 2005 - NIGHT 9
N: Caden sits on a metal table. The room has some meager Christmas ornaments. A doctor stitches Caden's forehead. SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 7. 9 CONTINUED:9 Caden squints into the bright light the doctor uses to see his work. In the background we hear another patient. PATIENT (O.S.)

C: CADEN
D: I prefer there not be a scar.

E: CONT'D

D: What? The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart. He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.
C: DOCTOR
D: Changes in bowel movements?

C: DOCTOR
D: I'd like you to see an ophthalmologist.

D: What? No, an ophthalmologist. I said, ophthalmologist.
C: CADEN
D: Oh. The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden's ears.
S: 10INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S CAR - WINTER 2006 - NIGHT 10
N: Adele drives and coughs spasmodically. The car swerves a bit. Caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand. Olive, in her car seat, sings. Caden sees revelers in winter coats and party hats outside a house. They blow noisemakers and yell "happy new year!" OLIVE (SINGING) It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. And the world is too big to understand and today is Tuesday and -- (SPEAKING) Mom, is today Tuesday?

C: CADEN
D: Try to keep in mind that a young person playing Willy Loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. But the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation.

C: ADELE
D: Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a field of flames.

D: No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned. Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation.
C: OLIVE
D: I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told you. The flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. So I am, as well. This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos.
E: CONT'D

D: It's Maria. She did this.

N: It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick, angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild- eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t- shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.

N: Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair- back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable. He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.

They watch the "Sammy Funeral" scene replayed with actors playing Tammy playing Hazel and an actor playing the stand-in for Sammy playing Caden. Tammy has her head in her hands. She looks over at Millicent, imploringly.

C: MILLICENT
D: Okay, folks, let's run it! The scene comes alive with specific activity: weeping Hazel, a little boy in the back playing with dirt clods, a man and a woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A minister addresses the mourners.
C: MINISTER
D: Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. Even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. Something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved.
