T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET
N: A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains. In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA ADJUSTS and reveals--
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET
N: Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign. As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside.
S: INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET
N: This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper.
C: VOICES
D: --where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... Cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... Cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...!
E: various MORE
C: CONTINUED: VOICES
D: Hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes, I like, checked the almanac, okay...? Ready or not, here we come...
E: CONT'D
N: All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys... and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.
C: VOICES
D: ...There you are, you naughty girl! You almost made us lose the sunset... Come on, honey, time's wasting...
E: CONT'D
N: She shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet. The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No, please... I... I really don't want to do this... Can't I just wait for you..? I--I'm not sure about this--
E: faintly
N: A SET OF HANDS moves in, separates Cynthia from the others.
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than Cynthia.
C: VICTOR
D: Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to do this, that's okay... right, Harris?
N: The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back.
C: HARRIS
D: No, Victor, it's not okay. Here at Unity House, some things have to be done... ...in Unity. This is one of them.
E: slight smile
N: He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia, Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a smile that inspires trust.
C: HARRIS
D: Cynthia, do you trust me?
E: CONT'D
N: She nods immediately.
C: HARRIS
D: And have I ever lied to you?
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed.
C: HARRIS
D: Then I say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the Ultimate Joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and Godhead.
E: CONT'D
N: He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go, gets in. Now only Cynthia remains.
C: HARRIS
D: Cynthia. Come. There is no shame in this. No crime. No sin. Just the final break with the old world... As night falls, we start a new day... a day of Unity. Come to me... my lovechild.
E: CONT'D a command, but warm
C: ON CYNTHIA
D: His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs her hand through it. Her eyes widen.
S: EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT
N: The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this setting. It's beautiful.
C: CYNTHIA'S VOICE
D: No! No...
C: HARRIS' VOICE
D: Cynthia, come back! We can't do it without you... We must have unity, my lovechild... Unity, now and through eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run... You belong to us forever--!
N: Pause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS skittering on tired wooden floors... and then-- --UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES! EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave. Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we HEAR SIRENS...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue workers and firefighters are running back and forth.
C: INSPECTOR WASSERMAN
D: A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din.
C: WASSERMAN
D: What have we got?
C: POLICEMAN
D: Twenty-four bodies, Inspector. Maybe more.
N: As he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a SCORCHED AND BLACKENED CORPSE that looks like a 3,000 year old mummy. CORPSE - CLOSER It's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies partially covered by tarps. As the body is set down it CRUNCHES, and a piece BREAKS OFF.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Wasserman blanches, wipes his mouth.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Cause of fire?
C: OFFICER
D: Some kind of explosion... gas main, methane, too soon to tell. God only knows.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Let's hope He doesn't keep it to Himself.
C: A VOICE
D: We got one! We got a survivor! Get a stretcher and oxygen over here, STAT!
N: Wasserman and the cop run up the slope with the others. RUINS - CLOSER Medics run around the parked VW, which drips water and chemical foam. Rescue workers move a FALLEN BEAM and pull a soot-blackened form out of a hole. As the CAMERA PUSHES closer, we see that it is Cynthia. Her clothes are torn and singed, and she is unconscious, but as they work on her we see that she is largely unharmed.
C: VOICES
D: Make room, make room! Get that airway in! I got a pulse, whoa, it's faint... Talk about lucky, she musta fallen in the basement... First and second degree burns... Come on people, move your asses!
E: busy, frantic
N: Wasserman tries to keep up as they carry her on a stretcher towards an ambulance, put her inside. It ROARS AWAY, SIREN WAILING. MUSIC COMES UP AND OVER-- it's MAGIC CARPET RIDE by Steppenwolf.
C: NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
D: --Authorities continue to investigate yesterday's mysterious explosion and fire at Unity House, the controversial New Age commune headed by self-styled Guru Adrian Harris. 32 people died in the blaze. Thirteen year old Cynthia Weston, the fire's only survivor, remains in guarded but stable condition at County General. In national news, newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst was abducted from her Bay area apartment shortly before dawn today... A communique from the so-called "Symbionese Liberation Army" demanded that...

S: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
N: The doors CRASH ASIDE as Cynthia is rushed in on a gurney. The CEILING LIGHTS flicker past us as they move her into the emergency room.
C: VOICES
D: Blood pressure 90 over 30, we're losing her... Where's that cart? CLEAR! CLEAR! Okay, it's climbing... Watch the EEG... Brain activity, shit, damn low...
N: We begin a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, including: A) WASSERMAN, who appears first in his clothes from the fire, then two other wardrobe changes; B) HOSPITAL PERSONNEL, at first the harried and rushed emergency staff, and then the more blase regular doctors and nurses; C) VARIOUS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, as a series of DIAGNOSTIC TESTS are run on Cynthia-- D) CYNTHIA, first in her fire-scorched clothing, then as it is cut away, and then in several HOSPITAL GOWNS, first white, then green, then blue... E) A SERIES OF HOSPITAL ROOMS AND LABS; P) HOSPITAL CHARTS AND FILES, with ever-changing DATES;
C: VOICES
D: No sign of physical damage but neurological functions still depressed... Sorry, Inspector, no changes... Patient comatose after 14 days... Brain scan shows minor irregularities; pupil function within normal range... Still no sign of consciousness... Still comatose after 21 days ... Sorry, Inspector, we'll call you if there's any progress... Still comatose after 42 days... Patient moved out of intensive care....
E: CONT'D over this
N: As the MONTAGE CONTINUES, TITLES BEGIN. Now we HEAR VARIOUS NEWS BROADCASTS which come UP AND OVER, fading IN AND OUT with the medical VOICES. (If desired, TV NEWSCASTS might be seen as well on a hospital room's set.)
C: VARIOUS NEWSCASTERS' VOICES
D: ...The mother of Martin Luther King Junior was assassinated today while she played the organ in her son's church... interrupt to bring this bulletin... Richard Milhous Nixon has resigned as President of the United States... As the Marine guards hold back the crowds, the last helicopters took off from the roof of the Embassy in Saigon... Bicentennial festivities begin today in Philadelphia...
E: filtered, in and out, intermittently audible
N: MONTAGE - CONTINUED We SEE Cynthia in her bad, always in the same near-fetal position. The only changes are the occasionally different hues of her blankets and the varying length of her hair.
C: NEWSCASTERS
D: --leak at the Three Mile Island facility... 73 Americans remain hostage in the Teheran Embassy... Ronald Reagan has been elected 40th President... renewed fighting in the Middle East... assailant shot John Lennon at point blank range... President Reagan has been shot! He is in guarded condition at... The Pope has been shot! He was rushed by ambulance to... President Anwar Sadat has been assassinated...
N: 14A BERRISFORD - IN MONTAGE 14A We SEE several SHOTS of this man, first as a white-coated RESIDENT in his late 30's, walking past Cynthia's hospital doorway, and then stopping, curious, and looking in on her... and then in-- 14B OTHER SHOTS - BERRISFORD 14B as (with changing wardrobe and increasing status) he checks in on the girl's unaltered condition as months and years continue to click by:

E: CONT'D

S: INT. HOSPITAL NURSE'S STATION - DAY
N: The HEAD NURSE looks up, smiles at a YOUNG FLOOR NURSE as she walks past. From somewhere we HEAR a Springsteen song on the radio.
C: HEAD NURSE
D: Debbie. What happened to your windsurfing lesson?
C: YOUNG NURSE
D: No wind. I changed shifts with Nancy. Well... time to weed the vegetable patch.
E: picking up charts
N: We FOLLOW the young nurse as she goes into--
C: CYNTHIA'S ROOM
D: Bored, the nurse goes to the foot of the bad, checks the chart there. She moves past MONITORING EQUIPMENT which shows only subtle movement. As she begins to take Cynthia's blood pressure, CAMERA CONTINUES ON INTO THE BED and we see Cynthia,
N: She is now a fully grown young woman in her late 20's. She is curled up in a fetal ball.
C: THE YOUNG NURSE
D: finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side table. She goes to the door and then REACTS to a SOUND.
N: She looks around, puzzled. Meanwhile, we SEE (and she DOESN'T) that there is INCREASED ACTIVITY on the monitors.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No... no... it's wrong... someone... please help...
E: faint, weak
C: YOUNG NURSE
D: Holy shit...
N: Stunned, the nurse DROPS the bottles with a CRASH. Recovering her composure, she darts back to the bed, watches flabbergasted as Cynthia continues to STIR, her arms weakly battling half-realized fears. The young nurse hits an ALARM, grabs Cynthia's arms to prevent her from pitching out of the bed, and then DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling all over the room, and as the DIN RISES we

S: INT. HOSPITAL PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
N: FLASHBULBS pop and the HOSPITAL SPOKESMAN grins clumsily, famous for fifteen minutes. There's eight or nine reporters here, all of them wishing they were on bigger stories.
C: SPOKESMAN
D: Twelve years, two months... nine days.
E: in mid speech
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: Is that like a world record for a coma or something?
C: SPOKESMAN
D: Actually, no. The longest one on record is 37 years.
N: The first reporter closes a notebook, leaves.
C: SECOND REPORTER
D: Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House?
N: NEW ANGLE - SHOWING THE BACK OF THE ROOM Lieutenant (née Inspector) Wasserman is there. He's grayer, paunchier, but the raincoat is the same one.
C: SPOKESMAN'S VOICE
D: Unity House. No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it. It's not uncommon after serious trauma.
E: correcting
C: THIRD REPORTER
D: What happens to her now? Have her family or friends been notified?
C: SPOKESMAN
D: We stopped looking for any family ton years ago.. Right now we"re planning to transfer Cynthia to Dr. S.A. Berrisford's Neuropsychiatric Clinic. It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you.
N: The reporters filter out. Wasserman is already gone.
T: CUT TO:
C: FOOT
D: as it is clumsily set down... another FOOT slides forward.
S: INT. THERAPY ROOM - WIDER
N: Cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars. She's pale, weak looking. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST is at her elbow, egging her on.
C: THERAPIST
D: Good... Very good... Come on, just a few more steps...
N: Cynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word takes some adjustment.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I... I can't... I have to rest...
E: weary
C: BERRISFORD'S VOICE
D: Young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest.
N: CAMERA ADJUSTS to show DR. BERRISFORD. In his 50's, avuncular, he wears half-framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat. Two pieces of tissue paper mark his razor's passage on his neck.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream.
E: CONT'D
N: Something about Berrisford's mock-stern tone bores in on Cynthia, gets a reaction. She gropes for an answer.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I... I hate chocolate ice cream.
E: finally
C: BERRISFORD
D: Then walk to the end of the platform, or I'll shove an entire gallon down your throat.
N: Cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform. The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair.
C: BERRISFORD
D: That'll be all.
E: to the therapist
N: Berrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Am I supposed to know you or something?
E: peering at Berrisford
C: BERRISFORD
D: I've looked in on you from time to time... but that's hardly an introduction. You've been transferred into my care, Cynthia. I*m Doctor S. A. Berrisford, Consulting Chief of Neuropsychiatry and head of the Berrisford Clinic.
C: CYNTHIA
D: C-consulting Cheev-- Chief of--
E: fumbling it
C: BERRISFORD
D: Oh, forget all that. Just call me what my staff does.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What's that?
C: BERRISFORD
D: God.
N: Cynthia LAUGHS. She likes this man's directness, the way he doesn't condescend to her.
S: INT./EXT. SUN DECK OR DAY ROOM - DAY
N: Berrisford parks her and site down across from her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What... what kind of doctor did you say you were?
N: Berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck. Scowls, flicks it away.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Obviously, I'm not a surgeon. I'm a psychiatrist.
E: as she laughs
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why do I need a psychiatrist?
E: puzzled
C: BERRISFORD
D: Cynthia, you've been out of touch with reality for over ten years. Your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone... You have to ease into life... into interacting with other people again. Into a world that's changed so much that sometimes I get confused by it. Now, my assistant Dr. Goldman has a group therapy session every day... I'm putting you down for it, starting tomorrow...
E: taking out an appointment book
C: CYNTHIA
D: Group therapy? But--
E: unsure
C: WASSERMAN'S VOICE
D: Dr. Berrisford?
C: NEW ANGLE
D: Revealing Wasserman. He shows his badge to the doctor.
C: WASSERMAN
D: I'm Lieutenant Wasserman. I left a message with your secretary...?
C: BERRISFORD
D: And I left one with your desk sergeant. I told you this would have to wait. You shouldn't even be here--
E: rising, meeting him halfway a hard whisper
C: FAVORING CYNTHIA
D: She can't help but listen as they continue in lowered tones.
C: WASSERMAN
D: I've waited fifteen years. That's long enough. Now I want to speak with Miss Weston.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Miss Weston is still recovering and is in no condition for a prolonged interrogation.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Then don't prolong it. I'll be brief with her, I'll be gentle with her--
E: tight smile
C: BERRISFORD
D: I'll let you know when she's ready--
C: CYNTHIA
D: E--excuse me...
C: ANGLE
D: They turn and look at her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Doctor Berrisford, what's this all about...? This man wants to talk to me...?
E: CONT'D
N: Berrisford starts to answer, but Wasserman rushes in.
C: WASSERMAN
D: That's right, Miss Weston. I just have a few easy, simple questions. About you... and about Unity House.
E: quietly, slowly, as if to a child patient, phony smile
N: Cynthia looks at him strangely, turns to Berrisford.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why is he talking like that? Is he one of your patients?
E: sotto
N: Wasserman burns. Berrisford LAUGHS.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Lieutenant Wasserman is a police officer. And the word "patience" isn't part of his vocabulary.
N: Wasserman scowls, not enjoying being the butt of a joke. He resumes his normal tons, which is far from diplomatic.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Miss Weston. What's the last thing you remember before...
C: CYNTHIA
D: --Before the accident? Nothing.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Then how do you know it was an accident?
C: BERRISFORD
D: Lieutenant!
C: CYNTHIA
D: I remember... a beautiful sunset. Harris, smiling at me...
C: WASSERMAN
D: Harris, he was the leader?
E: writing
N: Cynthia's eyes are far away. The memories come back... the words are slow, but vivid.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Leader, founder... chief cook and bottlewasher... Executive in charge of Dreaming. We were all together... all working to make a now world... That last night, there was a... Gathering... a... a sort of... baptism... And then...
E: smiling brow furrowing
N: She winces, rubs her eyes.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm sorry, that's all I can see.
E: CONT'D
C: WASSERMAN
D: Miss Weston. This "Unity House"... was it a cult?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm sorry. I don't understand the question.
C: BERRISFORD
D: A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. They're popular with impressionable people, the penny press... ...and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't solve.
E: pause
N: Wasserman closes his notebook, gives Berrisford a cold stare.
C: WASSERMAN
D: I was there that night, Doctor. I watched them stack those bodies...
E: MORE
N: CONTINUED: (4) WASSERMAN(CONT'D) men, women, children. They looked like 2,000 year old mummies. They broke apart like 2,000 year old mummies. Cynthia gasps.
C: WASSERMAN
D: If it was an accident... fine. If it wasn't... the person responsible could still be out there. And he's probably as interested in Miss Weston's memory as I am.
E: CONT'D pause
N: He turns, nods to Cynthia.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Feel better.
E: CONT'D
N: He goes out. Cynthia's breath comes in short gasps. Finally she calms.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I don't like that man.
C: BERRISFORD
D: That makes two of us.
N: He sits beside her again.
C: BERRISFORD
D: But as long as you're here... I can keep him away.
E: CONT'D smiling
N: CAMERA TIGHTENS on Cynthia as she considers this...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
N: The room is cheery, commands a view of the city. A VIDEO CAMERA sits unobtrusively in one corner. Six people sit in chairs in various stages of interest and/or boredom. They are MIRIAM, an attractive woman in her forties, who chain-smokes designer cigarettes; CONNIE, smiling, chipper; ED, overweight, friendly; LANA, pale, worried looking; and GILDA, tiny, frightened, withdrawn. She sits with feet pulled up on her chair, arms wrapped around her knees. CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Cynthia driving her electric wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle. RALPH stands. Long-haired, with the staccato delivery of a stand-up comic, he smiles.
C: RALPH
D: Well, now that we're all here, we can begin. Cynthia, I'm Dr. Goldman, and I'd like to welcome you to our little group. I don't know how much my colleague Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods. I have my detractors... but I have my successes, too! We're going to get you out of your depression... We're going to got you out of your neurosises... We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee--one with the little holes here? I can see us now on a desert island... You, me, a portable waterbed--
N: As Cynthia's eyes widen, DR. ALAN GOLDMAN comes into the room, sighs with weary familiarity at Ralph's antics. (Actually, Alan doesn't look much more like a doctor than Ralph.)
C: ALAN
D: Ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay?
C: RALPH
D: Dr. Goldman, I was on the verge of a major breakthrough, and you blew it!
C: ALAN
D: Ralph? Cynthia. I'm Doctor Goldman--at least, last time I checked...
E: when he sits MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) ALAN(CONT'D) and I doubt if my welcome can equal Ralph's, but I'll try. This is the Borderline Personality Group. And you are now a card-carrying member.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What's a borderline personality?
C: MIRIAM
D: Don't ask him. He's making this up as he goes along.
C: ALAN
D: A borderline personality is one that can't be accurately placed on the Neurosis-Psychosis arc. As a personality syndrome it encompasses identity crises, chemical addictions, emotionalism, anxiety-
C: RALPH
D: You forgot VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS!
E: standing, SCREAMING like Sam Kinison
N: He sits, smiles sweetly.
C: CONNIE
D: He also forgot suicidal tendencies. But, as one whose previous reincarnations stretch back to Ancient Atlantis, well, suicide is meaningless anyway.
C: ED
D: And don't forgot binge eating. Gourmet binge eating.
E: pause
C: MIRIAM
D: I told you he was making this up.
E: sweetly, to Cynthia
C: ALAN
D: If everyone is finished--
C: LANA
D: They're not finished, Dr. Goldman, they won't be finished until they have her feeling as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.
E: breaking in
C: CYNTHIA
D: I am confused--
C: LANA
D: See? I hope you're all happy--
E: to the group
C: CYNTHIA
D: Dr. Goldman, I... I don't really know what I'm doing here. I mean... I don't think I meet your description of a Borderline Personality--
C: RALPH
D: Give yourself some time, Cynthia. We'll help you work on it.
C: CYNTHIA
D: --and I don't really know what I'm doing here.
C: ALAN
D: Didn't Dr. Berrisford explain?
C: CYNTHIA
D: He said he thought that this would help me... fit into the 80's.
N: Miriam CRACKS UP.
C: MIRIAM
D: Honey, you want to fit into the 80's, you're already two divorces, one condo and a yeast infection behind. Why don't you just catch up with the 70's and move to Cleveland?
C: ALAN
D: If I can offer a more practical suggestion... Why don't you talk, Cynthia?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Talk...?
C: ALAN
D: About something close to you.
C: MIRIAM
D: Stop beating around the fucking bush, Goldman! Just come out and ask her!
C: LANA
D: Do you have to be so crude?
E: to Miriam
C: MIRIAM
D: Come on, Cynthia. Dish out the dirt. Tell us all about Unity House. The last gasp of the Age of Aquarius. Building a better world through... what? Chemistry? Good vibrations? Tie-dying your undies?
E: gesturing a marquee
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't have those kinds of stories.
C: RALPH
D: Back off, Miriam. Cynthia, just tell us about the orgies.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, I'm going to bore you.
N: She thinks for a minute, starts to speak. She's hesitant at first, and then the old memories come forward. She's sincere, earnest... captivating.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What we felt... what we believed... was that if people could become selfless enough, if they could free themselves from their egos, they would experience a... togetherness. A... oneness. A Unity. That's where the name came from. We had a dream about a perfect society based on trust. On love. On totally committed togetherness. We weren't trying to change the whole world. We were just trying to change each other.
E: CONT'D
N: Pause. Everyone is affected by her sincerity.
C: RALPH
D: Bullshit.
E: acting out
C: GILDA
D: No.
C: NEW ANGLE
D: AS everyone turns, astonished. Gilda gets out of her chair, slowly walks towards Cynthia. Takes her hand. And smiles.
C: GILDA
D: It's beautiful. It didn't matter if it worked. All that mattered was... you tried.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Exactly!
E: touched

S: INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: WIDEN from a TV SCREEN which shown the above moment. As the group session CONTINUES UNDER, CAMERA PANS to reveal Berrisford and Alan watching the tape.
C: ALAN
D: Gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. And now, Cynthia comes in with this love, peace and Woodstock routine and... presto. Am I missing something, or what?
C: BERRISFORD
D: She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it.
C: ALAN
D: Too bad we can't follow through on this.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Why not?
C: ALAN
D: Dr. Berrisford, the people in this group... some of them are deeply disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong with them-- an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run--
C: BERRISFORD
D: Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress... not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the meantime...
N: He stands, puts his hand on the younger man's shoulder.
C: BERRISFORD
D: She seems to like you. See if you can get her to open up, and let's press on. With a united front?
E: CONT'D pause
C: ALAN
D: A united front. Sure.
N: Satisfied, Berrisford smiles, goes out the door. Alan sighs, and looks at Cynthia's image on the screen.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY
N: Patients in different stages of fitness use the equipment, some with supervision, others on their own. HETTIE, Berrisford's chief nurse--a Selma Diamond type--comes in with a tray of medication in paper cups. She works her way over to where
C: CYNTHIA
D: is doing log lifts on a bench. She's in a leotard and leg warmers, and there's real color in her face for the first time.
C: HETTIE
D: Drop down to first gear, honey. It's Miller time.
N: She fumbles on her tray for the cup marked "Weston," hands the pills to Cynthia along with a cup of juice.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What are these? Vitamins?
C: HETTIE
D: Beauty secrets from the orient. Look what they've done for me.
N: Cynthia laughs, takes the pills. Hettie moves over to Ralph, who's just finished doing bench presses.
C: HETTIE
D: Ralph, you in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again?
C: RALPH
D: Promises, promises.
N: He takes the pills she gives him, smiles. She just looks at him, taps his mouth.
C: HETTIE
D: Open.
N: Of course the pills are still under his tongue. Hettie gives him a shot in the solar plexus and he GULPS. Hettie hands him the juice.
C: HETTIE
D: Next time I hit lower.
E: CONT'D
N: She moves on to other patients. Ralph moves over to Cynthia.
C: RALPH
D: She's crazy about me. You're coming along. A regular Rocky.
E: watching Cynthia's workout
C: CYNTHIA
D: Rocky? The flying squirrel?
C: RALPH
D: Rocky the fighting Stallone.
E: on her blank look MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) RALPH(CONT'D) I keep forgetting you just left the Twilight Zone. Hey, why don't you come up to my room, and I'll bring you up to date. I've got a VHS VCR, a CD, and MTV.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're making this up... aren't you?
N: He just grins. She slips down to the floor, does some stretching exercises.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Sounds like a complicated world. How do you handle it?
E: CONT'D
C: RALPH
D: Well, whenever it gets to be too much, I just let all of the negative stuff out of my body.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You mean with meditation, yoga, what?
C: RALPH
D: Nah. I just make a little hole and let it all escape.
N: He pulls open his shirt. On his chest and arms are dozens of scars in neat little rows. Cynthia swallows, stunned. Nonplussed, Ralph buttons back up.
C: RALPH
D: Uh-uh, here comes the assistant Ayatollah. See ya.
E: CONT'D
N: As Ralph exits, Cynthia looks around, puzzled.
C: CYNTHIA
D: "Ay-a-toll-ah..?"
N: Then she sees Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Buy you some lunch?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Sure.
N: He starts to help her up. She pushes him off gets up with a theatrical hop.
C: ALAN
D: I'm impressed.
N: They walk out of the therapy room.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Impressed enough to call me a cab?
C: ALAN
D: I'm not sure I follow you.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I've been talking to Ralph. He told me about his... personal therapy program. And I've been watching the others... Dr. Goldman, they belong here. I don't.
E: as Alan winces
S: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
N: They pass Lana and Miriam who are swallowing medication from Hettie's tray. The two women patients wave at Cynthia, who smiles.
C: ALAN
D: Please, call me Alan. Doctor Goldman is my father... ...and my grandfather. I think my first baby toy was a stethoscope--
E: as they walk thinking
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're changing the subject... --Alan. I'm feeling stronger. I'm getting used to things like VC esses and MCDs. I want to leave.
E: trying it out
C: ALAN
D: Your parents died when you were a child. We haven't been able to locate any relatives.
E: carefully
N: He stops at the elevator doors, hits the button.
C: ALAN
D: Where would you go?
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: I guess I'd just look up some of the old hands from Unity House... crash with them for a while... ...do people still say "crash"--?
E: thinking
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia... There aren't any old hands left. The fire that injured you...? It took everyone also with it. They're all gone.
E: gently
N: Cynthia reacts as if struck... has to loan against the wall to catch her breath.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I knew there were deaths... but... everybody?
C: ALAN
D: I'm afraid so. Look, Cynthia... I'm not saying this to upset you, but the sooner you realize that that whole phase of your life is over, and move on, the better off you're going to be. Why don't you bring this into the open... talk about it in group? Oh, here's our ride.
N: Saying this, he turns as an elevator OPENS. It's pretty crowded. He holds the door for her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Talk about it...?
E: confused
N: Seeing he's waiting, she straightens, moves into the elevator.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
C: ALAN
D: Could somebody hit one? Thanks.
C: CYNTHIA
D: "Talk about it in group." Is that the answer to everything around here?
E: to him
N: The doors CLOSE. Everyone huddles in the compact space silently, politely. The elevator heaves into movement. It HUMS as it whisks down the shaft. The overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak. It flickers off and on momentarily.
C: ALAN
D: Nobody ever said it would be easy. And it works for a lot of people.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's not working for Ralph... or his chest. Can't you at least transfer me... get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine--
E: gently pleading tone
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, we don't have a lot of patients who've been in a coma for over a decade!
N: The light gets weaker. Finally it just goes out. There is a general SIGH of annoyance from the passengers. The light FLICKERS on every few seconds giving off the effect of a strobe light.
C: A PASSENGER
D: You'd think with what they charge here they could pay their electric bills
N: LAUGHTER.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Relax. They're probably giving shock therapy. "It works for most people".
E: for Alan's benefit
N: More LAUGHTER. Then Cynthia is RIVETED by the sight of something across the elevator. In the LIGHT of the next strobe like FLASH, we see HARRIS! He is staring at Cynthia.
C: ON CYNTHIA
D: Staggered, disbelievingly, she moves behind Alan, looks over to the far corner again.
N: Another FLASH. Harris is gone. Suddenly the ELEVATOR JERKS TO A HALT, but the doors DON'T OPEN. Passengers GROAN, annoyed.
C: PASSENGER
D: Oh, great--
N: The emergency BELL starts sounding. Cynthia, still confused, gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy themselves pushing buttons. Cynthia bumps into the man next to her. She looks up at him. FLASH. It is Harris. FLASH. Harris reaches out to Cynthia. She CRIES OUT, jerks away, slamming into Alan, falling to the floor.
C: PASSENGER
D: Jesus, lady, relax! We're on the ground floor--
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me out! Let me out--!
N: FLASH. Cynthia is on the floor. She raises her head. Someone is on the floor right across from her. FLASH. It's Harris. His face is burned and skeletal. He GRINS.
C: HARRIS
D: Unity, Cynthia... Now and forever!
N: He has no eyelids or lips. Cynthia SCREAMS, struggles to her feet, knocking over another passenger. Now it's chaos in here.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me out, let me out! Alan, help, help--!
C: HARRIS
D: Cynthia, you cannot run... You belong to us Forever--!
C: ALAN
D: Struggles across the crowded elevator, catches her in his arms.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia..?
N: The elevator doors suddenly OPEN.
S: INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Cynthia literally TUMBLES out of the elevator, staggers along the wall, holding herself up. Alan runs out to aid her. The passengers get off the elevator, looking at her oddly. A CUSTODIAN runs up and turns off the alarm.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, what happened--?
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's him! It's him! He's alive--
C: ALAN
D: Who's alive?
C: CYNTHIA
D: He's alive! Right over--
E: pointing
N: She stops. The elevator is open and empty. The passengers watch her, some concerned, some voyeuristic. Now they drift away.
C: CYNTHIA
D: --there...
E: CONT'D weakly
N: Alan just stares at her.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Berrisford sits, listens intently to Alan.
C: ALAN
D: --hallucination, flashback, I don't know what to call it-
C: BERRISFORD
D: How about psychotic episode?
C: ALAN
D: No, no, she doesn't fit the pattern--
C: BERRISFORD
D: Addictive personalities can be borderline. You know that--
C: ALAN
D: She has no history of drug abuse--
E: patiently
C: BERRISFORD
D: There's other kinds of addictions. we see it in these fringe religious groups... these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions. You've heard how she talks about Unity House? Perhaps that's her drug. Perhaps she's going through a--withdrawal of sorts. Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic... There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade.
E: standing, pensive
C: ALAN
D: You put her in the Borderline Group and she became one?
E: skeptical
C: BERRISFORD
D: No.
N: CAMERA TIGHTENS ON HIM.
C: BERRISFORD
D: I believe she went into that coma a disturbed young lady. Fifteen years later... nothing has changed.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ENTRANCE - BERRISFORD CLINIC WING - NIGHT
N: We can read the name on the locked security door (albeit backwards.) A SECURITY GUARD watches a basketball game on a portable set.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: This is not the room we saw when she was comatose, but a brighter, more residential arrangement. Cynthia sits on the bed, watches as Hettie counts out pills for her. Cynthia swallows them, hesitates at a red one.
C: CYNTHIA
D: This one's new.
C: HETTIE
D: It'll help you sleep. Sort of a post-elevator cocktail?
E: explaining
N: Cynthia scowls, takes it. Hettie goes out. Cynthia lies down on the bed, stiff. Turns over once or twice. Sighing, she picks up the TV remote, shakes her head at the myriad buttons. Finally she finds the right one, CLICKS IT. TV - HER P.O.V. She's come in on the middle of a group therapy scene from THE BOB NEWHART SHOW. (NOTE: Or maybe THE SNAKE PIT or SHOCK CORRIDOR?)
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: She watches until she realizes what it is, then CLICKS it off.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Hettie leans over the security guard's desk. The guard GROANS in frustration an the basketball game ends.
C: HETTIE
D: Pay up. Twenty bucks.
E: extending her hand
N: Neither notices a DARK FIGURE passing by close to the CAMERA.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Cynthia lies restlessly in her bed. She hears footsteps coming closer. They stop at her door. She looks over. There is a SHADOW moving in the crack under the door. The doorknob TURNS. Cynthia sits up.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Who's there?
N: She reaches for the button to call the nurse, but then the door is OPEN, and the figure stands there silhouetted.
C: FIGURE
D: Cynthia?
E: whisper
N: The figure comes forward. Cynthia backs off the other side of the bed and turns on a light. It is Victor, the boy we remember from the opening scene. The years have been kind to him. He stands there, the dim light spilling on his Army field jacket and bell-bottomed jeans.
C: VICTOR
D: Cynthia? It's me. Victor.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Vic? Oh, my God--
E: amazed
N: She practically leaps across the room, hugs him with all her strength.
C: VICTOR
D: Look at you. Little Cyn. Not so little anymore.
E: marveling impressed
C: CYNTHIA
D: Vic, this is just... fantastic, it's the most incredible... But... how can you be here?
E: hesitating
C: VICTOR
D: Yeah. It is after visiting hours--
C: CYNTHIA
D: I mean... they said that... that everybody died.
C: VICTOR
D: Do I look like a ghost to you?
E: smiling
C: CYNTHIA
D: How did you survive? How did you find me? Is anyone else--
E: rapid-fire
C: VICTOR
D: Whoa, whoa. It's a long story... Let me tell it somewhere else. I feel like I'm in, like, the Pentagon or something.
E: looking around
N: Cynthia grins, grabs a light jacket.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Then let's go AWOL.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Victor peeks out the door. An orderly passes, then disappears. Victor and Cynthia tiptoe out, sprint down the corridor to a stairwell marked "EXIT", and they are gone.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Victor takes her hand, and they run towards a battered VW van. We recognize it and its slogans.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Zeke! You've still got Zeke!
N: She runs her hand along the dusty side lovingly, and then they hop inside. ON THE REAR LICENSE PLATE Rusted, dated 1973. The van DRIVES AWAY.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: It's a tacky but cozy building, circa 1958. "Zeke" pulls up, rattling to a coughing halt. They get out, head up the steps.
S: INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: They come in, turning on lights. It's a dingy couple of rooms, but lush with its variety of objects. Everything looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights, blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters. Cynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner. PAINTING - HER POV It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House perched prominently on a hill in the distance. (In the doorway, the bare-chested FIGURE of a man may--or may not--be barely visible.) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene. But her face is that of today's Cynthia.
C: BACK TO SCENE VICTOR
D: I... did it by memory. I tried to imagine... what you'd... look like today. Guess I came pretty close.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's beautiful. More beautiful than I ever was.
C: VICTOR
D: Then you need a new mirror.
E: softly
N: she smiles, flattered. Suddenly a CAT jumps up on a crate.
C: VICTOR
D: That's Chairman Meow.
E: CONT'D
N: Cynthia picks him up. Victor takes out a bottle of tequila and two glasses.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You still haven't told me how you lived. I really can't remember anything about the... accident.
C: VICTOR
D: It wasn't an accident.
N: She stiffens. His eyes are far away.
C: VICTOR
D: A lot of people back then, they hated Unity House. Hated Harris and his dreams... dreams of peace... of oneness. That hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex... Something bad was bound to happen. That hate was so strong... so envious of what we had...
E: CONT'D
N: He has SQUEEZED the shot glass in his hand so hard that it EXPLODES. Cynthia JUMPS, and that's when he notices it.
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, fuck--
E: CONT'D very normal
C: CYNTHIA
D: You've cut yourself--
N: She comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth. He holds onto her.
C: VICTOR
D: I guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous.
N: He pours a shot into the remaining glass.
C: VICTOR
D: Let's drink to the present. To us.
E: CONT'D pause
N: He SIPS. Passes the glass to her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: She hesitates... smiles. Drinks.
N: There is a drop of blood in the glass. She doesn't see it.
C: CYNTHIA
D: To us.
C: BACK TO SCENE VICTOR
D: To... Unity.
E: quietly
N: He pulls her close. They KISS... she seems to malt in his grasp. The cat jumps down. Slowly they kiss and touch each other. They stop and stare into each other's eyes. He moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair. She is completely his.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Half a dozen candles illuminate the room. Cynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost. Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax. But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.
C: VICTOR
D: Oh Jesus!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Victor?
N: Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the walls.
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What a great idea...! Too amazing! Too amazing!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Is something wrong?
C: VICTOR
D: Not wrong, Cynthia...right! The most right thing in the world!
N: He goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box. He holds it with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog. Cynthia's annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his exuberance. Their tone with each other remains loving, kidding.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Are you going to tell me your little secret, or should I just got dressed?
C: VICTOR
D: I'm sorry, Cyn, but I just got the most incredible idea. It's absolutely beautiful! Do you want to know what it is?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes!
E: exasperated
N: He sits on the bad.
C: VICTOR
D: I was just thinking about what we were doing here together...
C: CYNTHIA
D: I should hope so...
C: VICTOR
D: Wouldn't it be incredible if, right at the perfect moment right when we're coming, if we did it?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Did what?
C: VICTOR
D: What we were meant to do, of course.
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...meant to do...?
E: puzzled
C: VICTOR
D: That sunset. That last night. At Unity House. Remember?
C: CYNTHIA
D: No... No, Victor, I don't...
C: VICTOR
D: They all got to go. You and me... we got left behind... while they went on. Guess that's why they say life ain't fair. Well...
E: distant chuckling
N: He opens the box. Inside it are TWO PISTOLS.
C: VICTOR
D: --we can fix that.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: My God, Victor! Put those away--
E: stiffening
N: He ignores her, checks the cylinder on the revolver, the clip on the automatic.
C: VICTOR
D: This is so great! I mean, I've been living with all this shit, thinking about you, searching... going nowhere. And you, hell, you don't fit in with Ralph and Miriam, those other flakes... Berrisford and Goldman, they're a waste of time--
C: CYNTHIA
D: H-how do you know about them? I never--
N: He SLAMS the clip home, CLOSES the cylinder.
C: VICTOR
D: Yeah. We had the answers, way back then. Unity. Unity, now and forever. Cynthia, this is our second chance!
N: She shrinks away from him on the bed. He bounces closer like a kid at a pajama party, holds out one of the pistols.
C: VICTOR
D: Okay, you do me, and I'll do you-- but wait until I say go! Hey, get rid of the sheet... Let me see that grown up body...
E: CONT'D
N: He grins, puts the gun to her head and gets an top of her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No, Vic. Please. Please! I don't want to do this!
C: VICTOR
D: Yes, you do. You know you do.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No!
N: He's holding her down. He's getting into it.
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, Cynthia, it's so beautiful.
C: CYNTHIA
D: God, God, no--
C: VICTOR
D: We're on the edge of space and time.
N: He spreads her legs under the sheets. She's struggling against him, but it's no use. He's too strong. He's coming closer.
C: VICTOR
D: Oh, good... good... ummm... ummm... Cynthia, it's happening. Put the gun to my head.
E: CONT'D continuing
C: CYNTHIA
D: Jesus, Vic, no!
C: VICTOR
D: Yeah, oh yeah... oh, YEAH--
N: A SHOT sounds. She SCREAMS--
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Cynthia BOLTS up out of bed.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No!
N: The candles are out. Victor isn't in the room. Cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath. She looks around, confused.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Vic?
E: CONT'D
N: She goes into the other room.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: No Vic. It is dark except for a FIRE in the fireplace. The flames REFLECT oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of Unity House.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Vic?
N: She checks in the kitchen. Nothing. She looks back in the bedroom. The apartment is empty. She's just calming when--MEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight. She swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES.
C: VICTOR
D: Where are you going?
N: Cynthia JUMPS from fright.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Jesus, Vic. I thought you... left.
C: VICTOR
D: Me? Leave you all alone?
N: He pulls her into his arms. She hesitates.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Vic? Vic, are you... happy?
C: VICTOR
D: That... ...has to be.. ...the stupidest question I ever heard...
E: kissing her kissing again
N: He keeps kissing, caressing.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I mean... with... life. With... being alive.
N: He looks at her oddly.
C: VICTOR
D: What are you talking about?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Never mind... I had this... bizarre dream...
E: relaxing
C: VICTOR
D: Welcome to reality.
N: He touches her soft face. He runs his hands down her neck. They kiss again, she now completely without reservation. Their embrace is so all-encompassing that, when she opens her eyes, it's only then that she SEES
C: CLOSER
D: She is kissing a BURNED AND SCARRED FACE WITH ONLY CLUMPS OF PUPPY BLACK MUSCLE HANGING ON THE BONE. It is Harris' face, the face we saw in the elevator. Cynthia GASPS, fumbles backwards off of the sofa.
C: VICTOR
D: What's the matter?
E: CONT'D
N: She looks back up at him. He's Victor again, normal again.
C: VICTOR
D: Cynthia?
E: CONT'D
N: She knocks over a tequila bottle. It's spilled all over the floor. She is speechless. He picks the bottle up.
C: VICTOR
D: Why did you pull away?
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: I... I think I'd better go.
C: VICTOR
D: Why?
N: She's over by the door. Victor comes and presses against it so she can't get out.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Please let me out.
C: VICTOR
D: I don't understand... What did I do?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Nothing. It's not you, it... it's me. I just want to go.
C: VICTOR
D: You know, maybe you belong in that clinic, because this, this is crazy! We were having a good time-- I'm sorry. Look, what we were feeling... it was special.
E: on her look
N: She softens--
C: VICTOR
D: --it was Unity. Unity, Now and through Eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run...
E: CONT'D distantly
N: That does it. Pale, she scrabbles at the doorknob, opens it, runs out.
C: VICTOR
D: You cannot run... You belong to us Forever--!
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: She runs out of the building, past "Zeke." She looks back.
C: THE APARTMENT--HER POV
D: Victor is in the window waving, firelight dancing behind him. The reflection on the glass makes the painting on the wall look totally aflame.
N: ETHEREAL SITAR MUSIC UP OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Cynthia has her thumb out as the cars whizz by. One stops.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: A sweaty-looking DRIVER eyes Cynthia. She just looks off, depressed and afraid.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN
N: She gets out of the car and goes in the main entrance.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAWN
N: She makes her way to her room looking tired, distraught.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - DAY
N: She lies on her bed, exhausted, trying to sleep. She can't. She gets out of bad.
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
N: She's looking for an office. She goes in one marked Dr. Goldman. He looks up from his coffee, sees her ashen expression... pulls out a chair. Listens as the words tumble out. His expression changes... to skepticism... and then, as she breaks down SOBBING, to concern. He holds her... thinks... ...reaches for his car keys.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ALAN'S CAR - DAY
N: They are travelling along the highway. Cynthia POINTS. He turns onto another street.
S: EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: They pull up in front, park. Go inside. CAMERA LINGERS long enough for us to notice a puddle from an OIL LEAK exactly where "Zeke" was parked.
T: THE MUSIC FADES OUT.
S: INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The MANAGER, a fat woman in a muumuu, waddles ahead of them, a huge keychain CLINKING with each of her steps.
C: MANAGER
D: Apartment 2-B, right?
N: Alan looks at Cynthia.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Right.
C: MANAGER
D: 2B or not 2B, that is the question.
N: She chuckles at her own wit, arrives at the door. Opens it.
S: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
N: They step inside. The place is completely bare. No furniture. Nothing. Cynthia is stunned.
C: CYNTHIA
D: B..but... it... it's empty!
C: MANAGER
D: Of course it is. I don't show rented apartments. Anyway, what you see is what you get... one bedroom, gas range, yadda yadda yadda.
E: MORE
C: CONTINUED: MANAGER
D: Supposed to be six months minimum, but you seem like nice kids, so if you want a month to month, we can work it out.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: This... this is impossible... Alan, I was here... He was here-
N: Cynthia is staggering around the room, looking everywhere. She stares long and hard at a DUST-FREE rectangle where the painting... ...might have been.
C: ALAN
D: How long has this place been vacant?
E: to the manager
C: MANAGER
D: 'Bout six weeks. Couple a deadbeats... their damn kids tore the hell out of it, too--
C: CYNTHIA
D: Alan, I don't care what she says, this is it! Look, look-- There's a double-door closet in there on the left.
E: pointing
N: Alan goes in.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: Alan looks and sees the closet as she described it.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: CYNTHIA
D: Well?
E: as he comes back out
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, a double closet isn't exactly a positive I.D.--
C: MANAGER
D: What are you two talking about? You wanna rent, or what?
N: Cynthia looks around, suddenly points to a stain on the rug, triumphant.
C: CYNTHIA
D: There! There, look--that's where I spilled the tequila... See? See? It's still wet!
E: on her knees, desperate
C: MANAGER
D: Hon, I think that's from the ceiling...
E: apologetic
N: CAMERA TILTS UP. There is, indeed, a corresponding damp spot directly above the one on the rug. As we WATCH a DRIP plops down.
C: MANAGER
D: ...damn plumber was supposed to fix it last week. So! We in business?
E: CONT'D smiling
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Wasserman SLAMS his hand down on the desk, furious. Cynthia JUMPS, squeezes Alan's hand. Berrisford sits quietly, leans forward and picks up the pan holder Wasserman has displaced.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Twelve hours! You wait twelve hours to tell me about this? Am I supposed to be grateful for your civic-mindedness? I told you the Unity House case was still open-- --and she's the only lead. You should have called me the minute you found out--
E: pointing at Cynthia
C: BERRISFORD
D: Found out what? Lieutenant, if I called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here--
E: calmly
C: CYNTHIA
D: It was not a delusion! Victor Lunes was here--
E: sharp, stepping forward
C: BERRISFORD
D: The security guard didn't see anyone--
C: CYNTHIA
D: Then the security guard needs glasses! Alan, tell them--
C: ALAN
D: The apartment did match her general description--
E: on the spot
C: WASSERMAN
D: --a one bedroom flat with a beige rug... that's rather... generic.
C: CYNTHIA
D: --Victor isn't generic--
C: WASSERMAN
D: Victor is dead! Dead for fifteen years--
C: CYNTHIA
D: --you've seen his body?
C: WASSERMAN
D: --it was burned beyond recognition-- but there was I.D.--
C: CYNTHIA
D: I knew it--I knew it-
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia. Look... we've all done it... tumbled out of bed positive that we've just lived something that was only a dream--
C: CYNTHIA
D: Damn it, it wasn't a dream--I was out there--
E: firmly
C: WASSERMAN
D: No one's denying you flow the coop, Miss Weston... You wanna prove the rest? Lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing. We'll see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card--
N: Cynthia hauls off and gives Wasserman a tremendous SLAP.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You bastard.
N: She goes to the door, looks at the doctors.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You... --experts!
E: CONT'D searching
N: She goes out, SLAMS the door. Wasserman rubs his jaw, checks his mouth.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion! This could be a breakthrough! Thank you, Lieutenant.
E: sincere
N: Wasserman holds a filling in his fingertips.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Hey. Anytime.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
N: CAMERA PANS past a row of PILLOWS. We WIDEN, see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them.
C: ALAN
D: Okay. First off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly...
C: RALPH
D: Especially in that shirt you're wearing, Goldman...
E: a la Groucho
N: 70A NEW ANGLE - FAVORING CYNTHIA 70A She sits, looking very distracted. As Alan continues speaking, he occasionally looks at her, but--to her relief-- deliberately doesn't single her out.
C: ALAN
D: --but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression. Who's going to go first? Lana?
E: amused, but pushing on
C: LANA
D: How many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows?
E: pause
C: ALAN
D: None, Lana. They're polyester. Ed? Want to start?
E: as everyone groans
C: ED
D: Nah. Let's talk about the geese again. Nice fat ones, with all the trimmings--
C: ALAN
D: All right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor. Come on.
N: He starts POUNDING his pillow with a steady beat. Gradually, self-consciously, the others JOIN in except for Cynthia.
C: ALAN
D: Okay. What are we feeling?
E: CONT'D standing, walking around the circle
C: CONNIE
D: We used to do something like this in the royal palace in Atlantis. But we used bags of dried kelp.
E: as she pounds
C: RALPH
D: Your brain is a bag of dried kelp--
C: ALAN
D: Ralph. Miriam?
E: chiding
C: MIRIAM
D: I'm pretending this is my first husband... No, maybe my third... Can I have a baseball bat?
E: pounding grinning
C: ALAN
D: Please, people, let's work at being serious.
N: He moves behind Cynthia, who's still unmoving. Leans close, whispers.
C: ALAN
D: I know you had a rough night. But you have to participate.
E: CONT'D
N: She sighs, starts to pound the pillow. At first she's very distracted, but then she gets into an unconscious rhythm... 70B GROUP - QUICK SHOTS 70B All of them are finally and legitimately exorcising personal demons.
C: ALAN
D: Okay, that's better. Now let's hear some emotion. Let it out. yell! Scream!
E: CONT'D
N: Miriam gives a very theatrical scream. There's some laughter, but others try, too. Gilda begins to give little angry yelps. Ralph is really punching some ancient enemy. Connie does a respectable if modest SCREAM. Ed SNARLS with more anger than we'd expect.
C: 70B CYNTHIA 70B
D: begins hitting the pillow with growing strength. Her eyes are far away. She begins to BREATHE HEAVILY. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON HER. She closes her eyes. When she opens them, she REACTS TO--
S: INT. UNITY HOUSE COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
N: The scene in exactly like the first time we saw this room with one difference: the hospital Group Therapy crowd sits in the room. They are oblivious to the change around them. Now their pounding gradually UNIFIES, becomes a background voodoo- like DRUMMING. Cynthia is speechless. She looks at then in amazement, but none of them notice her. Suddenly she sees
C: 75A HARRIS 75A
D: He's across from her, SMILING. Again, he sleeks back his hair in that amber liquid.
C: HARRIS
D: You failed me, Cynthia... You failed all of us...
N: Harris holds a wooden match. With it he presses back a fingernail. It snaps off and bleeds. Harris watches Cynthia.
C: HARRIS
D: We were supposed to be together... in this world... and in the next...
E: CONT'D
N: CAMERA WIDENS to take in the cistern of liquid. We SEE the dripping wet Unity members.
C: HARRIS
D: It was going to be perfect, all of us taking the same journey... You shouldn't have run. You made us wait for you while you slept... all those years.
E: CONT'D
N: He presses back another nail SNAP. CAMERA WIDENS FURTHER. Now we see something we didn't see before: a dozen or so PLASTIC JERRY CANS marked "GASOLINE--DANGER--PLAMMABLE."
C: HARRIS
D: The waiting time is over, my lovechild. It's time for you to join us. In Unity...
E: CONT'D
N: Another. SNAP. Hands and faces everywhere are soaked. They DRIP.
C: HARRIS
D: In death. You know you want it.
E: CONT'D
N: SNAP. Drip.
C: 75B CYNTHIA 75B
D: Her throat muscles constrict, but she can't speak. She looks over at Alan, who seems not to see any of this. Now, eyes widening in horror, Cynthia LOOKS DOWN and sees a POOL OF GASOLINE SPREADING TOWARDS HER. It washes against the pillow, her knees.
N: 75C BACK TO SCENE 75C
C: HARRIS
D: You know we're your family...
E: CONT'D
N: SNAP. Drip.
C: HARRIS
D: ...You have no choice...
E: CONT'D
N: He takes the match and strikes it through the pile of nails. The nails scatter.
C: HARRIS
D: ...Come to us, Cynthia. It's time to die. Don't lot another take your place. Come to us... now.
E: CONT'D
N: The match is lit. He throws it off.
C: SLOW MOTION
D: It FALLS through the air. Lands on the soaked carpet. An EXPLOSION of flames. They RUSH TOWARDS CYNTHIA--
C: CYNTHIA
D: NOOOOOOOOO--!
N: It is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever heard. There is a FLASH of light.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
N: Cynthia's SCREAM trails off as she THROWS herself back from the pillow. The Unity House Members and Harris are all gone. The group therapy people all turn to her in amazement.
C: 77A MIRIAM 77A
D: Open mouthed, she DROPS the match she's holding to light a cigarette. It SIZZLES on the rug. Alan STOMPS it out, rushes over to Cynthia, who SAGS in his arms,
T: CUT TO:
S: 77B INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY 77B
N: Cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in Alan's office. The room is decorated in comforting tones, with Sierra Club posters and outdoors-y souvenirs. The late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds. Alan sits beside Cynthia on the couch, concerned. Berrisford sucks on his pipe, makes notes. Wasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own little notebook.
C: CYNTHIA
D: ...They... they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers... they were... happy. Because it was going to be their break with the world... a world that didn't understand them. I don't remember if they took a vote or if Harris just... decided. But they all agreed. They were... happy... smiling... laughing... crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline...
E: softly, tense
C: WASSERMAN
D: --Jesus--
E: under his breath
C: CYNTHIA
D: Somehow, I... I knew it was wrong... I ran... When he threw the match, I was at the other end of the hallway... There was a flash... and a... like a wind, or the hand of God--picked me up, threw me... The ceiling fell in... When I opened my eyes... I was here.
E: she looks up
N: Hettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her eyebrows inquisitively at Alan. Alan nods immediately: Hell, yes. Hettie comes in, gives Cynthia her medication. Wasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful.
C: ALAN
D: If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson?
E: to Wasserman
C: WASSERMAN
D: The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else... We knew there'd been an explosion... We just didn't know how or why.
N: Berrisford stands, approaches Wasserman as the police officer closes his book, moves to the doorway.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after... what is it, twelve years?
C: WASSERMAN
D: Who says it's closed?
N: The medical people look at him. Cynthia's thoughts are elsewhere.
C: ALAN
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: WASSERMAN
D: When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. Now she remembers they committed suicide...
E: MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) WASSERMAN(CONT'D) but she, of course, was innocent. Who knows what she'll remember tomorrow? Running for help... or pouring gasoline on the fire? He goes out.
C: HETTIE
D: That man's a candidate for shock therapy... with a car battery right to the cojones.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No... he's right. I am guilty.
N: They look at her, startled.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm guilty of lying... to Unity House. I promised to be part of it... Forever. They expected me to keep my word. They still do.
E: CONT'D pause
N: She stands, goes out. Alan and Hettie look worried. Berrisford looks... unsurprised. He turns to Alan.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Well, Alan. Still think she doesn't belong in the group?
N: Alan just looks at him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
N: Cynthia, in her bathrobe, wanders out of the shower in between the dark, steamy rows of lockers. She passes Lana and Miriam. Miriam is dressing, and Lana is putting on a swimsuit.
C: MIRIAM
D: Nothing like a hot shower, huh?
N: Cynthia doesn't hear or see them. She settles on the far end of the bench. She sits there blankly. Lana nears, with great trepidation.
C: LANA
D: Cynthia? Cynthia? Are you okay?
N: Cynthia looks up.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What?
C: LANA
D: Are you all right? After that session today, I--
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm fine.
N: Cynthia starts to dress, ignoring Lana. Lana stands there for a moment, very awkwardly.
C: LANA
D: I think... you're a decent person... not a... mean spirited witch like some people...
N: She thrown a look at Miriam, who just smiles pleasantly.
C: LANA
D: --and, well, if you need a friend here...
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: All my friends are dead.
E: distant tone
N: Rattled, Lana backs off, on the verge of tears, rushing past Miriam, who has observed all this.
C: MIRIAM
D: Lana, wait a minute, she didn't mean it--shit.
N: Miriam closes her locker and comes over to Cynthia.
C: MIRIAM
D: I know Lana's a mealy-mouthed little prude, but she means well. I probably pull her chain too much... She's reaching out, like all of us. Try and help her.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: I can't even help myself.
N: Miriam looks at her, puzzled, then exits the locker room, heading back to the ward. Beyond the lockers, through a doorway, we see Lana lowering herself into the pool. Blue ripples line the wall beyond.
C: DISTANT VOICES
D: Be cleansed!
E: echo affect
N: The SOUND of the VOICES unnerves Cynthia. She presses her hands against her forehand in pain. We are TIGHT ON Cynthia. We hear SPLASHING.
C: VOICE
D: Cleanse the heart of your mind.
N: A bright white light melts across Cynthia's face. She looks up. Something draws her forward. 80A CYNTHIA - SIDE ANGLE 80A She begins walking, passing behind CLOTHES RACKS and LOCKERS. Then, somehow, the SHADOWS of these things become the SHADOWS of TREES, and then Cynthia is 80B ON A BROAD FIELD 80B which leads down to a POND. Twenty or so PEOPLE are gathered at the edge of the water. We see the Unity House in the distance. Cynthia moves behind a tree to watch. Harris stands waist- deep in the pond. The Unity House Members all sit or stand on the shore. Harris holds his hands out in a gesture. A girl comes forward through the group out into the water. It is Cynthia, the younger Cynthia, with long hair in a braid. She smiles at Harris as she nears him. He clutches her hands. Behind the tree, Cynthia watches "herself," absorbed. Harris looks into Cynthia's eyes. He touches her face.
C: HARRIS
D: Cynthia. You are part of the whole.
N: He grabs her by the back of the head and plunges her violently under water.
C: HARRIS
D: Cleanse the heart of the mind!
E: CONT'D
N: He yanks her up. She smiles exultantly. He dunks her back down.
C: HARRIS
D: Cleanse the soul of the self!
E: CONT'D
N: He yanks her up again, but it's not Cynthia. It's LANA. Before she can catch her breath, she's plunged back down. 80C LANA - CLOSER 80C She's yanked up, but this time she's not in the pond, she's in that gasoline-filled cistern!
C: HARRIS
D: Cleanse the spirit of the body!
E: CONT'D
N: He holds her under. She starts to move her arms around to grab hold of something to pull herself up, but Harris is too strong. She flails around desperately.
C: 80D CYNTHIA 80D
D: Alarmed, she moves forward--
N: 80E WITH LANA - UNDER WATER 80E
C: HARRIS
D: Cleanse the spirit.
E: CONT'D distant
N: Lana's gasping, inhaling water, turning blue. Harris is possessed.
C: HARRIS
D: Cleanse.
E: CONT'D
N: Her movements slow. Her eyes close. She is completely still. 80F HARRIS - CLOSE 80F He looks directly at Cynthia.
C: HARRIS
D: I warned you, Cynthia. I warned you someone else would take your place.
E: CONT'D
N: 80G UNDER WATER AGAIN 80G His HAND withdraws from Lana. Her eyes OPEN. No life there. SHE FLOATS UPWARDS. THE CAMERA BREAKS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WITH HER. We're in the clinic's swimming pool! On the edge of the pool, Cynthia SCREAMS, drops to her knees in horror. 80H OTHER END OF BUILDING 80H The clinic CUSTODIAN and some staff run into the room. 80I SWIMMING POOL - HIGH ANGLE 80I Someone wades out to Lana's body, drags it to the concrete deck, tries futilely to pump life back into it. Across the pool, Cynthia flails at the people trying to help her.
T: CUT TO:
S: 80J INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT 80J
N: TIGHT on Cynthia's arm as a clear liquid is injected into her vein. We WIDEN, see Berrisford has injected her. Alan watches, concerned. Cynthia flails on the bed, already reacting to the sedative qualities of the drug.
C: CYNTHIA
D: --He killed her--he killed her because I broke my word... He said he'd take someone else, and he did... She wanted my help... my friendship... That's why... he took her...
N: She's out cold. Behind the doctors, in the doorway, the other clinic patients press close, curious. Hettie pushes them out and down the hallway.
C: HETTIE
D: Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow... Get back to your rooms...
N: Alan looks down at Cynthia with genuine concern. But Berrisford eyes her totally clinically.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Fascinating.
E: thinking aloud MORE
C: CONTINUED: BERRISFORD
D: She's a textbook specimen from a collective environment, an immersion philosophy, run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with Messianic delusions. Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity-- That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety! What do you think?
E: CONT'D exciting himself turning
N: Alan looks at him disbelievingly.
C: ALAN
D: I think she's fucking freaked out about Lana!
E: exploding
C: BERRISFORD
D: Possible.
E: a shrug
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: The patients file past the nurse's station, taking their meds from Hettie. They look unsettled.
C: ED
D: Did you see the swimming pool this morning? The cops are all over it... Fingerprints, photographs...
E: aside to Ralph
C: RALPH
D: Next they'll send in the fucking coast guard. Lot of good it'll do Lana.
N: HE SMASHES his fist on the counter, denting it. Hettie looks at him.
C: HETTIE
D: Ralph, we're gonna start billing you for these outbursts.
N: Ralph just crumples his medication cup and throws it towards her. She glares at him, doesn't say anything.
C: 88A NEARBY 88A
D: Cynthia and the other women from the group sit in a waiting area. Connie sits in a sunbeam, looking ethereal. Gilda is nearby, unmoving... tear stains on her cheeks.
C: CONNIE
D: Drowning isn't so bad... I remember when I died in Atlantis... It was like failing asleep. You know what's bad? Burning. When I was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you--
N: Hearing this, Cynthia chokes back a sob, jumps up and leaves the room. Miriam whirls on Connie.
C: MIRIAM
D: Connie, I don't know about your previous lives, but in this one, you're a shithead.
N: She follows Cynthia.
S: 88B INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - DAY 88B
N: Cynthia is on the bad, crying. Miriam comes in, sits beside her... Cynthia jumps at the weight on the bad, calms when she sees who it is.
C: MIRIAM
D: Honey, you can't blame yourself. Lana was an unhappy girl. Sometimes unhappy girls do foolish things.
C: CYNTHIA
D: She didn't kill herself.
N: Cynthia sits up.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It was Harris.
E: CONT'D
C: MIRIAM
D: Harris?
C: CYNTHIA
D: From Unity House. He comes to me, Miriam. He talks to me. He reminds me that I was supposed to go with them that night--
C: MIRIAM
D: Go with them--
C: CYNTHIA
D: Through the fire. To the next world. They waited while I was in a coma... He told me that if I didn't join him, he would take someone also... and he did it, Miriam, he did it!
N: Miriam gets up, her face a mixture of sympathy... sympathy and something else. She lights a cigarette. Involuntarily, Cynthia FLINCHES at the spark.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You... you don't believe me, do you?
E: CONT'D
C: MIRIAM
D: I believe that you believe it. And I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie- jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems. We gotta get you out of here--get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way. Right?
C: CYNTHIA
D: But I don't know anyone. I don't have any money.
C: MIRIAM
D: You know me.
C: CYNTHIA
D: And you have money, right?
E: skeptical
N: 88C CLOSE ON MIRIAM 88C
C: MIRIAM
D: Look. Despite popular opinion to the contrary, I have not always been the career borderline psychotic neurotic that I am today. Up until a coupla years ago I was a writer, a reporter, a damn good one too... Hell, I really kicked some ass with that Selectric...
N: She seems lost in thought for a moment. Unconsciously, she scratches her wrist... a wrist where we notice for the first time a PURPLE SCAR across the veins.
C: MIRIAM
D: I was on the staff of a magazine... Well, some people called it a rag, but it was home: ME! Magazine. You heard of it?
E: CONT'D turning
C: CYNTHIA
D: I was in a coma.
E: shaking her head, diplomatic
C: MIRIAM
D: Oh, right. Well, when they took me off to the funny farm, Saul--he's the editor--he said I was always welcome back. Maybe this is the time. See, if I can go to him, tell him your story, I could get a big advance... I'd share it with you, and we'd be set! I mean, girl, your story has everything... death, hospitalization, weird rituals, maybe a little romance-- I've seen all those longing glances between you and Goldman-
C: CYNTHIA
D: What--!
C: MIRIAM
D: --and now with poor Lana we got a little mystery. Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- series!
C: CYNTHIA
D: I... I don't know...
C: MIRIAM
D: Cynthia, let me be honest. This is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here. But I really think you need to tell people about Unity House... about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous. You owe it to the world. You owe it to yourself. It's your life, and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it... --if you want to live it.
E: sharper
N: Cynthia turns, mind made up.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let's do it.
T: CUT TO,.
S: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Cynthia walks along with Miriam towards the banks of elevators.
C: MIRIAM
D: I think I know a way to make a phone call. We'll have you out of here tonight.
N: Miriam suddenly stops, almost paralyzed with anxiety.
C: MIRIAM
D: Cynthia. This is the right thing to do.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Of course it is.
C: MIRIAM
D: Uh oh. Mum's the word.
N: Alan is coming down the hallway towards them. They move towards the elevator.
C: ALAN
D: Ladies. Good to see you socializing, Cynthia.
E: nodding
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes. See you later. And... thanks.
E: to Miriam
C: MIRIAM
D: Thank you.
N: Miriam then gets into the elevator. The doors remain open, Alan turns to Cynthia.
C: ALAN
D: How are you feeling?
C: CYNTHIA
D: Fine.
C: ALAN
D: Good.
N: He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him. She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person. Miriam smiles and waves. Cynthia smiles and waves. From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and waves. The elevator doors close.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No!
N: Alan whirls around. Cynthia rushes to the elevator.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Miriam! Stop!
E: CONT'D
N: She bangs on the buttons. She pounds on the doors. Everyone in the corridor turns to look.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia?
N: He starts to approach. She runs to a stairwell.
S: INT. STAIRWELL
N: Cynthia sprints down a flight. She goes out onto
S: INT. HALLWAY, ONE FLIGHT DOWN
N: Cynthia runs to the elevator and pounds on the button, but the elevator car has already passed.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Miriam, get out!
E: yelling into the door
N: She races back to
S: INT. STAIRWELL
N: She flies down the steps. We can hear ALAN tailing her.
C: ALAN'S VOICE
D: Cynthia!
N: She swings around a turn into a flight and trips. Suddenly she's ROLLING DOWN A
S: EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT
N: She SLAMS into a tree. We see the Unity House in the distance.
C: VOICE
D: Cynthia!
C: ANOTHER VOICE
D: She's trying to get away!
N: There are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her. She gets up and runs along the path into the forest.
C: VOICE
D: Cynthia! We want you to stay with us! You mustn't be afraid!
N: She is in total panic, running blindly.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Please, no.
N: Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black as night. The people are getting nearer.
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: She's over here.
N: We see someone nearing through the brush.
C: HARRIS
D: No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand.
N: Cynthia looks down the cliff.
C: ORDERLY'S VOICE
D: Take my hand.
N: Cynthia backs away. She starts lowering herself down, trying to get footing. Some rocks slide out.
S: INT. STAIRWELL
C: ORDERLY
D: Cynthia, take my hand.
N: The Orderly rushes to her, but she wavers dizzily and FALLS down the half-flight. She's dazed, but she becomes alert when she sees the orderly approaching. She picks herself up and runs.
S: INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
N: She gets to the elevator. The door is just closing, but it opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse. The elevator is empty. Cynthia whips around looking for her. Orderlies and nurses are moving towards her. At the opposite and of the hallway, a window is broken. Cynthia runs to it. There is a WOMAN'S SCREAM from the street below. PEOPLE YELLING. Cynthia looks out and down. We know what she sees. She covers her face. An orderly takes hold of her. She is docile now, almost weak. Alan runs up. He looks out the window. So does a Nurse.
C: ALAN
D: Jesus.
N: The nurse crosses herself. Cynthia is escorted away amid the confusion.
S: EXT. SKY - DAY
N: The CAMERA IS MOVING FORWARD, TOWARDS the window. It seemingly goes OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW. The FRAME is filled with bright blue sky. Silence, except for a slight BREEZE. Someone is falling through the sky. It is MIRIAM. We see her CLOSER, flowing down, the wind rushing up round her. She is happy.
C: MIRIAM
D: Cynthia, it's really quite beautiful.
N: The ground comes rushing up and we SLAM into it. BLACK.
T: FADE IN:
S: 99A INT. THERAPY ROOM - NIGHT 99A
N: It's not a session. It's a wake. Cynthia sits, face half in shadow.
C: CYNTHIA
D: They want us all now. They want us with them. Whether we like it or not, we're going,
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, we're all upset by what's happened. But let's not get--
C: CYNTHIA
D: Harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when we're all together.
C: CONNIE
D: Eternal bliss....
C: RALPH
D: Eternal bullshit--!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Miriam was going to write a story about me. He killed her because she was going to help me got out of here.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, please...
C: CYNTHIA
D: You're not listening to me! He wants us all to die! He wants you all with them, and it's because of me! It's all because of me...
E: sobbing
N: Berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERAMEN.
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: Dr. Berrisford, what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together?
C: BERRISFORD
D: I'd call it a tragic coincidence. Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies.
C: SECOND REPORTER
D: What about the commune girl? Has she confirmed that the fire was some sort of mass suicide?
C: BERRISFORD
D: As that is a police matter, I am not at liberty to comment on it.
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: Speaking of the police, doctor, isn't it true that they suspect that the recent deaths may not have been suicides at all?
C: BERRISFORD
D: That's completely absurd. Where do you get this nonsense?
C: FIRST REPORTER
D: From Lieutenant Wasserman. He confirmed to me that he's assigning some of his officers to the hospital grounds until further notice.
E: a smug smile
N: Pandemonium as the other reporters seize this information.
C: REPORTERS
D: Doctor Berrisford, are you cooperating with the police? Dr. Berrisford, do your patients have a history of violence?
E: rapid fire
C: BERRISFORD
D: Ah... I have work to do. No further questions.
N: And--flustered for once--he leaves the room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: It is raining. Cynthia sits in bed, in the dark. We see the CHARRED AND BURNED HARRIS sitting across the room in a shadow. Cynthia looks over at him.
C: HARRIS
D: You're in pain, Cynthia.
N: He reaches up to his face, and peels off some skin. It CRACKLES and oozes. He peels off more.
C: HARRIS
D: Your pain is my pain. We share it all, because we have our love.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: CONTINUED: HARRIS
D: Our love will never die. Don't make me take another of your friends. Keep your promise, lovechild. Join me.
E: CONT'D
N: She stands, fumbles for the switch, knocks over a glass, and turns on the light. He is gone. As she stands there in shock, a HAND touches her shoulder, spins her around. She GASPS-- It's Alan, who's just opened the door. He looks at her, worried.
C: ALAN
D: I didn't want you to be alone.
N: She sways, dizzy, sags in his arms.
C: ALAN
D: Looks like I was right.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Connie is sitting on her bad. She takes her pills from Hettie dutifully. Ed comes in.
C: HETTIE
D: What are you doing here?
C: ED
D: You know me at feeding time.
N: He takes his meds from her, smiling. CHEWS THEM loudly and sloppily until she grimaces and goes out. Then, the minute the door closes, Ed and Connie are in each other's arms. They kiss like characters in a Harlequin Romance.
C: CONNIE
D: Why didn't you tell me before that you were a Prince of Ancient Atlantis?
E: coming up for air
C: ED
D: It slipped my mind ... your Highness.
N: She kisses him passionately again. He breaks the clinch, pulls her towards the door.
C: ED
D: They'll have bed check soon. I know a better place.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Alan site on the counter across from Cynthia's bed. He plays with the hinged mirror on the wall.
C: ALAN
D: I don't know if you want to hear this or not, and frankly, I don't care.
N: As he toys with the mirror, we see a CANTED REFLECTION of first Cynthia and then the hallway. A nurse passes by.
C: 109A ON CYNTHIA 109A
D: As she listens.
C: ALAN
D: You are no more responsible for those deaths twelve hours ago than you are for the ones twelve years ago.
E: CONT'D
N: Something catches her eye. 109B IN THE MIRROR 109B Connie and Ed walk by.
C: ALAN
D: Thinking otherwise is putting you in a self-replicating spiral of depression. And that puts me in a bind... What do I do, write more prescriptions? You need to face reality, not get medicated out of it...
E: CONT'D
N: Cynthia GASPS. HARRIS HAS APPEARED IN THE MIRROR, following Ed and Connie. 109C BACK TO SCENE 109C Cynthia jumps up, heads for the door. Alan catches her by the wrist,
C: ALAN
D: Damn it, Cynthia, you can't run away from this--
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's Harris--he's going to do something to Connie--to Ed--!
N: Alan SLAPS her. She pales... tries to hit him back.
C: ALAN
D: Good! Get mad--get angry--but not at me--at these fantasies--!
N: She stands on rocky feet, unsure...
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Connie and Ed come to a door marked "Utility." Ed looks around cautiously and opens the door, relieved that it's still unlocked.
S: INT. UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT
N: Once inside the small space, he kisses Connie. He pulls out a pint flask of schnapps from his bathrobe pocket. He gives her a swig.
C: CONNIE
D: Nectar from the grapes of Atlantis!
E: wistful
C: ED
D: No fooling you.
N: He leads her back to a door that's labeled "DANGER: Authorized Personnel Only." The lock is busted open. They go in.
S: INT. TURBINE ROOM - NIGHT
N: There are metal grating steps leading up to a platform that sits adjacent to a huge spinning turbine, its six-foot blades WHIRRING at top speed. Air ducts lead in and out of the space. Connie is uplifted, frightened, exhilarated. Their clothes and hair are blown around. They ascend the platform, and sit across from each other. They each take a swig. They kiss softly, spiritually.
C: ED
D: I'm so happy.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The door to the utility room CLOSES. It LOCKS.
S: INT. TURBINE ROOM - NIGHT
N: Connie and Ed stare into each other's eyes. They are lost. The CAMERA MOVES IN AND OUT between and around them, exploring the depth of their absorption. The CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the huge spinning turbine. Its SOUND builds to a tremendous ROAR. We see Connie and Ed through the door into the turbine room. The door is pulled closed by someone or something. The knob locks.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Cynthia keeps looking at the door, worried.
C: ALAN
D: Miriam and Lana were both deeply disturbed women. Miriam tried to kill herself before. Lana was obsessed with the morbid... You heard her in the sessions. You can't twist what they did into something other than what it was.
N: Just then, all the lights go OUT.
C: ALAN
D: Now what?
E: CONT'D
N: In the darkness, he stumbles towards the light, flicks it. Nothing. The door OPENS. In the dim light of the hallway emergency lamps, we SEE Cynthia go out.
C: ALAN
D: Damn it, Cynthia, come back--!
E: CONT'D
N: Trying to follow, he COLLIDES With some furniture.
C: ALAN
D: Shit--!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Darkness and confusion. Cynthia passes by the CAMERA. A moment later Alan comes by, looking for her. Other patients come out and wonder. Flashlights. A NURSE streams by.
C: NURSE
D: It's just overloaded circuits. Everyone, please go back into your room.
N: CAMERA ADJUSTS to show an elderly, skeletal custodian, EDGAR, on the phone.
C: EDGAR
D: The turbine room upstairs? All right. We'll set it straight in a minute. Somethin's caught in the turbine.
E: he hangs up
C: NURSE
D: Hurry.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Edgar comes up to the utility door, but it won't budge.
C: EDGAR
D: Goddammit.
N: He walks off.
S: INT. UTILITY TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: This is a low passageway between floors. Edgar has to stoop under the ducts and pipes. He comes to a small hatchway in the coiling above him marked "CAUTION: Turbine." There is a latch which has to be pulled to release the hatchway. Edgar pulls. It's stuck. He yanks with his frail body. The latch barely moves. A TRICKLE OF BLOOD streams out at the edge, but Edgar doesn't see it. Edgar yanks and pulls with all his might, groaning and heaving. Finally he stops in frustration. He sits an a duct, resting. Just then the latch undoes itself. The hatchway slams open. Edgar is showered with red lumpy fluid. He is coated with it.
C: EDGAR
D: What the hell?
N: Edgar looks down. In the pool of red is a woman's shoe. Puzzled, he bends down, picks it up. Something FALLS OUT OF IT. 121A ON THE FLOOR 121A It is a SEVERED HUMAN FOOT.
C: 121B ON EDGAR 121B
D: as he reacts in shock, the spinning turbine begins to SPLATTER DROPS OF BLOOD on him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Cynthia comes towards us. Alan, further down the hall, sees her.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia--!
N: Cynthia turns, reacts... and then reacts to--
C: CONNIE'S VOICE
D: Cynthia. Cynthia.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Connie?
N: She goes into another corridor. Alan hurries to catch up, but then has to help a nurse with a frightened OLDER WOMAN. 122A ANOTHER CORRIDOR - WITH CYNTHIA 122A
C: CONNIE'S VOICE
D: Cynthia.
N: Cynthia moves down the hall a bit. She looks up at the coiling. ANGLE - THE AIR VENT
C: CONNIE'S VOICE
D: Cynthia, we're up here!
E: CONT'D
N: Down the hall further, another vent.
C: ED'S VOICE
D: Come with us, Cynthia!
C: CONNIE'S VOICE
D: You must join us, Cynthia!
N: Cynthia follows the voices. She is underneath another larger vent with a fan spinning inside. Everyone in the hall ignores her.
C: HARRIS' VOICE
D: Cynthia, you must reach out and embrace our love for you... You must reach out to me...
N: We see Harris now, behind the fan, in brief flashes of light, burnt then normal, gazing down at Cynthia. He reaches towards her.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Where are Connie and Ed?
N: His fingers ARE SLICED OFF BY THE FAN. He takes no notice.
C: HARRIS
D: They're with us now.
N: We hear SPLASHING. Cynthia looks over. Gallons of blood and solid matter pour out of the ceiling vents all down the hall.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Where are they? Where are Connie and Ed? Where are they?
E: she is frantic
N: Alan wonders at the pouring red, then he hears Cynthia screaming. He runs down the hall to stop her. The patients and nurses watch the blood pour in horror. Cynthia is getting more and more hysterical.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Where are Connie and Ed?
E: CONT'D
N: Alan corners her.
C: ALAN
D: It's all right--it's all right--
N: Suddenly, out of nowhere, a BL00D-COVERED BODY careens into them, driving them apart!
C: 123A ANGLE 123A
D: It's Edgar, covered with blood, in a total state of shock.
C: EDGAR
D: --horrible--sweet Jesus--help me--
N: Alan struggles to restrain him. Nurses run to help.
C: 123B CYNTHIA 123B
D: Huddles on the floor in a position not unlike the one from her coma. She SOBS uncontrollably.
T: CUT TO:
S: 123C INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 123C
N: Alan and an orderly escort Cynthia to her room. Alan comes out, watches Edgar pass by in a wheelchair, raving. Ralph and Gilda come up to Alan.
C: RALPH
D: What the fuck is going on?
C: GILDA
D: It's Ed and Connie. They're dead, aren't they?
N: Alan looks at her. How did the grapevine got it to her so fast?
C: ALAN
D: Yes. We're not sure what happened... There was evidence that they were drinking... They fell into... the main turbine.
C: RALPH
D: Fuck... Look, Ed drank before. Lots of times. Didn't know that, did you? But he didn't usually decide to jump into a mix master, man!
C: ALAN
D: Ralph, as for your own safety, you are being given the most amount of protection possible.
C: GILDA
D: The police are powerless. Ask Cynthia. She knows. Harris wants us all.
E: softly
N: Ralph looks at Gilda with almost as much dismay as Alan.
C: RALPH
D: Jesus Fucking Christ! I'm getting the hell out of here.
N: Ralph storms out.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: As Ralph moves along, a paunchy POLICEMAN intercepts him.
C: RALPH
D: Now what?
C: COP
D: Lieutenant Wasserman assigned me to you. Where you go--
C: RALPH
D: I get the picture. Try not to shoot me or your fat ass, okay?
T: CUT TO:
N: BERRISFORD'S SILENT IMAGE ON A VIDEO SCREEN
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The newscast continues silently on the TV in her room. She is getting dressed. She peaks out the door.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The Policeman assigned to her is down the hall a ways, chatting with a nurse. Cynthia slips out and down the corridor. She waits for an elevator. When a door opens, she tries to inconspicuously slip inside but she finds herself face to face with Alan who in just getting out of the elevator. He holds a grocery bag.
C: ALAN
D: Isn't this a coincidence?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm getting out of here.
N: He takes her arm and starts leading her back to her room.
C: ALAN
D: Believe it or not, this is the safest place for you to be. The police are here. There are doctors here. And I'm going to keep you company, all night. I even brought provisions.
N: He shows a variety of fast food.
C: ALAN
D: Pure unadulterated junk. At this point, who cares about the chemicals?
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles slightly. He holds his arm out for her like a swain escorting his date. She takes it in a similar spirit. The policeman comes out of Cynthia's room, looking for her in alarm. He's instantly relieved to see her there with Alan. Alan directs her inside. She goes. Alan gives the Policeman a look.
C: ALAN
D: Try harder next time.
E: CONT'D
N: He goes into her room, leaving the embarrassed cop behind. Suddenly the LIGHTS RETURN with an eye-jarring FLASH. The cop has his revolver halfway out of the holster before he realizes what it is.
S: 128B INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT 128B
N: They both react to the returned power with relief. Alan takes the stuff out of the bag: chips, dips, cookies, six- packs of beer. He offers some of the chips. She shakes her head. The TV's still on. Alan switches channels with the sound muted.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Connie and Ed aren't going to be the last.
E: with frightening casualness
C: ALAN
D: Yes, they are. Everyone's under protection. Nothing can happen.
T: CUT TO:
N: 128C CLOSE UP - A KNIFE 128C pointing upwards. An outstretched hand SLAMS itself down, the blade impaling through the palm. The hand squirms its fingers a bit, then pulls off.
S: INT. RALPH'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: He gets up clenching the perforated hand. He is very calm. He closes the knife and puts it in a drawer. Suddenly, violently, he kicks a trash bin. Then he is calm again. Ralph's assigned Policeman pokes his head in the door.
C: RALPH'S POLICEMAN
D: Everything okay?
N: Ralph sticks his hand behind him. He is very friendly, very normal. He smiles.
C: RALPH
D: Yes, thank you, officer. Hey, lemme buy you a cup of coffee.
C: RALPH'S POLICEMAN
D: Sounds good to me.
E: shrugging
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Ralph comes out of his room. Ralph's policeman is beside him. His hand bleeds, but goes unnoticed.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Alan lies back in front of the TV, eyes closed, SNORING. Sympathetic, Cynthia slips the remote control from his hand... then there is a KNOCK at the door. She goes there, finds Ralph, who steps inside.
C: RALPH
D: Just a sec.
E: to his cop
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph? What is it?
C: RALPH
D: Nothing. I just came to tell you-- Everything's gonna be okay.
E: smiling, conspiratorially
C: CYNTHIA
D: What's going to be okay?
N: He goes into the bathroom and rinses his blood-soaked hand. Cynthia sees this.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What happened to your hand?
E: CONT'D
C: RALPH
D: Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph?
N: Cynthia is mystified. He goes.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Ralph walks off, his Policeman following.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph?
E: yelling down the hall
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: She comes in and pokes Alan awake.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph was just here. His hand was... all bloody.
N: They go to the door and they are immediately faced with Hettie.
C: HETTIE
D: Dr. Goldman, have you seen Ralph?
C: ALAN
D: I was going to ask you the same thing.
N: She holds up a paper cup with a tablet in it.
C: HETTIE
D: He didn't take his four o'clock. If he misses this one, I'm gonna...
N: Alan takes the capsule, examines it.
C: ALAN
D: Shit! It's his tranquilizer! If he doesn't take this, he'll completely flip out--!
N: Alan and Cynthia run down the hall. Cynthia's policeman follows.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Alan and Cynthia and the policeman scan for Ralph.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Look.
N: ANGLE - ON THE FLOOR Every five or six feet along in a line, there is a moderately- sized droplet splatter of blood. They follow the droplets along the hallway. They follow the droplets through a set of double doors.
S: INT. DARK, QUIET HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Ralph walks along, his policeman trailing. No one else is around.
C: RALPH'S POLICEMAN
D: Are you sure you know where you're going?
N: Ralph stops suddenly and turns to him. Ralph smiles warmly. Suddenly he hits the cop in the head using two fists. The cop falls.
S: INT. HALLWAY IN CLOSED SECTION OR HOSPITAL
N: Alan and Cynthia's policeman move down the hall, following the drops, scanning in doorways. Cynthia is just behind them. These hallways are unused. Nobody around.
C: ALAN
D: Was he behaving strangely?
C: CYNTHIA
D: No more strangely than everybody also in this place.
C: CYNTHIA'S POLICEMAN
D: I can't get him. He must be shut off.
E: with walkie-talkie
N: They pass an open freight elevator. Cynthia looks in it and stops. There is a droplet of blood on the floor inside.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Hey.
N: A BLOODY HAND reaches out of the elevator covering her mouth and pulls her inside.
S: INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Ralph holds her, slams the gate closed, and flips the switch. The car moves down. Cynthia SCREAMS.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Alan and the policeman rush up just as the car disappears.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia!
S: INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: They descend. She wipes blood from her face. He looks wired.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, we have to go and get your medication.
N: She slowly moves to the control panel. He watches her. Just as she is about to reach the buttons, he violently pushes her back.
C: RALPH
D: Relax.
N: He smiles.
S: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: The elevator comes down to a stop. Ralph throws the door open. It is a huge dark space, a vast store room. Cynthia won't come out. Ralph gestures politely.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, I'm not going out. We have to go back upstairs.
N: Ralph grabs her firmly and pulls her out.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, please!
E: CONT'D
C: RALPH
D: I have to talk to you.
N: He leans in the elevator, opens the control panel and yanks some wires. Sparks fly. The HUM of the elevator motor dies. Cynthia is panicked.
C: RALPH
D: It's very, very, very, very, very important that I talk to you.
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, you're not being yourself. Can't you tell?
C: RALPH
D: No! This is the real me!
N: He flies across the basement and, grabbing a chair, smashes the control box for the electric cargo door, the only other entrance. He darts up a storage aisle. He rips a phone off the wall.
C: RALPH
D: I come down here a lot. It helps me unwind.
E: CONT'D
N: Cynthia can't see him. He wildly paces up and down the storage aisles. Cynthia starts to cry.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, please! How do we get out?
C: RALPH
D: It's been said by better men than me in better ways in better times-- there is no way out!
N: She goes to a barred window.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Help!
N: Ralph goes into a rage. He pushes over a huge storage shelf. Everything spills and breaks. Amid the rubble a pile of surgical blades lies glinting in a pool of light. Ralph looks down at it. Cynthia sees him looking at it. She is afraid. He grabs some of the blades randomly and disappears. He is walking crazily up and down the storage aisles. Cynthia only catches glimpses of him. He jumps up and breaks the individual LIGHT BULBS which hang on wires, providing the only illumination. The space grows DARKER. All the while, Ralph talks and talks.
C: RALPH
D: There are only a few chances for real glory, and most people fuck it up. Most people can't even find the noses on their fucking faces. You want an example? How about EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR in this entire hospital? Do you think I'm just going to let myself slowly dissolve into nothingness here?! I'm talking about a glorious glory. And everybody's trying to drag me down!
E: jump, BREAK jump, BREAK
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, please, they said you have to take some pills.
C: RALPH
D: Pills have got nothing to do with it! You know what I'm talking about!
N: He jumps, smashes the last bulb. She can't see him.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No, I don't. I don't.
C: RALPH
D: You do! Real glory, hallelujah! The great big gig in the sky. Don't play dumb, Cynthia.
N: She sees him at the far and of the aisle. His shirt is off. There are deep, bleeding cuts all over his chest and stomach. He has blades clenched in both fists. Cynthia is terrified.
C: RALPH
D: I think you know the word I'm searching for.
E: CONT'D
N: He starts making deep slashes on his arm.
C: RALPH
D: U, N, I, T, Y! Unity!
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Oh God, Ralph! No!
C: RALPH
D: Yes, oh, yes! Eternal bliss!
N: He stops and raises the scalpels to his chest. He jabs them in and cuts open down to his stomach.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph, please, stop!
N: He swats at the one remaining lamp. It flickers on and off. Ralph's eyes flutter. He FALLS. Cynthia rushes to him.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Ralph!
E: CONT'D
N: He throws a scalpel at her. It misses, but she is spattered with blood.
C: RALPH
D: Get back.
E: fading
N: Cynthia is crouched down, crying as she watches him.
C: RALPH
D: Join us, Cynthia.
E: CONT'D
N: The light flickers off, then on. A hand is on Cynthia's shoulder. She looks up... it is Harris.
C: HARRIS
D: Join us.
N: The bulb DIES. Blackness.

C: POLICEMAN
D: They're in the basement. The girl's alive.
N: They run on together.
S: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
N: Lots of COPS, a few DOCTORS and ORDERLIES. Alan is stopped by a FEMALE COP. He looks into the basement area and sees Ralph in a pool of blood. A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is taking pictures of him. Alan stares at Ralph. Berrisford is with Cynthia and a nurse. Cynthia is getting an injection. Wasserman comes over to Alan and Berrisford.
C: WASSERMAN
D: You're running out of patients, Doctors.
C: ALAN
D: What did she say happened?
C: WASSERMAN
D: She's having a little trouble with reality--as usual.
N: A nurse and an orderly escorts Cynthia towards the elevator.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Goodbye, Alan. Thanks for trying. But it's time for me to go now.
E: to Alan
N: Alan suddenly realizes what she means.
C: ALAN
D: I have to go with her. Where is she being taken?
C: BERRISFORD
D: Isolation.
C: ALAN
D: Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contact--connection--isolation is the worst thing you can do--
E: stunned
C: BERRISFORD
D: Dr. Goldman, I know you're fond of the girl, but you're out of line.
C: ALAN
D: Shit. You want her on the edge, don't you... You want to play your theory out to the end--
C: BERRISFORD
D: Goldman!
C: WASSERMAN
D: Theory? Anything I should know?
E: interested
C: BERRISFORD
D: It's an extraordinarily complex situation, severe identity crisis compounded with the multiple shock of these deaths. She's reverting to this total belief system from the commune through an intermittent psychosis that puts ideology above her life itself--
C: ALAN
D: Fuck ideology! Fuck you, Berrisford! You can't use a human being as a guinea pig-- You have to stop this. Call it off--I'll--I'll sign her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician--
E: to Wasserman
C: BERRISFORD

E: calling off

S: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
N: Cynthia is escorted through the hospital by the nurse and policeman. She moves without resistance, without emotion. We hear CRICKETS. Cynthia hovers in a dreamlike calm. The hospital is a blur as they move through it. Objects pass in front of our view as we TRACK with her. Cynthia, the nurse, and the policeman walk up the path to
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DUSK
N: The imposing facade of the old Victorian with its warmly lit windows looks inviting. The three make their way over the lawn up the path towards the front porch. An evening BREEZE is just coming up. Cynthia looks around, absorbing the environment. The policeman and the nurse say nothing. Cynthia turns to them.

D: Would you like to come in?
C: NURSE
D: No, thank you.

E: apologetic apologetic
N: Burning, Alan shifts his package, finds the card, flings it down on the counter.
C: ALAN
D: Tell Berrisford he can use it for a bookmark. Maybe then he can find his dick without a road map.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: We're gonna miss you around here, Dr. Goldman.
N: Alan manages a smile for the man, goes out.
T: CUT TO:
N: A DIM, FUZZY VIDEO IMAGE FOCUS DOWN until we realize it is Cynthia lying in her bed. We are looking at her from directly above. We WIDEN, realize that we're at a NURSE'S STATION, where Cynthia is monitored along with other patients. We can see that she is talking.

N: We see the whole room now. It's filled with Unity House Members, all of them. They're sitting leaning, slumping everywhere in the shadows. Among them are Connie and Ed.
C: CONNIE
D: You have to do it yourself, honey. When you didn't... he took us instead. But we're not mad. It's wonderful here.
N: FEMALE UNITY MEMBER 2 Death is like this really beautiful trip Cynthia. We just want to share it with you. Lana and Miriam.
C: LANA
D: You mustn't be afraid, Cynthia.
N: Harris in playing with his burning finger.
C: MIRIAM
D: if I can do it, you can do it, honey.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why don't you kill me?
S: INT. NURSE'S STATION - NIGHT
N: A NURSE notices Cynthia's movement on the screen. She turns the volume up.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why don't you just kill me?!
E: ON TV
N: The nurse gets up. Gilda is standing there. She follows. Gilda's policeman lurks nearby.
C: GILDA'S POLICEMAN
D: Hey.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
C: HARRIS
D: You have to join us because you love us. You have to do it for yourself.
N: We hear the Nurse UNLOCKING the door. A MALE UNITY MEMBER looks over at the door. We seem him momentarily burned.
C: HARRIS
D: You have to do it for yourself-- --lovechild.
E: CONT'D smiling
N: We see Harris momentarily burned. He blows his finger out.
C: CYNTHIA
D: But I'm so scared.
N: The Nurse opens the door. The room is empty except for Cynthia on her bed.
C: NURSE
D: You want me to call the doctor, honey?
N: Cynthia says nothing.
C: NURSE
D: Try to sleep, all right?
E: CONT'D
N: Gilda rushes in behind the Nurse, going to Cynthia.
C: NURSE
D: Hey, get out of here!
E: CONT'D
C: GILDA
D: I can do nothing for you now, but know this--the answer you seek is inside of you! It is inside you!
E: frantic
N: Gilda's Policeman comes in.
C: NURSE
D: Get her out of here!
N: He pulls at Gilda.
C: GILDA
D: Know yourself and you will be at peace! It is so!
E: as she goes
N: The Nurse SLAMS the door closed. Cynthia is alone.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Gilda's policeman is on the phone.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Yeah, I'm taking her back to her room... Okay, bye.
N: He hangs up, looks around. Gilda is gone.
S: INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT
N: We are FOLLOWING GILDA through the corridors back to her room.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Gilda's policeman is still looking for her. She's nowhere in sight.
S: INT. GILDA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Gilda comes in and lies down. Momentary silence. A shaft of light hits Gilda as someone comes in the door. Whoever it is nears Gilda. She is calm. She looks over.
C: GILDA
D: I know you'd come.
N: Silence.
C: GILDA
D: But you're too late.
E: CONT'D
N: She holds up a bottle of tablets. We fleetingly see the word "poisonous." The bottle SMASHES to the floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
C: TIGHT ON HER
D: She looks like she's been crying. She stares off into space.
N: Someone crosses in the shadows to the window. The rubber edging is slit with a scalpel.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It feels good. I know this is right.
C: HARRIS' VOICE
D: That's right. You need our love. We need your love.
N: A shadowed hand pushes on the plexiglass. The windowpane plops onto the pavement below. A breeze wafts in. Cynthia gets out of bed and comes to the window. She looks out onto the evening horizon, refreshed, fully experiencing the moment.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I know this is right. We'll all be together.
T: CUT TO:
S: 171A EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 171A
N: Alan comes out, still fuming. He walks along a ways and then looks at the illuminated SIGN pointing out the way to the "Berrisford Clinic." Alan stares at it, then in a sudden release of fury, KICKS it, once, twice, and then he THROWS his carton at it. Calming, feeling like an idiot, he sighs.
C: ALAN
D: Brilliant. Do we feel better now? No. Yes. Maybe.
N: A thought strikes him. He reaches into his shirt pocket, takes out-- 171B TRANQUILIZER - CL0SE 171B --the one Hettie handed to Alan two long and bloody hours ago. 171C BACK TO SCENE 171C
C: ALAN
D: It's okay, officer. I'll write myself a prescription in the morning.
E: CONT'D with a shrug
N: He swallows it, dry, with a loud GULP, Then he picks up his papers and things, heads for the parking lot. 171D ALAN'S CAR - NIGHT 171D PULLBACK as Alan unlocks it, his carton momentarily balanced on the car roof. The door open, Alan gets in, puts his box in the cluttered back seat. He SHIVERS from one of those unexpected chills we all get, then puts the key in the ignition, STARTS the engine, turns on the LIGHTS. Then he looks up ahead and sees-- 171E DR. BERRISFORD - HIS POV 171E Briefcase in hand, crossing the parking lot up ahead, his long shadow falling across a high retaining wall. 171F BACK TO SCENE 171F Alan sits, face unreadable. He REVS the engine. Faster. Faster. A strange smile crosses Alan's face. He THROWS THE CAR INTO GEAR. 171G BERRISFORD - CROSSING THE LOT 171G He taken out his keys, approaches his car... suddenly REACTS as HEADLIGHTS BLIND HIM--
C: 171H REVERSE ANGLE 171H
D: Alan ROARS TOWARDS HIM, grinning behind the wheel--
N: 171I BACK TO SCENE 171I Berrisford gasps, RUNS!
C: 171J THE CHASE 171J
D: Berrisford dodges in and out of cars, behind lamp posts. Manic, Alan follows him relentlessly, skidding around turns, SIDESWIPING as many cars as budget allows. Finally--
C: 171K BERRISFORD 171K
D: finds himself against a wall--as TIRES SKID in he SCREAMS--
N: 171L INSIDE ALAN'S CAR 171L He SLAMS Berrisford against the wall. Berrisford's body SMACKS against the bricks, rebounds onto the windshield, CRACKING IT. Alan recoils from the impact, blood on his lips from his own collision with the steering wheel. He looks at Berrisford, squirming a foot away with the little life left in him. Alan CACKLES, gives Berrisford the finger. Then he throws the car into reverse.
C: 171M REAR TIRES 171M
D: SKIDDING BACKWARDS--
C: 171N BERRISFORD 171N
D: SLIDES off the car hood, hits the asphalt, his head CRACKING--
C: 171O ALAN'S CAR 171O
D: RUNS FORWARD AGAIN--
T: 171P BERRISFORD - QUICK CUTS 171P
N: As the car GRINDS him into the ground, his wrist bones SNAPPING, ribs CRUNCHING, body TWITCHING. Finally he is STILL. An artery SQUIRTS fountain-like into the air. 171Q INSIDE THE CAR 171Q The blood hits the windshield. Idly, distracted, Alan turns on the windshield wipers... Suddenly HARRIS sits up in the rear seat, a smile on the burned and scarred face.
C: HARRIS
D: Good work, Dr. Goldman. Now, it's your turn.
N: Skeletal hands GRAB Alan's throat. He STRUGGLES. KICKS--out of the corner of his eye he sees- 171R FRONT OF CAR 171R Gasoline is flowing over the dented hood and through the cracked windshield and over the dash and over Alan. More and more comes. 171S BACK TO SCENE 171S Holding Alan with one hand, Harris leans forward, pulls out the cigarette lighter! He holds the GLOWING TIP up in the air.
C: HARRIS
D: Need a light?
E: CONT'D
N: He presses the burning tip against Alan's gasoline soaked CREEK. It SIZZLES--Alan SCREAMS-- 171T CAR - LONG SHOT 171T It EXPLODES--
T: CUT TO:
N: 171U ALAN - IN HIS CAR 171U He jerks his head up, face drenched in sweat. He's still in his original parking space! He's never even started the car! Gasping for air, still freaked, he opens the door, tumbles out.
C: 171V PARKING LOT 171V
D: The box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car. Alan sees this, staggers against the car, fights a wave of nausea. Struggling to remain composed, he takes his pulse. Feels his head. Suspicion crosses his face. Then his hand moves to his shirt pocket.
T: 171W FLASH CUT 171W
N: of himself taking the pill by the clinic sign. 171X BACK TO THE PRESENT 171X fingers down his throat. He HEAVES his guts out beside his car... but when he straightens up, he's clear eyed and lucid. He turns, runs like hell towards the clinic.
S: 171Y INT. CLINIC PHARMACY - NIGHT 171Y
N: RON, the pharmacist, looks up as Alan storms inside.
C: RON
D: Goldman, you look like shit--
C: ALAN
D: Show me the scrips for the therapy group--
E: pushing him aside
C: RON
D: Come on, man, I can't do that-- it's Berrisford's show all the way--
N: Ignoring him, Alan finds the files.
C: ALAN
D: Shit, this is all standard stuff--
C: RON
D: What do you expect?
C: ALAN
D: Do you fill these prescriptions?
C: RON
D: Nah, Berrisford does it. He comes in every morning and sets up the medication for the day--Hettie takes it as she needs it--
C: ALAN
D: Fuck!
N: He turns, tries to open the glass case with the prearranged trays. It's locked. He grabs a paperweight, SMASHES THE GLASS.
C: RON
D: Hey--!
N: Alan pulls out the tray, scans it. He grabs Ron by the collar, shoves the files into his face.
C: ALAN
D: Read it. Pesco, Ralph--
C: RON
D: He's dead--
C: ALAN
D: READ IT! What's he down for?
C: RON
D: Ah, Lithium--four times a day--
N: Alan grabs the tray, holds up a pill.
C: ALAN
D: Is that Lithium?
C: RON
D: Fuck, no--that's Endoral--the complete opposite--one of those, even a normal person would flip out--
C: ALAN
D: Tell me about it--
N: Alan looks at the tray and its compartments labeled for Lana, Miriam, Ed... all the others. Alan GRABS them all.
C: ALAN
D: What's this? And this? And this?
E: CONT'D
C: RON
D: This is, uh, dextroamphetamine... Christ, take one of these and you can walk on the ceiling. Holy mother. Methylphenidate! Don't mass with that fucker. Clonodine! Chlorapromazine! Preludin? Shit, I didn't know they still made that... Two of these and Mother Teresa would turn into a maniac!
N: Alan in having convulsions of horror. FLASH CUTS - ON MIRIAM AND LANA - they swallow medication. ON BERRISFORD - he pulls bottles off the pharmacy shelves. ON CONNIE AND ED - they swallow medication. ON BERRISFORD - he hands the bottles of medication to the pharmacy administrator. ON NURSE WITH RALPH'S PRESCRIPTION - Alan grabs it away.
C: ON BERRISFORD
D: he injects Cynthia with medication.
C: RON
D: Tetrahydrocannabinol! Do you know what that is? Liquid condensed marijuana! Just thinking about that stuff gets you wasted.
E: CONT'D
N: Alan runs out.
C: RON
D: Hey, Goldman, come back here! Who's gonna clean up this mess--?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Alan running faster.
S: INT. NURSE'S STATION, ISOLATION WARD - NIGHT
N: Hettie is standing smiling in the middle of the hall. Alan nears.
C: HETTIE
D: You're not supposed to be here, Dr. Goldman, are you?
N: Alan turns. Two SECURITY GUARDS are coming.
C: ALAN
D: Please, Hettie, I need your help.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: She is at the window, facing out.
C: VOICE
D: Now.
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Alan rushes over to Cynthia's door and pounds furiously.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia! Cynthia!
N: The two security guards start running over. One of them has his gun drawn. Alan wants to run, but he sees there is no way out. He sticks his hands in the air. The guards are upon him. They start leading him away.
C: NURSE
D: Sometimes doctors got personally involved. I think it's a mistake. You've got to keep professional.
C: HETTIE
D: Get some rest, Goldman. You look like shit.
N: He looks back at Hettie. He sees a fire alarm. Suddenly, he grabs one of the Guard's guns. He dives against the wall and pulls the fire alarm. All of the Isolation Ward doors open. BELLS and SIRENS go off. Red lights FLASH on and off.
C: HETTIE
D: Oh, no!
E: CONT'D
N: Alan runs from the guards, shooting but missing. He runs up the hall in the opposite direction of Cynthia's room. He hides in a doorway. They pass. He heads back up to Cynthia's room. He grabs the cop's chair and runs into
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: He slams the door and rams the metal chair log into the bolt latch to secure the door. SIRENS and BELLS continue. Alan looks over. The room is dark, except for the red light flashing on and off. Cynthia is crouched in the far corner by the open window. We can see that the room is otherwise empty of anybody.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Get out of here. I want to do it!
C: ALAN
D: No. Cynthia, please. I'm not going to be able to come back, but you have to listen! Berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group--that's why they've been committing suicide--he's been making them crazy--
E: going to her
C: CYNTHIA
D: But Harris comes to me... He speaks to me--
C: ALAN
D: A drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. All we've hearing for days is "Harris, Harris,"... so that's what we all saw... That's what I saw when I took Ralph's pill! It's all part of Berrisford's plan--he has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!
N: Behind Alan, the dark shape of Berrisford emerges from outside the window. It is climbing inside from the ledge.
C: ALAN
D: Do you hear me?! He's going to want you to kill yourself! He's recreating the whole thing for you! But you can't listen to him!
E: CONT'D
N: Cynthia is getting hysterical. Berrisford stands behind Alan with a scalpel.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Dr. Goldman.
N: Alan turns around. Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. Alan flies against the wall. The gun is knocked away. Alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness, Cynthia is a basket case. She looks at Alan.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No... no... no...
N: Berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection. She calms herself. She looks at him dreamily.
C: 191A CYNTHIA'S POV 191A
D: She sees Harris gazing at her lovingly.
C: HARRIS
D: Only one thing matters.
N: She touches his face.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Our love. We'll be together. All of us.
N: Berrisford taken Alan's gun.
S: INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Alan comes to. The ALARMS and BELLS are still ringing. Cynthia and Berrisford are gone.
C: ALAN
D: Shit!
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying. Hettie is by the stairway helping Isolation patients exit.
C: HETTIE
D: One at a time! No pushing! Please do not use the elevator!
N: Alan is frantically looking for Cynthia and Berrisford, checking everywhere, pushing open doors. The security guards are at the far end of the hallway. Alan goes to Hettie.
C: ALAN
D: Where's Berrisford?
C: HETTIE
D: This is your fault! These goddamn doors won't re-lock!
C: ALAN
D: Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is!
E: furious 
C: HETTIE
D: I haven't seen him!
N: The guards see Alan. They come after him. He runs. Alan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door marked "NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS." It is ajar. He goes in without the guards seeing him.
S: INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT
N: It is dark, but the red lights FLASH. He runs up several flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing, open, no glass. He turns a corner. Cynthia is there. She in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene expression on her face, the wind blowing her frail white gown. Alan freezes. He moves towards her slowly, hands outstretched.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand...
E: soothingly
N: She watches him blankly. She turns to someone behind Alan.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's so beautiful.
N: Alan turns. There on the stair above is Berrisford, his face dancing in the flashing red light.
C: ALAN
D: You piece of shit!
E: to Berrisford
N: Cynthia lets go. Alan reaches out.
C: ALAN
D: No!
E: CONT'D
C: FALLING
D: It is a dizzying spiral. We hear the WIND RUSHING up as we go FASTER AND FASTER down. We SLAM into the ground.
N: CYNTHIA'S HEAD hits rock.
C: ON HER FACE
D: She is still. Blood drips out her nose and mouth. She is dead. We HOLD ON HER until gradually bright light pours in over her. The CAMERA LIFTS UP revealing
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: Cynthia rises and walks towards the house through a field in the foreground. She walks up the porch.
S: INT. UNITY HOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY
N: She opens the door. Everything is clean and fresh. Flowers. Light. Birds CHIRPING. Harris is at the far and of the hall. There is an intense white light behind him. He is smiling beatifically. Cynthia goes towards him. As she nears him, she reaches out her hands. He does too. They clasp.
C: ALAN'S VOICE
D: Cynthia!
N: Suddenly she FALLS. She drops and dangles in the night air against
S: EXT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - NIGHT
N: She is unconscious. She swings twelve stories above the pavement. The CAMERA FOLLOWS UP her arm to her hand grasped tightly by Alan's hand. We CONTINUE UP TO Alan.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia! Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
N: He is over the railing holding on with his other hand. Cynthia is coming to.
C: ALAN
D: Pull up! Pull yourself up so I can got a grip on you!
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me go.
C: ALAN
D: No!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me go. I saw it. It's beautiful.
C: ALAN
D: You didn't see shit! Hold on!
C: BERRISFORD
D: Eternal bliss.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes! I want to go! Let me go!
C: BERRISFORD
D: Let her go. She needs it.
E: coming forward
C: ALAN
D: No! Cynthia, Harris doesn't exist! He's dead! Look at who that is! Look at him! Look!
N: Cynthia looks at Berrisford deliriously. He CHANGES from Berrisford to Harris with each FLASH. He comes to the railing where Alan is holding on. Almost politely, he tries to undo Alan's grip.
C: ALAN
D: Goddamn you! Goddamn you!
E: CONT'D
N: Alan's grip on Cynthia slips down to her fingers.
C: BERRISFORD
D: Let her go. Let her go and I'll forget your disobedience.
E: MORE
N: CONTINUED: (2) BERRISFORD(CONT'D) You can stay one with me in the psychosis and cult behavior study. We'll publish our findings together--
C: ALAN
D: Publish this, asshole!
N: Alan SWINGS one leg up, KICKS Berrisford in the groin. Berrisford HOWLS and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks. Snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at Alan's hand.
C: ALAN
D: Don't you hear him? He's trying to bribe me--but I'm not letting go! I'll go with you, but I'm not letting go!
E: CONT'D to Cynthia
N: Berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. He aims unsteadily... SHOOTS. Alan yanks himself out of the way. Berrisford misses. Berrisford moves closer. Raises the g= barrel at point black range towards Alan's hand.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, help us! Help us both!
E: CONT'D
C: BERRISFORD
D: You'll be with them, Dr. Goldman, Be happy.
C: ALAN
D: No!
C: CYNTHIA
D: S...stop it... Stop it!
N: Berrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN AWAY. He SCREAMS, his grip loosens, and he SLIDES down the railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close... begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia, don't let him kill you! Don't let him do this!
C: CYNTHIA
D: Unity... It... it's my destiny... I've fought it too long. Right or wrong... my death has a purpose... It will close the book. End the story.
C: ALAN
D: Your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too...
N: She looks at Berrisford viciously pounding on Alan's hand.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me up. Stop it.
N: She starts to climb up, but she can't.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let me up!
E: CONT'D
C: BERRISFORD
D: I'm afraid it's too late for that.
N: Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK. She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze. Alan is weakening. He is losing consciousness. He knows he is about to die.
C: GUARD
D: Dr. Berrisford?
N: Suddenly Berrisford freezes. He is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up the stairs. Berrisford backs away glaring. Alan GROANS. The guard rushes over.
C: GUARD
D: Jesus Gomez, get up here!
E: CONT'D Yelling down the stairs
N: The other guard appears. They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger. CLICK. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. Just as they pull Cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see: Berrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly. Silently.
C: GUARD
D: Holy shit.
E: CONT'D
N: Cynthia numbly watches him fall. Then she in pulled up and over...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY - OVERHEAD - NIGHT
N: Cynthia is plopped over onto a gurney. Lights are passing her. She is being whisked down a hallway. She is descending into a haze of unconsciousness.
C: DOCTOR'S VOICE
D: I need a detox prep! Stat!
C: CYNTHIA
D: It was him...
S: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Alan runs alongside the gurney with doctors and nurses. He clutches bloody bandages to his hand, tries to hear Cynthia.
C: ALAN
D: It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Then all those other things... Faces... voices? They were... in my head?
C: ALAN
D: It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined.
N: There is joy through her delirium. She is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
N: A new station wagon whisks along the pretty road.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
N: Alan drives, Cynthia looks at a map. They both look relaxed. They both have bandaged hands.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Go right if that's the interstate. Yeah, it is.
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of Unity House. A chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it. Alan and Cynthia pull up, park. Cynthia gets out and looks around. She goes to the front entrance. Alan follows her in.
S: INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
N: A mere skeleton of what it was. Daylight pours in through the faded, burnt slats of wood. Patches of woods have sprouted up. Cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all. Only piles of charcoal signify where furniture was. Alan meanders in from the other and of the house.
C: ALAN
D: Victorian. Looks like it was a nice house once.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes. I guess appearances can be deceiving.
N: She moves out upstairs. He follows her up onto the risky- looking steps.
C: ON THE LANDING
D: She reaches a point at the top that looks out over the meadow and pond. She looks out. Alan joins her. Cynthia takes in the view contentedly.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's dead. It's really dead...
E: CONT'D
C: ALAN
D: What?
N: She gestures to the house around them.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's over.
N: Alan smiles. He pulls her close to him. They look into each other's eyes. Neither of them is completely at ease with the other, but there is honest affection. They hug, then kiss.
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: It looks almost tranquil. MUSIC UP.
T: CUT TO:
S: 210A INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 210A
N: Wasserman walks along, accompanied by a uniformed officer. They go into-
S: 201B INT. BERRISFORD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 201B
N: where the doctor is in a bed, one leg and one arm in traction. He's talking to his LAWYER as the police officers enter.
C: LAWYER
D: --letters of support could have an influence on the court... You know, from your peers--?
E: in mid-speech
C: BERRISFORD
D: I have no peers. Hello, Lieutenant. Forgive me for not getting up.
E: cutting him off turning smiling
C: WASSERMAN
D: Real funny, Doctor. Try this for laughs: As soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a Grand Jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault.
E: MORE
C: CONTINUED: WASSERMAN
D: Then it gets choice: five counts of murder in the first degree, one count of murder in the second degree. Add the civil liability to all that, and you're going to have plenty of time to write that book.
E: CONT'D
C: BERRISFORD
D: Well. I don't agree with your definition of justice, but I suppose I obstructed it... All in the name of science, of course--
C: LAWYER
D: Doctor Berrisford--
E: appalled
C: BERRISFORD
D: --but as to murder, well, Lieutenant, I beg to differ. I didn't kill anyone. Why would I? I'm only interested in knowledge. Cynthia is a unique girl--the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity. I wanted to understand the depth of her commitment, the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies, the dark terra incognita of the human psyche--
E: hushing him
C: WASSERMAN
D: Hey, go chow on a Latin dictionary, okay? You can bullshit all you want, but how do you account for six bodies?
E: fed up
C: BERRISFORD
D: Clearly some unknown variable was a factor.
C: WASSERMAN
D: Yeah? Well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did?
C: BERRISFORD
D: Lieutenant, I'll put it in terms even a policeman can understand.
N: He smiles, shrugs the best he can in his plaster cast.
C: BERRISFORD
D: It beats the fuck out of me.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY TRACKING IN INT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: Cynthia and Alan are still in each other's arms. Cynthia pulls away.
C: ALAN
D: What's the matter?
C: CYNTHIA
D: I was just thinking about Gilda. Somehow, she knew. She kept talking about "him," but I didn't know what she meant. She said the answer was inside me. Why would she say that?
N: Alan doesn't have an answer. She sighs.
C: ALAN
D: Let's go.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You go down. I'll be out in a minute. I just want to... bury some memories.
C: ALAN
D: You sure?
N: She nods. He goes. Cynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated structure and turns down the stairs. She stands at the top of what remains of the stairs. We FOLLOW HER DOWN. Just as she nears the bottom, the TICKING of a clock is audible. It gets LOUDER. Cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into
S: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
N: We FOLLOW HER with a CONTINUOUS PAN. The foyer is new now, completely untouched by fire, just as it was at the beginning of the film. A candelabrum is lit. Cynthia turns and we PAN BACK TO THE STAIRCASE. It is new, unburnt. Two KIDS come scrambling down the stairs laughing. The entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene. CYNTHIA peers into the kitchen. Two WOMEN in work aprons are kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables. They smile at Cynthia. WOMAN 1 Cynthia! Are you staying for supper? Cynthia is silent, wide-eyed, taking it all in. She turns towards the front door. Victor is coming in.
C: VICTOR
D: Cynthia. It's good. Come in.
N: She in unable to resist.
S: INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
N: They walk in. The room is filled with people. There is a fire in the hearth. Children play. Candles illuminate the space. Unity Members smile and great her casually as she passes them. Miriam in talking with a BEARDED MAN intently.
C: MIRIAM
D: Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here.
N: Ed and Connie are by the fireplace with some others. They smile at Cynthia knowingly. Lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children. Ralph is crouched with victor in a corner. They are laughing warmly. Gilda comes up to her. She is ebullient, happier, healthier looking than we've ever seen her.
C: GILDA
D: Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly.
N: Cynthia nears Harris. He smiles at her and kisses her. Everyone in the room turns to her. Harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. Cynthia doesn't see it yet. He puts the pointed tip against her chest.
C: HARRIS
D: It's time, Cynthia. It's finally time, isn't it?
C: EVERYONE
D: Yes.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You don't exist.
E: fighting the vision
C: HARRIS
D: I wouldn't say that. Go on. Take the knife.
E: he touches her
N: She can't escape his gaze.
C: HARRIS
D: Do it. You know you want to.
E: CONT'D
C: GILDA
D: You know you do, Cynthia.
C: VICTOR
D: You'll see how beautiful it is.
C: SOMEONE ELSE
D: You will.
N: Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes.
C: MIRIAM
D: Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you.
C: HARRIS
D: Beautiful lovechild. All will be in balance when you've joined us. All will be right when daughter is with father.
C: SOMEONE
D: You're special, Cynthia.
C: SOMEONE ELSE
D: Scared blood... daughter of the father.
N: Cynthia in mortified.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I'm...?
C: HARRIS
D: Now you remember.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Yes...
C: HARRIS
D: My own beautiful lovechild. Everyone has proven their love to me. Now you must.
N: She is weak now. She is about to do it. Her grasp tightens around the knife handle. She's trembling. She takes a deep breath.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No!
N: She jams the knife into Harris' throat and pulls it out.
C: CYNTHIA
D: No I don't! I don't love you! I don't need you!
E: CONT'D
N: She is crazed. She flies around the room brandishing the knife at everyone. They back off.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I never loved any of you! I hate you! I hate you all! What you did was wrong!
E: CONT'D
N: She swats the knife at them all. Victor's arm gets cut. Gilda has to dive away from her. Cynthia is knocking over lamps and chairs in her rage. She is crying hysterically.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It was WRONG! It was stupid!
E: CONT'D
C: HARRIS
D: Oh, Cynthia.
E: saddened
C: CYNTHIA
D: I never needed you! Any of you!
N: We are TIGHT ON CYNTHIA. She is winding down, crying with her face buried in her arms.
C: CYNTHIA
D: I never did...
E: CONT'D
N: She is still. Gradually, the silence fills with a quiet BREEZE.
C: ALAN
D: Cynthia?
N: She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded. The floor is a charred mass. Cynthia turns around. Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty, skeletal self, blackened and silent. Cynthia is trembling. She walks out of the room.
C: ALAN
D: Are you all right?
E: CONT'D
C: CYNTHIA
D: Let's go.
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: She stands on the porch, holding onto a post, trying to calm herself. Alan comes out. As he starts the car, a gust comes up. The trees are thrashed around. The WIND ECHOES through the house. MUSIC UP SOFTLY, EERILY. Cynthia descends the stairs. The station wagon pulls up. She gets inside.
S: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
N: They pull out. Slowly we see Cynthia collect herself. A sense of hope is evident.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It's going to be okay. I'm going to be okay.
S: EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: The car speeds off trailing dust. We see the UNITY HOUSE in the distance. The winds kicks up again.
S: EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: We are CLOSER. Branches and leaves are being tossed around by violent gusts as we MOVE TOWARD the structure. A teenage GIRL comes running up from the field behind. She is crying. She runs into the house. We FOLLOW HER.
S: INT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY
N: She goes to a far corner and cries some more, angrily, hopelessly.
C: BOY
D: Come on, where are you? I hope you're not in that house... You always got like this and make stupid threats that you don't mean!
E: far off
N: The girl peeks out the corner of the window. ANGLE - The TEENAGE BOY is in the field beyond.
C: BOY
D: If you're not here on three, I'm history. Permanently. One... Two... Three! Fine. Good riddance.
E: CONT'D
N: THE GIRL backs away from the window, only more upset now. A hand touches her shoulder. She whirls around.
C: GIRL
D: Who are you?
E: startled
C: HARRIS
D: A friend. You're upset.
N: She nods.
C: HARRIS
D: What would you say if I could promise you eternal bliss?
E: CONT'D
C: GIRL
D: Eternal bliss? What do you mean?
N: TRACKING IN on the old knife an the floor. It begins to transform from its rusty and corroded state into a new and shiny knife. MUSIC UP. A burned, skeletal hand reaches INTO FRAME and takes it.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: THE END
