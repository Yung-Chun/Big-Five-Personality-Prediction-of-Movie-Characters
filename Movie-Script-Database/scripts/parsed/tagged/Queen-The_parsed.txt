M: ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE
N: It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations, black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls. Everyone, that is, except the people that live in...
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
N: The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world. The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters on the roof.
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM DAY
N: We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the corner..
C: COMMENTARY
D: ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.."
N: QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many Charities of which she is patron)..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?
N: ARTIST (proudly dabbing palette) Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they opened. First in line. Seven o'clock. COMMENTARY If he wins, he'll be the youngest Prime Minister in almost two hundred years.." He straightens..
C: ARTIST
D: And I don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Not a moderniser, then?
C: ARTIST
D: Certainly not. We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is.
C: TV COMMENTARY
D: "The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?"
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hmm.
N: The QUEEN watches as he paints..
C: ELIZABETH
D: I rather envy you being able to vote. Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. But the sheer joy of being partial.
E: a beat a beat
C: ARTIST
D: Yes..
N: The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass..
C: ARTIST
D: One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote.
C: ELIZABETH
D: No.
C: ARTIST
D: Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. But it IS your Government.
E: a beat
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yes.
N: The QUEEN raises her eyebrow..
C: ELIZABETH
D: I suppose that is some consolation.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am. Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something else.. The stirring sound of bagpipes..
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - DAY
N: The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes. t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up wherever she is - anywhere in the world.
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey tea and the newspapers.
C: MAID
D: G'morning, Ma'am.
N: The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table.
C: DRESSER
D: Shall I draw the curtains?
N: The QUEEN's sleepy voice answers..`Please'. The DRESSER goes to the window.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Did you stay up?
E: O.S
C: DRESSER
D: Yes, Ma'am.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And? Was it as expected..?
E: O.S
N: The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the newspapers. She puts on her glasses.
C: RESSER
D: Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.
N: The QUEEN's expression changes..
C: ELIZABETH
D: I see.
N: She lifts the newspaper up. The front page comes into sharp focus. FULL FRAME: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new Prime Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it were. Headlines tell us.. "IT'S BLAIR!", "LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR BLAIR".
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
N: The QUEEN sits at breakfast. Reading the newspapers. Dogs under the table. A knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN, (40's), her deputy Private Secretary, pops around..
C: JANVRIN
D: The Prime Minister is on his way, Ma'am.
C: ELIZABETH
D: To BE, Robin. Prime Minister to BE.
E: correcting, terse
N: The QUEEN frostily flicks a page, without looking up.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) He hasn't asked my permission yet.
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace. It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded mirrors. Portraits on the walls..
C: ELIZABETH
D: He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
C: JANVRIN
D: Yes. On the one hand his background is quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Well, we'll try not to hold that against him.
C: JANVRIN
D: On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do you think?
C: JANVRIN
D: I wouldn't put it past him. He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as `shallow'.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my sister.
C: JANVRIN
D: And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms. At the Prime Minister's insistence.
E: a beat
C: ELIZABETH
D: What? As in `Call me Tony?'
C: JANVRIN
D: Yes.
N: The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Have we sent him a protocol sheet?
E: a beat
S: EXT. MALL - DAY
N: ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: as TONY BLAIR's motorcade drives down the MALL.
S: EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
N: The motorcade sweeps into the grand, inner quadrangle of Buckingham Palace, and stops at the King's door.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Three secret service BODYGUARDS leap out and open the car doors. TONY looks out at the palace..
C: TONY
D: Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
C: HERIE
D: hy? You've met her often enough before.
C: TONY
D: I know. But never one to one. And never as Prime Minister.
C: CHERIE
D: Remember, you're a man that's just been elected by the whole country.
C: TONY
D: Yes. But she's still, y'know..
N: TONY looks up at the vast palace in front of him..
C: TONY
D: The Queen.
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE - DAY
N: A uniformed EQUERRY leads TONY and CHERIE through corridors, and up a grand staircase..
C: EQUERRY
D: When we reach the audience room, I will knock. We will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside. Standing by the door, we bow. From the neck. I will introduce you. The Queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her hand.
N: TONY shoots his cuffs, `Right', clears his throat. QUERRY (cont'd) Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am' as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.
C: TONY
D: Yes..
C: EQUERRY
D: And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back.
C: TONY
D: The `Presence'?
C: EQUERRY
D: Yes, Sir. That's what it's called, when you're in her Majesty's company.
N: TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers down her throat. TONY smiles back.. The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without waiting for a reply, he enters.. CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a liveried FOOTMAN. He stares back. No life behind his eyes. CHERIE takes a seat on a chair. Eyes widen to herself.
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY
N: TONY and the EQUERRY enter, and gently bow their heads. The EQUERRY then straightens, and announces..
C: EQUERRY
D: Mr Blair, your Majesty.
N: The QUEEN extends her hand. TONY walks forward, and shakes it. The EQUERRY leaves. The door is then closed.
C: ELIZABETH
D: ongratulations.
C: TONY
D: Thank you, Ma'am.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Your children must be very proud.
C: TONY
D: I hope so.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You've three, haven't you?
C: TONY
D: That's right.
C: ELIZABETH
D: How lovely. Such a blessing. Children.
N: The QUEEN and TONY take their seats..
C: ELIZABETH
D: So..Have we shown you how to start a nuclear war yet?
C: TONY
D: No.
E: thrown
C: ELIZABETH
D: First thing we do, I believe. a beat) Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world.
C: TONY
D: You obviously know my job better than I do.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister, Mr Blair. I'd like to think there weren't too many surprises left. My first was Winston Churchill. He sat in your chair, in frock coat and top hat, and was kind enough to give a shy young girl like me quite an education.
C: TONY
D: I can imagine.
C: ELIZABETH
D: ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility. To advise, guide and warn the government of the day.
E: a pointed addition
C: TONY
D: Advice which I look forward to receiving.
C: ELIZABETH
D: ell, we will save that for our weekly meetings. a beat) Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..
N: TONY stares, then clicks..
C: TONY
D: Of course..
N: He falls, rather extravagantly, on bended knee. The supplicant position of deference...
C: TONY
D: Your Majesty, the country has spoken...and I come now to ask your permiss.. E
C: ELIZABETH
D: No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask the questions.
E: interjecting
N: TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.
N: TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Generally, this is where you say `yes.'
C: TONY
D: `Yes'.
N: The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens a door, and CHERIE is invited inside. ELIZABETH (cont'd) How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair. HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) You must be very proud.
C: HERIE
D: Yes.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And exhausted, I imagine. Where will you be spending the summer?
C: CHERIE
D: France.
C: ELIZABETH
D: How lovely.
C: TONY
D: ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful place.
N: The QUEEN indicates a portrait of QUEEN VICTORIA..
C: ELIZABETH
D: My great, great grandmother said of it - "In Balmoral all seems to breathe freedom and peace and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils."
N: t that moment, the doors open, and JANVRIN enters, and whispers urgently in the QUEEN's ear. The QUEEN's face changes as she listens. ELIZABETH (cont'd) Really..? Her expression changes. She frostily turns to the BLAIRS.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. With that the QUEEN shakes TONY's hand. TONY and CHERIE awkwardly back out of the royal presence, leaving The QUEEN and JANVRIN.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Not too short, was it? I gave him fifteen minutes. One doesn't want to be rude.
E: a beat
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

C: CHERIE

E: ON TV MORE
N: SPENCER(cont'd) But even I could not imagine that they would take such a direct hand in her death as seems to be the case. It would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative photographs of her has blood on his hands today...

D: I don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet?

E: ON TV
N: PRINCE PHILIP shakes his head..
C: PRINCE PHILIP

C: ELIZABETH
D: Is it?
N: Her knuckles momentarily whiten. Unaware, PHILIP stares at the television..

D: A bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded...nutters.
C: TONY
D: That's just absurd.

C: CHERIE
D: Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. They don't pay tax.
C: TONY
D: Yes, they do.
C: CHERIE
D: The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty, forty million a year..

N: TONY heads for the door..
C: HERIE
D: It's not a mother thing, is it?
N: TONY turns..
C: CHERIE
D: Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well c'mon..? Who does THAT sound like?

C: PRINCE PHILIP
D: No, we'll be all right.

N: HILIP turns, an exasperated look..
C: PRINCE PHILIP
D: About WHAT?
C: ELIZABETH
D: The flag above Buckingham Palace. He thinks it should be flying at half- mast.
N: The DOGS continue to P whimper hungrily.
C: RINCE PHILIP
D: Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T a flag above Buckingham Palace... ...only the Royal Standard, which flies for one reason only.
E: angrily jabs coals with a long, sharp fork MORE
N: PRINCE PHILIP(cont'd) To denote the presence of the Monarch. Since you're here, the flag pole is bare. Which is as it should be. HARLES clears his throat..
C: CHARLES
D: Isn't it possible..that to some people...the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal.
N: The QUEEN turns. A withering look..
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's not the point.
C: RINCE PHILIP
D: The point is it's more than four hundred years old. It has never been lowered for ANYONE..
C: QUEEN MOTHER
D: Your grandfather didn't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she wouldn't get it either.
C: CHARLES

You don't get dictated to. a beat) You've conceded the idea of a public funeral. You've opened up the parks. That's ENOUGH.
N: The QUEEN indicates to PHILIP to keep his voice down, to avoid upsetting the BOYS, who are still fishing.. PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) You wait. In forty-eight hours it was all have calmed down.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Like those condolence books.
C: PRINCE PHILIP
D: Quite right. When we started with one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we've heard nothing more about that, see?

C: HARLES
D: In one sense its comforting. a beat) For the first time my parents can see what it's been like for me all these years, being up against her popularity. But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public. But it's not. The two Dianas, theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all.
E: a beat
N: CHARLES looks at LAMPORT.. CHARLES (cont'd) They just adored her. Would have loved nothing more than for her to be Queen. a beat) Someone compassionate. With a heart. Gifts in tragically short supply around here. HARLES looks at LAMPORT..

C: TONY
D: That's just the papers spoiling for a fight.
E: irritated gesture
C: CHERIE
D: But still, imagine this country without them? With a nice elected Head of State? a beat) That'd be some legacy. If the revolution were to happen on your watch.

N: The QUEEN looks at her desk. Most of the newspapers are strewn out in front of her..
C: ELIZABETH
D: We've managed to look at one or two, yes.
C: TONY
D: In which case, my next question would be - whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary?
N: ELIZABETH (cont'd) No. I believe a few over-eager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers..and it would be a mistake to dance to their tune.
C: TONY
D: Under normal circumstances I would agree, but..P
C: RINCE PHILIP
D: Here we go! The bloody flag again..!

N: PRINCE PHILIP almost has an apoplexy..
C: PRINCE PHILIP
D: See!
C: TONY
D: And coming down to London at the earliest opportunity.
N: PHILIP stares in disbelief.."What?"
C: TONY
D: It would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their grief.
C: ELIZABETH
D: THEIR grief?
N: he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP..
C: ELIZABETH
D: If you're suggesting that I drop everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're mistaken.
C: RINCE PHILIP
D: Absurd.. E
C: ELIZABETH
D: I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. a beat) That's the way we do things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. It's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.

E: searches for right words
C: TONY
D: I think we should leave God out of it. It's just not helpful.
C: JANVRIN
D: She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication. a beat)
E: MORE
N: JANVRIN(cont'd) And I cannot emphasise enough what affect that had on her. Unexpectedly becoming King as good as killed her father.

S: EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
N: The QUEEN reaches the River Dee, then slows down. She stops and stares. Ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous crossing. he QUEEN composes herself, visibly intimidated. A deep breath, then.. She drives into the fast-moving river.
S: EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
N: The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side to side as it slowly crosses the river. One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience.. But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen.. `Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The ugly sound of tearing metal. he QUEEN instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator. The engine roars in protest, and.. `Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh..
N: The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, you are stupid.
N: She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter what she does, the Land Rover is stuck.. The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile telephone. he QUEEN punches in a number..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hello? Could you put me through to the Ghillies' office? listens) ello, Thomas? I'm afraid I've done something very foolish. I think I've broken the prop-shaft. Crossing the river.

S: EXT. HIGHLANDS - RIVER DEE - DAY
N: The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet.
S: EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
N: The QUEEN sits on a stone by the stranded Land Rover. She sits in silence.. othing but the sound of running water, wind in the trees, and birdsong. Ah, that's good. he QUEEN closes her eyes. All around her, silence except for the sounds of the great outdoors. Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit much. o time to think. ne shock after another. veryone shouting. ll far too dramatic. ome to think of it, this is the first time she's been able to.. Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are shaking. Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying. e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes. Gradually, she composes herself. That's better. on't want to make a fuss. he GILLIES will be here soon. The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better. resently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable sense that she is being watched. Strange.. The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup.. Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the STAG. The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have imagined. His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive. He is vast, almost the size of a horse. nd staring at her. The QUEEN stares back.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, you are a beauty.
N: It is unprecedented - almost supernatural. No STAG ever willingly comes this close to humans. he QUEEN looks into his dark, brown eyes. An unmistakable connection between them.. It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind, the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the distance.. The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to look for the QUEEN. Sensing this.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) (indicating the STAG should go) Go. Go on. You'd better go.. The STAG remains rooted to the spot.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) (claps hands) Go. Shoo. Go on. The ENGINES get closer and closer. The STAG takes a last look at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and walks off. o sooner has he disappeared into the woods, than.. Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety.. The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself. e's vanished. It's as if he was never there.

D: I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather.
N: ilence.
C: TONY
D: I imagine those occasions are quite difficult. Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private audience..
N: Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then..
C: TONY
D: Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies..
N: The QUEEN looks up..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Whatever for?
C: TONY
D: In case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Not at all.
N: beat.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer.
C: TONY
D: The circumstances were exceptional, Ma'am. And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility. E
C: ELIZABETH
D: ou're confusing humility with humiliation.
C: TONY
D: That's not true.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday.
C: TONY
D: I still believe History will show it was a good week for you.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And an even better one for you, Mr Blair.
C: TONY
D: But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century.
N: The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..
C: TONY
D: And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Really?
C: ELIZABETH
D: You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for..
N: She wants to say `Me', but instead says..
C: ELIZABETH
D: ..this institution has been diminished?
C: TONY
D: Not at all.
N: pause..
C: ELIZABETH
D: I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..
C: TONY
D: One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. a beat) I could never have added my voice to the chorus.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You're very kind.
N: The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow..
C: ELIZABETH
D: But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason.
C: TONY
D: Which is?
C: ELIZABETH
D: That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has.
N: TONY looks up..
C: ELIZABETH
D: If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. Just look at the French.
E: a beat
N: The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses.. E ELIZABETH (cont'd) I suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand.. The QUEEN looks out of the window. Notices how the sun is setting.. ELIZABETH (cont'd) I do love this time of day. Shall we walk while there's still some sunshine left? I do hope you're a walker.
C: TONY
D: I am.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Good. The clocks go back next week, then it'll be dark by five.
N: TONY and the QUEEN get to their feet. ELIZABETH (cont'd) I always think these meetings stand a better chance of succeeding if the Prime Minister is a walker. FOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the Audience Room, and into..
S: INT. CORRIDOR - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
N: BLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a corridor from the audience room...
C: ELIZABETH
D: As a matter of fact, it's how I think best. On my feet. I've never been one for sitting around endlessly. A good walk and fresh air sorts everything out..
N: Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been holding something back..
C: ELIZABETH
D: One in four, you said? Wanted to get rid of me? T
C: TONY
D: For about half an hour. But then you came down to London and all that went away.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I've never been hated like that before.
C: TONY
D: No. And that must have been difficult.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It was. Very.
N: They begin walking again..
C: ELIZABETH
D: Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly I believed that's what people wanted from their Queen. Not to make a fuss nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve, duty first... self second.
N: The QUEEN stops..
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's how I was brought up. It's all I've ever known
C: TONY
D: One forgets. You were so young when you became Queen.
N: The QUEEN drifts off..
C: ELIZABETH
D: I was. A girl.
N: Then pulls herself back..
C: ELIZABETH
D: But I can see the world has changed. And one must 'modernise'.
C: TONY
D: Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Don't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister, I think you'll find that I'm supposed to be advising YOU!
E: with a twinkle as they set off
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND STAIRCASE - DAY
N: The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow. The QUEEN smiles..
S: INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
N: FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens. The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..
C: ELIZABETH
D: So...what might we expect in your first Parliament?
N: TONY clears his throat, then..
C: TONY
D: Well, Ma'am, top of the list is education reform. We want to radically reduce classroom sizes...
N: Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance... Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints. The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long forgotten..
T: FADE TO BLACK:
