E: back in accent
C: OLIVER
D: Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.
C: OLIVER
D: I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"
C: OLIVER
D: That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: "Why are you at a party if you're sad?" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.
N: 10/29/07 17.

C: HAL
D: Oh, hey what's that?
C: ANDY
D: Now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape. Oliver can't believe it.
C: HAL
D: That's a great idea.
C: ANDY
D: Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show you how. Hal's still heading to the sink.
C: HAL

D: No.
N: 10/29/07 55.
C: ANDY
D: I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. You know, they're a threat. Oliver's blown away by the logic.
C: OLIVER
D: I don't know Andy.
C: ANDY
D: I didn't want you to feel threatened, I don't want to have sex with you. What I do, most people wouldn't even call it sex. Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.
