D: Shit. Really?
C: TERRY
D: What the hell does that mean?
C: VIGMAN

C: MIKE
D: Well I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.
C: CINDY
D: I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea.
C: MIKE
D: I understand that, Cindy. But you haven't seen Leo in a long time and he's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here.
C: ELEANOR
D: She is the presumed Guardian, Mr Flaherty.
C: MIKE
D: I understand that.
C: ELEANOR
D: And we do hope to avoid litigation.
C: MIKE
D: So do I and I'm sure we can. Now, I'm sorry, but I actually have to go see a client so we'll have to set up another time to discuss this.
C: CINDY
D: Kyle's still coming to see me today, right?

C: MIKE
D: I just can't go back in front of Judge Lee, it won't look good, trust me.
C: TERRY
D: So maybe you'll get a different judge.
C: MIKE
D: She's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now, I'm screwed. I'll have to close my fricking doors.
