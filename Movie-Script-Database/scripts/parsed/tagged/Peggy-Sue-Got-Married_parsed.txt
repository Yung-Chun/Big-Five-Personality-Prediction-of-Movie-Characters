C: GILFOND
D: ...What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone  that when we go out too far we're vulnerable. The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero.

D: Choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make. It will often determine your child's attitude towards education and schooling. Of course, the lessons learned are primarily social  sharing, being considerate of others. And they're so cute when they're little. They bring you back their Little masterpieces every day and you put 'em on the refrigerator door. They're so proud, and their names are all misspelled. Scott would always print his S backwards, and Beth would make her sweet little flowers...
E: proud of herself remembering
N: Peggy wipes away a tear. At the stunned reaction of the class and Miss Otto.
S: EXT. PLAYING' FIELD
N: The baseball team practices. Michael Fitzsimmons runs laps with the track team. One lone boy kicks a soccer ball. CLOSE - A BATON TWIRLING IN THE AIR WIDEN to INCLUDE the baton spinning down, falling into the hands of a uniformed majorette who deftly passes it through her legs and twirls it back into the air. Another baton  it rises, spinning awkwardly and falls through Peggy's hands onto the ground. Six MAJORETTES in uniform are practicing. Dolores is one of them.
C: DOLORES
D: What a girl. What a twirl. You know, PegLeggy, you're gonna get demoted to hall monitor -
E: to Peggy
C: HEAD MAJORETTE
D: Come on, Peggy Sue.. Try it again. You haven't been practicing.
N: Peggy gamely tries it again and manages at least to catch the baton and continue twirling. She continues, enjoying herself. Michael runs by, the lonely long distance runner.
S: EXT. PLAYING FIELD  LATER
N: The group of majorettes heads toward the school. Peggy sees Charlie leaning against the car, waving her over.
C: CHARLIE
D: Looking good out there.
C: PEGGY
D: Thanks.
C: CHARLIE
D: I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
C: PEGGY
D: I thought it had a lot of merit.
C: CHARLIE
D: In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
C: PEGGY
D: Rejected, worthless, miserable.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah. Like that.
C: PEGGY
D: Good.
N: Peggy turns, and walks away. Charlie looks miserable.
S: INT. PHYSICS LAB
N: Peggy enters and approaches Richard. He is too engrossed constructing an elaborate kite to notice her.
C: PEGGY
D: What a great kite.
C: RICHARD
D: I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
C: PEGGY
D: I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible?
E: beat
C: RICHARD
D: Are you doing some kind of science project?
C: PEGGY
D: Sort of.
C: RICHARD
D: Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
N: Peggy hasn't understood a word.
C: RICHARD
D: And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
C: PEGGY
D: What's that?
C: RICHARD
D: That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
C: PEGGY
D: I know what a burrito is.
C: RICHARD
D: Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
C: PEGGY
D: What's inside?
C: RICHARD
D: You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
C: PEGGY
D: So you think time travel is possible? For people?
C: RICHARD
D: Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
C: PEGGY
D: Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
C: RICHARD
D: Okay. I promise.
C: PEGGY
D: This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
C: RICHARD
D: You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
C: PEGGY.
D: No. Really. You're the smartest person I know. It sounds unbelievable. But I can prove it.
C: RICHARD
D: Oh yeah?
C: PEGGY
D: You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
C: RICHARD
D: How, did you know about my grandfather?
C: PEGGY
D: Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
C: RICHARD
D: Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
S: EXT. STREET
N: Peggy and Richard are walking, carrying their books.
C: RICHARD
D: But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
C: PEGGY
D: I don't know.
N: Oblivious, Peggy and Richard walk by Shower's Cafe. Inside, Dolores and Carol see them.
S: EXT. ANOTHER STREET  APPROACHING RICHARD'S HOUSE
C: RICHARD
D: I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
C: PEGGY
D: That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
E: beat
S: EXT. RICHARD'S DRIVEWAY
C: RICHARD
D: You look pretty good for a corpse.
C: PEGGY
D: Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
C: RICHARD
D: You're giving me the creeps.
C: PEGGY
D: Am I dead or not?
C: RICHARD
D: There's one way to find out.
N: Richard stops and throws down his books. He steps in front of Peggy, throwing down her books, dragging her to the curb.
C: PEGGY
D: What're you doing?
C: RICHARD
D: Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
N: A large truck speeds towards them.
C: RICHARD
D: Step in front of the truck! If you're dead, it won't matter. The truck'll go right through you. Go ahead! You're dead!
N: Peggy takes one step off the curb. The truck is getting closer. The truck BLOWS A LOUD SUSTAINED WAIL.
C: PEGGY
D: No! I don't want to die!
S: INT. RICHARD'S GARAGE
N: A completely outfitted laboratory, kites decorate the walls.
C: RICHARD
D: Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
C: PEGGY
D: What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
C: RI CHARD
D: Einstein said "God doesn't play dice with the universe." I'm a scientist. I believe that there's an order to things. Why would God bring you back as a high school girl?
C: PEGGY
D: I don't know.
C: RICHARD
D: You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
C: PEGGY
D: I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
C: RICHARD
D: All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
E: heads out the door
C: RICHARD
D: What if you're not here tomorrow?
S: INT. KELCHER HALLWAY
N: Peggy comes home, enters hallway.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: This necklace is sapphire, it was my Grandmother's.
E: O.S.
N: Peggy Looks into the living room. PEGGY'S POV: Her mother is sitting on the sofa with a strange MAN in a suit. She's served him tea. There are several, pieces of old jewelry spread on a cloth on the coffee table. The man is examining one of the pieces. Mrs. Kelcher seems surprised that Peggy's home from school. Peggy moves on into the kitchen.
S: INT. KELCHER KITCHEN
N: Peggy hears her mother let the man out. She enters the kitchen.
C: PEGGY
D: Who was that man?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
C: PEGGY
D: It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
N: The TELEPHONE RINGS.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Would you get that, dear?
C: PEGGY
D: Sure, Mom. Hello.
E: picking up the phone
N: Peggy gasps. Mrs. Kelcher turns to her.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
C: PEGGY
D: It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.
E: shaken into phone
N: Peggy hands the receiver to her mother and runs out of the room sobbing. Her first confrontation with mortality.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Peggy climbs the stairs, in tears.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Peggy Sue! What is it?
E: O.S.
N: Forcing herself to regain her composure, she sits down at the top of the landing as Mrs. Kelcher joins her.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: What happened to you?
C: PEGGY
D: I had a dream that Grandma died.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
C: PEGGY
D: She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
E: beat
C: PEGGY
D: I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
N: Two beats.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
C: PEGGY
D: What do you mean?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.
E: Peggy's jaw drops
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT
N: Charlie pulls up to the curb, opens the glove compartment, extracts a can of Old Spice aerosol, sprays the seat; and exits his car, throwing a kiss to it as he walks up to the door. CLOSER VIEW He's wearing a hideous orange and turquoise sweater.
S: INT. KELCHER HOUSE  HALLWAY
N: Mr. Kelcher opens the door, Charlie enters.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Hello, Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
N: CAMERA TRACKS Charlie and Mr. Kelcher into the living room. Mr. Kelcher sits on his recliner, Charlie, nervous, on the couch. Nancy is on the rug, studying.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately.
C: NANCY
D: She's distorted.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, sir.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
C: NANCY
D: She's almost a juvenile delinquent.
N: Mr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door. Without her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and makes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to laugh. Nancy continues to clown.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
N: Mr. Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of teenage weirdness.
S: INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM
N: Peggy is changing a record. She sees the dress she was wearing the day before (and at the reunion) slung across a chair. As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out. Peggy picks it up, excited. INSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR SPARE TIME. Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and slowly draws out two joints. She stares at them for a beat.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh, Beth.
E: worrying
N: There's a knock at the door. Peggy quickly hides the joints. Mrs. Kelcher opens the door.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
C: PEGGY
D: For what?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Maddy's party.
C: PEGGY
D: I don't feel very festive.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
N: Peggy laughs.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Enjoy yourself! This is the best time of your life. And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better. Get dressed.
N: Mrs. Kelcher closes the door.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
C: MR. KELCHER
D: We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
C: CHARLIE
D: What would that be, sir?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
C: CHARLIE
D: Of course.
E: surprised
N: ANGLE ON PEGGY walking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking.
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Peggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car. Peggy's holding a pan of Rice Krispie squares. Charlie slips Peggy's sweater back on her shoulder. He's trying hard to make up.
C: PEGGY
D: Where did you get that sweater?
C: CHARLIE
D: Great, isn't it?
C: PEGGY
D: It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
C: PEGGY
D: Right. I promised my mother.
S: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR  NIGHT - DRIVING
C: CHARLIE
D: Is this slow enough for you?
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, how are you?
E: serious
C: CHARLIE
D: I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
C: PEGGY
D: Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
N: Charlie looks thoughtful, then guns the engine.
C: CHARLIE
D: It's great. I cleaned the car, do you like it? Oh, I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday, you like him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is half of thirty six. It's "Gentlemen start your engines", vroom, like I'm gassed up ready for the race. I've got the girl, I've got the car, I've got the talent, but I don't know. Do I date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college? I got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose. But it's different for a girl. You're Lucky. You just have to wait for me.
S: INT. MADDY'S HOUSE  BASEMENT
N: Thirty kids are dancing, talking, snacking. One couple makes out. Walter, Leon, Terry and Doug Snell are crowded around a TV, watching an old western with Eugene Pallette or Edgar Buchanan. The boys laugh as Pallette or Buchanan growls a western cliche.
C: DOUG
D: Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn it, dad blame it.

S: INT. MADDY'S HOUSE  BASEMENT
N: Arthur and a few others stand by the bar, where bottles of Coke are lined up. Arthur carefully pours rum from a hip flask directly into the bottles. Peggy and Charlie enter.
C: LEON
D: Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
C: CHARLIE
D: Have no fear. Charlie's here.
C: WALTER
D: Oh, it's you is it.
C: TERRY
D: Jumping Jehosophat!
C: DOUG
D: It's a miracle!
C: PEGGY
D: Hi, guys.
C: ARTHUR
D: Now that's a purty little heifer.
C: CHARLIE
D: Why Pete's the best darn cook on the Panhandle!
C: PEGGY
D: Why I oughta!
N: The boys all crack up. THE PARTY  LATER Walter, Leon, Charlie and Terry crowd around Arthur who has an open, widemouthed bottle of beer in his hand.
C: CHARLIE
D: Ready. Set. Go -
N: Arthur rapidly chugalugs the entire beer and immediately recites from memory as the boys urge him on:
C: ARTHUR
D: HiYo Silver! A cloud of dust, a galloping horse with the speed of light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the Plains came to Earth with powers- and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear - from out of the...

D: I hate it when the beer comes out my nose.
E: foaming at the nose
N: ANOTHER AREA Peggy, Carol and Maddy bemusedly watching the boys.
C: MADDY
D: Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
C: CAROL
D: Why do guys do such stupid things?
C: PEGGY
D: You know, I never could figure that one out.
S: INT. BASEMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE
N: Maddy, Arthur, Walter, Carol, Charlie and Peggy sit on a couch. Maddy and Carol sit in their boyfriends' laps. Peggy sits distractedly on the couch arm. They cross talk  boys to boys  girls to girls.
C: MADDY
D: I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids.
C: WALTER
D: The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense.
C: CAROL
D: What are your colors, going to be?
C: ARTHUR
D: I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio.
C: MADDY
D: I'm thinking of pink and green.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Dolores and Terry standing in a corner kissing passionately.
C: MADDY
D: Look at Dolores. What a tramp.
E: CONT'D.

D: Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack.
S: INT. BASEMENT  LATER

D: And now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world... Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry. The Definitions.
E: beat
N: Applause as the group enters from the furnace room. They all wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. Charlie is in the center of the group as they position themselves.
C: CHARLIE
D: One, two, three-...
N: The group begins to SING an A CAPELLA version of RAMA LAMA DING DONG (or I WONDER WHY). Charlie sings lead, backed up by the other three. Walter dances insane, Temptationlike steps. The crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. Peggy is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy.
C: CAROL
D: Charlie really has a great voice.
C: MADDY
D: Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
C: PEGGY
D: Don't get your hopes up.
C: MADDY
D: Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
N: Charlie SINGS directly to Peggy, grinning at her. In spite of herself, she smiles back at him. She's starting to realize why she fell in love with him. He's irresistible.
C: PEGGY
D: He is kind of cute, isn't he?
C: CAROL
D: Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
C: PEGGY
D: He does?
N: The group finishes the song. Charlie blows Peggy a kiss. The crowd APPLAUDS, including Peggy. Dolores joins Peggy, Carol and Maddy.
C: DOLORES
D: Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
C: PEGGY
D: First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
C: DOLORES
D: God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
C: PEGGY
D: Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
C: DOLORES
D: Are you for real?
C: PEGGY
D: Touchy, touchy!
N: Dolores storms away.
C: MADDY
D: I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it.
E: to Peggy
N: Charlie and Walter walk over and accept "BRAVOS" from the girls. Walter does his James Dean imitation.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
C: CHARLIE
D: Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
C: PEGGY
D: He's trying.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
C: PEGGY
D: Come on, let's dance.
E: charmed
C: WALTER
D: Put on some makeout music, and kill the lights.
N: We HEAR a RECORD SCRATCH. A slow song begins. The lights are dimmed. Coupler begin to slow dance. Charlie holds Peggy close, barely moving. Peggy is mistyeyed, moved by being in Charlie's arms again.
C: CHARLIE
D: There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
C: PEGGY
D: You're pretty charming when you want to be.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
N: As they dance Charlie gets embarrassed by an erection, and moves his hips away from Peggy. She surprises him by grabbing his tush and pulling him into her.
S: INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - LATER
N: MUSIC FADES INTO the song "PARTY DOLL" by Buddy Knox. Peggy is doing the Twist, showing Charlie and several others. Walter gets the hang of it, twisting on one leg. Carol tries to keep up. Maddy and Arthur are always a beat behind.
C: DOLORES
D: Hey Terry, what is that? Did Peggy make it up? I've never seen that on Bandstand.
C: TERRY
D: What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
S: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DESERTED LANE - NIGHT
N: The windows are fogged. Peggy and Charlie kiss tenderly.

D: Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you.
C: CHARLIE
D: Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
C: PEGGY
D: You really love me, don't you?
C: CHARLIE
D: You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, let's make love.
E: tentatively
C: CHARLIE
D: What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
E: nonbelieving
C: PEGGY
D: A lot's happened since last weekend.
C: CHARLIE
D: But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
C: PEGGY
D: I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
E: f1ustered beat; coyly
C: CHARLIE
D: Who?
N: Peggy starts to GIGGLE, realizing the absurdity of the situation. The more she GIGGLES, the more agitated Charlie gets. Peggy starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt.
C: PEGGY
D: You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
C: CHARLIE
D: You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
N: Charlie pushes her away, angry..
C: CHARLIE
D: What is this? What the hell is going on? One week you say, "If you love me you won't", now you say "If you love me you will". Excuse me. That's a guy's line!
E: beat
N: Peggy realizes she's blown it. Charlie isn't ready for this.
C: PEGGY
D: This is a mistake. We better forget it.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
N: Charlie straightens himself up, starts the car and burns out.
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT
N: Charlie drops her off.
C: PEGGY

N: Peggy watches him go. Looking at her darkened house, she turns and walks down the street.
S: EXT. STREET  SHOWER'S CAFE
N: Peggy peeks in the window. The kids from the party are eating and laughing. Rosalie Testa is dancing. Shaken by Rosalie, she turns away. In the distance she SEES the lights of: ART'S DONUT HOLE. OPEN 24 HOURS.
S: INT. ART'S DONUT HOLE
N: A few people linger over coffee. The waitress serving them is Monica (the same but younger woman from LOVIN' OVEN). In a corner, Michael Fitzsimmons, in a red leather jacket, sits alone, reading. He looks up to check on his motorcycle parked outside. He's splendid in his isolation. Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see Monica, who doesn't know her.
C: MONICA
D: What would you like?
C: PEGGY
D: Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines?
C: MONICA
D: Yes. Who are you?
C: PEGGY
D: Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller. How's Bobo?
E: sotto
N: Peggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut.
C: MONICA
D: Twenty cents, please.
C: PEGGY
D: You're kidding?
N: Picking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's table and sits opposite him.
C: PEGGY
D: I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
C: MICHAEL
D: Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
C: PEGGY
D: You don't?
C: MICHAEL
D: He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
E: contemptuously
C: PEGGY
D: Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
C: MICHAEL
D: A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
N: Michael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy studies him for a beat.
C: PEGGY
D: The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
C: MICHAEL
D: What're you doing here anyway?
C: PEGGY
D: Coffee and a donut.

D: That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
C: DOLORES
D: First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT  DRIVING
N: Peggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him. Her eyes closed, enjoying the wind blowing in her hair. They head out of town.
S: EXT. GAS STATION
N: Michael pumps gas. Peggy walks to the washrooms. Looking around she waits a beat, then enters the men's.
S: INT. MEN'S WASHROOM
N: With all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits.
S: EXT. GAS STATION
N: Michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building. Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales.
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD
N: They drive up to a mountain top, Peggy wearing the leather jacket. She directs Michael with one arm. The motorcycle is parked. Peggy and Michael lie on the grass, staring down at the town lights below. Michael inhales the joint, then passes it to Peggy.
C: MICHAEL
D: This is great reefer.
C: PEGGY
D: Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
E: inhales beat
C: MICHAEL
D: The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
C: PEGGY
D: What are you shooting for?
C: MICHAEL
D: Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
C: PEGGY
D: Don't you get along with your parents?
C: MICHAEL
D: The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
C: PEGGY
D: They care about you. They're just a different generation.
C: MICHAEL
D: Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
E: beat
C: PEGGY
D: I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
N: Peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins to dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the moon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over to her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her neck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies touching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her tenderly.
C: MICHAEL
D: You know, I had you pegged all wrong.
N: Michael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately.
C: MICHAEL
D: A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
C: PEGGY
D: Is that one of your poems?
C: MICHAEL
D: No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
C: PEGGY
D: I'd love to.
C: MICHAEL
D: Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
E: eyes ablaze beat sees Peggy grimace; he calms down kisses her
N: Peggy is falling for it. He fumbles with her bra straps.
C: PEGGY
D: Michael... you're as good as you looked.
N: His other hand reaches to undo her skirt.
C: MICHAEL
D: I'll respect you for eternity. 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once." I didn't write that. That's Yeats.
E: reciting tenderly beat
N: Peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost motherly.
C: PEGGY
D: I envy you. You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do. But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful.
E: beat
N: Peggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand and kisses it.
C: PEGGY
D: You know, this isn't really happening.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the entire, perfect tableau: the starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop.
S: EXT. STREET  DAWN
N: Michael stops at the corner of Peggy's street. She gets off the bike and kisses Michael goodbye. He takes off.
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE
N: Peggy walks up the path as the MILKMAN approaches.
C: MILKMAN
D: Your parents are waiting up. You know, I see a lot of this in the spring. Good luck.
C: PEGGY
D: Thanks, Ralph.
S: INT. KELCHER HOUSE
N: Peggy enters, trying to be quiet. Mr. Kelcher stands in the kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming. CAMERA TRACKS Peggy into kitchen. She grabs a cup of coffee before sitting down.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Where have you been?
C: PEGGY
D: I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Damn that Charlie I
C: PEGGY
D: It's not Charlie. It's me.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
E: nervously beat
C: PEGGY
D: At my age? Don't be silly.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Thank God for that.
C: PEGGY
D: Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
C: PEGGY
D: Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: All right. But this better be good.
C: PEGGY
D: I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
C: PEGGY
D: I think they're going to deregulate it.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
C: PEGGY
D: Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Evelyn, take her to her room!
N: Peggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: I'm not the maid!
C: PEGGY
D: Way to go, Mom!
N: The Kelchers glare at each other~. We HEAR the DOOR SLAM.
S: INT. SHOWER'S CAFE  DAY
N: Peggy and Richard sit in a booth. Richard's kite is hung on a coat rack.
C: RICHARD
D: The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
C: RICHARD
D: But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
C: PEGGY
D: I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
C: RICHARD
D: I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
C: PEGGY
D: Richard, take it easy.
C: RICHARD
D: No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
C: PEGGY
D: How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
C: RICHARD
D: I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
C: PEGGY
D: Give me some credit, will you?
C: RICHARD
D: Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
C: PEGGY
D: Wbat're you talking about?
C: RICHARD
D: Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
C: PEGGY
D: Sixtyforty.
C: RI CHARD
D: That's not fair.
C: PEGGY
D: Okay, find yourself another vision.
C: RICHARD
D: You're taking advantage of a minor.
C: PEGGY
D: When do we start?
N: A WAITRESS approaches their table.
C: WAITRESS
D: Do you know what you want?
C: RICHARD
D: A Ton on a Bun, with fries.
C: WAITRESS
D: And you?
C: PEGGY
D: Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET
N: The street is filled with Saturday shoppers. Peggy holds the kite, Richard takes notes as they windowshop. They stop in front of a dry cleaners.
C: PEGGY
D: Dry cleaners. No real change. Just higher prices.
N: They move next door to a shoe store.
C: PEGGY
D: Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
C: RICHARD
D: Come on. You can't be serious.
C: PEGGY
D: There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
C: RICHARD
D: Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
C: PEGGY
D: Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
N: They move along to the next window, an appliance store. The window is filled with old televisions, record players, large rotisseriebroilers, etc. The store sign reads: BODELL'S TV AND APPLIANCES. Another sign reads: COME IN AND LISTEN TO STEREOPHONIC SOUND.
C: PEGGY
D: Look at that stuff. It's like the dark ages. This is more your speed. And boy, do I know this business.
N: Peggy peers into the store again and catches a g1impse of Charlie serving a customer.
S: EXT. STREET  BUS STOP
N: Peggy and Richard sit on the bench next to TWO OLD. LADIES. Richard reads from his list.
C: RICHARD
D: Let's see... icrowavemays, ocketpay alculatorcays...
E: looking around
N: The two ladies react.
C: PEGGY
D: You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
C: RICHARD
D: All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh. And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
N: Peggy looks up and sees a lingerie store across the street. She heads towards it, calling:
C: PEGGY
D: I'll be right back.
N: Peggy enters the Lingerie store. After a beat, Peggy emerges from the store, excited and empty handed. Dodging traffic, she hurries back to Richard.
C: PEGGY
D: Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
C: RICHARD
D: What are you talking about?
C: PEGGY
D: The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
C: RICHARD
D: High tech. I like the sound of that.
S: EXT. APPLIANCE STORE  DUSK
N: At the back is a small record department, complete with a listening booth. Charlie is waiting on a customer. Peggy enters. CHARLIE'S FATHER is waiting on a buxom YOUNG WOMAN, his arm around her shoulder. He turns around as she enters. She has a shock of recognition.
C: MR. BODELL
D: Look at that freezer chest. What capacity. Hello Peggy Sue.
E: to young woman to Peggy, embarrassed
C: PEGGY
D: Woody! How ya doing?
C: MR. BODELL
D: Fine, just fine.
N: Peggy gives him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.
C: PEGGY
D: Nice to see you.
C: MR. BODELL
D: Charlie's in the back.
N: Peggy walks towards the back as Mr. Bodell explains:
C: MR. BODELL
D: My future daughterinlaw. Very affectionate girl.
S: INT. RECORD DEPT.  APPLIANCE STORE
N: Charlie talks to on ELDERLY GENTLEMAN.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: I'll just take the Ravel.
C: CHARLIE
D: Take the Shostakovich home and listen to it. Let it grow on you. Everyone that's bought it has come back and said, "This is definitive Shostakovich. Thank you for encouraging me to investigate it."
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Well, I did enjoy the Dvorak you suggested. Young man, you talked me into it.
N: Charlie points Peggy to the listening booth.
C: CHARLIE
D: You'll like it. I kid you not.
S: INT. LISTENING BOOTH
N: Peggy sits on the chair. A turntable sits on a small desk. Record covers decorate the walls. Charlie enters and sits on the desk, his feet resting on Peggy's chair.
C: PEGGY
D: What do you know about classical music?
C: CHARLIE
D: Nothing.. Selling is selling.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie. About last nights..
C: CHARLIE
D: Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
C: PEGGY
D: But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
C: CHARLIE
D: Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
C: PEGGY
D: Why?
N: Charlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart.
C: CHARLIE
D: Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
C: PEGGY
D: What am I going to do with you?
C: CHARLIE
D: Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
S: INT. KELCHER HAT STORE KELCHER'S HATS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Alone in the store, Mr. Kelcher is going through some receipts. Peggy enters carrying a shopping bag.
C: PEGGY
D: Hi, Dad.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Doing some shopping?
N: Peggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small wrapped box.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: For me?
C: PEGGY
D: Open it.
N: He opens the present. Inside are a pair of miniature golf ball cufflinks.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But they must've been expensive.
N: Across the street an ice cream truck pulls up. Mothers, fathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit the cab.
C: PEGGY
D: I closed my Christmas club.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
C: PEGGY
D: I wanted to apologize for this morning.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
E: looks out the window
C: PEGGY
D: Quiet today?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: This morning was good.
C: PEGGY
D: The hat business is in trouble.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
C: PEGGY
D: Yes.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
C: PEGGY
D: But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
C: PEGGY
D: He'll win.
E: gravely; closing her eyes
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
S: INT. NANCY'S ROOM
N: Peggy is helping her sister Nancy with an art project.
C: NANCY
D: You think this'll cheer Dad up?
C: PEGGY
D: Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
N: We HEAR Mr. Kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs. The two girls freeze.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
E: O.S.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Please don't shout.
N: Peggy opens the door, Nancy cautiously behind.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: I'm not shouting. Have we ever starved? Have we ever missed a mea1?
E: O.S.
S: INT. DOWNSTAIRS  PEGGY'S POV:
N: Mrs. Kelcher moves around the room, closing the windows.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Does everybody have to hear?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
N: Mr. Kelcher collapses into his barcalounger, red as a beet.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Jack, I was just trying to help.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: We'll make it, we'll be fine.
S: INT. NANCY'S ROOM
N: Nancy is frightened.
C: NANCY
D: Does this mean we're going to be poor?
N: Peggy leads her back into her room without letting her parents know they were there.
S: INT. PEGGY'S ROOM
N: We HEAR the song "Stranger in Paradise" from Kismet on the old black and white record player from opening scene. Peggy sits on the floor, surrounded by stockings, leotards and a sewing basket. She cuts the legs oft a pair of leotards. In one hand she holds up the top half of the leotards, in the other hand, a pair of nylon stockings. We HEAR a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Peggy pushes everything under the bed as Maddy and Carol enter.
C: CAROL
D: All right. What's the scoop?
C: PEGGY
D: On what?
C: MADDY
D: How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
C: PEGGY
D: She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
C: CAROL
D: I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
C: MADDY
D: That's disgusting!
C: CAROL
D: ) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
E: brushing her hair
C: PEGGY
D: Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
C: CAROL
D: Just what you underlined.
C: PEGGY
D: You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
C: CAROL
D: Come on. What's with you and Michael?
C: MADDY
D: Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
C: PEGGY
D: He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
C: CAROL
D: I bet Dolores told Charlie.
C: PEGGY
D: That loudmouthed little bitch~
C: MADDY
D: Peggy Sue!
C: CAROL
D: You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
C: PEGGY
D: Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
C: MADDY
D: But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
E: beat
C: CAROL
D: Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
C: MADDY
D: Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
C: PEGGY
D: Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
C: CAROL
D: Aren't we a little old for that?
C: MADDY
D: Sometimes you're so immature.
S: INT. KELCHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Peggy turns to face her parents, holding up her homemade pantyhose with a flourish.
C: PEGGY
D: Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: This is your great invention? Would you wear those things?
E: to Mrs. Kelcher
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Would they go over my girdle or under?
C: PEGGY
D: Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
C: MRS. KELCHER.
D: Jack, I think she's got something there.
C: PEGGY
D: And we won't just sell them in department stores. We'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
C: PEGGY
D: You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Isn't that awfully forward?
C: PEGGY
D: We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
C: PEGGY
D: Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
S: INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT
N: A breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully, tossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her window. A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the bedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to her bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they were still married.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
C: CHARLIE
D: I have to talk to you..
E: whispering
N: Through her sleepclouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the face of the younger Charlie. Suddenly, she remembers.
C: PEGGY
D: What are you doing here?
C: CHARLIE
D: Let's go down to the basement.
E: angry
S: INT. BASEMENT
N: Peggy enters, flicks on the light and leads Charlie in. Peggy senses Charlie's anger, and steels herself for the inevitable confrontation.
C: CHARLIE
D: I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
C: PEGGY
D: I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
C: CHARLIE
D: Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
E: furious
C: PEGGY
D: You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
C: PEGGY
D: And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
C: CHARLIE
D: Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
E: crying
C: CHARLIE
D: I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
C: PEGGY
D: That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
C: CHARLIE
D: What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
C: PEGGY
D: I just can't trust you anymore.
C: CHARLIE
D: What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
C: PEGGY
D: That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
C: CHARLIE
D: But what has to be different?
C: PEGGY
D: Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
C: CHARLIE
D: What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
C: PEGGY
D: I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
C: CHARLIE
D: You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
E: opening the door
N: Charlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she crosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of Pall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a table lighter and flicks it. As it lights, the tiny music box inside PLAYS SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.
S: INT. KELCHER KITCHEN - MORNING
N: We HEAR distant CHURCH BELLS. Peggy sits down to scan the large Sunday newspaper. Seeing her mother's phone book, she finds the number she needs and picks up the phone. She dials slowly.
C: PEGGY
D: Hello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue. Much better. How are you? I'm very sorry about the other day.
E: very nervous
S: EXT. STREET  APPROACHING RICHARD'S HOUSE
N: Peggy jogs towards Richard. He is watering the front lawn.
C: PEGGY
D: Hi, Richard.
E: breathless
C: RICHARD
D: What are you doing?
C: PEGGY
D: Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
C: RICHARD
D: That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?

D: Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
E: beat
C: RICHARD
D: That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
C: PEGGY
D: It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
C: RICHARD
D: Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
C: PEGGY
D: For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
C: RICHARD
D: Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
C: PEGGY
D: Like what?
C: RICHARD
D: Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
E: excited
C: PEGGY
D: What do you know about hypnosis?
C: RICHARD
D: Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
C: PEGGY
D: Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
C: RICHARD
D: No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
S: INT. RICHARD'S GARAGE
N: Peggy sits in an old recliner. Richard holds a small, batteryoperated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed eyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen.
C: RICHARD
D: You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
E: Peggy's eyes flutter open
C: PEGGY
D: Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure.
E: trancelike beat beat
C: RICHARD
D: Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
C: PEGGY
D: Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
C: RICHARD
D: What will they be made of?
C: PEGGY
D: I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
C: RICHARD
D: Silicon is from sand.
C: PEGGY
D: We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
N: Peggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her legs spread slightly. This is not lost on Richard. Weird, guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.
C: RICHARD
D: In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
C: PEGGY
D: No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
C: RICHARD
D: You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
C: PEGGY
D: No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
C: RICHARD
D: Will you take of f your blouse?
C: PEGGY
D: Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
E: taking her blouse off  getting spaced
N: Peggy's meandering makes Richard nervous.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Richard, are you in there?
E: O.S.
N: Richard frantically tries to put Peggy's blouse back on. She's limp and unresponsive.
C: RICHARD
D: No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
E: shouting urgent
C: PEGGY
D: I couldn't help it  I loved him.
C: RICHARD
D: One... two... three. You are now awake.
E: claps twice
N: Richard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the buttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off. She buttons her blouse, furious.
C: PEGGY
D: Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
C: RICHARD
D: Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
C: PEGGY
D: That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
C: RICHARD
D: I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
C: PEGGY
D: God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
N: Peggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall.
C: RICHARD
D: Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
N: Peggy storms out.
S: INT. KELCHER HOUSE
N: Mrs. Kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast. Peggy's making a chocolate mousse.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
C: PEGGY
D: Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
C: MRS KELCHER
D: What's pasta?
S: INT. KELCHER DINING ROOM
N: Peggy and Mrs. Kelcher are setting the table, taking the good china out of the cabinet. A dozen red roses grace the table.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: These roses are beautiful. And so romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is he a friend of Charlie's?
N: She moves the Jell-O mold.
C: PEGGY
D: No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: What does Charlie think about that?
C: PEGGY
D: You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
E: shocked
C: PEGGY
D: Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
C: MRS KELCHER
D: Of course I loved your Lather. I remember once being offered a scholarship to art school. But I turned it down.
C: PEGGY
D: Why?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: All the college girls I knew were so well, dressed. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't have the right clothes. I was so silly. But, I don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past. But Charlie. I hope you know what you're doing.
S: INT. DINING ROOM  TWO HOURS LATER
N: Michael, DORIS and ED FITZSIMMONS sit at the table with the Kelchers. They have just finished dessert.
C: MR. FITZSIMMONS
D: Moose? I never thought I'd have moose for desert.
N: The adults laugh. Michael looks bored.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner.
C: NANCY
D: But Mom helped.
C: MR. FITZSIMMONS
D: You know, you should open a restaurant.
C: PEGGY
D: It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business. You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies. They take months to pay.
N: The whole table is astonished.
C: MR. FITZSIMMONS
D: How does a young gal like you know so much about business?
C: PEGGY
D: Oh, I just picked it up from my dad. He's a wonderful businessman.
C: MR. FITZSIMMONS
D: Really?
N: Peggy gives her father a go get him look. Michael's writing in a pocket notebook.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn to the den for a while?
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE
N: Peggy~ and Michael stand by Michael's motorcycle, passing a cigarette.
C: MICHAEL
D: That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
C: PEGGY
D: I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
N: Michael makes a move towards Peggy, with lust in his eyes.
C: PEGGY
D: No. Something else. I'm too full. Besides, it's a school night.
S: EXT. GHETTO STREET - NIGHT
N: Michael and Peggy pull up on the motorcycle in front of Lena's Lounge, a seedy bar in the town's black ghetto. Half a dozen blacks are banging around outside. They eye Peggy and Michael suspiciously.
S: INT. LENA'S LOUNGE
N: The room has a bar at one side, booths and tables in the rest of the room. A stage is at the far end. On stage, an all black group, The FourMations, is performing the song GOOD TIMIN' The people in the club are dancing the Twist. Peggy and Michael sit in the last booth. Several people wave hello to Michael.. Although Peggy and Michael can see the stage, their booth is not visible from the stage.
C: MICHAEL
D: Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom.
E: he raises his glass
C: PEGGY
D: For everyone.
E: looking around at the crowd  clinking glasses
C: MICHAEL
D: Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
C: PEGGY
D: Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
C: MICHAEL
D: Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
C: PEGGY
D: I can't do that.
E: astounded
C: MICHAEL
D: Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
C: PEGGY
D: I hate chickens.
N: ANGLE  THE STAGE On stage, the FourNations have concluded their song. We HEAR APPLAUSE.
C: SINGER
D: Thank you. Now we're happy to introduce, a friend of ours. He's one damn fine singer, Mr. Charlie Dell!
N: We HEAR the GROVE BEGIN the SONG SEA OF LOVE.
C: MICHAEL
D: But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
C: PEGGY
D: Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
C: MICHAEL
D: But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time.
E: beat
C: PEGGY
D: That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
C: MICHAEL
D: You think so?
C: PEGGY
D: Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
C: MICHAEL
D: I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
N: Suddenly distracted by the familiar voice, Peggy looks up to the stage and sees that the lead singer, Charlie Bell, is in fact, Charlie Bodell. PEGGY'S POV: THE STAGE  CHARLIE SINGING
C: PEGGY
D: It's Charlie!
E: 0.S.
C: MICHAEL
D: What a treat.
E: 0.S.
N: INTERCUT - CHARLIE SINGING  WITH REACTIONS OF PEGGY AND MICHAEL. Michael observes Peggy's intimate reaction to Charlie's singing.
C: MICHAEL
D: Now I get it.
C: PEGGY
D: Ssh. He's great.
C: MICHAEL
D: Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
N: Charlie finishes the song as the audience goes wild. He beams.
C: PEGGY
D: I thought I knew everything about him.
C: MICHAEL
D: Can we split now?
N: Peggy and Michael unobtrusively slip out of the club. Charlie leaves the stage. He's met by a greasy looking MAN. They sit down at a booth to talk.
S: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT
N: Michael and Peggy pull up. Peggy gets off the bike and gives Michael a goodnight kiss.
C: MICHAEL
D: I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
C: PEGGY
D: What?
C: MICHAEL
D: My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
S: INT. KELCHER KITCHEN
N: Mrs. Kelcher finishes the dishes, with rubber gloves on. Mr. Kelcher sits, cleaning his pipe. Peggy enters.
C: PEGGY
D: How did it go with the pantyhose?
C: MR. KELCHER
D: It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh no!
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
C: PEGGY
D: He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh, you're both so naive.
C: MR. KELCHER
D: Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
C: MRS. KELCHER
D: You have a point, dear.
S: INT. PEGGY'S ROOM
N: (POSS. OMIT THIS SCENE) Peggy lies in bed in the darkness, her eyes wide open. The bedside clock reads: 2:47. Peggy gets out of bed. CAMERA TRACKS Peggy into Nancy's room. Peggy looks down at Nancy sleeping. Gently pulling back the blankets, Peggy gets into bed with her.
S: EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET  MORNING
N: Peggy walks down a residential street, much like her parents'. She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a driveway, and leans against a tree next to his car. Moments later, Charlie exits his house, a dog trailing behind him. The dog runs up to Peggy. Charlie is wary and distant.
C: CHARLIE
D: What're you doing here?
C: PEGGY
D: I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
E: pats dog
C: CHARLIE
D: Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
N: Charlie throws a stick. Ajax chases it, never comes back.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school?
E: beat
C: CHARLIE
D: Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
C: PEGGY
D: Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
C: CHARLIE
D: How'd you know about that?
C: PEGGY
D: I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
C: CHARLIE
D: Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
C: PEGGY
D: What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
N: Charlie and Peggy walking.
C: PEGGY
D: I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
C: CHARLIE
D: That's real big of you.
C: PEGGY
D: Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
N: Peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse.
C: PEGGY
D: Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
C: CHARLIE
D: Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
C: PEGGY
D: Just take a look at it.
E: hands him the lyric
C: CHARLIE
D: If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
N: Peggy and Charlie stand by their open locker.
C: CHARLIE
D: Does this mean you like me again?
C: PEGGY
D: It means I care about you and what happens to you.
C: CHARLIE
D: That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
N: Charlie walks away as Peggy reaches into the locker for her books.
C: CAROL
D: Peggy, I have to talk to you.
N: Peggy turns to Carol. They walk down the hallway together.
C: PEGGY
D: What's the matter?
C: CAROL
D: It's that jerk Walter.
C: PEGGY
D: What happened?
C: CAROL
D: After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
C: PEGGY
D: Welcome to the singles' scene.
C: CAROL
D: What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
C: PEGGY
D: Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Walter walks up to Charlie.
C: WALTER
D: Hey Charlie, what do you think of this?
N: Walter does a totally demented dance step, finishing by strumming his leg like a guitar. He stands there grinning.
C: CHARLIE
D: Walter, maybe you should be a dentist.
S: INT. CLASSROOM
N: Peggy sits at her desk, organizing her books. We hear the end of the ANNOUNCEMENTS over the P.A. SYSTEM.
C: MR. MOSEY
D: And finally, our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last Friday. And a special accolade to Rosalie Testa who placed first in every one of her events. We're proud of you, Rosalie.
E: V.0.
N: Everybody turns toward Rosalie and applauds. Peggy turns to Rosalie, trembling. The BELL RINGS as the class starts to leave, still crowded around Rosalie. Peggy stares after her, frozen in her seat Dolores approaches.
C: DOLORES
D: What's the matter, princess? Lost your prince?
N: Peggy looks up at Dolores and starts to seethe. She stands up slowly and faces Dolores.
C: PEGGY
D: You know Dolores, there's a lot of things I could say to you, but you're not worth the effort.
N: Peggy reaches down to up her books. On the top of the pile is an open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release lever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress. Dolores drops her books, looks down at her dress, horrified.
C: PEGGY
D: Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
C: DOLORES
D: Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
E: screams
C: PEGGY
D: I beg your pardon?
C: DOLORES
D: Take a long walk on a short pier.
C: PEGGY
D: Have a nice day.
S: INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM
N: Peggy sits disconsolate on a bench, watching the other girls changing into their swim suits. Rosalie is in the shower room, wetting down her suit. She accepts congratulations from a number of the girls. The BELL RINGS as the girls begin to exit to the pool.
C: PEGGY
D: Rosalie! Wait!
N: Rosalie turns at the door, smiling. They are alone.
C: ROSALIE
D: What's up?
C: PEGGY
D: I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
C: ROSALIE
D: Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
C: PEGGY
D: I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
C: ROSALIE
D: I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
C: PEGGY
D: But accidents can happen.
C: ROSALIE
D: Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
C: PEGGY
D: Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
C: ROSALIE
D: You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
N: Rosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Peggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to the pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie diving through the air with the careless innocence of youth. Burdened with the inevitability of it all, she rushes through the hall, and is stopped by Richard.
C: RICHARD
D: What's the matter?
C: PEGGY
D: It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
C: RICHARD
D: Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
C: PEGGY
D: You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
N: She starts to walk away.
C: RICHARD
D: Peggy, I believe you. I believe everything you told me. It's wonderful. You're the exception that proves the rule.
N: She kisses him on the forehead.
C: PEGGY
D: I love you too, Richard. Thanks for trying.
N: She continues down the hallway.
S: EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Peggy heads out the door, sees Charlie.
C: CHARLIE
D: Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute.
N: Peggy stops on the landing. Charlie joins her, so eager. He doesn't notice how distraught she is.
C: CHARLIE
D: I cut shop and did some work on your song. You know, it's not half bad for your first try. Of course, I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs". Listen to this.
N: Charlie begins to sing an R&B version of SHE LOVES YOU.
C: PEGGY
D: Forget it, it'll never work.
C: CHARLIE
D: Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
N: Walter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away.

C: BUS DRIVER
D: Everybody gettin' off at Dumont. Here we are.
N: Peggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase. Nervous, she drops it. A MAN, getting off the bus, helps her, picking it up.
C: PEGGY
D: Thank you.
C: MAN
D: No trouble at all.
N: The man gets off the bus.
S: EXT. GENERAL STORE
N: Peggy stands at the door of the bus, hesitant. Elizabeth and Barney approach the bus, waving and smiling up at her.
C: BARNEY
D: Hello, Lilla!
C: ELIZABETH

S: INT. CAR  DRIVING
N: Barney is behind the wheel of a 1951 Plymouth. Elizabeth is in front, Peggy curled up in the back, regressing.
C: BARNEY
D: Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.

N: Peggy and Elizabeth finish up the dishes, chatting.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: A fire blazes in the fireplace. A grandfather clock stands prominently in the room. The clock from Peggy's house. Peggy sits with Elizabeth, learning how to knit. Barney laughs at "The Burns and Allen Show" on TV. Suddenly, Peggy places her hand over her heart and shivers with fear.
C: BARNEY
D: What's the matter, Lilla? Somebody jump on your grave?
N: Peggy shivers again and shakes her head.

E: beat
C: PEGGY

C: PEGGY
D: I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
E: beat
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN  DAY
N: Peggy and Elizabeth are making strudel.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
C: PEGGY
D: But I'm remembering the future.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.

C: BARNEY
D: It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
N: Barney turns and winks at Peggy.
C: PEGGY
D: It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
C: ELIZABETH
D: He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.

S: INT. LODGE - NIGHT
N: A onestory, pitchroof building. The sign over the entrance reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to the front, exit the car and enter the building.
S: INT. LODGE  ANTEROOM
N: Thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts. They either wear or carry tricorner hats. Peggy and Barney enter. Several men approach them. Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm.
C: GEORGE
D: Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us.
C: PEGGY
D: Thank you.
C: HENRY
D: You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather.
C: PEGGY
D: Ah... thank you.
C: BARNEY
D: Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe.

C: PEGGY
D: Do you have to wear that hat?
E: nervous
C: BARNEY
D: It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
N: Barney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly through the doorway.
C: BARNEY
D: Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you.
S: INT. LODGE  MAIN ROOM
N: A large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth". Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.
C: HENRY
D: Hey, George. Get the lights.
N: The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles. The men form a semicircle around Peggy. Old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. The men rejoin the line. LEO COOPER, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.
C: LEO
D: Are you ready, dear?
E: to Peggy
C: PEGGY
D: Yes, sir.
N: Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.
C: PEGGY
D: Fasten your seat belts. Here we go.
C: LEO
D: Lord of the Universe, Vast and Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air, fire and water. We adore thee and invoke thee! Grant thine aid. Look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man. We behold the innocent endeavors of singleminded men and women. For we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels. We ask thy intervention, that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your Love.
E: kneeling down
C: PEGGY
D: This is never going to work.
E: sotto
N: The old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads bowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her. She smiles back.
C: MEN
D: Fount of life, Chariot of the Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim thy child of light.
N: We HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The artificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with amazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men continue to chant while:
C: LEO
D: The name of your love is sacrifice. We offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home.
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.
C: LEO
D: Nothing to worry about. Somebody get the lights.
E: 0.S.
N: The LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne. Peggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, the girl's gone. Let's play some poker.
E: chipper
N: CLOSE ON BARNEY  He smiles, happy that she made it. George crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a button. The wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card room. The men shuffle in.
S: EXT. BEHIND THE LODGE
N: Charlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering her mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts her down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe.
C: PEGGY
D: What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
C: CHARLIE
D: I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
C: PEGGY
D: Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're going to listen to me.
N: Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm not getting in that blue monstrosity.
N: Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.
C: PEGGY
D: Let me got! Where are you taking me?
C: CHARLIE
D: Right here. Now sit down.
N: Charlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and hopping mad.
C: CHARLIE
D: Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
C: PEGGY
D: How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
N: Thunder and lightning. It starts to rain.
C: CHARLIE
D: Because I love you, damnit! I had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down. Right away.
N: Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.
C: PEGGY
D: What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
C: CHARLIE
D: What?
C: PEGGY
D: You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
C: CHARLIE
D: You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
C: PEGGY
D: I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
E: tears start
N: Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy and strokes her hair.
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't bother you anymore. I promise. Please stop crying. Please.
N: Peggy starts to compose herself.
C: PEGGY
D: Will you take me back to my grandparents?
C: CHARLIE
D: Of course.
N: Charlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes out a small box, handing it to Peggy.
C: CHARLIE
D: It's almost your birthday. I wasn't sure when you were coming back, so I brought your present up here.
N: With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.
C: PEGGY
D: Oh, Charlie.
E: anguished
C: CHARLIE
D: It opens, too. Look inside.
N: Peggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition. INSERT - LOCKET Two photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children.
C: PEGGY
D: Scott and Beth. Where did you get these?
C: CHARM E
D: Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother gave me our picture. That's you and me.
C: PEGGY
D: So are Scott and Beth.
N: Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him, holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their foreheads touching.
C: CHARLIE
D: I love you.
E: tenderly
C: PEGGY
D: I know.
N: Charlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the ground. HOLD on the locket, and...
T: DISSOLVE:
S: EXT. ON THE HILL - LATER
N: Charlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash of lightning streaks across the sky.
C: CHARLIE
D: I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
C: PEGGY
D: Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
E: musing
C: CHARLIE
D: What the hell is that?
N: Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE. The kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.
C: CHARLIE
D: Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
C: PEGGY
D: I've got to go now.
C: CHARLIE
D: But I love you. I'll love you forever.
C: PEGGY
D: I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
C: CHARLIE
D: Come back to me.
C: PEGGY
D: I'm trying.
N: As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain the runaway kite.
C: CHARLIE
D: Richard, do something!
C: RICHARD
D: I can't! It's out of control!
N: Suddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.
C: CHARLIE
D: Peggy!
N: Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's VOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the blackness. In an instant she becomes a star. FINAL SCENE
T: DISSOLVE/OPTICAL
N: HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Moving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect: 'Your heart stopped for a while..." Father's voice: 'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of the head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right now, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so worried..." Echoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness. He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy Sue' for her.
C: CHARLIE
D: . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
E: singing softly
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie? Was I dead?
C: CHARLIE
D: I thought you were...for a while.
C: PEGGY
D: You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
E: affectionately
C: CHARLIE
D: But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
C: CHARLIE
D: I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
C: PEGGY
D: What about Janet?
C: CHARLIE
D: That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
N: Charlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her hospital room.
C: PEGGY
D: Who are all the flowers from?
N: Charlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the dresser.
C: CHARLIE
D: Everyone. Maddie and Arthur, Carol and Walter. Richard Norvick. And here's a book, by that guy from high school, Michael Fitzsimmons. He dedicated it to you.
N: Charlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover of the book. ANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim Soul" and the dedication reads "to Peggy Sue and a Starry Night". Peggy smiles but shakes her head.
C: PEGGY
D: It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'll just set it right here.
N: He places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, I had a strange experience. I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you. And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
C: CHARLIE
D: Oh, God, Dion.
C: PEGGY
D: You were terrific. And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
C: CHARLIE
D: I'll never give up.
C: PEGGY
D: Then hold me.
N: He holds her hand.
C: CHARLIE
D: I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
C: PEGGY
D: Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
C: CHARLIE
D: Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
C: PIGGY
D: Charlie, please, I need some time.
C: CHARLIE
D: Well, I'll let you get some rest...so long.
N: The VIEW PULLS BACK past the flowers. Charlie starts to exit. Checks himself in the mirror.
C: PEGGY
D: Charlie, I would like to invite you to dinner at home, on Sunday, with your kids. I will make a strudel.
N: He hurries back to her, kisses her again. They hang on to each other as Beth enters the room.
T: FADE OUT.
