T: FADE IN:
N: Through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of small, middle-class houses. This could be any suburban street in America.
S: INT. CITY BUS - DAY
N: A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus. This is TODD BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come. He stares out at the other passengers indifferently. Then something catches his eye.
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY
N: TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA FEBRUARY 1984 Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot. This is the kind of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful suburban community of Santo Donato. Todd gets off his bike and heads up the front steps. On the way, he bends down to pick up the L.A. Times. Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the door bell. The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER". The second reads: "NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN". Todd RINGS the bell. Nothing. He looks at his watch. It is twelve past ten. He RINGS again, this time longer. Still nothing. Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his watch as he does so. After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING, a voice is heard from within.
C: DUSSANDER
D: All right. All right. I'm coming. Let it go!
E: O.S.
N: Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. Then it opens. An old man stands behind the screen. He is KURT DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker. Mid-seventies. Standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein. Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot.
C: DUSSANDER
D: A boy. I don't need anything, boy. Can't you read? I thought all American boys could read. Don't be a nuisance, now. Good day.
E: continuing
N: The door begins to close. Todd waits till the last moment before speaking.
C: TODD
D: Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander.
N: The door stops. Dussander opens it slowly. He unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper. Todd does not let go.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Give me my newspaper.
C: TODD
D: Sure thing, Mr. Dussander.
N: Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door. Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's bicycle.
C: DUSSANDER
D: My name is Denker. See? Denker. Perhaps you cannot read after all. What a pity. Good day.
E: pointing
N: As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.
C: TODD
D: Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44. Then you went to Patin.
N: The door stops, still partly open.
C: TODD
D: After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires. From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know. No one does. But in 1965, you popped up in West Berlin, where they almost got you.
E: CONT'D
N: The door opens wider.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Listen, boy. I don't know what is the matter with you. But I don't have time for this game. Now, get out of here before I call the police.
C: TODD
D: Call them if you want.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Fine.
N: The heavy door slams shut.
C: TODD
D: It's okay by me Herr Kommandant. I'm sure the police would love to meet the "Blood- fiend of Patin."
N: In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen. Dussander is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled umbrella raised to strike him. Todd stumbles back against the porch rail.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You get away from this house, God damn you! I'll beat you all the way home.
N: But Todd regains his composure quickly. He brushes himself off and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the threat he was a few seconds ago.
C: TODD
D: After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I did. Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If you want to call the cops, go right ahead. I'II wait on the steps.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You'll do no such thing.
C: TODD
D: I won't? Listen, old man, if I want to start screaming right here, I will. If I want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then I will. I will do what ever I want. Do you understand? But if you like, I could come in for a minute. We could talk.
E: pause
N: Pause.
C: DUSSANDER
D: I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home.
N: Pause.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Is that what you want, to come into my home? So be it. There is no arguing with crazy people.
E: CONT'D
N: Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door. He stops at the threshold of the house and turns. He is holding the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the other. He looks straight ahead. A moment later, Todd steps into the house.
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old man. Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary. Todd looks around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle. But he doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table.
C: DUSSANDER
D: My wife. She died in 1955 of lung disease. At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen. I was heartbroken.
N: Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph. He begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Stop that!
E: CONT'D
N: Todd jumps back a little but then recovers.
C: TODD
D: Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the lampshades out of human skin?
C: DUSSANDER
D: Now I don't know what you're talking about.
C: TODD
D: Sure you do, Mr. Dussander.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Denker. Denker. Denker. You don't listen, boy. The television has fried your brain.
N: Pause.
C: TODD
D: Your hands are shaking.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Yes, they're shaking. I'm old. We all shake. You are most tiresome, and rude. Now if you have a point I wish you'd come to it.
C: TODD
D: We're in no rush. If I thought you had plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know you don't...
C: DUSSANDER
D: You know nothing of my business --
C: TODD
D: What business? You sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day. Except on Friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater. And twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping. You always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You have been following me?
C: TODD
D: Of course, I followed you. You think I normally go around to peoples' houses and accuse them of being Nazi fugitives?
C: DUSSANDER
D: Perhaps for me you made an exception.
C: TODD
D: No, for you I had to be sure. For Kurt Dussander I had to be absolutely certain. ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here.
N: Todd sits on the sofa.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Oh, yes, I see now. As I am this ex-Nazi fellow, as you say, then this must be the part where I offer you my hidden stash of gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish men, of course, which I keep buried in the basement. Isn't that right, boy? Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I have no money. If I did I might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense.
C: TODD
D: I don't need money. You don't have any anyway. At least, I don't think so. You probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country. A good American passport is expensive on the black market, that I know.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Do you? Good for you.
C: TODD
D: Yes, I do. I know it all, Dussander. You're my One Great Interest.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Your what?
C: TODD
D: My One Great Interest. Well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something I learned back in eighth grade. Our teacher, Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our One Great Interest in life. You know, the thing that would really grab us. Once we did that, everything would fall into place. Like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth-century postcards. I guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher. Anyway, she told us to start thinking about it. So I did, but nothing happened. Until the following summer, in Ronny Pegler's garage. That's where I found it.
S: INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY
N: Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in the corner of the garage. We see that the boxes are filled with old war magazines. Ronny tosses several of them to the ground as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse. Ronny selects one Penthouse and rifles through it. He discards it a moment later.
C: RONNY
D: One of these has three girls doing it at the same time.
N: But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention. He picks one up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages. We see a few of the photographs: Nazi storm troopers, prisoners behind barbed wire, the ovens.
C: RONNY
D: I got it! Check this out. ...Todd, look.
E: CONT'D
C: TODD
D: Hang on a sec.
N: As young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes in...
C: TODD
D: It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd never seen, stuff they never put in the books anymore, especially the ones they give us to read. And here were stacks of them.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Todd speaks excitedly. Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges him.
C: TODD
D: It... grabbed me. It was just like Miss Harmon said. I couldn't believe it. But there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the ...the way they saluted each other. But what am I telling you for? You know more about this stuff than anybody.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Yes, what are you telling me for?
C: TODD
D: Then last year I wrote my big term paper on Dachau. I got an A+. It was the only A+ she gave. I mean I always do real well. A's on everything. That's why I'm accelerated.
E: ignoring him
C: DUSSANDER
D: Accelerated?
C: TODD
D: You know, accelerated. I skipped two grades, second and ninth. I didn't need them. That's why I'm already a junior.
N: Dussander sits.
C: DUSSANDER
D: I see...
C: TODD
D: Some kids resent me for it. That's not important. Anyway, my paper really floored my history teacher. I guess because I got through all those books without throwing up. But I learned something. I learned that when you talk about the camps now, you have to remember to sound really disgusted. I mean, you can't just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that. If I tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in.
S: INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DUSK
N: Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old magazines. The door to the house opens and Ronny, looking cross, pokes his head out.
C: RONNY
D: Todd, your mom's on the phone. She says you have to come home for dinner. ...Todd?
N: Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny at first. Then he looks up at him. In his eyes is a glint of a darkness that we will come to know better.
C: TODD
D: What?
C: RONNY
D: Your mom's on the phone.
E: suddenly wary of Todd
N: ANGLE on Todd.
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: TODD
D: Nowadays you have to... soften it.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Why do I care about this?
C: TODD
D: Because, I don't want it softened.
N: Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. Dussander stares at him blankly, unsure of where this is going.
C: DUSSANDER
D: I am sure you trouble your parents to no end.
C: TODD
D: Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance. That's what my dad says.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You told your parents about me, then?
C: TODD
D: You think I'm crazy?
C: DUSSANDER
D: I think you're crackers, but go on. I'm riveted.
N: Todd looks deep into Dussander's eyes. Dussander is uncomfortable. Slowly, Todd reaches out and brushes his finger against Dussander's hand. Dussander gets up.
C: DUSSANDER
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
N: Pause.
C: TODD
D: And then it happened... I was on my way to the library. It was raining...
S: FLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY
N: Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing. Todd, seated near the back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard. Todd thinks nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him. Todd is trying to place the old man's face in his mind...
C: TODD
D: You climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle. Just like you were examining a new batch of inmates. I don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way. And under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella. But what really did it, what really set me off was the coat. You were wearing this long black rain coat. My mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at Patin. You in your S.S. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: TODD
D: It was incredible.
N: Dussander stares back at him flatly.
C: DUSSANDER
D: All of this... because of a rain coat?
C: TODD
D: Well, it wasn't that easy. I mean, I had to really check up on it. And every picture of you in those books is forty years old, at least. I went back to the library to find the picture. And then I matched it with the photos I took.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You took photographs of me?
C: TODD
D: Yeah, I got this little camera. Fits right in the palm of my hand.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Clever boy.
E: crunches cigarette into ashtray
C: TODD
D: But even then I couldn't be sure. I needed real proof. So I went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what you're supposed to look for and then dusted your mailbox while you were at the movies. Pretty smart, huh?
C: DUSSANDER
D: You... put dust on my mailbox? For fingerprints? You took photographs of me? What else did you do?... I don't believe any of this.
C: TODD
D: I already had a copy of your fingerprints. They're on your want sheet from the Israeli government. It's on database at UC Irvine. Can you believe that?
C: DUSSANDER
D: Bourbon.
N: He storms toward the kitchen and stops.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Would you care for a drink, boy?
E: CONT'D
C: TODD
D: Sure, you got a Coke?
C: DUSSANDER
D: No Kok.
C: TODD
D: Milk?
C: DUSSANDER
D: Milk.
N: Dussander disappears into the kitchen. Todd stands alone in the living room. He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for Dussander. He knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back. But after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far. The sternness returns to his eyes. Todd is all business. He takes a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear him in the kitchen.
C: TODD
D: It takes eight good matches, they're called compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get accepted in court.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Is that right?
E: O.S.
S: FLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY
N: Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly. He pulls the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the mailbox for prints.
C: TODD
D: Yeah, there were two sets of prints. The first I figured were the mailman's. Once I knew what I was looking for, yours were easy to spot.
E: V.O.
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
C: DUSSANDER
D: You should be a detective.
E: O.S.
N: The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the kitchen. Drinks being poured. Todd begins to move slowly toward the kitchen.
C: TODD
D: Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it.
S: INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY
N: He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks.
C: TODD
D: I found fourteen compares.
N: Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass of bourbon. He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to his lips and hesitates.
C: TODD
D: You have some.
E: CONT'D
C: DUSSANDER
D: Good Gott.
N: He snatches the cup and swallows twice.
C: DUSSANDER
D: You see? It's milk, boy. From Dairylee Farms. On the carton is a picture of a smiling cow.
E: CONT'D
N: Todd pauses and then begins to drink.
C: DUSSANDER
D: ...And two missing children. Boy what you have done, I have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand, what you have done is a violation.
E: CONT'D more to himself than Todd pause
C: TODD
D: A violation?
C: DUSSANDER
D: Yes.
C: TODD
D: Kind of like those experiments with the decompression chamber. Now, that was a violation, Dussander.
C: DUSSANDER
D: That fucking name. Enough of that. I demand it.
C: TODD
D: You what?
C: DUSSANDER
D: I demand --
C: TODD
D: You demand nothing from me. Ever. Get it?
N: Pause.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for the last time. My name is Arthur Denker. It has never been anything else. It has never even been Americanized. If you must know, and apparently you must, I was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. I did serve in the reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, when I was first married, I supported Hitler. I supported him most, I suppose, because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco. ...Would you like a cigarette?
C: TODD
D: No. My dad used to smoke. Mom made him quit. Now he's addicted to Nicorette... that's nicotine gum.
N: Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match from a cabinet. He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Nicotine gum.
N: Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns and continues.
C: DUSSANDER
D: Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer. He even gave his dog, Blondi, a death capsule. On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment surrendered to the Americans. I remember that a private named Gonzales gave me a chocolate bar. I wept.
E: CONT'D
N: Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.
C: DUSSANDER
D: I was interned at Essen where I was treated very well. We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio and when Goering committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk. When I was released, I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works until I retired in 1963. In 1967 I emigrated here, to California, and became a U.S. Citizen. I am as American as you are. I
E: CONT'D
N: vote. No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba
