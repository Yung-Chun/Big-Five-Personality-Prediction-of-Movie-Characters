S: INT. ANTARCTICA LAB (OPENING MONTAGE)
C: 1A 1A
D: A glowing blue box like a large toaster sits in a sterile lab shelf, plugged in. A rubber duck sits on a cluttered desk. GARY PINBACK identified by "Gary" stitched on a white lab coat - enters frame, unplugs the box and shoves it in a duffle bag nervously . An ALARM SOUNDS. RED SIREN LIGHT splashes into frame. Opening credits play on walls and other surfaces of this montage before and after Gary runs through frames. Gary goes to a desk and rushes to steal stationary, staplers, pencils, a calculator etc; he sweeps the desk surface junk with his arm into the duffle bag on top of the Time Cube. He picks up the rubber duck and shoves it in his pocket.
E: the Time Cube 40 his face framed out of this entire montage
S: INT. ANTARCTICA LAB HALLWAY (OPENING MONTAGE)
C: 1B 1B
D: A white lab coat fills the frame then reveals Gary running away. Gary's feet running. Duffle bag in frame. HIGH ANGLE: long hall, following Gary running. ANGLE ON DOOR: it's marked SPACEPORT LEVEL 4, Gary slams into it and runs through. LOW ANGLE: Gary runs through long high ceiling hall away from camera. Red Siren light spins on the wall. Gary goes through the far door. Gary slips and wipes out, spilling his stationary. He grabs his time cube bag and duck and keeps running.
S: INT. ANTARCTICA LAB SPACEPORT (OPENING MONTAGE)
C: 1C 1C
D: MEDIUM CLOSE: Gary throws the bag into a hatch and climbs in after it, closes the hatch, spins the handle from the inside. It's marked with decals reading CARGO DRONE 9. A blast door lowers into frame covering the drone and we hear SPACE SHUTTLE TAKING OFF SOUNDS.

E: O.S. O.S.
C: SECURITY
D: Where did it go? Did you get it? SECURITY 2 I'm not reading anything. Must have totally vaporized it.
E: O.S. O.S.

E: O.S.
S: INT. AIRLOCK MODULE (INSIDE AIRLOCK) - DAY
N: JIMMY ANDERSON (25) wears a jumpsuit with utility belt, has a small rolling suitcase, and a bunch of papers in the other hand. Elevator music. He stands waiting in a small industrial- looking passage with heavy duty inner and outer doors. A red light. He's sweating, pale. He presses the button repeatedly.
C: ANTON
D: Do you have any fruits, vegetables, or other food products?
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: No.
C: ANTON
D: Fever, stuffy nose, cold symptoms?

D: Allergies.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: Have you worked on the WENDI series computer systems before?
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: You still have a WENDI? The light turns green and the inner door opens, Jimmy enters the space station airlock module. A sign above the airlock says: "REMEMBER ALL ACCIDENTS IN SPACE ARE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS". Jimmy sneezes again, wipes his nose, offers his hand to shake. He reads Anton's name tag.
C: JIMMY
D: Captain Balvenie?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: Call me Anton. ANTON BALVENIE snatches the documents, and walks away as he reads. Jimmy follows him.

C: ANTON
D: Level 9 engineers aren't rated for central systems repair.
C: JIMMY
D: No, they are. I am. Do you want me to go back? Anton corners Jimmy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 4.
C: ANTON
D: We got you up here, I'll put you to work.
C: JIMMY
D: Great. This is my first orbital assignment.
C: ANTON
D: Let me clue you in. Up here the work never stops. There's always orbital debris piling up and someone has to be in each sector with a line of sight on it to keep launch vectors clear. Do you follow me?
C: JIMMY
D: No problem chief.
C: ANTON
D: I'm not a chief I'm a Captain.
C: JIMMY
D: Sorry, Captain. They keep walking, reaching the junction at the end.
C: ANTON
D: Just make sure you finish by zero eight hundred Zulu. I'm not signing overtime forms. Do you know how to fix mess hall food dispensers?
C: JIMMY
D: No. Maybe. What's the matter?
C: ANTON
D: All it's giving is sandwiches. That's your next job after the mainframe.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Computer monitors with important data cover the walls, there are six stations with rotating chairs and an island of consoles in the middle. Flight Specialist TILDA GENERO (25) has her feet up, headphones on. The door opens and Jimmy follows Anton into the control room. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 5.
C: ANTON
D: The terminal on the fritz is over there. Jimmy sees Tilda.
C: ANTON
D: That's Lieutenant Tilda Genero. You don't need to talk to her. Tilda glances at him and turns her chair away from him. Jimmy drags his suitcase, hitting everything, and dumps out electronic junk near the terminal. He opens up a panel near a screen showing static.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: There's your problem. Jimmy digs around in the panel with wires sticking out.
C: ANTON
D: And the sonovac coffee machine is malfunctioning. Can you fix that?
C: JIMMY
D: I don't know. I might have to take the mainframe offline to fix this-
C: ANTON
D: Whatever, get it done. Anton goes to another terminal and uses the computer.
C: JIMMY
D: What's his problem? Tilda ignores him.
C: JIMMY
D: I said, what's his problem? ... I guess you can't hear me with your headphones on.
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: I can hear you.
N: Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 6.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: In big naval ship name letters it says "WASS-8518 REGINA" on the dirty run-down and decaying sanitation station. FLASH OF LIGHT: The cargo shuttle appears out of nowhere, flying away from the Earth as it was before.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Tilda has her feet up, she listens to the radio chatter, not caring in the least. She presses a few buttons. Jimmy tests circuits in the background. She adjusts her headphones. Computer monitors show generic scrolling text, radar sweeps and simple iconographic status displays in the background.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Orbital control, this is ground control, come in please.
E: O.S.
C: BILL
D: What's shaking Steve?
E: O.S.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Oh hey Bill. Was Antarctica station looking for a missing shuttle earlier today?
C: BILL
D: Roger that. Did you find it?
E: O.S.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Thing is I have an unregistered shuttle here tagged with a high probability of debris collision. No life signs on board. Think it's the same one?
E: O.S.
C: BILL
D: Negative ground control. The one Antarctica lost had a passenger.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: The small drone appears moving (relatively) slowly toward the general area of the Regina station. A METAL SCREW floats in space (shallow focus). The drone is coming toward the screw from the distance.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Take a look at the collision warning. I read station eight five one eight in your sector. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 6A.
E: O.S. MORE
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Sanitation Station Regina. Better get them on it. Are you going to come to poker night? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 7.

C: BILL
D: You know it Steve. See you next Wednesday.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Tilda lazily leans over and presses the button.
C: BILL
D: Sanitation station eight five-
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: Station Regina here. I've been monitoring. We're not reading debris in our sector.
C: BILL
D: Why don't you check again. Tilda is annoyed and hits some buttons.
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: It's probably a sensor glitch.
C: BILL
D: That's a negative, the debris appears to be between class 2 and class 3. Can you whack it with a proton beam?
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: Ground control, it's too big for a proton beam if it's class 3. You know that. Anton comes over to Tilda and looks at the monitor.
C: ANTON
D: What do they want now?
C: TILDA
D: A cargo drone is coming through. They've got a collision alarm.
C: ANTON
D: Looks too small for a laser sweep.
C: TILDA
D: Probably just a false alarm. What do you want me to tell them?
C: JIMMY
D: Do you want me to take a look at the sensors? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 8.
C: ANTON
D: No. Keep working. Anton hits some keys, then presses the radio button.
C: ANTON
D: This is Captain Balvenie of sanitation station eight five one eight. Who the hell is telling my operations officer how to do her job?
E: CONT'D
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Balvenie-
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: You have to send someone else. Our main computer is down for service.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Hold on... Now I've got Antarctica station telling me it's a priority one situation.
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: Not our problem. The book says it's too small for lasers. Check your book down there.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: How about a particle beam?
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: Where's Valentina? Why am I dealing with these guys? It's her shift.
S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY
N: An intercom on the wall next to a bunch of bubbles. VALENTINA NOVAK (33) takes a bubble bath in a water tank, with a rubber duck. A towel is hung on equipment nearby. Anton sounds like he puts the mic too close to his mouth.
C: ANTON
D: Valentina to the control room immediately please. Valentina to the control room.
E: O.S.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: How about you just take a pod out there and pick up the debris? She turns to listen to the voices on the intercom. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 9.
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: We don't take pods out for class two debris.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Continuous. Anton practically eats a headset microphone.
C: ANTON
D: Sanitation Station Regina out. Anton switches off the radio.
C: ANTON
D: Morons.
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: Did he just tell us to take a pod to look for a class 2 object? Jimmy hangs out next to Tilda.
C: JIMMY
D: Do you know where can I get lunch?
C: TILDA
D: Mess hall.
C: JIMMY
D: Can you show me the way?
C: ANTON
D: Oh, you'd like lunch? Know what I'd like? I'd like my computer fixed right now. Fix it.
C: JIMMY
D: Ok Anton.
C: ANTON
D: That's Captain Balvenie.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: The cargo drone ship cruises along. It's approaching the metal screw floating in space. SMASH - the drone hits the screw and EXPLODES. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 10.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Red lights and indicators flash. A siren sounds. Tilda and Anton leap into action at the controls. Jimmy comes over.
C: JIMMY
D: What's that? Is everything ok?
C: TILDA
D: Collision detected. Secondary explosion. Reading a level six debris field out there. Lots of it.
C: ANTON
D: Are there any salvage crews in the sector?
C: TILDA
D: Nope. But they're scrambling two teams. They must really want the pod.
C: ANTON
D: You think there's something good in there?
C: TILDA
D: That's my bet.
C: ANTON
D: Well I'm calling it.
C: VALENTINA
D: What happened? Is that the collision alarm?
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: Match orbit and position for pod launch. Run the checklist. Valentina report to airlock two. We're going fishing. Anton runs out.
S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY
N: The siren sounds over the intercom. Valentina towels off. She zips up her jumpsuit and runs out.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
C: 14A 14A
D: Jimmy comes over to Tilda again. She turns off the sirens. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 11.
C: JIMMY
D: Do you get down to Earth much? Tilda turns around from her terminal.
C: TILDA
D: I need to monitor the salvage operation.
C: JIMMY
D: Do you always share a salvage bonus with the entire crew?
C: TILDA
D: Three way split.
C: JIMMY
D: But we're four including me.
C: TILDA
D: You didn't sign in. You're not crew. Tilda puts on her headphones and turns away from Jimmy.
C: JIMMY
D: Where's the sign-in sheet? Tilda points at her headphones without turning to him.
C: JIMMY
D: I'll sign in later I guess.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AIRLOCK MODULE - DAY
N: Anton heroically puts on a space suit and gear. Valentina comes in.
C: VALENTINA
D: Are we saying three way split on salvage?
C: ANTON
D: I'm not cutting in the new guy.
C: VALENTINA
D: That's the good space suit.
C: ANTON
D: I got here first. And you handle the heat better. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 12.
C: VALENTINA
D: Forget it then. Anton takes off his space-pants and hands them to Valentina.
C: ANTON
D: Fine, fine. There's nothing wrong with the other suit anyway. I don't care.
C: VALENTINA
D: I just took a bath.
C: ANTON
D: I said fine. Anton takes the other suit. It's very smelly. He takes off his shirt and pants and they both dress in space suits. [Simple montage of zipping, buckling, boots, gloves.]
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: A grungy old salvage pod moves away from the Regina and thrusts off into space toward a burning debris cloud.
S: INT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY
N: Valentina and Anton are squashed up next to each other at the controls of the small pod, helmets on laps, wearing headsets.
C: VALENTINA
D: Why are we bothering with this?
C: ANTON
D: This could be the haul we've been waiting for. They're flipping out over this cargo drone.
C: VALENTINA
D: What is it?
C: ANTON
D: I don't know. It must be worth something.
C: VALENTINA
D: If there's a big salvage bonus, I want to go somewhere with a beach. Looks like something over there.
C: ANTON
D: Ya I see it. Line us up. They work the controls. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 13.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Sanitation Pod, do not approach the debris field. The area will be salvaged by an authorized crew. Repeat; do not approach the cargo drone debris field, this now is a secure sector.
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: Ground control, this is our sector and we need to keep this space clear. We got all kinds of transports coming through today.
C: GROUND CONTROL
D: Negative. Stand down- Anton turns off the radio.
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: They really want whatever was on that shuttle. It's going to be good. Anton pulls out sandwiches from a pouch with difficulty and eats.
C: VALENTINA
D: Did you bring one for me? Anton hands her a sandwich.
C: VALENTINA
D: Veggie? Have you got ham?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: You got the good space suit. Valentina looks at him, stops steering the pod.
C: ANTON
D: Fine. God damn it. Take the ham. He gives her the ham sandwich. They eat and fly the pod.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: The pod scoots through a cloud of junk and boxes floating and spinning in space. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 14.
S: INT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY
N: Anton and Valentina flip switches and use joysticks.
C: ANTON
D: Almost full. Lets dump this load and try for another pass.
C: VALENTINA
D: Got it. Closing the hatch. Hatch secure. Looks like there may be an active energy source in there. A clunk noise. Anton checks his watch.
C: ANTON
D: It's fine. Skip the safety check, we've got two minutes left. Once it's onboard, it's ours.
N: OMITTED SCENES 22-23
S: INT. STORAGE MODULE - DAY
N: The room has salvage bins, heavy machinery, gamma ray detectors, piles of cables and garbage everywhere. Large pieces of burned space junk dump into the room through a hatch. Gary's Time Cube falls in. It glows ominous blue. It starts to HUMM. A FLASH OF LIGHT ripples out of the box!
S: INT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY
N: Anton pulls up a handle like a parking brake. The sounds of hydraulic pistons O.S. Outside the window there's a Super Bright FLASH that shines on their faces from windows above.
C: ANTON
D: Did they just shoot at us?
C: VALENTINA
D: I don't know. Hold on.
C: ANTON
D: I'm seeing spots.
C: VALENTINA
D: Sensors are down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 15.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY
N: The Regina station floats alone in space, the pod docked on the side. There's nothing except the Earth below, and no city lights shine on the surface. No junk, no other ships or stations in space.
S: INT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY
N: Anton and Val press buttons and look at screens.
C: VALENTINA
D: Where's the debris field?
C: ANTON
D: Where's everything? They stare at the monitors, growing confused.
C: TILDA
D: You guys ok?
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: Tilda, look out the window. Are you seeing anything? The pod sensors are blank.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Tilda is fully awake for once. She pushes buttons. Anton's voice is a little garbled from holding the microphone too close to his mouth. He always does this, and makes the crew strain to hear him.
C: ANTON
D: Tilda, can you raise ground control?
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: Ground control, come in. Ground control switch to emergency channel. Ground control? Jimmy leans on the console next to her, holding circuits he's testing with a probe tool.
C: ANTON
D: It's not the sensors. Something happened. We're heading back in.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: It sounds like he might be holding the microphone too close. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 16.
C: TILDA
D: You think so?
S: INT. AIRLOCK MODULE - DAY
N: Anton and Valentina are in the airlock. The light turns green and they come out. Tilda helps them with their space suits.
C: ANTON
D: Any luck with Ground control?
C: TILDA
D: There's no response. On any channel. There was a bright flash of light. Did you see that?
C: ANTON
D: Yeah, we saw it too.
C: VALENTINA
D: Was it a Solar flare?
C: TILDA
D: Maybe. Doesn't seem like it. A strange HUMMING SOUND starts. Jimmy pokes his head in.
C: JIMMY
D: Good salvage?
C: ANTON
D: Who said you could take a break?
C: TILDA
D: Are you ok?
C: VALENTINA
D: We're fine. I'll get on the coms. Check out what that humming noise is. We might have taken damage.
C: ANTON
D: Report to me in ten. Tilda rolls her eyes and goes.
C: JIMMY
D: What can I do? Valentina shoves her space suit into Jimmy's hands. She and Anton walk off in the other direction. Jimmy tries to hang up the space suits on the rack. They don't fit. He tries again. Jimmy drops the space suits and follows after Tilda. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 17.
S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY
N: Tilda walks past large devices, storage tanks, incinerators and cargo containers. The HUMMING is louder. She sees the Time Cube glowing with blue light. A FLASH OF LIGHT! The humming dies down. Tilda looks around the scary, poorly lit and greasy room. Tilda turns suddenly and sees ANOTHER TILDA, in a dirtier jumpsuit, walking towards her. They both stop and stare at each other.
C: TILDA
D: Who the hell are you? TILDA2 is disoriented and scared. Her jumpsuit has different computer symbols instead of standard station number stencils.
S: INT. PASSAGEWAY B - DAY
C: 30A 30A
D: Jimmy walking looking for Tilda hears A SCREAM O.S. He goes around a corner at the end of the hall where it came from.
S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY
C: 30B 30B
D: Tilda2's arms framed, stuffing a female human leg into a hatch marked ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING. She bends down and picks up a clean dry Tilda jumpsuit off the floor. Around the corner in a different area of the room, Jimmy pokes his head in and looks around.
C: JIMMY
D: Tilda? Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque beauty and doesn't realize he's staring. She turns and meets eyes with him. He's very embarrassed and ducks back behind the machine.
C: JIMMY
D: Is this the laundry room? I was looking for the mess hall. Sorry if I surprised you. I thought I heard something. I didn't see anything. The heavy machinery starts grinding and humming. CRUNCHING, SAWING AND SPLATTERING SOUNDS. The light turns from red to green. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 18.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: Okay well I'll see you on the bridge. Sorry. Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with a start. She's different; dissociated, laconic, very nervous.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: I was just going. Tilda2 stares at him, shivering.
E: CONT'D henceforth "Tilda"
C: JIMMY
D: Hey, what's the matter? Jimmy pats her shoulder. She looks up and they meet eyes.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: Are you ok? She turns and runs away. Jimmy watches her go out the hatch.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: You forgot your shoes! Jimmy picks up some sneakers. He doesn't notice blood dripping out from below the organic waste reprocessor as he goes.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. STORAGE MODULE - DAY
N: The HUMMING SOUND again: The Time Cube sits in deep shadows, glowing with faint blue light - the light dims and the humming stops.
S: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
N: The wall is marked W.E.N.D.I. Orbital Station System Computer. Jimmy sits next to the computer with Tilda's sneakers. Wendi has a female voice this scene only. Jimmy hits buttons on the keyboard. The computer turns on.
C: JIMMY
D: Wendi?
C: WENDI
D: Hello Jimmy.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: Where is the laundry room?
C: WENDI
D: Deck C. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 19.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: Does Tilda have a boyfriend? The intercom buzzes. Anton voice is distorted to the edge of comprehensibility.
C: ANTON
D: Jimmy, how are the repairs coming? Jimmy? Get on the intercom Jimmy.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: Anton?
C: ANTON
D: You'd better be getting all over this mainframe problem. I want hourly reports every half hour.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: I can't understand-
C: ANTON
D: Just get on it, God damn it!
C: JIMMY
D: Roger that. Jimmy opens the top binder from a tall stack of binders. The screen turns off.
C: JIMMY
D: Wendi? He hits buttons. It doesn't work now.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT
N: The vast view of the Earth from space. Pretty. The sunrise terminator approaches Western Canada, as we drift slowly backwards into peaceful space. Nothing else is in orbit. The Sanitation Station comes into view.
S: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jimmy sips juice from a sippy cup and goes back to soldering wires in an open panel near the screen. He wears safety goggles, reads from a technical binder marked SONOVAC SYSTEMS REPAIR. The tall stack of binders is now a mess of them opened, scattered around. OMITTED SCENES 35-36 Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 19A.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Valentina sits at the communications station and holds a radio microphone. Anton works at consoles across the room. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 20.
C: VALENTINA
D: This is the western alliance sanitation station Regina, in orbit, does anyone receive this message? Please respond. This is the sanitation station Regina, Please respond. She puts down the microphone, tweaks some knobs and pushes some buttons. Anton comes over to her and presses buttons at her station.
C: VALENTINA
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: I'm trying to figure out what you're doing wrong. She slams shut a procedure binder. Jimmy comes in.
C: VALENTINA
D: Have you got the mainframe back up?
C: JIMMY
D: It's taking me a bit longer than I thought. I might need to call down for some parts.
C: VALENTINA
D: There's nothing out there.
C: ANTON
D: I don't see how that's possible. It has to be a communications problem.
C: VALENTINA
D: We're having a communication problem right now. I'm telling you there's nothing out there. We need Wendi to do an analysis.
C: JIMMY
D: Why didn't anyone tell me? I have to get back to Earth.
C: VALENTINA
D: That's not happening any time soon.
C: JIMMY
D: So we're stranded. The full weight of their predicament settles on them. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 21.
S: INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: A large table, kitchenette, free weights, shake weight, book shelf with board games. Val's Rubber Duckie sits on the shelf with a few other personal items. Anton cycles an elliptical exercise machine. Valentina comes in with leotards and stretches next to him. Anton stops.
C: ANTON
D: Any luck?
C: VALENTINA
D: No.
C: ANTON
D: You're worried. Don't worry. We're going to be fine. He leans in to give her a kiss, she leans away from his kiss as she stretches. He sits to stretch next to her.
C: VALENTINA
D: I'm going to put in for reassignment.
C: ANTON
D: Not this again. Val-
C: VALENTINA
D: There's always something on deep space transports. A chance to see the galaxy a little.
C: ANTON
D: It's all the same.
C: VALENTINA
D: Then maybe I'll realize what I'm missing and come back.
C: ANTON
D: What about us? What about me?
C: VALENTINA
D: I'm sick of you. I want to puke every time I hear your voice. You completely disgust me in every way.
C: ANTON
D: If this is because of the other night, I already told you that was because of the bad egg sandwiches I ate after the refrigeration system went down. That was a one-off thing. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 22.
C: VALENTINA
D: It isn't because you had indigestion.

S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - NIGHT
N: Tilda pokes a water filtration system. A sign says DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE. She pokes the wires. A SNAP of high voltage short circuit. She takes out her finger, it's burnt a little. She pokes the power box again, searching and exploring, unfamiliar with the world around her and troubled.
S: INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jimmy, Anton and Val play scrabble. Val makes a word.
C: VALENTINA
D: "Giraffe." Eighteen points. Anton writes down the score. Jimmy turns the board to face him. Jimmy places tiles as he eats his soy protein sandwich. He spells "blorxr" and writes down his points. Valentina eyeballs him. Anton rotates the game board. He ponders what word to make. He moves his letters around.
C: VALENTINA
D: That's not a word.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: Do I have to play?

D: We need to take breaks. Keep to a schedule. Schedule says scrabble. How's your sandwich?

E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: Fifteen seconds overtime. Hurry up and make a word.
C: ANTON
D: I'm making a word. Tilda knocks little containers around searching the cupboards. She carelessly knocks things off the shelf.
C: VALENTINA
D: Five seconds.
C: ANTON
D: Tilda would you stop making that racket? What the hell are you looking for?
C: VALENTINA
D: You need to make decisions faster.

C: ANTON
D: It's totally inexplicable. Jimmy gets up.
C: JIMMY
D: You guys need a minute?
C: ANTON
D: Sit down. We're playing scrabble. A FLASH outside the window. Tilda turns, very scared, and looks out the window. Jimmy goes to the window next to her.
C: JIMMY
D: What was that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 25.
N: SMASH! The sound of an impact, like a car accident. The room trembles. METAL CREAKING NOISES. Things jiggle and fall off the shelves. Tilda stares at Jimmy, scared. Val and Anton are bracing themselves for more. The shaking stops.
C: ANTON
D: That was an impact.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Red lights blink, warnings flash on monitors. Valentina and Anton run in and sit, hit buttons. Jimmy takes a station and presses buttons too, scared.

D: Where did it hit us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 26.
N: Jimmy's computer screen shows the exterior of the space station - a DENTED PANEL with something yellow stuck in it. The screen is too fuzzy to tell what it is. Anton looks over Jimmy's shoulder.
C: JIMMY
D: What is that?
C: ANTON
D: It looks like... I don't know. An asteroid would have done more damage.
C: JIMMY
D: It's small... and yellow.

C: VALENTINA
D: Hmm.
C: ANTON
D: Is this your rubber duckie?
C: VALENTINA
D: It looks like it.

E: CONT'D

E: CONT'D out of nowhere
C: ANTON
D: You have to connect the words. Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the message.

C: ANTON
D: Are they more fond or less fond than memories of me?
C: VALENTINA
D: I don't know. It's not all about you. I want to get off this station Anton. I wanted out of here before we were stranded. I need a change of scenery. I'm sick of this place.
C: ANTON
D: So, whoever gave you the rubber duck has nothing to do with your change of heart.
C: VALENTINA
D: No. It has nothing to do with Gary.
C: ANTON
D: Oh, Gary? So we have a name now. Right... Gary. So what's Gary up to these days? Do you keep in touch? Valentina grabs her duck, bath robe and towel from the room.
C: VALENTINA
D: I haven't spoken to him in years. He was just a friend.

D: No stay like this. Can you show me the station video monitors? A grid of grainy black and white video cameras comes up. One screen shows Valentina walking down the hall angrily with her bath robe, towel and 2 rubber duckies. Another monitor shows a medium shot of Tilda kneeling in engineering area next to a wall panel marked T518. She looks around nervously and opens it.
C: WENDI
D: Jimmy, I appear to have an open access port in my T518 array. Jimmy zooms in, it's grainy. Tilda pulls out a row of circuits labeled "T518 D7", removes a small circuit board and looks at it. She closes the panel. Jimmy watches Tilda on the monitor screen: she sits back and unzips her flight suit. He leans in towards the monitor.

E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: What's your T518 array used for?
C: WENDI
D: T518 is a language processor for human interface systems. On the monitor we can see Tilda take the circuit board and jam it into her torso on her right side. The screen garbles slightly with electrical interference. Jimmy zooms in but it's hard to see what's going on. Tilda rubs her side, there's no mark and the circuit board is gone. She zips up her jumpsuit and tries to talk with fax sounds.
C: TILDA ZZZBBOOOORRRRRPXKXS!

C: JIMMY
D: What's wrong with the coffee machine?
C: ANTON
D: How should I know?
C: JIMMY

He turns it over and examines it.

N: Valentina snoozes with a wet cloth over her eyes in the tub. The FLASH of light passes through. The burned space-duckie sits on the tub edge, as if watching her. Strange HUMMING from Jimmy's device is heard. THE DUCKIE'S EYES MOVE TO FOCUS ON VALENTINA. Valentina takes off a wet cloth from her face and looks around. The duckie doesn't move.

S: INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - NIGHT
N: It's dark and scary. The duckie scuttles in and out of shadows, leaving a thin trail of mucus. Just before it disappears we see its silhouette rear up near the door and let loose a bone-chilling throaty howl of rage.

C: ANTON
D: Calm down.
C: VALENTINA
D: I am calm. Valentina throws a towel at him.
C: ANTON
D: Why are you mad at me?
C: VALENTINA
D: Because you're excluding me.
C: ANTON
D: If you were in the control room instead of taking baths, you might know what's going on. By the way, you and this Gary guy were a lot more than friends. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 44.
C: VALENTINA
D: How would you know?
C: ANTON
D: Wendi told me.

C: ANTON
D: Lets put the Gary stuff aside. Maybe you used to see him, maybe you were just friends, whatever. The important thing is you're over him and you're with me now. Lets not fight like this.
C: VALENTINA
D: You're right Anton. Anton is encouraged by her sweet voice and friendly tone.
C: ANTON
D: Good.
C: VALENTINA
D: What's the point of me fighting with a shit for brains, whiney little half pint control freak with no balls, stinky stupid fuck with no sense of style, charm or personal hygiene.
C: ANTON
D: So you don't want to talk right now. I'm going to go get a cup of coffee. Why don't you adjust your attitude and join me when you're ready. Anton goes.

E: MORE

D: We discovered that this station is the nexus point of all the damaged realities. We had just once chance to send me here, to take your Tilda's place, in order to stop this time cube from being activated.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: My station is the nexus?
C: VALENTINA
D: But we didn't activate anything. Did you turn it on? Jimmy lifts the box.
C: JIMMY
D: It's got some kind of port at the bottom which I haven't figured out.
C: ANTON
D: Put down the time cube. Jimmy puts it down.
C: VALENTINA
D: Did you turn it on?
C: JIMMY
D: No. Not really. It turned itself on. I might have dropped it. It was on before I found it. BEEP BEEP BEEP - a beeping sound.
C: ANTON
D: Wendi, what's the matter?
C: WENDI
D: A power fluctuation has been detected in my command relays in the control room.
E: O.S.

C: VALENTINA
D: Anton?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: Go ahead Val.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: It looks like a false alarm.
C: ANTON
D: Okay. Come to the rec room. I made coffee. She turns off the intercom. There's some slime.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: Who's been messing with the- Valentina looks to her left. There's a rubber duck sitting there. She's confused. It moves toward her. She's paralyzed with horror. It has tentacles peeking out under it.

D: Oh my god. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 49.
E: CONT'D
N: She starts to move away.
C: GARY
D: Please, don't run. My legs are short, and it hurts. Valentina. It hurts to exist. I shouldn't be here.
C: VALENTINA
D: What the... Fff... Duck?
C: GARY
D: I'm stuck in a transdimensional rift across the twelfth dimension. Gary lurches toward Valentina. She recoils.
C: GARY
D: Don't run away.
E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: What do you want?
C: GARY
D: I need to get back to my dimension. I need my time cube. Valentina, it's me, Gary. Gary moves very close to her. He puts a tentacle on her hand.

C: ANTON
D: So... you were saying you came here to replace our Tilda and stop someone from using this Time Cube, but he's not here. And what happened to our Tilda?
C: TILDA
D: An accident happened.
C: ANTON
D: Is she around here? Somewhere? Anton eats his sandwich.
C: TILDA
D: No.
C: ANTON
D: Well, you can see why I'd be concerned to hear a member of my crew is missing.
C: TILDA
D: Things didn't go as planned. I couldn't explain it to the other Tilda. Professor Pinback isn't here like he was supposed to be.
C: ANTON
D: Wait a minute. Gary Pinback?
C: TILDA
D: Yes.
C: ANTON
D: That's the guy who's supposed to be on this station?
C: TILDA
D: Yes.

C: VALENTINA
D: How did this happen, Gary? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51.
C: GARY
D: There was an accident. The cube was activated in my escape and I was shunted through a dimensional vortex into this stupid body. But I was on my way here for you.
C: VALENTINA
D: For me?
C: GARY
D: I promised you that one day I'd give you the world. I came here to keep that promise. I can take you away from all this.
C: VALENTINA
D: Gary... That was years ago.
C: GARY
D: Until I can activate the time cube I will continue to bleed across the dimensional boundary... I don't know what I will become.
C: VALENTINA
D: That sounds painful.
C: GARY
D: It's very painful. I need your help Valentina. There isn't much time. ALARMS GO OFF - RED SIREN LIGHTS. Valentina turns to look around. She turns back and Gary is gone.

C: ANTON
D: I'm going to the control room. You keep an eye on... the robot. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 51A.
C: JIMMY
D: She has a name. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 52.

D: I'm telling you, if that son of a bitch is on my station I'm going to find him. You two stay put. Anton leaves. Jimmy sits next to Tilda.
C: JIMMY
D: Hey. What's the matter?
C: TILDA
D: The cube has been activated. There's nothing I can do to stop it. Infinite universes will be destroyed.
C: JIMMY
D: We can try. Look, last week I never thought I'd be working orbit. Everyone told me it was impossible. I didn't have the training. I didn't have the stomach. People said, that Jimmy, he's never getting off Earth. But I got myself together and paid a guy a hundred and fifty bucks to forge my certification forms and the next thing you know, here I am.
C: TILDA
D: I didn't mean to kill her. The other Tilda.
C: JIMMY
D: I'm sure you didn't. Hey, lets go use Wendi's cameras to see if we can find Gary if he's on board.
C: TILDA
D: Ok.

D: I don't know. The control relays are all offline.
C: ANTON
D: Gary is onboard the station. Valentina freezes.
C: VALENTINA

D: Have you talked to him?
C: VALENTINA
D: No.

C: VALENTINA
D: Get off my case Anton. I don't know what you're talking about. Who said Gary is here?
C: ANTON
D: Tilda.
C: VALENTINA
D: She says she's a robot. Do you believe everything everyone tells you?
C: ANTON
D: You got the second duck from him. Admit that.
C: VALENTINA
D: If you want answers we should go down there and grill the robot.
C: ANTON
D: Fine. Lets start with that.
C: VALENTINA
D: She's probably the one who blew out the control systems. Whatever we do, we can't leave them with the cube anymore.
C: ANTON
D: What's the big deal with this cube? SUDDENLY THE ROOM JOLTS. Red warnings on monitors.
N: OMITTED SCENES 88-99
S: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tilda and Jimmy brace themselves. The room trembles.

D: We're in the computer room.

N: OMITTED SCENES 101-107
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Val and Anton sit at the controls as the room shakes. Evil metal creaking noises tear through. Alarms sound. More screens turn to static and garbled.
C: VALENTINA
D: Anton?
C: ANTON
D: Something is definitely wrong. Check the air pressure.
C: VALENTINA
D: Anton!
C: ANTON
D: What?
C: VALENTINA
D: Okay. I haven't been totally honest.
C: ANTON
D: Oh? The rubber duck scuttles across the floor behind them but Anton doesn't see it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 56.
E: duck 2
C: VALENTINA
D: Gary is onboard.
C: ANTON
D: Where is the bastard? How the hell did he get on the station?
C: VALENTINA
D: You brought him in.
C: ANTON
D: When did I do that? Valentina notices that Gary is in front of Anton, hiding on a shelf, dripping slime.
E: Duck 2
C: VALENTINA
D: He's just come for the time cube. That's all he needs to get back to his dimension and put things right. Its eyes glow faintly red.
C: ANTON
D: Sure. Naturally. He just wants his time cube. He's not interested in you?
C: VALENTINA
D: He's the only one that can send us home and set things right. Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there.
C: ANTON
D: What the hell is that? Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs deeper into the corner of the shelf.
C: ANTON
D: Anton, you're scaring him.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: Him? Hello little guy. Don't be afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey there. Val what the hell is this thing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 57.
E: CONT'D
N: He gets ready to fire.
C: VALENTINA
D: That's Gary. Anton slowly moves closer to it.
C: ANTON
D: What? This thing? Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear.
C: VALENTINA
D: No! Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click.
C: ANTON
D: That's odd. The batteries must be- Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken. Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind him, out of his sight.
C: ANTON
D: Where did that little bastard go?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Valentina pulls a first-aid kit off the wall and opens it. Anton has a trivial cut on his head.

D: It sure is strong for a little guy.
C: VALENTINA
D: I told you to be careful.
C: ANTON
D: Why didn't you just tell me about him? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 58.
C: VALENTINA
D: I tried to tell you. Valentina cleans his cut. She digs through the kit for tape.
C: VALENTINA
D: How is your head?
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON
D: It hurts. Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton.
C: ANTON
D: Did you know what this thing was when we brought it on board?
E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: No, of course not.
C: ANTON
D: Look what he did.
C: VALENTINA
D: He was frightened.
C: ANTON
D: Whose side are you on? A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he goes to one side of the room next to the hall.
C: ANTON
D: Can you see it?
E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: No. Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his laser blaster - his holster is empty.
C: ANTON
D: Something is coming. Stay back. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 59.
C: VALENTINA
D: Anton wait!
C: ANTON
D: I won't hurt him much. I'll just subdue him, okay? That's fair, isn't it? Jimmy runs around the corner into the room.
C: ANTON AHHHH!
D: Anton's war-cry is spent on Jimmy who jumps back frightened.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY AHHH! ANTON
D: What are you doing?
C: JIMMY
D: I'm looking for you!
C: ANTON
D: We have a guest onboard. Tilda follows carrying the Time Cube.

D: A rubber duck attacked me.

D: Yes. And it's growing.
C: JIMMY
D: How big is it?
C: ANTON
D: Like a small dog maybe. And it bites. Hard. What have you got?
C: VALENTINA
D: Rice, butter, carrot jam.
C: ANTON
D: God help us.
C: VALENTINA
D: Ham.
C: ANTON
D: Ah, ham. Give me the ham. Valentina reluctantly gives up the ham sandwich. They eat. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 61.

D: We checked with Wendi. It doesn't look like Gary is on board.
C: ANTON
D: The duck... is Gary.
C: TILDA
D: How?
C: ANTON
D: Valentina has something she'd like to tell us.
C: VALENTINA
D: I don't know all the facts.
C: ANTON
D: Go on. Please.
C: VALENTINA
D: The time cube sent him here through the duck. It was an accident.
C: JIMMY
D: This is the Gary that Tilda says destroyed Earth. He's a duck?
C: VALENTINA
D: He's on this station. He's part man, part rubber duck, part something else.
C: ANTON
D: And I'm going to kill him.
C: VALENTINA
D: How is that going to help?
C: ANTON
D: He tried to eat my face, Val.
C: VALENTINA
D: He's going through a lot of changes. He's not thinking straight. But he's the only one that set things right if we give him the Time Cube.
C: TILDA
D: He's not here to help us.
C: VALENTINA
D: I suppose you've helped us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 62.

D: I'm with Tilda on this one for now.

D: You're what?
C: JIMMY
D: Me too.
C: VALENTINA
D: Shut up Jimmy, no one asked you. METAL CREAKING NOISE O.S., sound of cables snapping.
C: ANTON
D: Sorry Val. Plan A: we get control of Gary. We're going to assume he's only going to keep smashing things. Jimmy, Tilda, work on Wendi. If we can get eyes on him and close doors remotely we can trap him- Another SMASHING noise echoes through the frame of the station. Distant creaking metal sounds.
C: ANTON
D: Val and I will look for the duck.
E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: No.
C: ANTON
D: You said yourself he's not thinking straight. I'm definitely not giving him the Time Cube - that's what got us into this mess.
C: JIMMY
D: Do we have any weapons? Anton opens a drawer. He spills out a handful of disposable plastic knives on the table.
C: ANTON
D: Everyone take one. They do. Jimmy bends his. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 63.
C: JIMMY
D: No lasers? Microwave rifles?
C: ANTON
D: Laser's broke. Make do. Jimmy grabs the pieces of the broken laser pistol, plastic knives and half a sandwich in his pockets, then puts the Time Cube into a backpack. Anton takes the backpack.
C: ANTON
D: I'll take that. Jimmy lets him have it.
E: CONT'D
C: ANTON

D: No. We should split up. Use the intercom if you find him.

D: What are you going to do with him Anton?
C: ANTON
D: I'm going to ask him nicely to stop destroying my space station for starters. That's reasonable isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 64.
C: VALENTINA
D: I suppose.

D: Then I'm going to kill him as hard as I can.

C: JIMMY
D: What are you going to do?
C: TILDA
D: Turn around. Tilda unzips her jumpsuit.

D: Ok. Jimmy turns around. Tilda sticks the RS232 cable down the front of her jumpsuit bottoms area and feels around with the cable until she finds her socket. CLICK.

C: WENDI
D: Hello Tilda.
E: O.S.

D: It was the duck.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: Gary? What is it trying to do?
C: TILDA
D: Look. The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving on that line toward the `red zone'. "WARNING" text blinks.
C: TILDA
D: The station's orbit has been altered. We're going to hit the atmosphere.

C: JIMMY
D: You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands.
C: JIMMY
D: Ow!
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: Oh Jimmy. You don't have a static discharge buffer. You're completely made of meat.
C: JIMMY
D: Meat that loves you, Tilda.
C: TILDA
D: It may not be possible for us to overcome our physiological differences in this universe.
C: JIMMY
D: It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Valentina looks under the communications equipment. There's a half-open compartment at the end of the room, filled with deep shadows. A wall panel is also open. She moves slowly toward it. She peeks in the wall panel. It's empty. She moves on toward the other compartment. Valentina reaches slowly toward the open compartment, her heart racing.
C: VALENTINA
D: Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 69.

C: VALENTINA
D: We split up. What are you doing here?

D: We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him?
C: VALENTINA
D: He's not between here and engineering.
C: JIMMY
D: Then there's only one place left he could be.
S: INT. CREW QUARTERS ~ VALENTINA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Anton is looking at shady spots under the sleeping cots, holding the elliptical machine handle as a club. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 70. The room is full of dark corners; each one seems to hold the promise of aliens bursting out. Anton explores cautiously.
C: TILDA
D: Anton! Anton spins around. Tilda points past him. Anton looks. The rubber duck is on the shelf! Anton smashes it with the handle!
E: O.S.
C: ANTON
D: Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak.
C: TILDA
D: That's not it.

C: TILDA
D: It's horrible.

C: 122B 122B ANTON
D: Where are you? Hiding. Not so tough now are ya Gary? You'd better hide. Scuttle sound. Anton goes left, toward his coffee table, re- aiming his handlebar, guessing where Gary is hiding. Anton is almost at the door. Anton turns right. The shadow of Gary rises up next to his bed: the tentacles were just the tip: it's grown larger now. It bares teeth.
E: Duck 3
C: GARY
D: Where is the Time Cube?
C: ANTON
D: What Time Cube?
C: GARY
D: I must have it.
C: ANTON
D: You come on my space station, try to steal my girlfriend, turn the place upside down and make demands for time cubes. Who do you think I am? Anton prepares to strike. The duck trembles with excitement and rage. Anton grits his teeth.

D: Tilda watches from the hallway outside Anton's room: A SUDDEN FLURRY OF MOTION as Gary attacks Anton, SNARLING. Pillows and household items are torn up and thrown around. Crashing sounds. Tilda ducks down, unable to watch the violence. Sounds: Anton yelling, things breaking. Violent crunches and punches. Clanging. Blood sprays on the wall next to Tilda. She's horrified. CUT TO: Jimmy and Valentina come from around the corner at the far end of the hall and stop when they hear the sound of THUMP SCUTTLE SCUTTLE. They cautiously peer down the hall.

S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Valentina sits in a flight deck chair looking at red emergency monitor warning messages. She sits facing the passageway, looks at the blood on her hands. A husky rasping breathing sound comes from Gary who hides around the edge of the doorway.
C: VALENTINA
D: Gary. Why are you doing this? Gary's voice answers from the shadows. It sounds bigger.
C: GARY
D: For you.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: But you'll kill me as well if the station falls out of orbit.
C: GARY
D: So, are you're with this Anton guy now?
C: VALENTINA
D: I was for a while. Not sure now.
C: GARY

C: VALENTINA
D: You're mutating faster and faster.
E: CONT'D
C: GARY
D: I could put everything back the way it was. Would you want that? Would you want to keep living on this rusty space dumpster, forever? With this Anton guy? Valentina looks into the shadowy dark.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: You didn't need to hurt him Gary. Gary's eyes glimmer in the darkness. Some tentacle too.
C: GARY
D: Come with me. We will return to Earth, to the dawn of man. There we will lay the foundations of a million-year dynasty, and rule an empire over all space and time. We will dominate the galaxy together.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: Together?
C: GARY
D: Once I have the time cube, the universe is ours. Valentina, I came here for you. I did this all for you.
E: O.S.
C: VALENTINA
D: That's so sweet. She decides to step into the darkness. A tentacle wraps around her as she disappears into the dark.
S: INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tilda opens the medical kit, snaps on rubber gloves and straps on a surgical mask. Jimmy brings napkins. She goes the monitor near the hallway. Tilda presses buttons on the screen. The monitor screen says "MEDICAL DATABASE DOWNLOAD" Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 74.
C: TILDA
D: Jimmy, our orbit is still decaying. We have to stop our descent. You have to go to the control room.

D: Ha. Sucker. Jimmy dramatically hits a big button on the keyboard.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. STORAGE MODULE - NIGHT
N: A big light blinks green next to the open door. CU on the door frame as the door closes. LOCKING SOUND. A TENTACLE slaps angrily against the hatch window.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jimmy works on the controls. Valentina comes up behind him in a sneaky way, he doesn't notice. She's holding a toolbox.
C: JIMMY
D: He's locked in. That should buy us some time but we have to hurry. Help me figure out the thruster controls. Valentina creeps up right behind Jimmy. Jimmy turns to see her too late: she bashes Jimmy in the head with the tool box and tosses it aside. Valentina uses the keyboard. Jimmy rolls over, regains focus.
C: JIMMY
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: VALENTINA
D: I'm leaving Jimmy. I'm done.
C: JIMMY
D: Where are you going? Tilda appears behind Valentina and hits her in the back of her head with the toolbox. Valentina goes down. Valentina rubs her head. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 76.

N: Tilda finishes binding Valentina to a chair with tape.
C: VALENTINA
D: Give Gary the time cube. You don't know him like I know him. He'll help us. He'll save us. Tilda is not convinced. Jimmy is on the soldering damaged circuits in a the control panel. He wears safety goggles. The Time Cube sits on the floor behind him.
C: JIMMY
D: He's a monster.
C: VALENTINA
D: It's just a phase. Jimmy closes the console he's working on. Presses buttons. The room shifts to the left.
C: TILDA
D: We're entering the upper atmosphere. Jimmy stands up. Jimmy wipes the sweat off his face.
C: JIMMY
D: That's bad, isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 77.
C: TILDA
D: We have fifteen minutes.
C: JIMMY
D: There's too much damage to fix in fifteen minutes.
C: TILDA
D: Maybe we should try to make a deal. A low RUMBLE sound.
C: JIMMY
D: We can't allow Gary to have total control of time and space. Jimmy gets back down into the computer panel. Tilda kneels next to him, watching. Valentina looks at the Time Cube on the floor and wriggles in her duct tape bonds.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT
N: The station starts to hit the atmosphere and shake.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jimmy and Tilda press buttons and flip switches on the consoles as they talk. The room shimmies and shakes more and more. The RUMBLE sound increases. Jimmy turns one more switch. BLEEP BLORP: the computer screen flickers on.

D: We have... fourteen minutes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 78.
C: TILDA
D: Leave Wendi to me. Jimmy reaches into an open mess of cables in a compartment and tosses Tilda an RS232 cable. She turns away from him, unzips her jumpsuit and plugs in her plug as before once Jimmy stops staring. Jimmy goes under the central console and sneaks glances to figure out what exactly she's doing. She zips up again with the cable sticking out, and concentrates. The monitors flash on. Jimmy spills out the tool box, grabs tools and sticks his head back under the central console.
S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT
N: The station starts to hit the hazy atmosphere and shakes more. Parts heat up. An antenna burns off.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The room shimmies and shakes. Valentina is straining against her duct tape wrapping. It's loosening. They don't notice. Jimmy is wriggling around in the confined area.
C: TILDA
D: We're entering the mesosphere.
E: O.S.
C: JIMMY
D: It's ugly in here. I don't know where the break is.

D: Hello Tilda.
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: Hi Wendi. The RUMBLE sound increases.
C: JIMMY
D: How's it going?! Jimmy is jammed deep in the panel, where he uses a circuit tester, probing. He wipes off his sweaty brow.
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: Try bank 5, on unit LBJ425. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 79.
N: Jimmy shifts around, probes.

D: Here? Tilda is focused on the monitors, doesn't notice Valentina is loose of her duct tape and stands up behind them.
C: TILDA
D: Try the next circuit.
S: INT. PASSAGEWAY B - NIGHT
N: We can catch glimpses of Gary lurching past. He's bigger. Hulking.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tilda sits, searching with her brain using her RS232 cable patch into the computer. Abstract data scrolls fast down the screens. It reflects in her eyes.
C: JIMMY
D: Is this it?
E: O.S.
C: TILDA
D: No. Hurry. Valentina gently picks up the Time Cube and marvels at it for a brief moment before backing out behind Tilda and out the door, stumbling on the bulkhead a little and running off. Jimmy reaches way deep into the panel and probes a circuit.
C: JIMMY
D: Here?
C: TILDA
D: You're getting closer. The rooms shakes suddenly extra hard. A CREAK of strained metal. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 80.
S: INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
N: We can just make out Gary and his tentacles dragging himself around a corner.
S: INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jimmy reaches as far as humanly possible with his logic probe and touches a difficult-to-reach circuit way in the back, in a maze of jumbled blinking lights, cables and circuits:
C: JIMMY
D: There's your problem. He pulls out a smoldering burned circuit.
C: JIMMY
D: The midrange data processor is burned out. I think we need it to control the thrust vector.
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: You can't fix it?
C: JIMMY
D: No way. No... I don't have the parts. This is serious.
C: JIMMY
D: We're dead.
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: No we're not. The room shakes more. Tilda unplugs the RS232 cable from the wall and grabs a cable cutter from Jimmy's belt. She pulls down her jumpsuit shoulder exposing her back tattoo lines again. Jimmy watches in fascination. Tilda jabs herself and cuts a 6 inch hole in her abdomen. There's no blood. She reaches in and feels around.
C: JIMMY
D: I wish you would warn me if you're going to do something like that.
C: TILDA
D: Wait... Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 81.
N: Tilda grunts and grimaces - something rips and her hand comes out with an organic/electric device with blinking lights. Wires and cables poke out of the hole in her stomach and drip with goo, she tucks them back in painfully with one hand and holds herself closed as she hands the device to Jimmy.
C: TILDA
D: Try using this. Jimmy takes it with a mixture of horror and curiosity.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: Don't you need it?
C: TILDA
D: I have two of them. Jimmy notices Valentina is gone.
C: JIMMY
D: Where's Val? Tilda turns.
C: TILDA
D: The time Cube!
C: JIMMY
D: Hold on, let me plug this in. Jimmy ducks back under the panel and stuffs the strange device into the socket of the circuit board. Sparks fly and lights start blinking! The SOUND of the midrange data processor humming back to life. Green lights on monitors. Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up.
C: JIMMY
D: It worked! Jimmy sees one monitor still shows ERROR.
E: CONT'D
C: JIMMY
D: It's not working.
E: CONT'D
C: TILDA
D: Thruster control is on a different circuit. It's still offline. Tilda sinks into a chair. The effort has worn her down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 82.
C: JIMMY
D: It should have worked.
C: TILDA
D: There's another break in the control path.
C: JIMMY
D: Are you okay?
C: TILDA
D: I'll be okay. But there's only one way to target the thrusters.
C: JIMMY
D: How?
C: TILDA
D: Manually.
C: JIMMY
D: You mean outside?
C: TILDA
D: Yes outside. The digital vector diagram monitor shows their orbit falling into the `danger zone' past the `Kármán line'. Jimmy sees Tilda suffer.
C: JIMMY
D: Take this. Jimmy hands Tilda Anton's blaster - Jimmy found time to repair it with wires, duct tape, and junk.
C: TILDA
D: You'll need it.
C: JIMMY
D: I'll be ok. Jimmy gets up to go, summons his courage.
C: TILDA
D: Jimmy, in ten minutes the outer hull will burn away completely. Hurry.

D: It's go time.

E: CONT'D

D: Gary! I have the Time Cube! Gary stays in the shadows, nearby. We can see him quiver and jiggle as he speaks, suggestions of a jaw moving, but lots of amorphous tentacles and bulging monstrous shapes.

S: EXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT
N: Jimmy [in spacesuit] moves along the exterior of the station. Atmosphere blows past him. The air is thin but they're moving fast. Smoke trails from burning station bits stream past. The station shakes. Jimmy is terrified, holds on for dear life. He sneezes in his helmet. The glass is all splattered. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 86.

C: GARY
D: So this is how it's going to be.
C: VALENTINA
D: Yup. Valentina swings high at Gary and catches him upside the head. He snarls and bashes her with a tentacle, knocking away the handlebar. She gives him a few punches, kick in the duck nuts. Gary knocks her down by the sandwich machine. Anton grabs a chair. A tentacle comes at Anton - it pulls him over by his neck, he drops the chair, and is thrown down by the hatch. Gary side steps quickly, looking around. He sees the Time Cube on the counter and sends a tentacle at it. Valentina stabs the tentacle with a plastic fork and it pulls back, spraying green blood and mucous in an unexpectedly heavy geyser over Valentina, Anton and the room. Valentina throws the time cube over the table to Anton, who catches it. Gary refocusses on Val and moves toward her. He bashes her with a tentacle sending her over the table. Space Milkshake Prod.

D: Hey. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE - 11/12/11 88.
E: O.S.
N: Gary and Val turn toward the hallway: Tilda's there. She throws the laser blaster to Valentina who catches it and aims at Gary. Gary freezes, afraid. Valentina takes great pleasure at pulling the trigger. ZZZZORCH! A beam blasts from the blaster at Gary, instantly causing an immense SPLAT! Valentina opens her eyes to see it rain Gary bits. Anton comes over.

D: Is that my blaster?

N: Jimmy at the thruster, he grips the joystick, feeling woozy.
C: JIMMY
D: Here goes nothing. He's sweating profusely. He looks at his glove - it's burning. There's orange-glowing cinders flying off his boots. Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of the thruster next to him. Over the course of five long seconds, the station stops falling. The thruster stops firing. He's burning more now. His suit POPS A LEAK! Smoke whizzes out of a hole in his arm. He stares at it.
E: Wide shot

D: Oh crap.
E: CONT'D
