One, NOW EAU WIFE, mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other OLDER WIFE. Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS CONTINUE... INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: "not yet." As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear: "Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." "That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.) Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes her head.

Helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts... ... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from the top.

And just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. Adrenal surge. Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry hall below. SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING. The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow. Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable face... The SIRENS are LOUDER... Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs. Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

N: As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat. Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes off target as...
S: EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT
N: The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down. On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around at... Kimble. Rising between the seats. A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head. Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to find Kimble.
C: OLD GUARD
D: You. You're a doctor. C'mere.
E: to Kimble
N: He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.
C: OLD GUARD
D: Do something.
N: Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.
C: KIMBLE
D: He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. Fast.
C: OLD GUARD
D: ZL.
N: In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it just settling? With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young Guard's bleeding. ANGLE UNDER SEAT We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the opening. BACK TO KIMBLE A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a growing vibration.
C: KIMBLE
D: Just where the hell are we?
N: The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.
C: OLD GUARD
D: Oh, shit...
S: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT
N: The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend grows bright by the light of an approaching train.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges to his side.
C: KIMBLE
D: It's locked. Where're your keys?
S: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT
N: Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus. The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.
C: KIMBLE
D: Which one? This? This one?!
N: Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws the door open. Grabs Young Guard.
C: KIMBLE
D: Help me get him -
N: But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out the shattered windshield. ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...
S: EXT. BUS - NIGHT
N: ... and hits the ground running the other way. The locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT
N: Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard hold a look.
S: EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT
N: As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.
S: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT
N: Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard behind him. He slings the man clear. SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer. For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus. The train light X-rays him. Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a dozen mincing steps before... IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, splitting it open. Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his feet, still running feverish half-steps. An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its flanks. The train burns past the wounded Guard. Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life: Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being chased by a fire-breathing locomotive. The train burrows to a stop. Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices something in his hand. It's the key-ring.
S: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
N: Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.
C: COPELAND
D: Give me that.
E: O.S.
N: Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his own chains.
C: COPELAND
D: You listen to me. I don't give a damn which way you go, just don't follow me.
N: Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT
N: News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators. Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. marshals emerge: BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick shithouse. RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds fully-equipped. POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during
T: nut-cuttin' time.
N: NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5. From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media spectacle.
C: GERARD
D: Good lord...
C: REFRO
D: What is this... a circus?
N: As a group they begin moving along the service road above the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials. Biggs spots something...
C: BIGGS
D: Point of impact.
N: ... and branches off.
C: GERARD
D: Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.
C: BIGGS
D: Shit. Come on.
E: to Newman
N: They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain with Gerard. A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he sees Gerard's Marshall star.
C: GERARD
D: How ya doing? Who's in charge?
C: TROOPER
D: Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the lights -
N: Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him. Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's about to happen. ANGLE - OLD GUARD Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the b.g., listening.
C: OLD GUARD
D: ... train was bearin' down on us, fast. I don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus.
C: SHERIFF
D: You coulda both been killed.
C: OLD GUARD
D: I know, but hell, he's my partner. Woulda done the same for me.
N: The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.
C: GERARD
D: Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.
C: SHERIFF
D: I'll be with you in a minute.
E: annoyed
N: The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos of all four prisoners.
C: SHERIFF
D: For the record. These three dead. And this one...
E: to Old Guard
N: He switches to a photo of Kimble.
C: OLD GUARD
D: Well, everything happened so fast... Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.
E: bites lip, decides
N: Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.
C: SHERIFF
D: You get some rest.
N: He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.
C: SHERIFF
D: Looks like you came a long way for nothing. My men've already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: ANGLE - CULVERT Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees something. He orders Newman into the muck after it. GERARD Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.
C: GERARD
D: With all due respect, may I suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east of -
C: SHERIFF
D: Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? Prisoners are all dead. The only thing check-points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls.
N: Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.
C: GERARD
D: Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for that to happen... So, I'll be taking over the investigation.
E: beat
C: SHERIFF
D: On whose authority?
C: GERARD
D: By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois...
N: Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.
C: SHERIFF
D: Okay. You want jurisdiction over this mess, you got it. Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us.
E: back-down beat to assistants
N: He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud. Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.
C: GERARD
D: Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room.
N: Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command. Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.
C: GERARD
D: Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir?
E: friendly, to Old Guard
C: OLD GUARD
D: Uh, me.
C: GERARD
D: Would you be so kind as to show them to me, sir?
N: Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard. The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the press hovering just out of earshot.
C: GERARD
D: Second chance.
N: Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man. The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.
C: OLD GUARD
D: He mighta got out.
E: cracking
C: GERARD
D: Thank you.
C: SHERIFF
D: What the hell is this? A minute ago you tell me he's part of the wreckage, now you're -
C: GERARD
D: Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want an accurate body count. Poole - Set up operations right here.
N: He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like Israelites behind Moses.
C: GERARD
D: Ladies and gentlemen... our fugitive's been on the run for ninety minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground - barring injury is approximately four miles an hour, giving us a radius of six miles. I want a hard-target search of any residence, gas station, farmhouse, henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in that area. Check-points go up at 15 miles. You got that? Good. Now, turn those damn things off and get out of our way.
E: to media
S: INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
N: ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.
S: EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT
N: Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.
S: EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT
N: Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's going to need stitches. Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps moving.
S: EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN
N: Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction of the lights. A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 mile. ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his breath. Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for cover behind the wrecked car. The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front seat and closes the door. He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the coveralls missing from the seat. As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window, clutching the coveralls.
S: EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN
N: A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone lines are pulled down from the lines running along the tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics. Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and relays it to Gerard.
C: POOLE
D: Blood trail found. Two miles southwest.
C: GERARD
D: Type it and match it against all four prisoners. Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to every local hospital. Newman...
E: to Biggs to Renfro to Newman
N: Newman appears.
C: NEWMAN
D: Yes, sir...
C: GERARD
D: I need some coffee.
N: As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING from the train crash. ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.
C: WORKER
D: Hey, one's alive!
S: EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING
N: Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. Once inside he branches off down a hallway.
S: INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING
N: A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us. Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front of the doorway. KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM
T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY
N: A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.
C: KIMBLE
D: Can you hear me, sir?
N: No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched breakfast tray.
T: CUT TO:

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY
N: A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the patient's call light comes on. The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the patient's room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY
N: Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

E: O.S.
N: ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.
C: DUTY NURSE
D: ... Oh, you did a good job on this.
N: She takes his empty plastic pitcher and... ... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and refills the pitcher from the sink.
C: DUTY NURSE
D: ... It does get dry in here, doesn't it?
E: over her shoulder, to patient
N: She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind it.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts down the corridor toward Kimble. The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...
C: TROOPER
D: 'Scuse me, Doc?...
N: Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. doors behind him.
C: TROOPER
D: ... Don't know if you heard or not but we're looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck 'couple hours ago. Thought he might show up here if he was hurt.
C: KIMBLE
D: What's he look like?
N: The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down Kimble's cheek.
C: TROOPER
D: Approximately six one, 180 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes and beard.
E: from fax sheet
N: At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes it clean as the Trooper looks up.

D: Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard.
N: They laugh.

N: Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks outside...
S: EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY
N: Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The lead wheels are stuck.
C: KIMBLE
D: Here...
N: Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney comes free. PARAMEDIC #2 Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out from under a train. As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.
C: YOUNG GUARD
D: It's him... It's -
N: Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.
C: KIMBLE
D: How is he?
N: The Paramedics move him toward the ramp. PARAMEDIC #1 He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, ribs. Concussion. As Kimble moves away...
C: KIMBLE
D: Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got a perforated spleen.
N: He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk the Young Guard inside. PARAMEDIC #2 (impressed) Jesus, how could he tell that from looking at his face? ANGLE - AMBULANCE Kimble climbs behind the wheel.
S: EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

C: DISPATCHER
D: Two-twelve-A, be advised that all discussion on this matter is to be conducted on a tactical frequency - either Channel K or Z. Over.
E: V.O.
N: Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield: ROAD SIGN An arrow points toward Canton, two miles. The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets attention.

S: INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
N: Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and eyeballs folded roadmap...
S: EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY
N: ... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.
S: EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY
N: Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS overhead.

E: into radio to Gerard
C: GERARD
D: Seal it up.
S: EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY
N: The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River. The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into the tunnel. ON KIMBLE Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at the mouth of the tunnel. Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat. ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM) Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks. ANGLE HELICOPTER Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole. KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.
S: EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking the other end. Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a State patrol car blares:

D: Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard part's over.
N: He starts into the tunnel.
C: RENFRO
D: We're movin' in.
E: to radio
S: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
N: Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb back inside and lock their doors. Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet. Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water. Running water. ON MARSHALS They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks confused.
C: POOLE
D: Where'd he go?
N: Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.
C: GERARD
D: Biggs, Renfro with me.
S: INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY
N: Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues straight ahead. Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong to... Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.
C: GERARD
D: Channel Three.
N: They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go left. Gerard - straight ahead.
S: INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY
N: Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy downslope.

D: Nothing yet.
E: into shoulder-mike
S: INT. CONDUIT - DAY

C: GERARD
D: Got a possible here. Stand by.
E: into radio
N: He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with three limbs
S: INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY
N: Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. Slips again... ... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY. Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets there first. It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.
C: KIMBLE
D: I didn't kill my wife.
C: GERARD
D: So, you didn't kill your wife.
N: Not my problem. An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the silence is broken by Gerard's radio.
C: BIGGS
D: Gerard? You there?
E: V.O.
N: Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone. Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up piece.
S: INT. CONDUIT - DAY
N: As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way. ANOTHER ANGLE Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...
C: GERARD
D: Straight ahead!

N: Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and stops. KIMBLE'S POV Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of mists. No rocks. None visible at least. He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER. ANGLE - MARSHALS Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a shooting stance.

N: For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.
C: GERARD

N: Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search helicopter converge on the site.

S: EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET
N: Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore. Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters. FROM SHORE Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.
C: HEAD TROOPER
D: Running out of daylight, Inspector.
C: GERARD
D: Lights and generators are coming, Captain.
C: HEAD TROOPER
D: Look, I don't mean to tell you your job, but maybe one person in a million could've survived that fall. The guy's fish food.

N: Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for party to answer. An old lady and her mother shop. Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble. ANGLE - PHONE Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

N: A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, moves down the road to the diner.
S: INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT
N: Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.
C: OLDER WAITRESS
D: Need to look at the menu?
C: KIMBLE
D: Some soup, please.
C: OLDER WAITRESS
D: Good choice.
N: She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around Kimble begins to occupy his attention: A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He stares at him. A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him. Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him his soup. Where's the first waitress? Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he sees: The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she going to report him? He fights the paranoia. A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention. ANGLE - TV A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death from the fall. Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on the counter and exits.
S: EXT. DINER - NIGHT
N: Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble looks at himself. He's shaking. A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next to him, passenger window rolls down...
C: OLDER WAITRESS
D: Need a ride?
N: Kimble stares at her.
C: KIMBLE

S: INT. HOUSE - DAWN
N: Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room. THEIR POV Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT OF VIEW. A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING. GERARD Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living room while he moves down the main hall into the back bedroom. ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. He steps into - SMALLER BEDROOM It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to the bedroom. HALLWAY Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward the doorway to the kitchen. Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty. Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.
T: CUT TO:

He backs through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the - LIVING ROOM Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against his throat.
C: COPELAND
D: You hear me? I said, I want out or I'll cut your man's throat!
E: to Gerard
N: GERARD Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course. LIVING ROOM Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard. Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He whips Newman around and we see: A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard. He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, stunned but unhurt. Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the bedroom doorway.
C: GERARD
D: Shut up.
N: She does. Immediately.
S: EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
N: As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly hysterical, clutching his ear.

S: INT. HALLWAY - ANGLE ON ELEVATOR - NIGHT
N: Kimble waits for the elevator. The folders in his uniform shift and he tries to rearrange them. When he turns back we see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: "ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging. The elevator arrives. They step into:

C: ANNE
D: You worked at other hospitals?
C: KIMBLE
D: Lots of them over the years. Here, long ago. Hasn't changed much.
C: ANNE
D: I bet it hasn't. See you.
N: They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops and watches him leave.
S: INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT
N: Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking at his information.
S: INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY
N: Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking for a key to the identity of the one-armed man. Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and covers his face. Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the Prosthetic Clinic material. FLASHBACK - FIGHT Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates. FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind returning to something. Getting closer to the key...) FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again. Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly different... a CAR DOOR.
S: INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)
N: Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and MOVING TOWARD him.

N: A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.
S: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
N: Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. Carefully looks out: KIMBLE'S POV Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving his way. BACK TO SCENE Kimble moves instinctively to the back door. He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees the back courtyard covered by more cops. Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, he's sweating, preparing for the worst. He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of charging through the basement door they move up the front steps and into the house overhead. Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops. KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and pulled away. KIMBLE Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the Punk Kid out to the car. POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down. Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out. KIMBLE'S POV Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying. BACK TO SCENE Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.
S: INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

S: INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in. The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC. ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses direct traffic. Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, a BOY.
C: ANNE
D: What happened?
C: ORDERLY
D: A bus flipped off the overpass. Got at least twenty more coming in.

C: ORDERLY
D: Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming up.
N: Anne checks the boy's chart.
C: ANNE
D: Okay, we've got to get some room in this hallway, people.
N: Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.
C: ANNE
D: Hey, take this one up the hall to Critical Care.
N: Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient. Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays. Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble pushing the gurney and looking at the film. ANNE Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work. ON KIMBLE He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors close.

S: EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall for the exit when a voice stops him.
C: ANNE
D: Do you have a particular interest in our patients' x-rays?
E: O.S.
N: Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.
C: KIMBLE

N: She reaches him.

E: firmly
N: Gerard watches her eyes carefully.
C: GERARD

C: ANNE
D: For what?
C: GERARD
D: For murdering his wife.
N: Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her surprise.
C: GERARD
D: Thank you for your help, Doctor.
N: He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.
C: RENFRO
D: What I can't figure is, if you were Kimble, why'd you take a major league chance of hanging around a trauma ward?
N: Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices something.
C: RENFRO
D: The place would be crawling with cops.
N: Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and follows the Man down the hall. The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, holds the hallway door open for Gerard.
C: MAN
D: Can I help you find something?
C: GERARD
D: Thank you, sir, I think you already have.

N: The Clearing Officer, head down, drones on - doesn't notice Kimble is already gone. Kimble strides down the row of chairs, rounds the last partition to reach booth seven - and to stare at the one-armed man, DRISCOLL, who waits there.

N: Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of COPS around the elevator again, opts for the door marked: "STAIRS"
S: INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY
N: Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's had enough.
C: GERARD
D: Where're the damn stairs?

N: He finds the door and starts up.
S: INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - STAIRWELL - DAY
N: Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the stairwell but the traffic is light...
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: GERARD Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down. Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet. One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the stairwell railing to spy... Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be any dark-haired man. But still...
C: GERARD
D: Kimble.
E: a quick probe
N: Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain his step, keeps moving. But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's stride told him everything.
C: GERARD
D: Kimble!
N: Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.
S: INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY
N: Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. Sees two cops, quickly approaches.
C: KIMBLE
D: Officers - there's a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming.
N: The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak himself in civilians. ANGLE ON ELEVATORS Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied. He lets a woman on in front of him, oblivious to... Kimble moving... The revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer.
S: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
N: The two cops see Gerard. Gerard holds up his badge.
C: GERARD
D: U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call your commander, tell him there's a top-fifteen warrant in the building. Go.
N: He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.
S: INT. LOBBY - DAY
N: Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds. People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door. GERARD Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.
C: GERARD
D: Kimble. Stop!
N: But there's only one way of stopping Kimble. KIMBLE Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door. Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees Gerard. Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire.
C: GERARD
D: Down. down. everybody down!
N: With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening...
S: EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY
N: ... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks back over his shoulder at... Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.
C: GERARD
D: Kimble. Stop!
N: It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as
S: INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY
N: Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds. Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with bullet holes, he sees... Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's alive. He runs free.
C: GERARD
D: Open the doors!
N: Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade. Doors open and Gerard and his men follow. But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. Blending in with the marchers.
T: CUT TO:

N: Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from his hair. He moves down the street.

S: INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Inside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home.
S: INT. BAR - MORNING
N: The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks down at his list of five. The only name remaining is Fredrick Sykes. He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans across the seat and opens the door for him. He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a handgun. Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.
S: EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.
S: INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: No sound. Slowly he moves into... HALLWAY Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is modest. He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a police uniform. Kimble freezes.

INSERT - PHOTOGRAPHS (PRESENT) Kimble flips back to the earlier group photos and we see a Devlin-MacGregor banner over the group shot. KIMBLE Looks up. He's found the man he's looking for but also a new possibility - that the murder wasn't just a random act of violence. Kimble digs through Sykes' top desk drawer. His mind reeling. He stops: CLOSE ON PAYCHECK STUBS The Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceutical logo in the top right corner. Payroll level four: Security.

N: Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz.
C: GERARD
D: Any idea why Kimble would be interested in these?
C: SYKES
D: No. Just some doctors on a company junket.

N: The group of deputies and Gerard assemble around Gerard's information board. They've come armed with facts and theories. Gerard orchestrates the information.
C: RENFRO
D: If you were Richard Kimble... Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us?
C: POOLE
D: To throw us off his trail.
C: RENFRO
D: Unless... What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? How would you do it?
C: BIGGS
D: I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen.
C: POOLE
D: Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad.
C: RENFRO
D: How would you find him? Look in the phone book?
C: RENFRO
D: Through a connection.
C: POOLE
D: Maybe through a company you did some business with.
C: BIGGS
D: Like a pharmaceutical company. Someone in security.
C: NEWMAN
D: On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company.
N: Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.
C: BIGGS
D: But Sykes claims he was out of town.
C: POOLE
D: And company records support that he was on a business trip.
C: RENFRO
D: That's an easy fix. So let's say he was in town. Did the job. Everything goes as planned with one problem.
C: NEWMAN
D: Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused...
C: BIGGS
D: ... tried, convicted...
C: POOLE
D: ... and the hit man gets away clean.
C: RENFRO
D: So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man.
C: NEWMAN
D: Why? To share the blame? He'd still go to prison.
N: Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.
C: RENFRO
D: You're underestimating the power of the good doctor. It would be his word against... Sykes'. Who would you believe?
C: BIGGS
D: So what does Kimble do next?
C: RENFRO
D: Get help.
N: Gerard pins the card to the board and looks at Renfro. It says: "NICHOLS"

C: KIMBLE
D: Half the people in the study were indigents. No follow-up, no baseline on them. Who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers?
C: WAHLUND
D: The one on the right is one of the samples you sent me. It shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils. When you see that with the accumulation of bile it's a classic for -

C: WAHLUND
D: I'm impressed. Now look at this.
N: She positions a second slide.
C: WAHLUND
D: According to the study, this is a slice from the same liver.
N: Kimble studies the slide. The tissue difference is markedly different, clearer.
C: KIMBLE
D: Cold normal.
C: WAHLUND
D: Clearly not from the same tissue. In fact.
N: She yields the microscope to Kimble.
C: WAHLUND
D: See this small area of bile duct proliferation? Von Meyenberg's Complex. Occurs in only 2% of the population. But it's in every one of your five samples.
N: Kimble looks up.

C: WAHLUND
D: Big bucks. One schmuck standing in the way. Easy, get rid of him and his wife. But why Lentz?
C: KIMBLE
D: Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake.
N: Kimble notices something in the report.
C: KIMBLE
D: When did Lentz die?
C: WAHLUND
D: Oh, last summer sometime. August... Why?
N: Kimble looks up from the protocol report.
C: KIMBLE
D: Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died.
N: Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is on reports dated October, November, December.
C: KIMBLE
D: Someone else used Lentz's name.
C: WAHLUND
D: A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor?
C: KIMBLE
D: They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital.

S: INT. DOWNTOWN EL TRAIN - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT
N: Sits in the front car. There are very few other riders. A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The headlines facing Kimble say: "KIMBLE IN CHICAGO". Kimble's booking photo stares back at him. Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns the pages. The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the front page. The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again, then down. Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the rear cars. Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until the man is gone. ANGLE - THROUGH CENTER OF TRAIN - NIGHT From the center of Kimble's car we see the man with the newspaper move up to a TRANSIT COP. They begin talking. Kimble stands, coming INTO the SHOT. We see him watching the discussion. Suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands and blocks Kimble's view of the Cop. It's Sykes. His gun is drawn.

C: TRANSIT COP
D: Kimble. Sir, move away from him.
E: to Sykes
N: Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns. The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts... But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES. As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble. But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

S: INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on throughout the car. Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and almost smiles.
C: SYKES
D: Go ahead. You don't have it in you .
N: For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious. Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead. Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop. He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face off the floor.
C: KIMBLE
D: Not as easy as Helen, was it? You missed your stop.
E: slams Sykes' head down, leaves

C: GERARD
D: ... That's why there was no forced entry at your house. He'd used your keys.
N: KIMBLE Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move. NICHOLS Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the hanging control for the I-beam. GERARD Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can see straight back toward the washers.
C: GERARD
D: Kimble... Come meet me out here.
N: ON RENFRO He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still. NICHOLS Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun. GERARD Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor belts. He makes one last appeal.
C: GERARD
D: It's time to quit running... if you don't, you know I'll stop you. He listens, there is no answer.
N: KIMBLE Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed. GERARD Moves into the alley between the two giant washers.

C: KIMBLE
D: Hey, Chuckles...
E: O.S.
N: Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor behind Gerard.
