C: CLOSE SHOT:
D: A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back.
C: BLACK
D: Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness.
C: BLACK
D: No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching.

S: 2 EXT WHARF - DAY
N: We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront. 3 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANT is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty. 4 SLOW TRACKING - RUDY GUZMAN wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has been broken several times from his years in the Mexican boxing league. He was almost a contender. 5 SLOW TRACKING - SKIP NATICK walks with a pronounced limp. 6 SLOW TRACKING - TRUMAYNE JOHNSON MC SAM is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool. 7 SLOW TRACKING - RICK is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows. B SLOW TRACKING - SMILEY 8 wears a permanent psychotic smile. SLOW TRACKING - PAULY is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips. SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth. They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies. Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're ready to kick some ass.
C: DOCK WORKER
D: Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. The eight visitors assume the position, placing their hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it.
N: DOCK WORKER #2
T: Bunch a cuties.
N: DOCK WORKER #3 Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one. From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up in silence.

N: Â¢ 19 CONTINUED The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now...total silence.
C: ROBERT G. DURANT
D: the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

The glass cylinder, wired to the computer, glows to life. 24P A three dimensional holographic image of Yakatito's nose 24P rotates within. Peyton glances from the Imager to the computer. He types on the computer keyboard.
C: PEYTON
D: Bio-press checks out okay... He glances to...
C: THE BIO-PRESS
D: As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.
N: YAKITITO No more bunching. Looks perfect.

D: Electrolytes, temp and glucose concentration. all normal.
C: YAKITITO
D: But still this ninety nine minute. Yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet.
C: PEYTON
D: Pacing, thinking;
C: PEYTON
D: Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment.
C: YAKITITO

D: But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs.
C: PEYTON
D: A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object ---
C: BAM!
D: He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech.

N: YAKITITO (FURIOUS) It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball.
C: PEYTON
D: Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches.
C: YAKITITO
D: This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks.

Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz. Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee.
C: KATZ
D: We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price.

C: KATZ
D: What's that?

N: PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE His eyes still closed. No response.
C: RESIDENT
D: Of course, there are serious emotional side effects to this operation. When the body ceases to feel, when so much sensory input is lost, the patient becomes alienated. The mind, cut off from its regular diet of input, has a never-satisfied thirst; alienation gives rise to loneliness, anger; uncontrolled rage is not uncommon. And the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain-- giving him the strength of dozen men. Hence the leather restraints. The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns follow behind like ducklings.

He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the strain of the load, he staggers back across the room to the king-sized bed. With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands. They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over the sides and clatter to the floor. Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty, then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the floor. Like a swan he dives. He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips. Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then slough off, leaving their imprint.

C: DURANT
D: No problem at all. And the good news?
C: STRACK
D: Your wife died. I'm joking, of course. No, the good news is that I know who's behind our little troubles of late. When you retrieved my memorandum, you failed to excise the good doctor.

C: DURANT
D: They do look up to me. The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.

D: Kids need an example, Robert. When I was a young man my father made me work high steel. That's how he started out, and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me...

D: ...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet...

N: 447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright.
C: DURANT/DARKMAN
D: Julie! Strack laughs.
C: STRACK
D: Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..
N: 448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels away again. It spins downward towards a forest of reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat-- pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars. 449 JULIE gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring:
C: STR.ACK
D: You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.

C: ON THE UPPER GIRDER
D: Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV-- nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night. Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.

N: 454 CRACK! Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin into Darkman's eyeball to find--
C: THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE
D: Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked. Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold Krugerands. The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body. Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears a funny little hat. Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- the face of the Darkman. A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It bursts into flames. The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein pulsing madly.
C: DARXMAN'S RIVETED HAND
D: insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.

N: DARKMAN ARRRRRRRGGGGGGG ! Darkman hurls him up, up into the air. Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins to fall, yards away from the girder. He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face.

D: I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

D: Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:
C: DARKMAN
D: Peyton is gone... He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other side. Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic. The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she desperately searches for him, turning people around, staring at their faces... It begins to snow.
C: JULIE
D: Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves.
N: AS WE ROLL END CREDITS The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians, any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards, wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street- person shuffles into view:
