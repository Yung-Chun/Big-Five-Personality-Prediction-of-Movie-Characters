M: "BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"
M: by
M: Mike Judge and Joe Stillman
N: The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T- shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt- Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh." Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, "Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights. We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking him.
S: INT. B&B'S HOME - DAY
C: BEAVIS
D: Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
E: O.C.
N: Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
C: BEAVIS
D: Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
N: Butt-Head comes around.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: What's gone?
C: BEAVIS
D: The TV.
N: Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock. Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV was.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
N: Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their van. Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open. Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this a couple of times - piecing it all together.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
E: CONT.
C: BEAVIS
D: What?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: This sucks.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh.
N: Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do. Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: This sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before. We must find this butt-hole that took the TV.
S: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares. A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes off his glasses. FREEZE ON BEAVIS
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Beavis!
N: FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
C: BEAVIS
D: Freeze, butt-wipe!
N: An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, collar way open. He plops down in the bed. FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Butt-Head!
N: FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Star in...
N: MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
S: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
N: ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening. OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits would. Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun. Butt-Head slaps a pimp. Beavis drives, chasing a car. Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
N: Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out. A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B. B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes. In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot. Butt-Head does the same. Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge. A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into bed. Suddenly...
S: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
N: From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing. B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push the cart we hear more equipment falling.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Dammit, it's stuck.
N: They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which all come crashing to the ground.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
E: CONT.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
S: INT. SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
N: MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on here?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, someone stole our TV.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah. We're just gonna use this one. Get outta the way. Heh heh.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school. Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive experience for you guys. There's a wonderful world out there when we discover we don't need TV to entertain us.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
C: BEAVIS
D: Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
E: to himself
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: Have you guys heard a word I've said?
E: frustrated
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: Look, guys, just take the TV back to the A.V. room right now. And try to be a little more open-minded. Mmkay?
N: Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: What a dork. Huh huh.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
S: EXT. SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
N: B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
C: BEAVIS
D: No it wasn't!
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh,...Oh yeah.
N: B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV. McVICKER Why.... You... You bastards... Ge... get out! You're suspended. One more screw up... and you're expelled. B&B walk off laughing.
S: EXT. THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
N: B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
N: B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
C: MARCY
D: Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look at the refrigerator?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, no.
C: BEAVIS
D: We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
C: MARCY
D: Oh, I didn't realize it was broken. Come on in.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Cool. Huh huh huh.
N: B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
S: EXT. ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
N: Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
C: TOM
D: Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know, the most important thing you can have on a camper is a good propane regulator, and this here's the best one they make.
C: MARCY
D: I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed before we leave.
C: TOM
D: Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip our whole lives and we're gonna go come Hell or high water...
N: Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
C: TOM
D: What the hell is that noise?
E: CONT.
S: INT. ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
N: B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the counter on which the TV is sitting. Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
C: BEAVIS
D: AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
N: ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV goes dead.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
S: EXT. ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
N: B&B come out. Tom notices them.
C: TOM
D: Hey, what's goin' on here?
C: MARCY
D: They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
C: TOM
D: The TV ain't broken.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
N: Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B. TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
C: TOM
D: Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda familiar. Ain't you them kids that've been whackin' off in my tool shed?
N: BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD Huh huh huh huh huh. ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back and forth. B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
S: EXT. STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
N: B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight Cowboy."
C: BEAVIS
D: Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: What's your problem Beavis?
C: BEAVIS
D: I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
N: Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a golden, throbbing light. BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap Rates." B&B stare up, as if at a god.
C: BEAVIS
D: Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
E: crazed
S: EXT. MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
N: Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens. B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS him. McVICKER Please mmm... may I have another?! B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up. McVICKER (CONT.) Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you bastards.
C: BEAVIS
D: Can we watch your TV?
N: McVICKER Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out! Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed by McVicker asking for another.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
C: BEAVIS
D: Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck - a Jack Ruby type. On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
C: MUDDY
D: ...Are you sure these guys can pull this off? It's gotta look like an accident...
N: We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
C: MUDDY
D: Hold on a minute. That must be them now. I'll call you back. ... Come in!
E: CONT. Hangs up phone
N: B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
C: BEAVIS
D: Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
E: sounding suddenly sedated
C: MUDDY
D: Yer late.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
N: MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.
C: MUDDY
D: Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, Butt-Head.
C: BEAVIS
D: Beavis.
C: MUDDY
D: That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Do her? Huh huh.
E: full of innuendo
C: MUDDY
D: That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
N: Butt-Head stares in shock.
C: BEAVIS
D: Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
C: BEAVIS
D: Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
E: trembling
N: Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
C: BEAVIS
D: Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
E: to Muddy
C: MUDDY
D: Okay, then let's get down to business.
N: ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
C: MUDDY
D: Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
E: CONT.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
N: Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
C: MUDDY
D: She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
C: BEAVIS
D: Can we watch some TV first?
N: Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
C: MUDDY
D: No.
S: EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING
N: Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a SHRIEK.
C: MUDDY
D: One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
C: MUDDY
D: She sure does.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
C: MUDDY
D: Just make sure it looks like an accident...
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
E: spastic
C: MUDDY
D: Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
N: Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
S: EXT. AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
N: In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels away.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: We're gonna get paid to score.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
N: B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches them.
C: DOLORIS
D: Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
C: DOLORIS
D: I think your tickets have you seated in row fourteen, coach. So why don't you just go ahead and move back, OK?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: That's OK. Someone else can have those.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, it's not that important to me, really. Those seats are too small anyways.
N: Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the aisle. ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
C: DOLORIS
D: Here you are.
N: She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh huh huh.
N: Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
C: MARTHA
D: Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, we're gonna score.
C: MARTHA
D: I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
C: MARTHA
D: Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
C: BEAVIS
D: Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Cool. Huh huh huh.
C: MARTHA
D: It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
C: MARTHA
D: Oh, that's nice.
C: CAPTAIN'S VOICE
D: Good morning. This is your captain speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151 non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you turn your attention to the front of the cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
E: V.O. through P.A.
N: B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
C: ATTENDANT'S VOICE
D: To fasten your seat belt, insert the free end into the coupling.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Insert. Huh huh huh.
N: Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh...
E: CONT.
N: They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's parts.
C: TAMMY
D: Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
E: O.C.
N: Butt-Head looks up. From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays. CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull one strap from between Butt-Head's legs. Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
C: TAMMY
D: There you go. You're all set.
E: CONT.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: I love you.
E: stunned
N: Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
C: BEAVIS
D: Wait, I wanted her to do it.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
C: CAPTAIN'S VOICE
D: Flight attendants, please prepare for take-off.
N: The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling. Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear. The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to freak.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
N: Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window and realizes they're in the air.
C: BEAVIS
D: Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
E: CONT. screams
N: ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:
C: MAN
D: D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
C: WOMAN
D: Oh my God!!!!!!!
N: ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting up. ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
C: BEAVIS
D: Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
N: The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down the aisle. ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic. In free fall: Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes tearing out. Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which open and spill their contents. Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and coffee to pour freely. ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their screaming. ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is strapped in.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that thing with my belt again?
S: INT. PLANE - LATER
N: All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the aisle. People read, relaxed. ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy gave him.
C: BEAVIS
D: I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
C: MARTHA
D: You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
C: BEAVIS
D: Really? I poop too much.
C: MARTHA
D: Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
C: BEAVIS
D: Uh... No, I poop too much. Then I get tired.
E: louder
C: MARTHA
D: Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
N: She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
C: MARTHA
D: They perk me right up.
E: CONT.
C: BEAVIS
D: Heh heh, thanks.
N: He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. Then his eyes open wide.
C: BEAVIS
D: Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
E: CONT. strange
N: Beavis starts wolfing them down.
S: INT. PLANE - A BIT LATER
N: Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las Vegas? Huh huh huh.
E: to Tammy
N: Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there. ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something. PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The guy's asleep. Butt-head picks up the beer. ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff) Tammy reaches her next passenger.
C: TAMMY
D: Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections tonight are chicken piccata or seafood gumbo...
C: BEAVIS
D: Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
E: O.S.
N: Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of Cornholio mode.
C: PASSENGER
D: Does the gumbo have corn in it?
N: ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his head in full Cornholio mode.
C: BEAVIS
D: I am Cornholio! I need picatta for my bunghole!
C: TAMMY
D: You'll have to wait your turn sir.
C: BEAVIS
D: Are you threatening me? My bunghole will not wait!
N: Beavis starts to wander down the aisle. ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being pressed. ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
N: ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT. The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
C: BEAVIS
D: Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
N: The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A NOSE-DIVE. ON BUTT-HEAD In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
N: Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, and he continues to fly forward. COCKPIT The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane. Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel facing the captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Get the hell out of the cockpit!
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh, you said...
C: CAPTAIN
D: NOW!!!
N: The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane out of the dive.
S: EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
N: The plane lands.
S: INT. COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
N: The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with flecks of spilled food and other matter.
C: ATTENDANTS
D: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
N: They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T- shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That was cool.
S: INT. TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
N: Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their names. A reunited couple hugs. B&B look around in confusion.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
N: People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out. One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head. B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
E: CONT.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
N: B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
C: DRIVER
D: Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where I can find these guys, would ya?
N: He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his pants. They look and try to read:
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
E: reads
C: BEAVIS
D: Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
E: reads
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh. This says Beavis.
E: realizes
C: BEAVIS
D: And Boot-Head.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, we should party.
N: The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
C: DRIVER
D: This way, sirs.
N: B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
C: BEAVIS
D: So where's those guys?
S: EXT. MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the door.
C: ROSS
D: Where the hell is he?
C: HARLAN
D: You sure this is the right place?
N: Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No one's there. Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
C: HARLAN
D: You Muddy?
E: CONT.
C: MUDDY
D: You the cops?
E: slurring
C: ROSS
D: Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take care of your wife...
N: Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
C: MUDDY
D: What the hell?!... What about those other...
C: ROSS
D: Huh?
N: Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by- four.
C: MUDDY
D: Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
C: HARLAN
D: Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You wanna buy a new one?
N: Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
C: MUDDY
D: I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all three a' them!
N: Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused. Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the back onto the sidewalk. Ross starts to pick it up.
C: HARLAN
D: Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
C: ROSS
D: Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin' from rich people.
S: EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY
N: MONTAGE SONG BEGINS. Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like "Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's "You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best. The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
S: INT. HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
N: Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever. ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song. PAN DOWN rows of slot machines. PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips. DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe. REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a bare-chested woman. Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Beavis. This is what it's all about.
C: BEAVIS
D: Heh heh. Yeah.
E: speechless
S: EXT. VEGAS - DUSK
N: Lights are popping on. Billboards and signs are lighting up. The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.
S: INT. HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK
N: ON B&B, still staring at the statue.
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh.
E: in awe
N: A security guard comes and drags B&B away. ON THE LOUNGE BAND, continuing the song we've been hearing.
S: INT. B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: The door is opened by a bellboy.
C: BELLBOY
D: I'm so sorry about that little misunderstanding. We didn't know you were registered guests. Here's some playing chips compliments of...
N: Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.
C: BEAVIS
D: This remote's too heavy!
C: BELLBOY
D: Sir, it's attached to the...
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Here, dumbass! Let me try!
N: They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over backwards. Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.
S: INT. ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT
N: The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:
C: ELEVATOR VOICE
D: Ninth floor, going down.
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Going down. Huh huh huh.
N: The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.
S: INT. HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
N: MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk among the gambling tables. Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites into it.
C: BEAVIS
D: Ow! These chips suck.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
N: Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table. ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13. At the table, the DEALER...
C: DEALER
D: 13. We have a winner. Sir, your chips?
E: to Beavis
C: BEAVIS
D: I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.
C: DEALER
D: Let it ride!
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh... could you help us find a chick?
E: to dealer
C: DEALER
D: Sir, the casino does not partake in that kind of activity.
E: uneasy
N: The wheel stops.
C: DEALER
D: 13! Winner!
E: CONT. amazed
N: People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch. Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.
C: CHERYL
D: Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say you're looking for a date?
N: B&B freeze, shocked.
C: CHERYL
D: I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real fine time.
E: CONT.
N: B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.
C: CHERYL
D: A time you'll remember for the rest of your lives, if you know what I mean.
E: CONT.
C: DEALER
D: Sir, do you want your chips?
E: to Beavis
C: BEAVIS
D: No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!
C: DEALER
D: Let it ride.
N: Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.
C: CHERYL
D: What say we three go up to your room, take off our clothes and just see what comes up.
N: B&B's eyes open wide.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
C: BEAVIS
D: Uh... Uh...
N: The wheel stops.
C: DEALER
D: 14. No winners.
C: CHERYL
D: Hmmmm. Oh well.
N: She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
C: BEAVIS
D: Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
N: WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.
T: MUSIC FADES BACK UP...
S: INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song. Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out. B&B dance alone near the stage, doing the "butt-knocker."
S: INT. HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
N: A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.
C: WOMAN ATTENDANT
D: Good evening. Room service. How may I help you?
N: From the phone...
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh.
E: on phone
N: The woman's disturbed.
C: WOMAN ATTENDANT
D: Hello... Hello...
S: INT. HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
N: B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue. Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor hard.
S: INT. B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, huh huh, I'd like to be serviced... in my room.
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
S: INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: B&B keep dancing as the famous BAND plays the MONTAGE SONG which ENDS.
S: EXT. VEGAS - DAWN
N: Sunrise. The song rings out.
S: INT. B&B'S ROOM - MORNING
N: BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it and moving the whole thing. Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.
N: Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's one of those double doors to the next room. Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it. Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.
E: excited
C: DALLAS
D: All right, who are ya? C.I.A? F.B.I.? A.T.F.?

C: BEAVIS
D: Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is a lot of money... Maybe if we close our eyes and pretend he's a chick...
E: considering it
N: Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses. From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window. The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
C: DALLAS
D: Damn! You boys, you wait right there.
E: panics
N: Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door. B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.

D: Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
C: BEAVIS
D: Me first! Me first!
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
N: Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside. Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's surrounded. As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.
C: DALLAS
D: Gimme the number for Dream America Tours. Right.
E: to phone pause
N: Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose. Dallas closes the door again.

E: CONT. to phone pause listens mulls it over a look back to the other room
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
N: B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed. Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table. Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms over Butt-Head.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
C: BEAVIS
D: Me first!

C: BEAVIS
D: Me first.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh huh. No way, dude.
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
N: TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card. An LED light blinks. Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit in.
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
N: B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
N: Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose as if she has smelled something. She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the unit.
S: INT. DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY

E: CONT. urgent
N: She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her cart passes by. B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator. ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick open Dallas' door.
S: EXT. HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
N: More Feds and police enter. ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks away, Beavis rubs his butt.

C: BORK
D: Cut the power!
E: realizes
C: FLEMMING
D: Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
C: BORK
D: Well, sir it's not good. Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
E: to an assistant
N: ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.
C: BORK
D: The deadliest known to man. It could wipe out five states in five days. It can be activated by simply entering the right code. Here's what happened when it was tested on a group of Army recruits...
E: CONT.
N: ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling around in pain on stretchers, dying. Grotesque (but funny).
C: FLEMMING
D: Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
C: BORK
D: It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
N: A murmuring through the room. Flemming rises and holds up a picture of B&B.
C: FLEMMING
D: Okay People, as of right now these are the most dangerous men in America. I want these faces in front of every Fed and two- bit sheriff within a thousand miles. The orders are dead or alive. Let's just pray that nothing hits that unit.

E: V.O.
C: B&B

C: FLEMMING
D: National security is the responsibility of every American. Bork...
C: BORK

E: CONT.
S: EXT. ROAD - DAY
N: IN MONTAGE SHOTS: A.T.F. agents put up roadblocks. Agents load guns. Agents pile up sandbags and prepare for battle.
S: EXT. DESERT - DAY
N: WIDE SHOT. A wasteland. Scorching desert hear. B&B, small in frame, look lost. They're parched, weak.
C: BEAVIS
D: This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
N: ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B wobble like they haven't long to live. Overhead, vultures circle. ANGLE ON B&B, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly sees something.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Whoa! Check it out!
E: CONT.
N: Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.
C: B&B
D: Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.

C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh...
C: BEAVIS
D: Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
N: ANGLE ON SUN, brightening. The FRAME WHITES OUT.
S: EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY
N: Cars are backed up into the horizon. The car up front is waved on. Up next: Tom and Marcy. An agent steps over and shows the picture of B&B.
C: TOM
D: Something wrong, Officer?
C: AGENT
D: Sir, we're looking for these two fugitives.
N: ANDERSON SQUINTS to see. HIS P.O.V. REVEALS the photo out of focus.
C: ANDERSON
D: Why I'll be danged. It's those boys been whackin' off in my camper...
C: AGENT
D: You saw these two?
C: ANDERSON
D: I sure did. They were whackin' off in my tool shed. Then whackin' off in my camper. I never seen so much whackin' off.
N: The agent steps back and shouts into his walkie-talkie:
C: AGENT
D: Blue Den this is post nine! I have positive ID!! Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you and your wife to step out of the vehicle.
E: to Tom
C: ANDERSON
D: Well you see, me and the missus are on our way to Washington. We got this schedule...
N: The agent pulls his gun and orders:
C: AGENT
D: Now!!!!
S: EXT. SIDE OF HIGHWAY/JUST OFF ROADBLOCK - DAY
N: A BIT LATER. Agents swarm over Tom's camper, turning everything upside, pulling out dishes, trashing everything.
C: TOM
D: Now wait right there. You're dealing with a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the ones been whacking off. If I find anything broken in there, you and I are gonna tangle!
E: furious
N: An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through the pieces. Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
C: FLEMMING
D: Masturbating in a man's camper! We're dealing with two sick individuals. I want that camper torn apart, full cavity searches all around.
E: appalled
N: SNAP! SFX as Agent Hurley puts on her rubber gloves and leads Tom and Marcy away. Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
C: BORK
D: Chief - just came in! Two days ago, Express Airways had a disturbance by someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess who matches the description?
N: He holds up a police sketch of Cornholio. Flemming walks to a nearby chopper. SOUND of engine revving. Others follow.
C: FLEMMING
D: Finally, a real break. Get me that flight's point of origin. We're gonna kick some ass.
S: EXT. DESERT - DAY
N: B&B walk along in the scorching heat. Ahead of them they see a DUMB GUY and a DUMBER GUY with motorcycles parked. They are trying to start a camp fire, LAUGHING.
C: DUMB GUY
D: Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
E: to B&B
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
E: dehydrated
S: INT. B&B'S HOME - DAY
N: Peaceful. Empty. Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents break in, guns ready, searching every corner. They tear it apart.
S: EXT. B&B'S TOWN/STREETS - DAY
N: Agents rush down the business streets. People are in a panic. It's like an invasion. ANGLE ON ELITE MOTOR LODGE - ON B&B'S TV SET as agents rush by, knocking it over with a crash.
S: INT. VAN DRIESSEN'S CLASS - DAY
N: Guitar in hand, Van Driessen sings:
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: She flies so gracefully, over rocks, trees and sand. Soaring over cliffs and gently floating down to land. She proudly lifts her voice to sound her mating call. And soon her mate responds by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw." Come with me, Lesbian Seagull. Settle down and rest with me...
N: Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents crash into the room. The door bashes in, knocking Van Driessen down hard and crushing his guitar. Flemming enters. Behind him, McVicker. McVICKER Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their teacher.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: What's going on here?
C: FLEMMING
D: I'll ask the questions. Are these your students?
N: He shows a picture of B&B.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: I assume you're a government agent. I would think you would know there's something in this country called due process.
C: FLEMMING
D: That's about the kind of talk I'd expect from the guy who taught these two. Take this scum away.
C: VAN DRIESSEN
D: I believe I'm supposed to be read my Miranda Rights...
N: An agent interrupts, punching Van Driessen in the gut. He's taken away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker. McVICKER I...I...I always knew they were no good. I... I... I hate them!
C: FLEMMING
D: You've been harboring two criminal masterminds!
E: to McVicker
N: Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.
C: BORK
D: Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
C: FLEMMING
D: Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
E: appalled
C: BORK
D: Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
C: FLEMMING
D: That's better. Yes?
C: BORK
D: We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.
E: holds up photos
N: TIGHT ON PHOTO. It's the DUMB GUY and DUMBER GUY from the desert.
C: BORK
D: Former Motley Crue members turned drifters.
E: O.S./CONT.
N: Flemming takes the paper and marches off. Others follow.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
N: B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt- Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's. Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
C: DUMB GUY
D: Yup. Huh huh.
E: mouth full
C: BEAVIS
D: Fire.
C: DUMB GUY
D: Here's another true story. About fifteen years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet, called Highland...
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Really? That's where we're from.
C: DUMB GUY
D: Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: You scored with two chicks?!
C: DUMB GUY
D: Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
E: spaghetti dribbling from mouth
C: DUMBER GUY
D: Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
N: Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
C: DUMB GUY
D: Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
C: DUMB GUY
D: Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
E: after taking another big bite
N: Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to drop his pants.
S: EXT. DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
N: The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
C: B&B/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY
D: Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
E: O.S.
C: BEAVIS
D: Fire.
E: O.S.
S: EXT. DESERT - MORNING
N: B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is scorching. B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death. ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at the sun, squinting.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: The sun sucks.
E: barely alive
N: A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
C: BEAVIS
D: Cut it out butt-hole!
E: to the vulture
N: The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
E: CONT.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh...
E: semiconscious
N: Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Hey Beavis, check it out.
E: CONT. sees something
N: IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.
C: B&B
D: Huh huh huh huh huh .
E: struggling to laugh cough cough
S: EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY
N: START ON SUN - over B&B? REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B held by an A.T.F. agent.
C: MUDDY
D: No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope it's safe to drive around here.
C: COP
D: Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main roads. If they're around, they're probably hiding out in the desert.
C: MUDDY
D: That's good to know, Officer.
N: Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
S: EXT. DESERT - LATER
N: B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're barely able to talk.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
N: BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Whoa, my life is cool!
N: TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
C: BEAVIS
D: Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
N: BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
C: BEAVIS/SPERM
D: Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
N: Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg. With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
C: BEAVIS/SPERM
D: Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
E: CONT.
N: Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His conception looks like a dumb accident. BACK ON BEAVIS:
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, heh heh I scored.
N: Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
C: BEAVIS
D: Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
E: CONT.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Huh? Huh huh.
C: BEAVIS
D: Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
N: BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors start shifting.
C: BEAVIS
D: ...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's all these weird shapes and it's sort of like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
E: CONT.
N: Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder. THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the lower left hand corner. I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... fire!" The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.) BEAVIS' P.O.V.: We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
C: FIRE
D: I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... Fire...
E: music begins
C: BEAVIS
D: Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
N: THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini. At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory. As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird stuff from my high school notebooks, etc. At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform. As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the movie.) Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead bodies. The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not far from the side of a road all along.
C: B&B
D: Ahhhhghhhhgh!
N: B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them with a shotgun.
C: BEAVIS
D: Aagh! I'm all wet!... Oh, cool. Heh heh heh. Water.
E: realizing

D: I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste to your bunghole! Heh heh.
N: BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
C: FLEMMING
D: OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
C: BORK
D: Where are his pants?
C: FLEMMING
D: Who knows?
N: Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious. Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
C: FLEMMING
D: This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
E: CONT.
C: BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO

N: ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
C: BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
D: You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole. Heh heh, this is cool. Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
E: Beavis Cornholio, chanting

C: TOM
D: Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
N: IN SLOW MOTION: A S.W.A.T. TEAM GUY lunges at Tom, grabbing the pants. Tom pulls away, causing the pants to RIP. THE UNIT GOES FLYING. A FROZEN MOMENT. SLOW MOTION. TIGHT ON THE UNIT. TIGHT ON FACES IN THE CROWD. TIGHT ON THE UNIT. TIGHT ON FLEMMING. TIGHT ON BUTT-HEAD, LAUGHING IN SLOW MOTION - OBLIVIOUS. TIGHT ON THE UNIT, FALLING, FALLING. IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS. The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do. Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
N: The crowd CHEERS. ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER. Tom is handcuffed roughly.
C: TOM
D: Now wait just a minute...

C: BUTT-HEAD
D: Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get money and stuff?
C: BEAVIS
D: Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to score.
C: FLEMMING
