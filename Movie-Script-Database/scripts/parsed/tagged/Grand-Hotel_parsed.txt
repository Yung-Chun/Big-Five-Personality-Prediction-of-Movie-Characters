S: EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR
N: Show general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel. MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and hearing.
T: DISSOLVE OUT.
N: DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble. CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed. THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE PROCEED until we are facing the elevator. At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf:
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam Grusinskaya will not want her car.
N: This line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying:
C: VOICE
D: Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.
N: The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA and he moves out towards the lobby. BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A string orchestra is playing. Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:
C: MAITRE D'HOTEL
D: Where is that gentleman's soup?
N: The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:
C: WAITER
D: Where's that soup?
N: Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward.
C: BOY
D: Quick -- come on -- come on...
N: The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup.
T: CUT TO:
N: CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down.
C: WAITER
D: Yes.
E: anxious voice
C: PREYSING
D: Cold.
E: grimly
C: VOICE
D: Mr. Preysing...
E: near Preysing's elbow
C: PREYSING
D: Yes...
E: in same voice
C: BELLBOY
D: Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --
N: Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- He walks out through the door...
T: DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:
N: Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl. Bellboy is with Preysing.
C: BELLBOY
D: Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his call.
C: GIRL
D: Yes, Mr. Preysing --
N: Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of switchboard.
C: GIRL
D: They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...
E: nervously
C: PREYSING
D: You told me it was on -- you said the call was through.
E: to boy he waits irritably
C: SECOND GIRL
D: Who's in number three?
E: to first
C: FIRST GIRL
D: Senf -- the hall porter.
E: Girl looks off at...
T: CUT TO:
N: SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH
C: SENF
D: Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel... Are you at the Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is she in pain?,... Isn't the child coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy for you to talk... Get away?,... No, I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's like being in jail. Oh, I hope the child comes along all right.
N: At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:
C: PREYSING
D: Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off the wire... No... I was talking to Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh... Hello!... Is that you dear?... How is everything at home?... What do you hear from the factory?... No... How are the children?... I left my shaving set at home... Yes, is your father there?... Hello, father?... Our stock has gone down twenty-three points. If our merger with the Saxonia doesn't go through -- I don't know what we can do... Hello, hello... yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything depends on Manchester... If they refuse to come in -- well, we will be in bad shape... no... Rely on me, I'll make it go through -- I'll make it go through... Waiting?... Yes, I'm still speaking...
N: THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.
C: SUZETTE
D: Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that, Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette... Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid... No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go to the rehearsal... No... Madam is in a terrible state, she didn't sleep all night -- She's very tired... No, I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't want to speak in front of her... I gave her a tablet of veronal... She's sleeping now... You had better come to the hotel, I'm afraid...
E: starting to speak
N: PAN TO BARON just entering booth. He is lighting a cigarette. (receiver down - trick)
C: BARON
D: Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron Gaigern himself. Where are you?,... Good... No -- first, I need money. I need it right now. I have to make a showing... That's my business. I hope to do it tonight... at the theatre or after the show... But money -- for the hotel bill, for tips... I don't need advice, I need money!... Now, listen...
E: speaking into telephone
N: PAN TO KRINGELEIN - booth.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Who is that, This is... Hello, hello!... Who is that... Heinrich? This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich. This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can you hear me?... I've got to speak very quickly. Every minute costs two marks ninety... What?... Otto Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin, staying at the best hotel, the Grand Hotel... No, don't you understand? I want to explain, but I must do so quickly, it costs so much. Please don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello! Listen! You know that will I made before my operation? I gave it to you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine... It's pretty bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I can't live much longer. I haven't long to live! That's what's the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on the line? No, it isn't nice to be told a thing like that. All sorts of things run through your head. I am going to stay here in Berlin. I am never coming back to Fredersdorf. Never! I want to get something out of life, too. You plague, and bother, and save -- and all of a sudden you are dead. Heinrich... You don't say anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, do you understand, the most expensive hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a room here. The very best people stay here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I saw him -- not five minutes after I was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell him exactly what I think of him. Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all my savings; my life insurance, too; I cashed in all my policies, the sick benefit fund, the old age pension, the unemployment insurance, the burial fund and everything... What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. I have to hang up now. I have to pay three times overcharge. Just think, Heinrich! There's music here all day long. And in the evening, they go around in full dress... Yes, sometimes I have pain, but I can stand it. Everything is frightfully expensive here. You can imagine, the Grand Hotel... What? Time's up...
E: louder
N: Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor approaching through Kringelein's booth. He is looking down at something.
T: CUT TO:
N: COMPLETE REVERSE - MATCH SHOT - SHOOT THEM BOTH TOGETHER Doctor is looking down at parcel. Kringelein's voice on same track. CAMERA BACKS UP. Show doctor as he passes various booths -- voices of respective people come up sharply.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm a sick man -- Heinrich -- Hello - hello -- Operator -- every minute two marks ninety.
N: Doctor passes Baron's booth next.
C: BARON
D: Dangerous?... That's my business... I'll do it tonight -- ...I'll do it alone.
N: Doctor passes Suzette's booth.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam is afraid -- she will never dance again -- there was no applause last night --
N: Doctor passes Preysing's booth.
C: PREYSING
D: Yes -- the merger -- Manchester -- it is my business as much as yours -- we've already lost eighty-five thousand --
N: Doctor passes Senf's booth.
C: SENF
D: I'm on duty -- I can't leave the Grand Hotel -- it's like being in prison -- the baby --
N: Doctor crosses to telephone operator:
C: DOCTOR
D: Any calls?
E: to operator
C: GIRL
D: No, Doctor.
C: DOCTOR
D: Grand Hotel -- people -- coming -- going... Who cares... nothing ever happens.
E: half to himself
T: FADE OUT.
N: SEQUENCE "#1" FACADE OF HOTEL showing electric sign -- odd angle -- THE GRAND HOTEL -- unlighted.
T: CUT TO:
N: ELECTRIC CONTROL ROOM small section -- Engineer pulling down lever. FACADE OF HOTEL sign flashes on.
T: DISSOLVE OUT:
S: DISSOLVE INTO: EXTERIOR HOTEL
N: Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action. Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi- mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc. -- These types indicated. In the distance we hear music.
T: DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:
N: YELLOWROOM - NEAR SHOT OF BAND This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in the Yellow Room of the hotel. THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the hour of the tea-dansant. As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- he proceeds through the door of the restaurant -- Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor upstairs -- giving sense of distance. The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLORIST SHOP Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied in ribbon.
C: BARON
D: Good little girl -- nice ones?
C: GIRL
D: Yes, Baron.
N: The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he leaves.
T: CUT TO:
N: LOBBY In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk. SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. Senf is busy. The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the flower box -- he is good-natured and patient.
C: SENF
D: Is that for me?
E: to Clerk -- as telephone bell rings
C: CLERK
D: No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
E: he replaces the receiver
C: SENF
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
E: to one of the bellboys
N: Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door.
C: BELLBOY'S VOICE
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be brought.
C: SENF
D: Good evening, Baron.
C: BARON
D: Good evening. Will you send these up to Madam Grusinskaya?
E: amiably
C: SENF
D: Yes, Baron. Madam Grusinskaya.
E: he hands the box of flowers to the clerk
N: Clerk hands box to bellboy.
C: CLERK
D: Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya.
C: BARON
D: Have you my tickets for the theatre?
E: to Senf
C: SENF
D: Oh yes, Baron -- Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam Grusinskaya.
E: to Clerk
N: Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up.
C: SENF
D: For me?
E: to Clerk
C: CLERK
D: No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
E: at telephone -- shakes his head
C: SENF
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
E: to boy
N: The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the Baron.
C: BARON
D: Charge them...
N: As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.
C: PIMENOV
D: Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
E: to Senf
C: BARON
D: Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
C: PIMENOV
D: Oh -- good evening, Baron.
C: BARON
D: How's the beautiful lady?
C: PIMENOV
D: Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
C: BARON
D: Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
C: PIMENOV
D: Well -- last night was not so good.
C: BARON
D: I thought she was splendid!
C: PIMENOV
D: Yes -- but the audience.
N: At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.
C: CLERK
D: The parquot loges are behind the parquet chairs.
E: to Japanese
C: JAPANESE
D: Then they've put me back and I want to be up in front. How is that, chairs in front of loges?
N: Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.
C: SENF
D: The train leaves at seven-thirty, Madam. That is the only through train -- the dining car goes along.
N: The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese speaks volubly to his wife.
C: BARON
D: It's always so quiet here.
E: sarcastically
C: PIMENOV
D: If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
C: BARON
D: My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
C: PIMENOV
D: No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
E: effeminately
N: At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Pardon me. Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor Zinnowitz.
E: addressing Senf
C: SENF
D: Mr. Preysing -- from Fredersdorf --
E: to bellboy
C: BELLBOY
D: Mr. Preysing --
E: quickly -- paging
N: Preysing steps quickly into scene.
C: PREYSING
D: Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Have I kept you waiting?
C: PREYSING
D: Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: No news yet?
C: PREYSING
D: No. No word.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
C: PREYSING
D: I know -- I know.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
N: As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to Senf.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: I'm expecting a young woman -- a stenographer -- she will ask for Mr. Preysing. Ask her to wait.
C: SENF
D: Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.
N: As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.
C: SENF
D: For me?
E: to Clerk
C: CLERK
D: No -- letters to two-eighty.
C: SENF
D: If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
E: to Clerk
N: This just covers the scene. The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them has said which brings our attention to them again. At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.
C: DOCTOR
D: Any letters?
C: SENF
D: No, Doctor.
C: DOCTOR
D: Telegrams?
C: SENF
D: No, Doctor.
C: DOCTOR
D: Anyone asked for me?
C: SENF
D: Nobody, Doctor.
N: The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with his one hand.
C: BARON
D: The war.
E: glancing at Doctor
C: PIMENOV
D: That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
E: looking up from his letter -- glances off at the doctor
C: BARON
D: Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
C: PIMENOV
D: The war dropped him here and forgot him.
C: BARON
D: Yes, I was in the war.
E: beams
T: CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --
N: He turns as he hears the Baron say this. He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: Please -- please pay some attention to me -- I have no time.
N: Pan back to desk:
C: ROHNA
D: If you will wait one moment, sir.
E: engaged with a lady and gentleman, who have just arrived
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
C: ROHNA
D: It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
N: Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.
C: ROHNA
D: Just one moment, sir.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
N: Second Clerk is looking straight at him. Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and proceeds:
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I came here because I wanted to live here, two weeks, maybe three -- God only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- I'm ill -- I can't wait.
N: As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is watching. Assistant Manager enters.
C: ASSISTANT MANAGER
D: Has the gentleman a complaint?
N: Rohna and Kringelein speak together.
C: ROHNA
D: The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
N: He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and looks up.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
E: continuing he bangs at the desk with his fist
C: DOCTOR
D: This gentleman can have my room.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh!
E: turning
C: DOCTOR
D: Send his bags up to my room.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- but -- I --
C: DOCTOR
D: You're tired. I can see that.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
C: DOCTOR
D: You are ill.
N: During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna quietly. The manager how turns.
C: MANAGER
D: Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
E: subdued -- exhausted --
C: MANAGER
D: Certainly, sir.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
N: He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money.
C: DOCTOR
D: That will not be necessary.
N: The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to the new room. Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has noticed the money, stoops to pick it up. In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat. Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Thank you, sir.
C: BARON
D: Not at all, sir.
E: amused he beams
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
E: finding a friendly face
C: BARON
D: I'm Baron von Gaigern.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, a Baron!
E: he is impressed
N: Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular.
C: BARON
D: And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
E: turning to Doctor
C: DOCTOR
D: I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
E: his finger goes nervously to his collar
N: Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out. At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where he has bought the evening papers.
C: PIMENOV
D: Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Is this gentleman a Baron, too?
E: to doctor
C: PIMENOV
D: Unfortunately no.
E: laughing
N: The Manager comes into scene.
C: MANAGER
D: Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Again?
C: MANAGER
D: Please.
N: Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him. At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Have you a minute now?
C: BARON
D: No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Time's getting short.
C: BARON
D: I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
N: Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still holds it in his hand.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: I want to speak --
C: BARON
D: Not now.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Yes, sir.
N: The Baron leaves. General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, Kringelein and the Doctor. SENF'S DESK On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Mr. Preysing.
E: we hear her ask
C: SENF
D: Will you wait please.
C: CLERK
D: The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
C: SENF
D: Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Thanks -- Heigh! -- Wait!
E: calling off to elevator
N: She crosses to elevator. THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR WITH HER. As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed. NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen. The lift ascends. UPPER CORRIDOR Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for the numbers. She moves out of scene. The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move straight down the hall. Pimenov is chatting volubly.
C: PIMENOV
D: Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, trains, hotels -- hotels, trains theatre.
E: to Baron
N: We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. Preysing's room.
C: PIMENOV
D: I must go and dress -- she'll be waking up and calling for me.
E: continuing
N: He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of his ballet. At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there is an amusing exchange of glances between them. Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.
C: PREYSING'S VOICE
D: Come in.
N: She opens the door.
T: CUT TO:
N: PREYSING'S ROOM Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel. He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.
C: PREYSING
D: What...! --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I'm the stenographer.
C: PREYSING
D: Then you will please wait outside.
N: He is very much affronted. Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the altogether --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Don't hurry -- take your time.
E: lightly
N: She goes out of the room and shuts the door.
T: CUT TO:
N: UPPER CORRIDOR Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room. Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: "Are you mad?"
C: BARON
D: Like dancing?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Not with strangers.
N: Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes out.
C: BARON
D: Never?
E: turning to Flaemmchen
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're a fool!
C: BARON
D: Yes, I am rather.
N: He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets. She glances impatiently at her watch.
C: BARON
D: He must be very nice.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Who?
C: BARON
D: Whoever is keeping you waiting.
E: gallantly
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Have you seen it?
E: indicating Preysing's door
C: BARON
D: Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
E: indicating Preysing's door
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: That.
C: BARON
D: You?
E: with meaning
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- work!!
E: quickly
C: BARON
D: Oh!
E: with meaning
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Dictation. You know...
E: she twittles her fingers
C: BARON
D: Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
E: lightly
C: BARON
D: Reducing?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: No -- why? -- should I?
E: she turns invitingly
C: BARON
D: Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Money -- Ever heard of it?
E: laughing in his face
C: BARON
D: Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
E: moves fingers
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Very little.
C: BARON
D: Too bad.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
C: BARON
D: Poor child -- I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
E: enthusiastically
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Aren't you?
E: with invitation
C: BARON
D: What?
E: quickly
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Free --
C: BARON
D: Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
E: glancing up passage
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
C: BARON
D: Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Where downstairs?
C: BARON
D: Yellow Room where they dance --
E: business
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're very funny --
C: BARON
D: Yes? -- Tomorrow?
E: with great meaning
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Of course.
C: BARON
D: Really?
N: Flaemmchen laughs at him.
C: BARON
D: We'll dance.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: All right. We'll dance.
E: slowly
N: At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage.
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: Baron -- Oh, Baron!
N: The Baron turns and looks off at --- KRINGELEIN Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He waves.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
E: to Baron and Flaemmchen
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
N: At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette comes out into the hall.
C: SUZETTE
D: Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh!
N: By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The Baron turns back for a moment.
C: BARON
D: Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!
E: calling back quietly to Suzette
N: Suzette turns back into the room.
T: CUT TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow Room below. In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers which she has been mending. She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly and looks off dramatically at... GRUSINSKAYA Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, on the chaise-lounge. Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand which is outside the robe moves. The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the chaise-lounge and is looking down. Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.
C: SUZETTE'S VOICE
D: Madam has slept well.
E: quietly and reverently -- almost a whisper
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: No, I have been awake -- thinking -- thinking.
C: SUZETTE'S VOICE
D: It is time for the performance.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The performance?
C: SUZETTE
D: It is time.
N: Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly upright --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
E: she pauses and droops suddenly she takes the bottle of veronal which is nearby laughs a little
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
E: speaking into telephone
N: While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to the floor and although there is only one other woman in the room -- she holds the robe around her. She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time. There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak. Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them. Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence. Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I can't dance tonight --
C: SUZETTE
D: It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Let us cancel the engagement.
C: SUZETTE
D: But, Madam. cannot do that.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
N: She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands unconsciously touch the pearls.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The peals are cold -- everything is cold -- finished -- it seems so far away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- the Grand Duke Sergei -- -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- it's all gone.
E: very quietly long pause as though she were reliving incidents of the past
N: She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.
C: SUZETTE
D: Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
N: Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.
C: SUZETTE
D: Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
N: Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away in Russia -- she does not look -- Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.
C: SUZETTE
D: Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Send it away -- I shan't need it.
N: There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Come in.
N: She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak into telephone.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Madam Grusinskaya will not require her car -- no -- she will not be going to the theatre.
E: authoritatively she turns
N: Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood. She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing- table and sits.
C: PIMENOV
D: It is time for the performance.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
E: under her breath during this scene the orchids fall to the floor
N: It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance.
C: PIMENOV
D: Poor little Lisevata -- she still has her stage frights -- it will pass.
E: tenderly -- as he touches her shoulder gently
N: Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he attempts to soothe her. Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
C: PIMENOV
D: What -- what is it? Last night...
E: tenderly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Last night?... There was no applause.
C: PIMENOV
D: There was -- there was.
E: quickly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
E: she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance
N: There is a sudden knocking at the door.
C: PIMENOV
D: Meierheim --
N: The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? ...Or is that the time?
E: glances at his watch
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I'm cancelling the engagement.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Oh!
N: Business of Pimenov signaling to him.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The house is not full -- Is it really full?
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh -- but it can't be.
E: to Suzette
C: SUZETTE
D: Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
E: she holds up her frock
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
E: changed mood
C: PIMENOV
D: We will wait.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: You are late. Hurry.
N: Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and says:
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur to bring the car.
N: Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed.
T: CUT TO:
N: BY ELEVATOR Pimenov and Meierheim. Meierheim is pushing the bell.
C: PIMENOV
D: How is the house?
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- Just jazz.
E: snaps his fingers
C: PIMENOV
D: If the house is empty again, I don't know --
C: MEIERHEIM
D: When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
N: They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc. In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter -- comedian.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
N: The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes her head.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. And these are real silk drapes.
E: he has a slight case of hiccups from the champagne. He touches the drapes
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
E: amusedly
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
E: who hasn't stopped talking
N: At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor Clerk.
C: PREYSING
D: The stenographer!
N: Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Her master's voice! I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
E: turns to Baron
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, don't go.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I'm engaged for the evening.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing -- Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
E: to Baron she is moving out
N: Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as though years had returned to him.
C: BARON
D: What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: General Director Preysing! Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
E: to himself possibly he turns to Baron
C: BARON
D: Then you know him?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
N: They start to leave. Oh, gentlemen, please don't go.
C: BARON
D: I must -- I hope to see you again, Mr. Kringelein.
N: Baron leaves.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
C: DOCTOR
D: I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
N: They move into the room.
T: CUT TO:
N: NO SCENES: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script. NEAR ELEVATOR Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there. Meierheim is pushing the elevator button. The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in the distance. Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette. GRUSINSKAYA Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down the corridor, followed by Suzette.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: BARON, PIMENOV AND MEIERHEIM
C: BARON
D: Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
C: PIMENOV
D: Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
N: Grusinskaya sweeps into scene. The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a glance at her. They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first time they have met in the picture. She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she turns to Suzette.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: My coat.
N: Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel case.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Why not?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Take them back, Suzette.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: You haven't time.
N: Suzette hesitates.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Hurry, Suzette.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Such nonsense.
N: Suzette toddles off with the pearls. The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the Baron and descends. FLASH IN A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up. FLASH IN A shot of the reverse of him looking down. The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in his action. For the first time he becomes furtive. HOTEL LOBBY - FROM ELEVATORS Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the great Grusinskaya.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: The car for Madam Grusinskaya.
E: off scene
N: The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to be echoed through the lobby. People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting. THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she sweeps outside of the hotel. The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs. IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON
T: FADE OUT:
N: END OF SEQUENCE "#1" PREYSING'S ROOM Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.
C: PREYSING
D: No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
C: PREYSING
D: Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
C: PREYSING
D: I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
C: PREYSING
D: Good night.
N: Zinnowitz leaves. SEQUENCE "#2" FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.
C: PREYSING'S VOICE
D: Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
N: Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's room. The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse. Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides forward As he strides he says:
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Moreover --
E: repeating
N: Preysing paces the room.
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover -- Is there a telegram for me yet?... Oh -- when it does, send it up.
E: repeating he pauses, thinking. Picks up telephone quickly -- into telephone
N: During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist- watch. Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.
C: PREYSING
D: Now, where was I? Oh -- sorry. Where was I?
E: he looks over the sheet in her typewriter -- accidentally his arm touches her neck he puts his cigar in his mouth and walks away. As he walks away
N: As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at attention.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Moreover...
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover...
N: It seems a silly kind of lull.
C: PREYSING
D: Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: No -- only occasional jobs.
E: she yawns suddenly
C: PREYSING
D: Tired?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You pay me.
C: PREYSING
D: You're a very unusual stenographer --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Moreover...
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover...
E: as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts
N: She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
C: PREYSING
D: Movies?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
N: She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to him. He looks down at it without touching it.
C: PREYSING
D: What is this?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I got ten marks for that.
N: He picks it up.
C: PREYSING
D: You...
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Me.
E: without looking up
N: As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes.
C: PREYSING
D: You...
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Moreover...
E: reading
C: PREYSING
D: What?
E: quickly
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
E: reading
C: PREYSING
D: What brown hands you have.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: That's from skiing.
C: PREYSING
D: Skiing?
E: he holds her hands
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
E: natural -- unabashed
N: He drops her hand suddenly.
C: PREYSING
D: A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
E: reading
N: Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to the work in hand.
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Perhaps.
E: she waits at attention
N: He paces back and forth again.
C: PREYSING
D: Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too.
E: she takes cigarette
C: PREYSING
D: With the same friend?
N: By this time she is smoking her cigarette.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: No.
E: without looking at him
C: PREYSING
D: Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
E: quickly
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Not too quickly.
C: PREYSING
D: What?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're a little too fast.
C: PREYSING
D: Can't you understand me?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I understand you perfectly.
C: PREYSING
D: Have you got it now?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Cotton Company --
E: typing
C: PREYSING
D: Should throw a great weight into the balance...
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: ...weight into the balance...
E: as he turns his back looks at him significantly
N: There is a sudden knock at the door.
C: PREYSING
D: Come in.
N: Boy enters with telegram.
C: BOY
D: Telegram for Mr. Preysing.
N: With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose. IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.
C: PREYSING
D: Oh -- oh.
E: he throws the telegram away from him, onto her desk. Paces the room.
N: Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Deal with Manchester Cotton Company definitely off.
N: Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Sorry.
N: Preysing paces the room with the telegram. Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: How nice -- your daughters?
C: PREYSING
D: My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
E: he is talking more to himself
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Is that Mrs. Preysing.
C: PREYSING
D: Definitely off.
E: to himself
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
E: she is looking at picture of Mrs. Preysing
C: PREYSING
D: That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
E: turns, speaks quickly -- definitely he turns, goes out onto balcony with telegram
N: Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up her papers and is prepared to leave.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLASH OF CORRIDOR Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to elevator. At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.
C: BARON'S VOICE
D: Come in!
E: calling
N: Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room. BARON'S ROOM Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
C: BARON
D: Well?
E: very nonchalantly
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
C: BARON
D: Yes.
E: very nonchalantly
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: And what are you going to do?
E: ready to explode
C: BARON
D: The pearls are in her room.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
E: threateningly
C: BARON
D: I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
C: BARON
D: I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Need any help?
C: BARON
D: No.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Have you got that skeleton key?
N: He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the Baron.
C: BARON
D: No --
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Why?
C: BARON
D: The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: I could take care of her.
E: contemptuously
C: BARON
D: How?
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
C: BARON
D: No -- no -- no -- no...
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Why?
C: BARON
D: Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
C: BARON
D: I don't like your tone.
E: swings suddenly on him
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: No --
E: comes up to him -- face to face
N: Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.
C: BARON
D: Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: With the pearls?
C: BARON
D: With the pearls --
N: The Chauffeur leaves. The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad lib. Crosses to window. FACADE OF HOTEL The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room. Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room. GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY Baron is pretty shaken by jump.
T: CUT TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite. Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:
C: LOUD SPEAKER
D: 'You are listening to the music of the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'
T: CUT TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:
T: CUT TO:
N: SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY: Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene bullying waiter. GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm. Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd way. As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's room. He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief. He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. Crosses to the door again. Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's voice singing an absurd song. He listens. She is coming in. The key turns in the door. Quickly he hides behind the curtains. Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room. He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door. The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio. The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties. At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks.
C: CHAMBERMAID
D: No -- no -- there is no one here.
E: she replaces the receiver
N: At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears at the open door.
C: INSPECTRESS
D: You're late... What have you been doing?
E: to Chambermaid
C: CHAMBERMAID
D: Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come back - come back.' They won't get out of their rooms.
E: grumbling
N: The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it is locked. Telephone bell rings again. Inspectress picks it up quickly.
C: INSPECTRESS
D: No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... The Western Theater?... No...
N: Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette. Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.
C: SUZETTE'S VOICE
D: Have you seen Madame?
C: CLERK'S VOICE
D: Isn't she at the theatre?
E: replying
N: Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.
C: SUZETTE
D: Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at the hotel.
T: INTERCUT
N: With the Baron watching. GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room. Business ad lib. Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, I haven't found her. Is Desprez dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all right. Keep the show going. Wait till I see her, she'll pay for this -- this little trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract.
E: into telephone bangs down receiver
C: SUZETTE
D: Madame is ill -- her nerves...
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Her nerves... What about my nerves?... Who is she anyway? Where does she think she is -- Russia? Those days have passed.
N: He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madame --
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Well?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I want to be alone.
N: The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: Where have you been?
C: SUZETTE
D: Should I -- Does madame wish...
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Suzette, please go, I want to be alone.
N: Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, waiting for Meierheim. Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I wish to be alone.
C: MEIERHEIM
D: You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
E: he stamps out
N: Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit. DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON. It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz. Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob. FLASH OF BARON Watching her. GRUSINSKAYA Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. Then she becomes weary again. With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain -- where the Baron is standing. BARON We see him tense himself. GRUSINSKAYA She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out of scene. CLOSEUP OF BARON He peeps around the curtains.
T: CUT TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say:
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The end -- over -- finished --
N: Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom. Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet. She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- asks for the theatre.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The Western Theatre --
N: She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to telephone speaks:
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Western Theatre?
N: She glances up at the clock.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- hurry.
N: Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.
N: She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into the telephone --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... No, no don't -- ...Just alone... Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, how is it going, badly?... Uh?... Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- they didn't miss me?... They didn't miss me. They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov...
E: long pause she lets her hand drop with the receiver and goes on talking into the air
N: She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced. The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind her the Baron peers from the closet. Her head sinks down upon her hands. A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks:
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have finished.
E: with great humility she replaces the receiver
N: The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It is in fact, ballet. Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone. She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before. We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth. She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray. The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it. It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it. At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed. She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. She places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance herself. The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there. She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly. She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a sitting position.
C: BARON
D: Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.
N: She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the bed.
C: BARON
D: Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor.
N: Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be a silly movement.
C: BARON
D: There.
E: takes a pillow from the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps back
N: She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair. Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense of relief with her. She is trembling. The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)
C: BARON
D: Please do not be frightened, Madam.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: What do you want here?
E: after a silence
C: BARON
D: Nothing -- only to be here.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Why do you hide in my room?
C: BARON
D: But surely you must know -- because I love you.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Because you love me -- you love me?
N: She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately.
C: BARON
D: Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
E: going over to her
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
E: sitting up
C: BARON
D: Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
E: regaining control
C: BARON
D: I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
N: A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She sweeps across the room.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
C: BARON
D: I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
E: following her
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Certainly.
N: She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Why do you look at me like that?
C: BARON
D: I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: And then --?
E: bitterly
C: BARON
D: No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: And -- and --
E: involuntarily closing her eyes
C: BARON
D: How tired you are!
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes -- tired...
C: BARON
D: So alone.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
E: whispers in Russian
C: BARON
D: You mustn't talk Russian to me.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Strange man...
C: BARON
D: Am I quite strange to you?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
C: BARON
D: And...?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
C: BARON
D: I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
E: he embraces her
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Go away. Who are you --?
C: BARON
D: A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
C: BARON
D: I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
C: BARON
D: Yes -- I do understand.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
C: BARON
D: I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I want to be alone.
C: BARON
D: That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
E: he looks back at the bed as if remembering the suicide.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I want to be alone --
C: BARON
D: No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Just for a minute then.
E: whispering
N: Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --
C: BARON
D: What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.
N: She whispers.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: You -- man...
N: The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly. (NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is) She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. She can't find the other. Business as he gets other slipper for her. He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Thank you -- you are gallant. What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is many years since she did such a thing... You frightened me -- badly. You're responsible for this -- painful scene.
E: she turns, her mood has changed
N: He watches her. The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
C: BARON
D: I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
N: Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
C: BARON
D: I should like to smoke.
E: naive as he says frankly
N: She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Why do you smile?
C: BARON
D: Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
E: he pauses suddenly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: What can you see?
C: BARON
D: You are beautiful!
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: No.
C: BARON
D: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
N: Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it. A long tender and sincere embrace. Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages herself.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor.
N: He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.
C: BARON
D: I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: What?
C: BARON
D: The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I want to be alone.
C: BARON
D: That is not the truth. You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
E: he catches her wrists he almost shakes her
N: Her head falls slowly on his breast.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: For just a minute then. No -- oh, no!
E: whispers she pulls away, crosses the room, quickly to the door, with almost a cry. She looks around for the key to the door
N: He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.
C: BARON
D: Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --
N: Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor. FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor. They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for the first time by alcohol. Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole. THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because the Doctor has paused at the door.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
C: DOCTOR
D: The Grand Hotel.
E: with a deprecating gesture
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
C: DOCTOR
D: Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
E: he leaves
C: KRINGELEIN
D: But Doctor --
E: to doctor
N: But the Doctor has gone. Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib. He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. Imitating the doctor, he repeats:
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- good night.
N: He puts his hat on the knob of the bed. He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass and some water which he sees standing on the night table by his bed. He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine bottles. His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain. He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain. He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine away. With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters around the room, undressing.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE
N: His voice is still heard in the passage. Rows of shoes outside the doors. The dozing night clerk hears the voice and looks up, startled.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO A WATCHMAN
N: with his clock, hears the voice.
T: DISSOLVE OUT:
N: DISSOLVE INTO A CORNER OF DOCTOR'S ROOM He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on. He looks up suddenly, hearing the voice.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO PREYSING'S ROOM
N: He is snoring. The distant voice disturbs him. He turns in his sleep.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
N: A beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows.
C: BARON'S VOICE
D: I've never been as happy.
C: GRU'S VOICE
D: What did you say?
C: BARON'S VOICE
D: I've never been as happy!
C: GRUSINSKAYA'S VOICE
D: Say it again -- say it!
C: BARON'S VOICE
D: I have never been so happy!
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
N: He is now dressed in an absurd night dress. He crosses to the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great pillows. His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light. He might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh. DISTANT CLOCK CHIMES.
T: FADE OUT:
N: END OF SEQUENCE "#2" SEQUENCE "#3"
T: FADE IN:
N: TELEPHONE ROOM It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written) We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.

D: Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
C: PREYSING
D: We did not approach you.
C: WAITZ
D: Letter on file September fourteenth would show that you approached...
E: quickly looking through the papers
C: PREYSING
D: It isn't so -- this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own.
E: snatching the document from his hand -- losing his temper
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
E: snatching the document violently away
C: PREYSING
D: Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.
E: he nearly chokes
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Of course you took the initiative.
N: Zinnowitz enters the room.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
C: PREYSING
D: Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
E: he clears his throat
C: GERSTENKORN
D: How clear is Manchester?
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
E: to Preysing
C: PREYSING
D: I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Well -- gentlemen.
N: There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
E: over Zinnowitz's voice -- with a sigh -- sits back
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: As you remember it -- when you approached us...
E: stops suddenly -- takes glasses from his nose -- he is speaking, not reading
C: GERSTENKORN
D: We did not approach you.
E: bangs the paper down
C: PREYSING
D: I know you did -- I said you did --
C: GERSTENKORN
D: And I said we didn't.
C: WAITZ
D: And I know we didn't.
N: During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues over her.
T: CUT TO:
N: NO SCENE 61 Sequence omitted from original script. GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn about her. She speaks voluably.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
C: BARON
D: I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
C: BARON
D: I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Really?
C: BARON
D: Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: No?
C: BARON
D: When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: And?
C: BARON
D: And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: And what do you do -- now?
C: BARON
D: I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
C: BARON
D: I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
E: seriously he turns away
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: That's a silly joke.
C: BARON
D: Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
E: turns -- takes both her hands he releases her hands and turns away again.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: What is the matter?
N: He does not answer.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Flix!
N: The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them before her.
C: BARON
D: There.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh --
E: with a little cry of pain in the silence Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks
N: The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then holds back.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Did you come here just -- just for that? Oh -- it's horrible.
E: softly
N: Pause. She is suddenly cold.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
C: BARON
D: I don't want them now.
E: passionately
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I'll not denounce you.
E: broken
C: BARON
D: I know.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: So --
C: BARON
D: Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
C: BARON
D: I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: And now?
E: softly
C: BARON
D: I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.
E: his head goes down into her lap -- he sighs:
N: His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.
C: BARON
D: Do you understand?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes -- yes -- yes.
N: There is a sudden knock at the door.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Quickly -- here.
N: With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Good morning, Suzette.
C: SUZETTE
D: Good morning, Madam.
E: delighted to see her in a good mood
N: She puts the coffee down on the table. Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily crested cigarette case of the Baron.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam has slept well?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Oh, yes, Suzette.
E: enthusiastically
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam will dress now, it is late.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
C: SUZETTE
D: Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
N: She is a French woman. She is pleased.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam is beautiful this morning.
N: As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes, Suzette.
N: Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: You must go now.
N: As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to the telephone.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: There -- it begins.
N: With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and speaks.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...
N: During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: No --
E: to Baron
N: During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns suddenly --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you mad? We always have great success in Vienna... Certainly not. Come here and see me... yes... good-bye.
N: She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other. The telephone rings again.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: There -- the day begins... I must go to rehearsal.
E: quickly
N: She lets the telephone ring.
C: BARON
D: Grusinskaya --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes.
C: BARON
D: You do believe that I really love you?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
C: BARON
D: I want to be good to you -- madly good.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Suzette will be back here in a minute.
C: BARON
D: I'll go -- good-bye.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Shall I see you again?
C: BARON
D: I --
N: Telephone bell rings again.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Suzette will be back here any minute.
C: BARON
D: When are you leaving Berlin?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Very early in the morning.
C: BARON
D: For Vienna?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
C: BARON
D: Oh -- yes but -- later.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Why later?
C: BARON
D: I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
C: BARON
D: Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
C: BARON
D: Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
N: They move towards the door.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I shall dance and you'll be with me and then -- listen -- After that you will come with me to Lake Como, I have a villa there. The sun will be shining. I will take a vacation -- six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be happy and lazy. And then you will go with me to South America -- oh!
N: Telephone starts ringing.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
C: BARON
D: I'll go. -- I love you. I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
E: he kisses her
N: She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
C: BARON
D: Don't worry. I'll be on the train. He leaves.
E: he kisses her
N: Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are you, in your room? Come, I will see you now... hurry.
E: speaking into telephone
N: She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, she is indeed younger. Suzette is putting out a dark dress.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Not that dark dress -- something light -- bright -- it's a sunny morning, Suzette.
N: Suzette happily glances at her. There is a knock at the door.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Come in.
E: sings
N: Pimenov enters, before he can speak --
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Good morning, Pimenov.
C: PIMENOV
D: Good morning, Gru -- your --
E: a little puzzled at change in her
N: Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new ballet -- it must have mad music -- I'll explain it to you later. But now, hurry to the theatre -- I want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- Quickly. I will be there --
N: During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face. Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him the cigarette case on the table. As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost sweeps Suzette to the door with him.
C: PIMENOV
D: Gru -- you are positively radiant.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
E: quickly to Suzette
N: They leave. Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the telephone.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... Baron von Gaigern -- yes...
E: very very softly - her voice is like music to operator
N: While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... Cherie... yes... it is you... nothing... good morning, good morning, cherie... nothing... no... just to tell you I'm happy.
E: again into telephone she speaks quietly
T: FADE OUT SLOWLY:
N: Bring music up. END OF SEQUENCE "#3" SEQUENCE "#4"
S: EXT. HOTEL - SIGN
N: Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same angle as before. The sign lights.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key shot of the lobby. Senf is busy. The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien.
C: SENF
D: Step back please.
N: Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He does not move but glares at Senf.
C: SENF
D: I've told you three times -- Baron von Gaigern is out.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: Did he leave any message for me?
C: SENF
D: No, he did not -- there is no message.
N: This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.
C: DOCTOR
D: Any letters?
E: to Senf
C: SENF
D: No, doctor.
N: During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off. Kringelein comes to the doctor.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a day!
N: They move away from the scene. Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following the chauffeur. The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the back of the Baron in the shot. CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.
C: BARON
D: Madam Grusinskaya.
E: to Senf
C: SENF
D: For Madam Grusinskaya.
E: taking the flowers and handing them to clerk
C: CLERK
D: Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
E: to page boy
C: SENF
D: Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
E: to Baron
C: BARON
D: All right.
E: Quickly -- shortly he glances around apprehensively
N: Kringelein is speaking to the doctor. The Baron approaches them.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
C: BARON
D: Yes, quite.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
E: to doctor
C: DOCTOR
D: Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
N: The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.
C: BARON
D: I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
C: BARON
D: Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
E: amused
N: The Baron leaves.
C: DOCTOR
D: No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
T: NOTE: Find cut here.
N: While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed under the door, glances at it. FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER In scrawl: "I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR AT THE GARAGE." "S"
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: BARON We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the conference room. Bring up noise from the conference room.
T: CUT TO:
N: CONFERENCE ROOM We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a pretty picture.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: ...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
E: he is hoarse and tired
C: GERSTENKORN
D: I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
N: Preysing jumps to his feet.
C: PREYSING
D: Evil days -- I've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
E: he bangs the paper
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
C: PREYSING
D: What?
C: SCHWEIMANN
D: Shall I tell them again?
E: to Gerstenkorn -- with a sigh
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Why waste time -- it's getting late.
E: glancing at his watch
C: SCHWEIMANN
D: You see -- what we are interested in --
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Ah, come on -- we're going home.
E: interrupting
N: Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
E: rising
C: GERSTENKORN
D: You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
N: IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram and glances at it. The following scene is played over this closeup.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Sorry, Preysing.
E: he gets his hat
C: PREYSING
D: You've decided against the merger?
E: nervously
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Yes --
C: PREYSING
D: Then, it's all over?
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Yes --
C: WAITZ
D: Well -- well -- You could call my office.
E: to Zinnowitz
N: There is a general movement to go. FLASH OF TELEGRAM Trembling in Preysing's hand. "DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY OFF." GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
C: PREYSING
D: Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester. You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
E: interrupting he develops almost a passion he is generating almost a passion
C: GERSTENKORN
D: What?
C: PREYSING
D: Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
E: he starts packing up his papers.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: If you actually have news from Manchester then...
C: PREYSING
D: Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
E: he is perspiring, his hands are trembling
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Preysing, you're joking with us.
C: SCHWEIMANN
D: You're a deep one.
N: QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM
C: GERSTENKORN
D: In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
C: PREYSING
D: I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
E: smiling, slowly folds up the telegram and puts it back in his pocket
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
C: PREYSING
D: Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
N: By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table. Preysing is perspiring. Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Come on -- business is business -- Come on --
N: Preysing stands, looking ahead of him. Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at Waitz. Flaemmchen is awakening.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: What a session this has been.
N: While Preysing is signing.
C: SCHWEIMANN
D: It's twenty-five to six.
C: WAITZ
D: We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine.
C: GERSTENKORN
D: See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
E: with his hat and coat
C: PREYSING
D: Next week.
N: Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits. Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out. Preysing has not moved. Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry the signature.
C: PREYSING
D: Next week.
E: to himself
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
N: Preysing does not answer. Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Well -- the deal has been put through.
N: Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.
C: PREYSING
D: Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through.
N: During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: What's the matter with you?
E: to Preysing
C: PREYSING
D: Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
E: hysterically
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: What's bluff?
C: PREYSING
D: That.
E: throwing the telegram on the table
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: 'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
E: reading at out loud
C: PREYSING
D: No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...
E: he turns away
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
C: PREYSING
D: Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: What you need is some relaxation.
C: PREYSING
D: Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
C: PREYSING
D: Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: What do you want with her?
C: PREYSING
D: I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
C: PREYSING
D: Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Pretty as a picture.
C: PREYSING
D: Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz. I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
E: he is picking up papers
C: ZINNOWITZ
D: Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
N: Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that moment the telephone rings.
C: PREYSING
D: Aeh!
N: He crosses to the telephone.
C: PREYSING
D: Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that you?... The agreement is signed -- I did it... yes, father-in-law... but now I must go to Manchester.
E: into telephone
N: When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking --
T: DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:
N: COCKTAIL SHAKER -- which shakes more. Music crashes up --
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO BAR
N: Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering. Kringelein is changed. His hair has been cut short and his moustache is gone, he looks almost saucy.
C: DOCTOR
D: Barman -- whiskey -- For you, Mr. Kringelein?
E: to barman to Kringelein
C: KRINGELEIN
D: For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
C: BARMAN
D: A Louisiana flip, sir?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: A Louisiana flip, that sounds very nice -- sweet, eh? --
N: During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly happy.
C: DOCTOR
D: What do you do in the Grand Hotel? Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do business -- flirt a little -- dance a little. A hundred doors to one hall and nobody knows anything about the person next to him. When you leave another takes your room and lies in your bed -- the end.
N: At that moment Flaemmchen enters.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip. A Louisiana flip.
E: to barman
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: No - absinthe.
E: to barman
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- that --
E: amazed
N: Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried away. Flaemmchen laughs.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You like music?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: A man might what?
E: mischievously
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- you would!
E: very quietly
N: The Baron enters quickly.
C: BARON
D: Hello -- sorry I'm late.
E: to Flaemmchen
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
C: BARON
D: Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: A little strange, Baron.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I'd given you up.
C: BARON
D: Sorry.
E: to Flaemmchen
C: KRINGELEIN
D: A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
C: BARON

E: to Kringelein
N: BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN DANCING
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: What have you been doing all day?
C: BARON
D: Chasing around.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Chasing what?
C: BARON
D: Money.
N: They dance a few steps, in silence.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You were very different yesterday.
C: BARON
D: Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
N: They dance into the crowd.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: BAR
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: What, Doctor?
C: DOCTOR
D: A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
C: DOCTOR
D: You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
C: DOCTOR
D: I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
E: quietly
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Everything?
C: DOCTOR
D: I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. I've been everything.
E: pause
N: The music has stopped.
T: CUT TO:
N: BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: That was lovely.
C: BARON
D: Will you do me a big favor?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I'll do anything for you.
C: BARON
D: Would you like to make a man happy?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes -- I'd love to.
E: quietly
C: BARON
D: Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Why?
C: BARON
D: I feel sorry for him.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
C: BARON
D: I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
C: BARON
D: I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Anything for you.
N: They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm.
C: PREYSING
D: Miss Flaemm.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Hello!
C: PREYSING
D: I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Presently, Mr. Preysing.
E: with the Baron
C: PREYSING
D: It's urgent.
C: BARON
D: Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
C: PREYSING
D: Insolent -- Berlin manners.
E: to himself
N: At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to Preysing.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
C: PREYSING
D: I don't know you.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
E: quickly
C: PREYSING
D: I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Tomorrow morning.
E: lightly
C: PREYSING
D: No -- now.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
N: They bow stiffly.
C: PREYSING
D: Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I could not think of not accepting.
C: PREYSING
D: You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
N: Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
E: her arms go around Kringelein. They dance off
C: PREYSING
D: I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
C: BARON
D: Oh, let the poor devil alone.
C: PREYSING
D: I did not ask your advice.
N: The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a fight.
C: BARON
D: I think it would be much better if you went away.
C: PREYSING
D: We shall see who remains here the longer.
C: BARON
D: As you will.
E: shrugging his shoulders
N: Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron turns his back to him, watching the dancing.
T: CUT TO:
N: FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You must look at my face and not at the floor.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're trembling.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I never danced before -- in public.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You dance splendidly.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Really?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
N: Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion. Flaemmchen watches him quickly.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Let's stop -- I'm tired.
N: It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's distress.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
N: They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's arm.
C: PREYSING
D: Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
C: PREYSING
D: You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
C: PREYSING
D: What is this insolence?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
C: PREYSING
D: Go away -- go away.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Please -- please!
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
C: PREYSING
D: Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
C: PREYSING
D: You're discharged.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Me?
C: PREYSING
D: Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
N: Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it. Kringelein starts to laugh. The Baron steps into the scene. The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You can't discharge me -- I'm my own master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm going to die -- do you understand? I'm going to die very soon. Nothing can happen to me now. Nobody can do anything any more to me. By the time you can have discharged me I shall have been dead already.
E: his laugh becomes a convulsive sob
N: The Baron steps between the two looking straight into Preysing's face.
C: DOCTOR
D: Come, Mr. Kringelein.
E: he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar
C: PREYSING
D: The man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die... I shall see you in the lobby in half an hour.
E: his fists clenched, between his teeth hesitates -- to Flaemmchen
N: END SEQUENCE "#4" SEQUENCE "#5"
T: FADE IN:
N: KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD General activity. The house detective, later identified, is talking to the chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.
C: HOUSE DETECTIVE
D: Better let him stay -- I've sent for the Baron... How's your wife coming along?
C: SENF
D: I was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor. They wouldn't let me in to see her. She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and I have to stay here chained to this desk.
C: HOUSE DETECTIVE
D: It will be all right.
C: SENF
D: I hope so.
N: At that moment Preysing enters.
C: PREYSING
D: Did you send that page?
C: SENF
D: The young lady's there, sir.
N: Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking around. Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
C: PREYSING
D: Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
E: calls to a boy
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Nothing.
N: At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass. Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes.
C: PREYSING
D: I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Well -- you want me?
C: PREYSING
D: Yes.
E: looks straight at her
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Well?
C: PREYSING
D: I must go to England -- at once.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Well?
C: PREYSING
D: You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I understand perfectly.
C: PREYSING
D: What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Wait -- I must figure it up. First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
E: she smokes and thinks
C: PREYSING
D: Of course -- of course.
E: he is fidgeting
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: A thousand marks --
E: she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much
C: PREYSING
D: It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
N: She is looking away.
C: PREYSING
D: I can get a room here in the Grand Hotel for you.
N: She still looks away.
C: PREYSING
D: Can you pay some attention to me?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh, yes.
C: PREYSING
D: Insolent young cub!
E: looking off
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You mean Baron von Gaigern?
C: PREYSING
D: Baron!
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Well, he's a gentleman!
N: THE BARON Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein. THE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM. They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at: FLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk. BACK TO: THE BARON He slumps on the arm of the chair.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: The Baron is tired?
E: watching him
C: BARON
D: No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- Well -- well --
E: he shrugs his shoulders
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
C: BARON
D: I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
N: The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --
T: CUT IN:
N: FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR Arguing with Senf.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: BARON
C: BARON
D: Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.
E: he strides off
N: Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron. He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron money. Charming scene.
T: CUT TO:
N: BARON AND CHAUFFEUR Moving into position. They are talking.
C: BARON
D: I've quit.
E: quietly
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: You can't.
C: BARON
D: I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: What about the money?
C: BARON
D: I'll pay you back.
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: How?
C: BARON
D: I have an idea working in my head...
E: he glances at Kringelein
C: CHAUFFEUR
D: You might find a bullet through that head...
C: BARON
D: If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
N: At that moment a voice is heard.
C: VOICE
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam Grusinskaya's car.
N: It is passed along.
C: INSIDE PORTER
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car --
E: calls through his little telephone
C: MEGAPHONE
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car --
E: outside
C: BARON
D: Later.
E: quickly to chauffeur Chauffeur exits with bad grace.
N: Baron looks off... FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. Music comes up. Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward. As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Go on please -- go on, Suzette.
E: to them
N: She and the Baron are alone.
C: BARON
D: Bless you...
E: quietly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
C: BARON
D: I can't.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: No?
C: BARON
D: No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Why do you think --
C: BARON
D: Why?
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: They've brought me such good luck -- you --
N: He takes her hand, kisses it quietly.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I'm worried about you.
C: BARON
D: Don't.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: On the train?
C: BARON
D: Yes -- I will be on the train.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Till then.
C: BARON
D: Bless you --
N: During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his mind miles away.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
C: BARON
D: Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
E: lightly
C: KRINGELEIN
D: If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
N: The Baron looks at him suddenly.
C: BARON
D: What?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
C: BARON
D: If I could get into a game I might win some.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
C: BARON
D: If we could scare up some men to play.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: We could come to my room.
C: BARON
D: Good!
E: with enthusiasm
N: At that moment Flaemmchen passes.
C: BARON
D: Going?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes --
N: Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind. A curious little scene. She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to Kringelein.
C: BARON
D: Ready, Kringelein?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Ready, Baron.
N: They move off and are last in the crowd.
T: FADE OUT:
N: END OF SEQUENCE "#5" SEQUENCE "#6" No scenes 88-93 inclusive Sequence omitted from original script.
T: DISSOLVE INTO:
N: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players. White faced, the Baron has the bank. Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table. Kringelein's back is to us. They are smart people, not professional gamblers. There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around tightly. We do not see the cards. The following voices are heard:
C: BARON'S VOICE
D: All right, gentlemen.
C: VOICES
D: I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- Playing --
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: Yes -- me.
N: Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Is that too much, Baron?
C: BARON
D: No -- not at all.
E: glances down at his own money
C: KRINGELEIN
D: All right then.
C: BARON
D: All right then.
N: There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. Kringelein takes cards.
C: A MAN
D: Don't show them.
E: quickly
N: Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a new game. The Baron deals himself a card.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: What do I do now?
E: to Baron
N: The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to take him to Vienna.
C: A MAN
D: Turn 'em up.
E: next to Kringelein
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --
E: he turns the card up
N: The Baron rises.
C: BARON
D: There you are gentlemen.
C: A MAN
D: Will you take the bank, sir?
E: to Kringelein
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen -- please, let us drink -- champagne --- champagne is expensive and good. I'm winning more than I used to earn in a year -- double what I used to earn.
E: he is counting his money
N: They hand him the cards. Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Where is the Baron -- where are you, Baron?
N: At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- his face is white -- he has lost.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Excuse me, gentlemen.
E: rising quickly
C: DOCTOR
D: I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
E: sitting down in Kringelein's place
N: Kringelein has come to the Baron.
C: BARON
D: That was my last.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You've lost everything?
C: BARON
D: I've no luck.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
E: he puts bills in Baron's hand.
N: Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.
C: BARON
D: Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win. It's good, -- come along, Baron.
E: earnestly he drinks
N: They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the bank.
C: BARON
D: I take five hundred.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: All of that at once, Baron?
N: The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't understand.
C: BARON
D: Eight.
E: he is triumphant.
C: DOCTOR'S VOICE
D: Nine.
E: rings in background
N: The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and turns to Kringelein:
C: BARON
D: That's it. The luck's with you.
E: he walks away.
C: VOICES
D: Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
C: A MAN
D: Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
N: Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down on the table. Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another drink.
C: DOCTOR
D: Out, Baron?
C: BARON
D: For a while -- I'll recover -- in ten or twenty years. Look at that.
E: bitterly he points
N: He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's voice:
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: I've won again, Baron -- I've won again.
N: Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron approaches table.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Baron, I drink and win -- I drink and win -- I win and drink!
E: he is pulling money towards him, counting it, eagerly, frantically, not the movement of a miser, not a greedy movement, but the movement of an excited child liberated. Money has become so much mad paper to him.
N: During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back now.
C: A MAN
D: There are complaints in the hotel about the noise.
C: VOICES
D: What time is it? Getting late? Let's break it up! You've been very lucky... Where's my coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!... Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the game, I'm broke and tired; you can't play against him. I put my hat down here, somewhere. I think I'll have a drink before I go. By the way, I've got to see you tomorrow morning. How've you been, Doctor?
E: to Kringelein
N: Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit. Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up suddenly, sees men are leaving --
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a while. Be my guests!
E: he stands to his feet
N: By this time the men are pausing by the door.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I oughtn't to presume, but I -- I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
E: he is a little drunk
C: A MAN
D: Splendid!
E: slapping him on back
N: There is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has reached an emotional pitch.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
C: A MAN
D: Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
E: sings
N: General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him goodnight. The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's shoulder. Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men are nearing the door.
C: A MAN
D: It's a short life and a gay one...
E: starts singing
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --
E: seizing a glass of champagne turns to Baron he collapses suddenly onto the floor
N: Business ad lib. The doctor is there quickly. The Baron next.
C: MAN
D: Drunk.
C: ANOTHER MAN
D: Poor fellow.
N: General normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry Kringelein to the bed.
C: VOICES
D: Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill. He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- He's just drunk!
E: of players mingling well paused over:
C: DOCTOR
D: Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very ill -- if you will leave.
C: VOICES
D: Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!
C: DRUNKEN MAN
D: He's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it?
N: Little comedy on exit. Ad lib. INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, tragic. One man, perhaps, remains.
C: MAN
D: Can I help, doctor?
C: DOCTOR
D: No, the Baron will stay.
C: BARON
D: Certainly.
N: Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp. By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket. We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket -- He stands looking down at Kringelein.
C: DOCTOR
D: It will be over in a minute.
E: drops Kringelein's hand
N: Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. Oh, the pain.
E: he closes his eyes suddenly
C: DOCTOR
D: Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
E: mutteringly
C: BARON
D: You'll be all right, Kringelein.
E: touching his shoulder gently he moves from the bed -- takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. He seizes his drink
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: My pocketbook... my money in it...
E: out of scene
C: DOCTOR'S VOICE
D: What do you say -- what?
N: We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.
C: DOCTOR'S VOICE
D: You what -- Oh, isn't it there?
C: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
D: No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost my pocketbook.
N: Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them. The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.
C: DOCTOR
D: There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
E: He glances down
C: KRINGELEIN
D: More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
E: starting up suddenly
C: DOCTOR
D: Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
E: looking at Baron
C: BARON
D: Quite possibly.
E: with a shrug
N: At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, I've got to find it.
C: DOCTOR
D: Stay where you are.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: No -- I must find it -- Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
E: he starts talking he pulls himself to the side of the bed
N: The doctor goes to restrain him.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: I'm all right, Doctor. There's no pain now -- only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.
N: He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets under the card table. The Doctor looks at the Baron. The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You don't know, because you've never lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and saved and scrimped. My life hangs upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives you anything. You have to buy everything and pay cash for it. I wanted to pay for my last days with that money. Every hour costs money. I've nothing -- nothing but that pocketbook. I must have it back.
E: talking at intervals as he crawls looking for money he crawls along the floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he looks he pauses breathless -- like an animal along the wall -- looking up at the men
N: The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it is not a long speech: The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the time the Doctor watches. The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting conscience. Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but piercing, says:
C: DOCTOR
D: He must find his money, Baron. Mr. Kringelein should find his pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?
E: next time
N: These are two interjections. And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little sack of pain, his head down. The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his voice as he says:
C: BARON
D: Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
E: his head coming up
C: BARON
D: Goodnight, Kringelein.
E: quickly he moves towards the door.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
C: DOCTOR
D: You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
C: KRINGELEIN
D: No.
C: BARON
D: Come, get up -- come let me help you.
N: NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.
C: BARON
D: You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
N: Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.
C: DOCTOR'S VOICE
D: Goodnight, Baron.
C: BARON
D: Goodnight.
E: his hand presses on Kringelein's shoulder -- he exits
T: CUT OUT INTO:
N: CORRIDOR Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience feel his problem with him. This man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his hair back. Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. He walks down the corridor.
C: BARON
D: Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
C: BARON
D: You live here?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: For tonight.
E: she points to door -- she looks at him a long time
C: BARON
D: Oh!
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes -- oh!
C: BARON
D: Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
N: They both go into their respective rooms. Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically for the want of a little money. FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his door. She peeps through.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM from her angle. Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his hand. FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night. CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off. SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks hoarsely, quietly.
C: PREYSING
D: Flaemmchen!
E: he seizes her to him
N: She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. She is passive -- cold.
C: PREYSING
D: You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
E: breathlessly
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I had to arrange about the trip.
C: PREYSING
D: You're sweet.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You think so?
N: He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately avoids his kiss.
C: PREYSING
D: Come here.
E: awkwardly he sits heavily on the bed, sitting on her night dress.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Here, hold up!
N: Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him. He draws her to him.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
C: PREYSING
D: Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh, no.
E: pulling away, glad of an excuse for conversation
C: PREYSING
D: Why not?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
C: PREYSING
D: You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said: 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
E: she imitates him
N: Preysing laughs. She laughs.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: That's all quite proper. But supposing I met you when you were with your wife and I called out: "Hello you big baby -- remember Manchester?' And you with your wife, how would you like that?
E: she is happy again. She would rather talk than be squeezed
N: There is a pause for a moment.
C: PREYSING
D: Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this.
N: Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: All right. I'll get undressed -- get out.
N: He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony. Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.
C: PREYSING
D: Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
C: BARON
D: I must have made a mistake.
C: PREYSING
D: Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here... Give me that money.
E: the Baron starts to leave. bellowing
N: The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.
C: PREYSING
D: So that's how we stand, Baron.
C: BARON
D: Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
C: PREYSING
D: Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
C: BARON
D: Be quiet.
C: PREYSING
D: I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
E: he picks up the telephone
N: The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob.
C: PREYSING
D: The door is locked, Baron.
N: The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the Baron.
C: PREYSING
D: Hello! Hello! --
E: into telephone
C: BARON
D: Don't do that.
E: he tries to snatch the telephone from Preysing.
N: Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. The action excites him.
C: PREYSING
D: Strike me, would you? Attack me would you? Attack me --
N: With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.
C: PREYSING
D: I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- Strike me!
N: By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.
C: PREYSING
D: I strike you --
E: with telephone foolishly in his hand, he looks down at what he has done.
T: CUT TO:
N: DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM Sharp sound of buzzing. Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.
C: NIGHT GIRL
D: Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator -- They are having a nice little game up there with the telephone.
E: she listens -- says to herself
N: With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:
T: CUT TO:
N: PREYSING'S ROOM New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He is terrified. Door opens behind him. Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing seizes her. Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the traffic below. Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it. With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears through her own room.
T: CUT TO:
N: CORRIDOR Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.
T: CUT TO:
N: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers and shirt. Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes hanging to her, crosses.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- where are you?
E: hoarse whisper
N: She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- what -- what --
E: he is looking up at what seems to be a ghost.
N: She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their faces.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Preysing?
N: It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a strength.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- it's awful.
N: She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed. Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Stay here.
N: She waves him away.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.
N: Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves. WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he knocks.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --
E: calling
N: He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees Flaemmchen's door open next to it. He enters.
T: CUT HIM THROUGH:
N: FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly forward.
T: CUT INTO REVERSE:
N: PREYSING'S ROOM Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying -- a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come around as Kringelein enters. Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
C: PREYSING
D: He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
C: KRINGELEIN
D: My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
C: PREYSING
D: -- We must do something...
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes, the police must be called.
E: quickly
C: PREYSING
D: No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
C: PREYSING
D: Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
E: suddenly
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
C: PREYSING
D: I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
E: frantically
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes, I know them --
C: PREYSING
D: The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: We must call the police, your excellency.
N: Preysing takes him by the shoulders.
C: PREYSING
D: How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
E: he picks up receiver
T: CUT TO:
N: TELEPHONE ROOM Telephone girl plugs in.
C: GIRL
D: Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... someone in one sixty-four says there has been a murder.
T: CUT TO:
N: HALL PORTER The scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man.
C: PORTER
D: Here - quick - here -- go to one sixty-four immediately. Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the manager.
E: calls back on telephone
T: CUT TO:
N: ROHNA'S ROOM Darkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the news.
C: ROHNA
D: Where?... murder?... who?... all right, I'm coming. Wait a minute. Instruct everyone to use the utmost tact -- we must have no scandal in the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, I'm coming now -- inform the police.
E: speaks in a monotone
N: (he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly)
T: CUT TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam should sleep.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
C: SUZETTE
D: When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
E: rising she pushes the window closed, shivers, it is chilly. She crosses the room turning out one of the lights
C: SUZETTE
D: Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
E: quietly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Goodnight, Suzette.
N: Suzette leaves -- turning out a light. Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the receiver.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Hello -- can you tell me if Baron von Gaigern is in his room -- ring him. Cherie, I must wake you or you'll miss the train. ...yes... are you ringing, he may be asleep. Cherie, you must get up and fetch me from my room -- I'm longing for you, Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- I kept thinking you would come to me. ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- ring -- ring.
E: talking to herself into phone to herself into phone
N: CUT IN HERE at discretion the: BARON'S EMPTY ROOM Telephone is ringing.
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. Answer the phone -- what is the matter. Ring him -- ring him. Where are you -- where are you, Cherie? Why don't you answer? Well, ring him -- please -- please.
E: to herself into phone to herself into phone
T: FADE OUT SLOWLY:
N: END OF SEQUENCE "#6" SEQUENCE "#7" Music up as we --
T: FADE IN ON:
S: DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR SERVICE ENTRANCE OF HOTEL
N: The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first sequence. Music cold and eerie.
T: DISSOLVE OUT:
N: General early morning bustle and activity. From one van, fruit and vegetables are being unloaded. From another, huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time, to another man, from a van backed up --
C: BAKER
D: Forty-two -- forty-four -- forty-six -- forty-eight -- fifty -- fifty-two --
E: counting
N: Waiters coming to work. A noisy racket. Sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans, is backed a hearse. At the moment we come upon it, the men are pausing in their work to glance. The men take off their caps, as; proceeded by the hotel detective and others, who will be there, the corpse of the Baron in the basket, used at such time, is brought out and placed in the hearse, which drives noisily away. A policeman rides with the driver on the box. By this time the man with the bread is counting:
C: BAKER
D: One hundred and eight -- one hundred and ten -- one hundred and twelve...
N: Stay with him for a moment.
T: DISSOLVE OUT:
S: DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR FRONT OF HOTEL
N: Shooting onto door - day lighting. A man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which pulls forward.
T: DISSOLVE OUT: DISSOLVE INTO - MAIN HOTEL LOBBY
N: Early morning. Sense of chill and desolation. Some chairs stand on tables. A vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets. Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand. The various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being cleaned. The general feeling of the beginning of another day. THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving towards THE CAMERA. He is grim, his hat is drawn over his eyes. His hands deep in his pockets. When he has passed the CAMERA MOVES FORWARD TO: SENF'S DESK (the old shot) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through the door. He crosses now to Pimenov. They talk eagerly out of earshot. But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry. Rohna is there too. One of the men carries a telephone stand, wrapped loosely in paper. But we know it's the telephone stand. Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is late.
C: CLERK
D: The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
C: SENF
D: Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
C: CLERK
D: And the child isn't coming?
C: SENF
D: No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
C: CLERK
D: News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
C: SENF
D: What? -- Who? -- Whom?
C: CLERK
D: The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
C: SENF
D: Good heavens. What for?
C: CLERK
D: I don't know.
C: SENF
D: Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
C: CLERK
D: It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
C: SENF
D: I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
C: CLERK
D: Most imposters are --
N: A number of bellboys march up and form a line. Senf comes from behind the desk and inspects them.
C: SENF
D: Good morning.
C: BOYS
D: Good morning.
E: in chorus
C: SENF
D: Show your hands.
N: They show their hands.
C: SENF
D: You have dirty nails -- you little pig -- you're no good... Caps off! -- Let's see your hair. Good -- caps on! Where is number seven?... Not here? Take his name -- if he comes late again today, he's fired. Dismissed!
E: to one boy Boys take off their caps Boys put on their caps to clerk
N: The boys sit down on the bench. THE CAMERA MOVES TO KRINGELEIN. Kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in ear shot.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Please, officer.
C: OFFICER
D: That will be sufficient for the present, sir, you may travel in peace.
N: Kringelein exits.
T: CUT TO:
N: CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR As Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to the Floor Clerk.
C: SUZETTE
D: And they've taken him away.
C: FLOOR CLERK
D: Yes -- it's terrible.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam must not know -- you understand -- Madam must not know.
C: FLOOR CLERK
D: I will tell the maids. I cannot answer for downstairs --
N: Suzette hurries down corridor. By this time Kringelein has arrived at his door, he opens it.
T: CUT TO:
N: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM Kringelein opens the door and enters. Flaemmchen is looking into space. A lovely picture. Morning light over her hair, she is dressed.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: What's the matter?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You loved the Baron, didn't you?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes --
C: KRINGELEIN
D: So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: I didn't like Preysing right off.
E: naively
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Then why did you have anything to do with him?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Money!
E: simply
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Yes, of course, -- money!
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You don't understand that do you?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
E: he is silent a moment
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: What?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Later?
C: KRINGELEIN
D: When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: Oh yes, of course.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: Do you like me better?
E: takes her hands
C: FLAEMMCHEN
D: You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
N: Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face. He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone.
C: KRINGELEIN
D: When is the next train leaving for Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for me... and my bill please... and the lady's -- Miss Flaemm's. We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll have breakfast on the train.
E: into telephone puts down telephone to Flaemmchen
T: CUT TO:
N: CORRIDOR The figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is no one with her. Suzette steps out.
C: SUZETTE
D: Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
E: she looks off.
N: FLASH OF PIMENOV coming out of the elevator. Grusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet.
C: PIMENOV
D: He will be on the train.
E: breathlessly
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: But when did he go? How do you know?
N: She crosses and looks in the Baron's room. A maid is there changing the bedding. The room is unoccupied otherwise.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: Baron von Gaigern has left?
N: The maid nods.
C: GRUSINSKAYA
D: When? How long ago?
N: Maid shrugs her shoulders.
C: VOICE OF FLOOR CLERK
D: The Baron left about half an hour ago, Madam.
C: PIMENOV
D: Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll lose the train.
N: While they are waiting for the elevator Grusinskaya is like a live electric wire. The elevator arrives. They are stepping in.
T: CUT TO:
N: LOBBY General activity. We hear the cry go up:
C: VOICE
D: Madam Grusinskaya's car...
N: Grusinskaya comes out of the elevator followed by Suzette and Pimenov. Meierheim meets her.
C: MEIERHEIM
