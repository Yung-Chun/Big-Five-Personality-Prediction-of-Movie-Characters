T: FADE IN:
S: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in. In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.
C: PHIL
D: Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long, slow kiss.
N: PHIL (CONT ' D ) Minty fresh.
C: CLARA
D: That was nice.
C: PHIL
D: It was nice.
C: CLARA
D: Hey from now on when you change the toilet paper, could you just make sure it is out?
N: PHIL (CHUCKLES) Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's over!
C: CLARA
D: Oh, believe me, we're just getting started, Phil.
C: PHIL
D: Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!
E: reaches into picture pile
N: ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle deep in a manure bin. CLARA (LAUGHS) She just takes a while to warm up. You guys are gonna be best buddies. You picked a favorite of us yet? Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.
C: CLARA
D: That's exactly the one I picked!
E: CONT'D
N: Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed. It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front of them.
C: PHIL
D: Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He notices.
N: PHIL (CONT'D) WHAT IS
C: CLARA
D: I just... when I was growing up my Mom and Dad had a picture just like this. Now they can't even acknowledge each other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.
C: CLARA
D: Let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids-
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: We're having kids? With an "S"?
N: (CLARA LAUGHS) OK fine. But I promise you it's never gonna happen to us.
C: CLARA
D: Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when I'm long in the tooth.
C: PHIL
D: You'll be even hotter long toothed. Right now to be honest Clara they're a little stumpy.
N: CZ
C: (GIGGLES
D: Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.
C: CLARA
D: Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: wasn't the pictures.
C: CLARA
D: You know how long that took?
C: PHIL
D: We'll fix the picture piles, Clara. We've got all the time in the world. From now on everything's gonna be just about us. Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.
N: OLLIE (V.0.)
C: MOM!
D: The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks
S: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING
N: Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.
C: OLLIE
D: Mo-om! It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the hall and Phil to the bathroom.
E: O.S.
C: OLLIE
D: Mom! Mom! Mom!
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: I'm coming, Ollie!
S: INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
N: As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack of PAPERS in his hand.
C: CLARA
D: Uh Phil?
N: Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.
C: PHIL
D: Yep?
C: CLARA
D: I need to switch. I've got an open house. Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but contains it.
C: PHIL
D: Really?
C: CLARA
D: Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands together.
C: PHIL
D: OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look - cool yet approachable.
C: OLLIE
D: Yeah, well Mom says that. Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.
C: PHIL
D: Oh. Well... that's cool too!
S: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME
N: The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open. She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror. As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as well.
C: CLARA
D: Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste. Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.
N: Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT. As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad
C: NT. KITCHEN
D: Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits at the table. Phil finally notices.
C: PHIL
D: What?
C: OLLIE
D: Breakfast?
N: PHIL (HOPPING UP) Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob today. What's it gonna be? Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign of his tom.
C: OLLIE
D: How about... some Captain Crunch? Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.
N: PHIL (DISTRACTED)
C: OL
D: Captain Crunch?The cereal?
C: PHIL
D: Uh... yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.
C: CLARA
D: Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a bowl yesterday.
C: IE
D: But Dad already said yeah sure. Clara glances at Phil. said it. I said it
N: ARCASTIC) (MORE)
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl
E: CONT'D
N: A DAY- CLARA (CORRECTING HIM) A week.
C: PHIL
D: One bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.
C: PHIL
D: This is not for you today!
E: CONT'D
N: CLARA (CHUCKLES) Yeah right. PHIL (SHRUGS) Worth a try.
C: CLARA
D: Did you get his lunch together?
C: PHIL
D: Oh. Whoops.
N: CLARA (SIGHS) You just get his breakfast and I'll do it. As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly returning the carton to the fridge. CLARA (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but I'll be there as soon as I can.
C: PHIL
D: Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that I don't
N: UNDERSTAND-
C: CLARA
D: Ollie, do you want a banana?
E: focusing on Ollie's lunch
C: PHIL
D: Did you hear me?
C: CLARA
D: Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. Banana Ollie?
E: not looking at him
N: PHIL (BEAT) So I should probably get going. With the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days.
C: CLARA
D: OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek.
N: CLL. -- (CONT ' D ) Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.
C: PHIL
D: Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1 dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her head, she tosses the carton in the trash.
S: EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks a newspaper off his lawn.
C: CHAZ
D: Well, well! We're up bright and early, aren't we!
E: O.S.
C: PHIL
D: Yes we are! ike you say to me every morning. Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara' car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING STUCK halfway.
E: under his breath
N: PHIL (CONT'D)
C: OW! OW! OW!
D: Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room. Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's seat.
N: HONKING.
S: EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER
N: The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his watch.
S: EXT. STREET
N: Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her 30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW SIGNS on the sidewalk.
C: JANE
D: His name's Juan and he's some kind of Spanish, I think. He knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown. It's so exciting. And in bed...
N: (WHISPERS) I never knew I could still get my leg back that far.
C: CLARA
D: Too much information, Jane.
S: INT. OPEN HOUSE
N: Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each move quickly around different parts of the vacant home, cleaning and inspecting. The divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me. Seriously. You know that great nervous feeling in your stomach? Where you don't know what's going to happen next? On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she passes.
C: JANE
D: With Larry, I lost that. Everything had just become routine, you know? Boring. Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a weird, loud buzzing noise.
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: JANE
D: But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!
E: CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: Good for you, Jane. Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki the side and silencing it.
C: CLARA
D: Good for you.
E: CONT'D
N: T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together prospectuses.
C: JANE
D: There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot__ar night that you guys would love. _"st amazing view of the city. You guys should check it out on your next date night.
C: CLARA
D: Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have those that much anymore.
E: focusing on stapling
C: JANE
D: 't have date nights:
C: CLARA
D: , You know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and Ollie. And some of the shows on TV these days are really great. Ah. I see.
E: shrugs
C: 1Ï¿½1
D: They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look at each other.
C: CLAM
D: I know that's really lame.
C: JANE
D: So it's Phil?
N: CLARA (SIGHS) No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us. I don't know. It just... happened.
C: JANE
D: So why don't you change it? All you have to do is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again.
C: CLARA
D: I guess. Maybe.
C: JANE
D: Not maybe. Tonight.
C: CLARA
D: Nah. Tonight's no good.
N: Â¢
C: JANE
D: Why not? Seriously think about it. What's really gonna be more important tonight than that? Clara takes this in. Jane's right.
S: INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE
N: Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS scream out their orders.
S: INT. MR. RIVERS' OFFICE
N: In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR 'ï¿½ L HEADS lining the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's, GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS, 60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both look over.
C: PHIL
D: I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on the highways is insane these days!
C: MR. RIVERS
D: Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine. Catch your breath. George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch into his report.
C: MR. RIVERS
D: Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start... I've been thinking... this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra. Start really ripping the meat.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a more high risk direction?
E: beat, trying to decipher
C: MR.
D: Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid. Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow.
N: Â¢ MR. RIVERS (CLEARS THROAT) OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want George to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too.
C: PHIL
D: Oh.
C: MR. RIVERS
D: s nothing personal.
N: (BEAT) So let me get this straight. You're telling me that tomorrow I'm going to have to interview for the job I already have? Against George?
C: MR. RIVERS
D: I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need our pack leader to be more like... like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me?
C: PHIL
D: Kinda.
N: (BEAT) Actually, no. Not really at all.
C: MR. RIVERS
D: The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature.
C: PHIL
D: Sorry. Still not totally getting you.
C: MR. RIVERS
D: I've had a wife and a family. Three of them. It's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. He can rip the meat.
C: PHIL
D: Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to... I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when George was still... in the jungle!
N: MR. RIVERS (BEAT) What does that mean?
C: PHIL
D: I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just can't.
C: MR. RIVERS
D: Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little... well... tame.
N: PHIL (GETTING UP) That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers! I'll see you tomorrow. Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.
C: SCHOOL
D: Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from school.
C: CLARA
D: So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our reservation's at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.
N: Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini- bottle of Purell and cleans her hands. CLARA (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.
C: FEMALE VOICE
D: Mrs. Foster? Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.
E: O.S.
C: CLARA
D: Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a warm smile.
C: CLARA
D: I've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. CARDIGAN
D: I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries matter.
N: CLARA 1Ï¿½1 OK...
C: MRS. CARDIGAN
D: Can we speak a moment? Alone?
C: CLARA
D: Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.
C: CLARA
D: Is everything OK?
E: CONT'D
C: MRS. CARDIGAN
D: Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. Especially Jenny Diggs.
C: CLARA
D: Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's happening?
C: MRS. CARDIGAN
D: I'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out. But beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days is just... sub par. E
N: (MORE)
C: MRS. CARDIGAN
D: His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks motivation and tries to just "get by" o assignments. You know, this is a very competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my opinion, maybe you should consider whether this is really the right environment for him.
E: CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: Uh... wow. OK. Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car, watching Mrs. Cardigan.
E: beat, stunned
C: CLARA
D: Wow. What a bitch.
E: CONT'D under her breath
C: OLLIE
D: Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?
C: CLARA
D: (remembering Ollie's in the
C: BACK)
D: No.
C: OL LIE
D: Yeah you did.
N: Â¢
C: CLARA
D: I didn't. I really didn't. Clara quickly pulls out.
N: CAR PORT - LATER Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes his head.
C: PHIL
D: Unbelievable!
S: INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who packs a suitcase.
C: PHIL
D: Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta tell you it's about time.
N: OLLIE I'm going to Nana's tonight.
C: PHIL
D: On a school night? Why?
N: OLLIE (SHRUGS) Mom says you guys are going out.
C: PHIL
D: Tonight? What? No.
N: (CALLS OUT) Clara?
S: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Phil marches into the bedroom.
C: PHIL
D: Clara? Cl- He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.
C: PHIL
D: Wow. Wow. Clara tns and smiles.
E: CONT'D
N: IS
C: CLARA
D: I thought I could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in. A romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen... Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have the house all to ourselves. All night.
E: raises :,er eyebrows
C: PHIL
D: Wow... It sounds... great.
C: CLARA
D: Great! She turns back and continues getting ready.
C: PHIL
D: It's just... is there any chance we coul take a rain check?
N: CLARA (TURNS) A "rain check"?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do a bit of work tonight. E
C: CLARA
D: I thought all the cramming was for this report today. Did something go wrong?
N: PHIL (BEAT) Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just decided I could play with it a little more. Make it a little better. Clara takes him in a moment.
C: CLARA
D: Oh. OK. Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry back in the case.
C: PHIL
D: Listen, I'm sorry...
C: CLARA
D: You don't need to apologize, Phil.
C: PHIL
D: Listen, if I had more warning-
C: E C
D: Then something else would have come up. You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time. Even after Ollie was born. Now we never do anything together. They stare at each other, then Phil breaks
C: PHIL
D: Listen... any other night.
C: CLARA
D: OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her, feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted.
S: INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
N: As Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks him, still unsure.
C: PHIL
D: That dress really wasn't playing fair, Clara. With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.
C: PHIL
D: Well get a move on, girl! She zips her dress back up.
E: CONT'D
N: A DOORBELL RINGS.
S: INT. RUTH'S FRONT DOOR
N: RUTH, Clara's mother, opens her front door and brightens.
C: RUTH
D: Hey sweeties.
E: to Clara and Ollie
N: (SUDDENLY COLD) Phil.
C: PHIL
D: Ruth.
C: RUTH
D: Nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!
C: PHIL,
D: Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don't you think that's a little scary for a 5 year old?
C: RUTH
D: No, Phil, I don't.
E: not looking at him
C: PHIL
D: OK... not so sure about that.
N: RUTH
C: PHIL
D: Clara? What do you think?
C: RUTH
D: Yeah, Clara. What do you think?
E: putting her pressure on
S: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE
N: Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door towards Phil's car.
C: CLARA
D: I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight.
C: PHIL
D: fine. Fine. oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.
C: CLARA
D: You know, I should pee before we go.
N: PHIL (BEAT) OK. Sure. As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in the driver's seat.
C: PHIL
D: I'll just wait in the car as you go back E inside to pee. Again.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. EISENHOWER PARKWAY - SUNSET
N: As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the city. CAR - S Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.
C: PHIL
D: You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone's going to remember when it's time to vote is all this mess.
N: CLARA SHIVERS
C: CLARA
D: You're hot?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.
N: 19Â® CLAPA
C: OHM
D: Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the air.
C: CLARA
D: You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today that Ollie's been antagonizing his daughter.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: Antagonizing? How does a five year old "antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's daughter."
C: CL
D: She also went on that Ollie's penmanship's sloppy and he's not motivated enough.
C: PHIL
D: (trying to make a joke of Got all my best traits, huh? He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,, not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.
C: PHIL
D: I think he's fine.
E: CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: She actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else.
C: PHIL
D: Maybe she's right if the school has that kind of attitude. Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's hair.
C: CL RA
D: You know what? All we ever end up talking about is Ollie or work. Let's just focus on us tonight.
N: PHIL
C: SMILES)
D: Great. I'm all for tha Beat. They sit in silence in the traffic.
N: Ga.
C: CLARA
D: So what are you thinking about?
C: PHIL
D: Right now? Traffic.
C: CLARA
D: Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable story from Jane today.
C: PHIL
D: Yeah?
C: CLARA
D: She has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day. She's totally healthy and everything's normal with the pregnancy. So she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in, they go into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!
N: AMA!
C: PHIL
D: What's AMA?
C: CLARA
D: Advanced Maternal Age!
N: PHIL (CHUCKLES) No! You've got to be joking me!
C: CLARA
D: kid you not!
C: PHIL
D: That's unbelievable!
C: CLARA
D: I know. Beat. Clara looks out the window.
C: CLARA
D: The funny thing is she's my age, actually. Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible ulterior motive.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: Huh.
N: Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again. Phil looks over at her.
C: PHIL
D: I thought you were cold.
E: CONIT'B
C: CLARA
D: I was, but then you turned it down and I got hot.
C: PHIL
D: But I turned it down because... you see when you open and close your vents it makes my... never mind. Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up, suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding toward the exit.
C: CL AAA
D: What are you doing?
C: PHIL
D: I'm just gonna take a shortcut.
C: CLARA
D: Phil, please don't. You think they're shortcuts but they always take longer. And we're already-
C: PHIL
D: Clara, please just trust me, OK They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated, Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive.
S: INT. THE SIGNATURE ROOM
N: Phil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the Signature Restaurant on the 95t Flcor of the John Hancock Center, with dramatic s- Lng views over skyline of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan.
C: PHIL
D: I promise you it wouldn't have been any faster. I promise! OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we're here? I'm gonna go pee.
N: 1Ï¿½1
C: PHIL
D: Now?
C: CLARA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: Nothing. As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking his head, makes his way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL HOSTESS.
C: SUPERMODEL HOSTESS
D: Good evening. Welcome to the Signature Room.
C: PHIL
D: Thanks. The name is Foster.
C: SUPERMODEL HOSTESS

C: PHIL
D: You know what? You're absolutely right. Clara lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the first time tonight.
C: PHIL

C: PHIL
D: Listen, this is all getting out of hand, OK? I admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS over their noses and mouths. Phil and Clara veil and struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.
N: E CLOSEUP ON PHIL'S NOSE An AMMONIA STICK waves back and forth under Phil's nose and he startles awake, disoriented, to see he's TIED TO A CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the room, the Younger Burly Man sorts through items from Clara's purse and Phil's wallet scattered all over the table.
C: PHIL
D: Whoa. What the hell is this? Tied in the chair next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Burly Man waves the stick under her nose.
N: CLARA (FREAKED) Phil?!? What's going on?
C: PHIL
D: I don't know. A VOICE speaks from a speakerphone on the table
C: SPEAKERPHONE

D: Phil's now getting really annoyed.
C: PHIL
D: You must be kidding! Like a million people don't do it every single night of the week! This is unbelievable! I'm just in shock here! Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.

C: CLARA
D: No, Phil. I think they think we're actually "the Gales" who made the reservation tonight.
N: PHIL (REALIZING) Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She's right. We're not those Gales. You've got the wrong people. Really.
C: SPEAKERPHONE
D: Then why were you two at the Gales' table, Mr. Foster?
C: PHIL
D: OK, listen, what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the Gales' name and no one answered, my wife said that we were them. I swear on my life to you that's what happened.
C: SPEAKEFP IC

N: In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the keys back to Harry.
C: FRANK
D: You drive with her in front.
N: PHIL (WHISPERS) So what's your plan here? CLARA (WHISPERS) I don't have a plan Phil. PHIL (WHISPERS) You don't have a plan? CLARA E (WHISPERS) No. I was just trying to keep our knees for the time being. PHIL (WHISPERS) Well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead.

D: We'll just throw him in the back and have her show us. hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.
C: CLARA
D: Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar. If you give it to me I can find it for him. With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages inside... and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her, she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground, whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at Harry.
C: CLARA
D: Drop the gun and the keys.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: oa! Clara! No Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the gun. Harry looks at him, confused.

S: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: HOLBROOKE PETERSON, a thoroughbred of a man in his mid- 30's, opens the door to his candlelit apartment with a smile to find Phil and Clara.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same
C: CLARA
D: So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug, lifting her a little.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: You feel exactly the same too. Phil double-takes. Did he hear him right?
N: R1 U
C: CLARA
D: This is my husband, Phil.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Ah! The man who actually landed Clara. Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out his hand.

C: PHIL
D: Oh. The environmental thing.
N: HOLBROOKE (CHUCKLES) Yeah, the "environmental thing," Phil. As they walk into the apartment in their socks, they notice the whole place is filled with reclaimed and recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES.
C: CLARA
D: How beautiful. Or, the candles... Did we
C: ERRUPT SOMETHING-
D: Oh, no. I jus-_. --'-D.> myself off the gr a few weeks ago.
C: PHI
D: The grid?
N: 1Ï¿½1
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Power grid. I actually have a negative carbon footprint now. Making up for, you know, all you "Phil"-i-stines in the suburbs. Holbrooke chuckles. Phil's about to say something when a look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke gestures to some cardboard furniture.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: So have a seat. Holbrooke starts to sit down himself, then makes a show of taking a LARGE GUN out of his shoulder holster and putting it on the table.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: Whoa. You carry that around at home?
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Yeah. I'm supposed to sleep with her under my pillow.
N: (SHRUGS) Wish I didn't have to, but I just see it as... I carry the weight so citizens like yourselves don't have to. 1Ï¿½1
C: CLARA
D: It's so funny. I always knew you'd end up doing something in public service.
N: HOLBROOKE (SHRUGS HUMBLY) I don't know. That's lust how I Phil looks to Clara - can you get a load of this guy, but Clara's focused on Holbrooke.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is not a man you want to get on the wrong side of.
E: V.0. CONT'D
S: INT. HOLBROOKE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Phil watches as Holbrooke licks the salt allllll the wav around his Margarita glass with his extra long tongue. Clara listens intently, eating some jicama slices from a platter on the table in front of them.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: He's like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out. Those photos must be really important to him.
N: (MORE) HOLBROOKE (COIN" D )
C: 1Ï¿½1
D: More jicama, Clara? And sure no Margari-La to calm your nerves?
E: NOTICING
C: CLARA
D: No thanks, I'm Holbrooke picks up the plate and Margarita glass, then crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the extra liquid and scraps.
C: CLARA
D: What does Stockton do?
E: CONT'D
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Officially, he runs a bunch of these exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to let their hair down. Has one place called Le Passage, another called The Rainbow-
C: CLARA
D: e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we there to set things up!
N: HOLBROOKE (NODS) Interesting. I've had some of my guys looking into Stockton for years, but nothing ever sticks to him. He's very careful - ties up his loose ends and covers his tracks. But with this... he might have accidentally left himself open.
C: (BE
D: The th need to do now is keep you two safe. I'm going to call the office, put you under some protection until we figure out the best game
C: CLARA
D: Should we be worried about our s

N: HOLBROOKE (SMILES WARMLY) Aw, how is Ruth? Always thought the world of her. 1Ï¿½1
C: CLARA
D: And she of you. As it comes out of her mouth, Clara realizes and guiltily looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a pen.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: I'll just need your full names and your socials so I can get the paperwork started at the bureau. Not yours, Clara. Know that by heart. Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.
N: HOLBROOKE (CONT'D) (CHUCKLES) Just kidding. But I'm sure Phil-a-buster knows 'em both, right? Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands him.
C: PHIL
D: Uh... there's already writing all over this.
N: HOLBROOKE (B
C: IG EYED)
D: Does another tree really need to die for me to get your socials, Phil? Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing into a side of the paper.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: So just one kid, guys? What's keeping you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock tuck.
E: CONT'D
N: PHIL (WRITING) Yeah, well, that's a topic for another-
C: HOLBROOKE
D: It's just that by now, you and I woulda had a whole brood.
C: PHIL
D: That's... charming. Phil scoots the paper back to Holbrooke, who squints and dramatically turns it sideways.
E: under his breath

C: HOLBROOKE
D: We'll have you stay at the bureau for the night. Safer for you.
C: CLARA
D: Thank you so much, Holbrooke. I feel like we're in good hands for the E first time tonight. As Holbrooke goes into the other room to call, Clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices Phil's mood.
E: sighs, relieved

C: CLARA
D: Phil's really had enough with this guy. Your goodness... where does it end? Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but Holbrooke doesn't get his sarcasm.
N: HOLBROOKE (SHRUGS) How I roll. Now for some reason they wanted us to come in the back entrance. He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his shoulder strap before getting out of the car.
S: INT. FBI WINDOW
N: Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara walking toward the back of the building. In the foreground, A SHADOWY GUY watches them, then whispers into his walkie.
C: SHADOWY GUY
D: Positions.
N: FBI BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and Clara FREEZE behind them. At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in charge, yells to them.
C: AGENT
D: Continue slowly down the hallway. sudden movements. Are they armed, Peterson?
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Uh,

D: Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.
N: AGENT #1 His men? The Agents look at each other and chuckle. AGENT #2 What do you want us to do, Holbrooke? Reformat our hard drives? AGENT #3 Our badass I.T. guy! The laughter builds.
C: CLARA
D: I. I. guy?
C: HOLBROOKE
D: OK... I'm not the "I.T. guy." I help out
N: with computer questions out of kindness! But see if that happens anymore, Harold! AGENT #1 Alright, enough. Point is, Agent Peterson scored tonight. When I typed in those socials, an APB shot up with a whole laundry list on these guys.
C: PHIL
D: What?
C: CLARA
D: crooked cop did it! It's a lie!
N: AGENT #1 It's your booking, Peterson. We're Just here to back you up. Holbrooke... Holbrooke looks nervously between the Agents and Phil and Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara's arm.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Listen guys. I'll just book you and then tomorrow we can straighten the whole-
C: CLARA
D: What? Oh no you're not! Oooohs from the Agents.
E: pulling arm away
N: AGENT #3 You just gonna take that, Peterson? HOLBROOKE (PRESSURED) All right. Didn't want to have to- Holbrooke reaches into his holster to whip out his gun... .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground, right at Phil's feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT, holding the gun to Holbrooke's head.
C: PHIL
D: All right! Nobody move or he gets it! Clara's STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but don't seem overly concerned.
N: AGENT #1 Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even â¢ have a gun? HOLBROOKE (TO PHIL) Listen, man. I'm not that important. I'm really not. I'm not the IT guy but I'm just one step above him! No reason to do something rash, all right? AGENT #3 You think it's even loaded? A` -. I don't. HOLBROOKE (FREAKED) loaded, guys! It's loaded!
C: PHIL
D: I'm not screwing around!
C: HOLBROOKE
D: He's not screwing around! He's not screwing around! Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back toward the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but it's locked.

C: PHIL
D: Keycard.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: What?
C: A FEW FBI AGENTS
D: He wants your keycard.
C: PHIL
D: Thanks. He and I, the communication isn't great... Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the keycard then lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside.
S: EXT. FBI BUILDING - CONT
N: Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep down the hallway after them, guns trained.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I promise.
C: CLARA
D: Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.
C: PHIL
D: Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke. When we're about to drive off we'll let you go.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Uh, they were on the keychain.
C: PHIL
D: What? HOLB'?n`_ The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard inside. The keys were on that. And so the hero falls...
C: PHIL
D: Shit.
C: CL AA
D: we'll never outrun them.
N: Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY. Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears. HOLBROOKE AH!
C: PHIL
D: YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.
C: PHIL
D: How are you so good at that? The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1 tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass, but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents rush around to the front.
E: CONT'D stunned, looks at her
C: CLARA
D: gotta get going! Quick!
C: PHIL
D: Where? They both look around, unsure.
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the Green Line subway. Get on it and you can get anywhere in this city. Phil and Clara look at him, confused.
C: PHIL
D: Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?
N: HOLBROOKE (SIGHS) Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's the difference? I'm never gonna get behind that desk now anyway. my gun! I dropped it in front of everybody!
C: PHIL
D: It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more of a... bobble.
C: CLARA
D: Yeah, a bobble's bad...
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Listen, if you just leave me here I can tell them you ran the other way. It'll buy you time to get there. And maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.
C: CLARA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke
C: PHIL
D: Here. Tell them you got it back from us. Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.
E: CONT'D
C: HOLBROOKE
D: Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of husband.
S: EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.
C: PHIL
D: it's just on the other side of that bridge. I think we're going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him.
C: PHIL (COND
D: What?
C: CLARA
D: Nothing. That was just nice of you, back there.
N: (BEAT) This is crazy, but you know what I'm, reminded of right now?
C: PHIL
D: Bourne identity?
C: CLARA
D: I'm talking about right now. When we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch the sunrise.
C: PHIL
D: Where I held your hand for the first time.
C: CLARA
D: I can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.
C: PHIL
D: It's because we could sleep 'til noon.
N: CLARA (SMILES SLYLY) If I remember correctly, we weren't always "sleeping." Beat as they share the moment together, walking.
C: PHIL
D: I just don't understand when we got so... I don't know...
C: CLARA
D: Old.
C: PHIL
D: No, I was thinking numb. When did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?
C: CLARA
D: We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently. Phil doesn't understa
C: CLARA
D: Not big things. Just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Like the fact I know you never want to talk about us having this other baby.
C: PHIL
D: It's not that I don't want another kid, Clara. It's just... I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and your work, I'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth!
C: CLARA
D: But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! It's all about your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive past them over the bridge.
C: CLARA
D: Shit!
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: I think we're OK. Just play cool and keep walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1ï¿½1 Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief. Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming back toward them.
C: PHIL
D: Now you can say shit. Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath them.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: e 's only a few feet.
E: CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: What u high? No way. But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.
N: CLARA (CONT'D) AH! 1Ï¿½1 As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they DANGLE above the water and the boat.
C: CLARA (CONT'D
D: Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!
C: PHIL
D: Let go, Clara!
C: CLARA
D: A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them, cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going to miss the boat.
C: PHIL
D: go or I'm going to tickle you!
N: CLARA (DEAD SERIOUS) No you're not, Phil. We have a rule! tickling. I'm not- He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She giggles. CLARA (CONT'D) (LAUGHING) Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny! I mean- Stop it! Ah! Clara can't hold on any longer...
S: EXT. BOAT
N: They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.
C: PHIL
D: Ow! I think I broke my butt.
C: CLARA
D: OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule about tickling?
C: PHIL
D: I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure! What is our rule?
N: PHIL (BLANDLY RECITES) "It's only funny if it's funny for the both of us."
C: CLARA
D: Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny for me, Phil! Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting his proposal.
N: CLARA (CONT'D) (MARCHING PAST) B i g mistake! They look at her, stunned. A OTHER PART OF THE BOAT - M0_,'_= -1; LATER Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes next to her. Beat.
C: PHIL
D: T ' s your elbow?
N: CL RA (SIGHS) 's OK, How`s your butt?
C: PHIL
D: Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad.
N: (SHAKES HEAD) I can't even fucking believe this is happening to us.
C: CLARA
D: You know, we're kind of running ou ons.
C: PHIL
D: Maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.
C: CLARA
D: What makes you think it ever wil
C: PHIL
D: iaybe we should just turn ourselves
N: 1Ï¿½1 CLARA (SIGHS) Imagine what it's going to be like for Ollie when everyone hears about this tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going to be all over the papers. Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to him.
C: PHIL
D: Wait. What if we found the pictures?
C: CLARA
D: What do you mean?
C: PHIL
D: These pictures that everyone's after. we could get them we'd have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this.
C: CLARA
D: But then we'd have to find the Gales. don't know anything about them.
N: PHIL (THINKS) Except... the Rainbow. CLARA (CATCHING ON) The pictures have something to do with that place!
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.
C: CLARA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: You're not listening to me again!
C: CLARA
D: "You have to know where they are and h to get in-"
C: PHIL
D: That's great. Clara wanna cracker?
C: C LARA

C: CLARA_
D: Hey Jane, it's Clara.
E: CONT'D
N: (LISTENS) Where am I? (beat, looks around) I'm... I'm on a party cruise around Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into quite a night. Listen, we need to go to this club called the Rainbow later. Do you know how we can get in? Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side. A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.
C: PHIL
D: ara... Clara turns and looks.
C: CLARA
D: Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've actually gotta jump off right now.
S: INT. TOUR BOAT - LATER
N: POLICE swarm all over the tour boat, checking every compartment. A DRUNKEN PARTIER shows Lieutenant Manning SNAPSHOTS of Phil and Clara landing, groaning, and arguing on the back of his digital camera. A POLICEMAN comes up to Manning and shakes his head.
C: LIEUTENANT MANNING
D: Check again. Manning pockets the camera and starts to walk away.
C: PARTIER
D: Hey! That's mine, man!
C: LIEUTENANT MANNING

S: EXT. STREET - LATER
N: It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.
C: CLARA
D: Mine's totally shot too.
C: PHIL
D: You got the info from her though, right?
C: CLARA
D: Yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, Phil.
C: PHIL
D: I don't think we have a choice. Not a big shopping hour. They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights blazing. Windows show machines filled with young HARDBODIES working out.
C: PHIL
D: Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand. Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning? Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the building.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: You wanna do a little cardio? Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He shakes his head.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: OK, now that's scary. You know you're starting to think like a real criminal? You know that, don't you? Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's "Secret Agent Man" over a TrC _ GE .
E: CONT'D
S: INT. 24 HOUR FITNESS CENTER - MONTAGE
N: - Phil and Clara walk up to the front counter, where the GYM GREETER boredly watches TV. They say something and the Greeter waves them through without looking up. As they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND CLOD?!?
C: 1Ï¿½1
D: - In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one, he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth, pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE. - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel, blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD DASH for the lockers. - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him, excitedly telling him something and pointing outside. The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly undressing. - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A"S DRIPPING
C: CLOTHES.
D: - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with â¢ RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels the same about Phil.
S: EXT. ALLEY - LATER
N: Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a dark, derelict alley.
C: PHIL
D: Down here?
C: JANE
D: It's what she said.
C: PHIL
D: And if you die, does Jane get your commissic-l on the open house? Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby. Nervously, Clara approaches.
C: CLARA
D: Excuse me? Men shoot her a fierce look.
C: CLARA
D: Um... do you know which is the way back to Kansas? They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them LUNGES, and Phil jumps back... but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.
E: CONT'D
N: SHADY GUY #1 Welcome to the Rainbow.
S: INT. THE RAINBOW - LATER
N: Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara, amazed, take in THE RAINBOW. It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room - the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff - is EMERALD GREEN. Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate, disappearing into the mix.
S: INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW - SAME
N: Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.
C: VOICE
D: If you wanner be pissed at anyone about it, be pissed at Stockton... Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2 other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.
E: O.S.
C: BALDING MAN
D: You know, rumor is he's behind the whole mess. Raking it in on both ends. What do you mean?
C: BALDING MAN
D: Hush hush shell companies he owns. One of them hires all the construction inspectors. Another he's got rents all the construction equipment. The more one slows things down with violations, more the other takes to the bank.
N: The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing Phil to lean in even more.
C: BALDING MAN
D: My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone like him could do if he got someone less "squeaky clean" in the Mansion. The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil pastes on an excited face.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: you! Gale, right?
C: BALDING MAN
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: Sorry. From the side... confused you with somebody else. Phil quickly moves on.
S: INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW -

D: Thanks any-way. With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she
C: FREEZES.
D: ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her - but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN DOORS nearby and rushes through. INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.
C: VOICE
D: Watch it! Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large tray of food past her.

C: MR. RIVERS
D: Phil Foster with places to go he can talk about at 2 in the morning.
N: (THOUGHTFUL ) (MORE)
C: MR. RIVERS
D: You know what makes kangaroos so damn dangerous, George? They look so sweet and tame, so you forget they're wild animals. Lethal when they want to be. George, not fully understanding, chuckles and holds out his hand for another handshake, but Mr. Rivers, still watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSEUP ON A TV MONITOR A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil and Clara making their way through the crowd to the exit. In the dark room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the well dressed man in a dark suit, who absently twirls with two metal balls in his hand.

N: CL (SHRUGS) OK. Fine. I was just asking. Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch. Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.
C: RAY
D: Talk! Who are you?
C: PHIL
D: You know, that's like the 5th gun I've had to my head tonight! Just lower that thing and cool it, OK? Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.

D: She was in the bathroom at the restaurant!
C: RAY
D: Who are you?
C: PHIL
D: Who are we? Good question! Well, everybody thinks we're "the Gales" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight!

C: DORA
D: You must just think I'm awful.
C: CLARA
D: I don't think anything about you. I just want this to be over.
C: DORA
D: Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this money blackmailing people at the club. When he found out who was interested in me... he said it would be so easy. We'd never have to work again.
N: RAY (O.S.) HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PEE, GUYS?!?
C: DORA
D: We're coming!
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
N: Ray peeks nervously out of the window, searching the street.
C: PHIL
D: Listen, it looks like things didn't turn out the way you planned, but I think all Stockton wants is his pictures back. As soon as he gets them I bet-
C: RAY E
D: Stockton's pictures? You.think they're Stockton's pictures?
N: (SMIRKS) You really have no idea what you've gotten into, do you? BOOM! The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck. As Ray starts blindly firing back, Phil crawls on his knees and elbows across the floor toward the bathroom. CLARA (O.S.) PHIL?!?!
C: PHIL
D: I'm OK! I'm OK! Ray spots Phil crawling away and gets up, turning to him.

C: FRANK
D: How about you guys let me in before someone gets really hurt?
S: INT. BATHROOM
N: Dora quickly opens the window and gestures for Phil and Clara to climb through. Just as they squeeze outside... BAM! The door handle's BLOWN OFF and Frank kicks the door in. He grabs Dora, rushing toward the window, but Phil and Clara are GONE.
C: FRANK
D: Dammit! Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN THE FOOT, sending screaming to the ground in pain.

C: CHUBBY GUY
D: Who are you?
C: PHIL
D: You're late!
C: CHUBBY GUY
D: OK sorry! The roads are all screwed with all this construction- BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview mirror of the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and marching toward them, Harry right behind him.

E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: Clara! Please! Just leave the driving to me, OK?!? I know what I'm- SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the windshield. Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're face to face - nose to nose - with another broken windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE â¢ stares at them in shock.
E: taking another sharp turn
C: BLACK DUDE
D: No no no. Tell me you did not just do that.
C: PHIL
D: Shit! The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in hands.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Oh, man! You did not just do that! Whew, you gonna be payin' for this!
C: PHIL
D: owe you one. Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place. Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that
N: THE SMASHED FRONT GRILL OF THEIR CAR HAS INTERLOCKED WITH ASHED FRONT GRILL OF THE BLACK DUDE'S HONDA. _-M The Black Dude comes toward him. 76,
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Oh no no no. You're gonna get outta this car and hand me over a license and some insurance. We gonna do this right. Man, I think I got whiplash and shit. A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.
C: PHIL
D: Shit. Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into the Black Dude's souped up Honda.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Hey! HEY! What do you think you're doing? The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.
N: PHIL PUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA!
C: CLARA
D: What? That's insane!
N: Frank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash into them in seconds... PHIL I KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT! Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on the gas. The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield into the passenger's seat next to Phil. BLACK DUDE JESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!! PHIL NOW PUT IT IN DRIVE!
C: CLARA
D: Huh?
N: BLACK DUDE JESUS! JESUS! PH IL PUT IT IN DRIVE NOW!
C: CLARA
D: Phil, this is-
N: BLACK DUDE JESUS JESUS! PHIL
C: DO IT!
E: to Black Dude
T: AND YOU! CUT THE JESUS!
N: Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in pursuit. Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel, getting them back into the street.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Just let me out, OK? You can have it! 1ï¿½1 You can have it!
N: PHIL (IGNORING HIM) DAMMIT! TRY TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT CLARA! CLARA STOP YELLING AT ME!
C: PHIL
D: I'm not yelling! I'm just talking in an very animated voice! Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they're approaching the lar ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.
C: PHIL
D: OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT)
C: NOW!
D: On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply to t1- right., but it's the wrong way and their cars JACK across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.
C: PHIL
D: Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!
E: CONT'D
N: Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction, and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight), barely screeching past. Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots her a pissed off look.
C: CLARA
D: What? You just said spin the wheel, Phil! You didn't say which way.
C: PHIL
D: Yes I did!
C: CLARA
D: No you didn't!
C: BLACK DUDE
D: She's right! You di
N: CLARA (VINDICATED) God! Thank you! Can we take him home? I need him! Both Phil and the Black Dude sees that the Towncar's turned onto Michigan Avenue and is still right behind E them.
C: BLACK DUD
D: Aw man!
N: PHIL (TO CLARA) I say our best chance is to reverse again, then use both engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down Michigan.
C: CLARA
D: Why stay on Michigan?
C: PHIL
D: Why stay on Michigan? Because it's a wider street.
C: LARA
D: It's also a busier street! I think it would be better to try to branch off.
N: PHIL (SIGHS) Why do you have a problem with every route I take? Flustered, Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to commiserate, unaware that his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS. 1Ï¿½1
C: PHIL
D: She does this wherever we go! Every time! Phil doesn't notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind him..
E: CONT'D
N: CLARA
C: PHIL!
D: LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude look over their shoulders to see they're heading straight for a
N: DELIVERY TRUCK. PHIL, CLARA AND BLACK DUDE
C: AHHHH!
D: Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go SIDEWAYS, jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK. In their car following them, Frank and Harry's -mouths drop.
S: EXT. MCCORMICK ICE RINK
N: The conjoined cars sail across the grass and SMASH THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK. Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil, Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world is a SPINNING BLUR around them. Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings, Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them. He searches where to go next, then spots something.
C: PHIL
D: Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. Give it everything! Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors it. The car goes faster... faster...
C: BLACK
D: Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.
C: CLARA
D: Doing what? What are you doing?!? Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.
C: CL.

E: CONT'D
N: 1Ï¿½1
C: PHIL
D: Just trust me! The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE
C: STAIRWAY!
D: The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath, Frank reverses back down the steps.
S: EXT. CLOUD GATE
N: Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds up his hand for Phil.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man. Wicked. They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil, the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.
C: PHIL
D: â¢ Sorry.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: s cool.
N: CLARA (SPOTTING SOMETHING) They're back. They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Jesus! What the hell are you guys in trouble for?
N: 'D R (SIGHS) f i ght... you name it.
S: EXT. GREAT LAWN
N: Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.
S: EXT. COLUMBUS DRIVE
N: Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at Clara.
C: PHIL
D: Can we just try to work together at this?
N: CLARA PHIL-
C: PHIL
D: I'm not blaming you. Please? Clara nods.
C: PHIL
D: Now whatever direction I give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, OK?
E: CONT'D
C: CLARA
D: 35 percent. Fine.
C: PHIL
D: OK. Small left. Now!
N: Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts They ZOOM around the corner. PHIL (CONT'D) (LOOKING BACK) Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara! Now give me a medium right. Do it! She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another street.
C: CLAA

C: PHIL
D: Yes! No.
E: spotting something ahead
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Oh no.
C: CLARA
D: What? Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly rising. Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in. The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: say we can pop you guys up and over.
N: PHIL
C: CLARA
D: Excuse me? What are you talking about, "pop you guys up and over?"
C: BLACK DUDE
D: You climb over, then we both reverse it and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you flying over the top.
C: CLARA
D: What? Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.
C: CLARA
D: Phil, don't even think of it.
E: CONT'D
C: PHIL
D: can do it. Clara.
C: CLARA
D: No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Here we go now... One... two... THREE!
N: CLARA NO! But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse, stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT. CLARA (CONT'D)
C: AHHHH!
D: The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE... .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil and Clara. The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda. ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank and Harry.
C: BLACK DUDE
D: Hope you all got insurance. Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on his Honda.
S: INT. PHIL AND CL ARA' S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: As their car comes to a SMOKING, SPINNING STOP in the middle of the deserted road, Phil sandwiched in air bags, catches his breath. PHIL (INVIGORATED) We did it! We did it! A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside to see Clara MARCHING AWAY down the street.
S: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up. Where are you going?
C: CLARA
D: I want to make sure that at least one our son's parents survives tonight!
C: PHIL
D: What?
C: CLARA
D: You almost just got us killed!
C: PHIL
D: I see. I almost got us killed. Forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole.
C: CLARA
D: There's a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge!
C: PHIL
D: Unbelievable! You know, all you complain about is that I don't take risks anymore. Then the second I do, you get mad at me for doing it! I can't win with you!
C: CLARA
D: Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't you!
C: PHIL
D: Oh, you have no idea! Every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, â¢ disapproving, inconsiderate-
C: CLARA
D: I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!? Have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil's blown through? The floor! The sink! You use my toothbrush.
C: PHIL
D: What's the difference? Afraid you're gonna get my cooties?
C: CLARA
D: I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me! And how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right?
C: PHIL
D: Listen to yourself! You have problems with how I pqt in the toilet paper!
N: Because under makes no sense, Phil! Under makes no sense! When it's under it doesn't pull off right! It just keeps spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade properly! (MORE)
C: CLARA
D: After ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it!
E: CONTVD
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, how about the fact that I have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! You steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself.
C: CLARA
D: What? Phil, I do not "steal" the comforter. It just happens when we're-
C: PHIL
D: Bulls Bull-shit.
E: points at her
C: CLARA
D: Don't you point that at me!
C: PHIL
D: I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't think I don't!
N: (ILLUSTRATING) You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so I can't pull it at all. Â¢
C: CLARA
D: I do not leg lock the comforter!
C: PHIL
D: Oh yes you do!
C: CLARA
D: u think I don't know your little icks? Where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to "finish" it and replace it?
C: PHIL
D: You're right. I do that. You know why do that, Clara?
C: CLARA
D: Because you don't want to haul your ass to the market to buy it yourself!
C: PHIL
D: Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath! You're like the Nutrition Nazi.
N: (MORE) 1Ï¿½1 PHIL (CONT' D ) And I've got to be your little Nutrition Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this "united front" with Ollie! What's wrong if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar instead of one? Or if his handwriting isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school for one day not dressed like Finneas J. Nerdo!
C: CLARA
D: Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I must be hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who makes sure our child's fed, clothed and
N: SURVIVES!
C: PHIL
D: How would you even know? You don't give me or anyone else a chance! You're so goddamn controlling! You've got to be Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady!
C: CLARA
D: Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay attention to you, Phil? Because you give me a headache! Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh.
C: PHIL
D: What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse? How could it be? Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks and the contents spill all over the road.
C: CLARA
D: Screw you, Phil!
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I survive tonight I'm screwed all around anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with my job!
C: CLARA
D: What are you talking about, screwed with your job?
N: 1Ï¿½1
C: PHIL
D: was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn't take it over tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen!
C: CLARA
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: PHIL
D: I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I didn't want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right. He wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe." Someone who'll "take a risk."
C: CLARA
D: I can't believe that's what you think do.
C: PHI
D: Yeah, well...
N: (BEAT) You know, when you set up this whole "magical" night, in that dress... I got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us. But... I don't know. I guess we're just not those people anymore. CLARA (BEAT) I guess we're not. Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h and starts to gather the items from her purse something catches his eye. She picks up the ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.
S: EXT. ROADWAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him. Phil! Phil! She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.
C: PHIL
D: I think we said all needs to be said right now, Clara. Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.
C: CLARA
D: This... this... this...
C: PHIL
D: What?
N: CLARA (PANTING) Side cramp... Wow. She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at the pictures inside. His brow furrows.
C: PHIL
D: What is it? Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.
C: PHIL
D: Oh jeez. It's... it's...
E: CONT'D
N: It's the Mayor. Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.
C: PHIL
D: I bet this didn't have anything to do with Stockton at first.
E: V.0.
S: EXT. DESERTED STREETS - LATER
N: Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece things together.
C: PHIL
D: The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's club one night. He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested.
C: CLARA
D: So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea
C: PHIL
D: Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him.
C: CLARA
D: They knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked.
C: PHIL
D: But somehow Stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself.
C: CLARA
D: So he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the Gales and get the photos.
C: PHIL
D: But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed before the Mayor even had a chance to show up. Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.
C: CLARA
D: What?
C: PHIL
D: If we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be a way out of this for us. Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.
C: CLARA
D: can.
N: DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman building and start toward the elevator, straight past the NIGHT DOORMAN.
C: DOORMAN

C: CLARA
D: Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning! We were lust out for dinner. Trust me
N: Â¢
C: DOORMAN
D: I'm not really allowed to just let you up there.
C: CLARA
D: Please. Just look at us! The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well dressed suburban couple.

C: PHIL
D: Have a nice night.
C: DOORMAN

As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr. Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.

E: CONT'D

C: LIEUTENANT MANNING
D: I work for the Mayor, Terrence.
C: MAYOR DIGGS
D: Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?

D: Maybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns Falconwood.
C: CLARA
D: Not only that, you'll see those other pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment.
C: MR. STOCKTON
D: Frank, Harry! Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns his gun on them.
C: PHIL
D: The more violations Falconwood finds, the longer Eurostruct rents the equipment. That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor. I'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of screwing you in an election year, isn't he? Some of us are pretty pissed off about the roads. Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all
C: MAYOR DIGGS
D: You did this to me? I don't get it, Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I have the Lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs-
