C: BEN
D: - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.

C: MR. LOOMIS
D: Here's the track star himself. How are you, track star?
C: BEN

D: Is there an ashtray in here?
C: BEN
D: No.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Oh - I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
N: She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket.

C: BEN
D: Is what a girl?
C: MRS. ROBINSON

C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Did you know that?
C: BEN
D: Look - I think I should be going -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Sit down, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson - if you don't mind my saying so - this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: My husband will be back quite late.
N: They look at each other. Ben is half standing.

C: BEN
D: Oh my God.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Pardon?
C: BEN
D: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What's wrong?
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson, you didn't - I mean you didn't expect -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: I mean - you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Like what?
C: BEN
D: What do you think?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Well I don't know.
C: BEN
D: For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: So?
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce me.
N: There is a pause. She looks at him.
C: BEN
D: Aren't you?
E: weaker
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you -
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: It's all right.
C: BEN
D: It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Sit down.
C: BEN
D: Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: All right. Now finish your drink.
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
C: BEN
D: What is wrong with me?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
C: BEN
D: Her portrait?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Yes.
C: BEN
D: No.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
C: BEN
D: Very much.
N: We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room.
S: 37 INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.
C: BEN
D: Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she?

D: I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
E: looking at the portrait
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin?
C: BEN
D: Yes?
C: MRS. ROBINSON

C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I think I'll go to bed.
C: BEN
D: Oh. Well, goodnight.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Won't you unzip my dress?
C: BEN
D: I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -
C: BEN
D: No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin - you've known me all your life.
C: BEN
D: I know that. But I'm -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Come on.
N: She turns her back.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: It's hard for me to reach.
N: Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Thank you.
C: BEN
D: Right.
N: Ben walks toward the door.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What are you so scared of?
C: BEN
D: I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Then why do you keep running away?
C: BEN
D: Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
N: Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
C: BEN
D: Yes, I have -
N: He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.
C: BEN
D: But I just - Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What if he did?
C: BEN
D: Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't you think he trusts us together?
C: BEN
D: Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think -
C: BEN
D: But they would! Don't you see?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin - I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd -
C: BEN
D: I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Why is it?
C: BEN
D: Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Would you like me to seduce you?
C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Is that what you're trying to tell me?
C: BEN
D: I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
N: Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall. The CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall. Ben gets to the stairs and starts down.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: BENJAMIN?
C: BEN
D: Yes.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Will you bring up my purse before you go?
C: BEN
D: I have to go now. I'm sorry.
N: Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall. Her back is to us. She is holding her dress in front of her.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
C: BEN
D: Where is it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: On that chair in the hall.
N: She walks out of the shot.
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson?
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: I'm in the bathroom.
C: BEN
D: Well here's the purse.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Could you bring it up?
C: BEN
D: Well I'll hand it to you.
N: Ben starts back up the stairs.
C: BEN
D: Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Benjamin - I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
N: Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.
C: BEN
D: I'm putting it on the top step.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
N: Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly down the hall.
C: BEN
D: I'm putting it here by the door.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Will you bring it in to me?
C: BEN
D: I'd rather not.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: All right. Put it in the room where we were.
C: BEN
D: Right.
S: 38 INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed and puts the purse down. As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait. There is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait. He turns quickly. Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her.
C: BEN
D: Oh God.
N: She smiles.
C: BEN
D: Let me out.
N: She turns the lock on the door.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't be nervous.
C: BEN
D: Get away from that door.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I want to say something first.
C: BEN
D: Jesus Christ!
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin - I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time -
C: BEN
D: Oh my God.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
C: BEN
D: Let me out!
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Do you understand what I said?
C: BEN
D: Yes. Yes. Let me out!
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Because I find you very attractive and any time -
N: There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside. Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs.
S: 39 INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT
N: Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down. SOUND of FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside. Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

C: BEN
D: She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
C: BEN
D: Yes, sir.
N: Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Here. It looks like you need a refill.
C: BEN
D: Oh no.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: I've got to go.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
C: BEN
D: No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
N: Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.
N: Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie and checks to see if his fly is okay. Mr. Robinson turns and brings him the drink.
C: BEN
D: Thank you very much, sir.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Ben - how old are you now?
C: BEN
D: Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.

D: What?
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: How long have we known each other now?
N: Ben shakes his head.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
C: BEN
D: Quite a while.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: I've watched you grow up, Ben.
C: BEN
D: Yes, sir.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
C: BEN
D: Thank you.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
C: BEN
D: I'd like to hear it.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
N: Ben nods.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come. Have a good time with the girls and so forth.
N: Mrs. Robinson enters the room. She is now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't get up.
N: Ben sits.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow a few wild oats. Have a good time while he can. You think that's sound advice?
N: Mrs. Robinson nods.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Yes, I do.
C: BEN
D: I've got to go.
N: He stands. Mr. Robinson stands up with him.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
C: BEN
D: Oh no.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
E: to Mrs. Robinson

N: Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.
S: 41 EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house. Ben comes toward the car. Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin?
C: BEN
D: Yes.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Thank you for taking me home.
N: Ben nods.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I'll see you soon, I hope.

C: MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
D: Ladies and gentlemen - your attention, please - for this after- noon's feature attraction.
T: CUT TO:
S: 42 EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
N: The sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR. and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and LOUISE, who are eight or nine. Watching from across the fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next door and her boy friend. Across the fence on the other side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch- ing. One of them holds a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house. The others are grouped, more or less, at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Hey, over there -- I mean you! Your attention please!
N: Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly - in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
N: But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: - what was I saying?
C: MRS. ARNOLD
D: Feature attraction.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Right. Hey - I'm glad to see you're paying attention. A feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard.
N: They all laugh and some applaud.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Now I'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is twenty-one-years- old -
C: MR. ARNOLD
D: Let's get on with the show!
E: his hands like a megaphone
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Just hang on a minute because I have a few words to say -
C: MR. ARNOLD
D: You always do.
N: They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy comeback.
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Dad - could we just talk about this for a second?
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning -
C: MR. ARNOLD
D: Bring him out!
C: PETER AND LOUISE
D: On with the show! On with the show!
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
E: to the window
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: I'd like to discuss this.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: This boy - I'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does -
E: to his audience
N: Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: - before he does - You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
E: to the window
C: BEN'S VOICE
D: Dad - can you listen -
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: I'll give you ten seconds. He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks - so let's hear it for -
E: meaning it back to the people
N: Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: - Benjamin Braddock!
S: 44 INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY
N: At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand. The people applaud.
S: 45 EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
N: SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV The people in the backyard. His father stands just outside the screen door.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep -
N: Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall. Everything is slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly. We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool. Mr. Braddock signals us with his hand to go under. He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under. He has a big smile. We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look. The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under. We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.
S: 46 EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
N: OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV) Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it. PULL UP AND UP AND UP Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners, swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing, sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools. SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND of the WIND. Hold for a few seconds, then: SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 47 INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN
N: In a phone booth. The booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway. Ben holds the receiver to his ear. SOUND of PHONE RINGING.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Hello.
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite know how to put this -
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Benjamin?
C: BEN
D: Look - I was thinking about that time after the party -
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Where are you?
C: BEN
D: - and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something -
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Where are you?
C: BEN
D: Uh - The Taft Hotel.
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Did you get a room?
C: BEN
D: No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather -
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: Give me an hour.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
D: I'll be there in an hour.
N: SOUND of her HANGING UP. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the CLERK behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some- where. The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them. He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.
C: ROOM CLERK
D: Can I help you, sir!
C: BEN
D: What? Oh - no - I'm just -
N: He points vaguely in the direction of the other young people.
C: ROOM CLERK
D: Are you here for an affair, sir?
N: Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: ROOM CLERK
D: The Singleman party, sir?
C: BEN
D: Oh - yes. The Singleman party.
C: ROOM CLERK
D: It's in the main ballroom.
C: BEN
D: Ahh - thank you.
N: Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby. He puts on his jacket as he goes. He gets to the entrance to the main ballroom. He pauses at the door, looks in. What he sees: People dancing, talking, sitting, etc. He turns back toward te lobby. He stops. What he sees: The room clerk scross the lobby watching him. Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.
S: 48 INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: As Ben steps inside.
C: VOICE
D: Hello.
N: Ben turns. Four people stand in a row. Official greeters, they are: A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they are smiling with great determination.

D: I didn't get your name, sir.
C: BEN
D: Benjamin Braddock, sir.
N: Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding.
C: MRS. SINGLEMAN
D: Braddock - Braddock?
C: BEN
D: Yes, but I'm afraid -
C: MRS. SINGLEMAN
D: I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
C: BEN
D: No - actually I'm just looking for a friend.
C: MRS. SINGLEMAN
D: I'm afraid I don't understand.
C: BEN
D: I'm not with your party - I'm sorry.
E: backing off
C: MRS. SINGLEMAN
D: Hey - I don't get it.

C: MRS. SINGLEMAN
D: Angela - please!
N: Ben backs out of the ballroom.
S: 49 INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

S: 50 INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT
N: This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the windows that look out over the hotel grounds. It is quite dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen people seated around. The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table by the window. PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there. MUZAK is playing.

C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: May I have a drink?
C: BEN
D: A drink? Of course.
N: Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand. The waiter pays no attention. Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically.
C: BEN
D: He didn't see me.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Waiter!
N: For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede. The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them. The waiter moves to their table. The noise in the room comes back. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I will have a martini.
N: WAITER No. 1 Yes, madam. The waiter moves away. Ben watches him go.

SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern. PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light from the television set. Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed. She passes between Ben and the television set and goes out of frame. Ben continues to stare at the set. SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up. Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way. SOUND of BRACELETS being put on. Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again. SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped closed. Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying her purse, passes through again and, without looking at Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and exits.

C: BEN
D: No.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Would you mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
C: BEN
D: You got me.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
E: trying unsuccessfully to control himself
N: Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: The Robinson's are here.
N: Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others. They blot out the sun.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
C: BEN
D: Oh - not too much. Taking it easy.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
C: BEN
D: I will.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
N: Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them. (A long pause)

C: BEN
D: Sure.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
C: BEN
D: When I go off?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
C: BEN
D: No, I do. I want to tell you.
N: There is a pause.
C: BEN
D: I drive around.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: What else?
C: BEN
D: Nothing else.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: Oh, no.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
C: BEN
D: Meet someone?
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: Why did you say that?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you -
E: she starts toward the door
C: BEN
D: No wait. Wait.
N: She stops.
C: BEN
D: I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: Well, wait.
N: She looks at him.
C: BEN
D: You think I'm being dishonest?
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: Well why do you - why do you think that?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
C: BEN
D: Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Not if you don't want to.
C: BEN
D: I do.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: But I don't want you to make up something.
C: BEN
D: I'm not. But I'm - I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Goodnight, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: You believe me, don't you?
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: No.

D: Wait a minute. Sit down a minute.
E: he pushes her hand away
N: Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.
C: BEN
D: Will you please sit down a minute.
N: Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits. She reaches down to take off a shoe.
C: BEN
D: Will you leave that shoe on for a minute. Please.
N: She straightens up.
C: BEN
D: Now - do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: If you want.
C: BEN
D: Good. I mean are we dead or something?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
C: BEN
D: All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Are you tired of it?
C: BEN
D: I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Well what do you want to talk about?
C: BEN
D: Anything. Anything at all.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
C: BEN
D: Oh my God.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Well?
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and --
N: She reaches for her shoe.
C: BEN
D: Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: How about art.
C: BEN
D: Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
C: BEN
D: Oh.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't you?
C: BEN
D: Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Go ahead then.
C: BEN
D: Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
N: She shrugs.
C: BEN
D: Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Neither.
C: BEN
D: You're not interested in art?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: Then why do you want to talk about it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I don't.
N: Ben nods and looks at the rug.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Can I take off my clothes now?
C: BEN
D: No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Do you really want me to?
C: BEN
D: Yes I do.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I got up.
N: Ben starts shaking his head.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Do you want to hear it or not?
C: BEN
D: Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the after- noon I read a novel.
C: BEN
D: What one.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: What novel did you read.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I don't remember.
N: Ben nods.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until -
C: BEN
D: There!
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Him?
C: BEN
D: I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you - how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: There isn't any.
C: BEN
D: There's no risk?
N: She shakes her head.
C: BEN
D: How do you get out of the house?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I walk out.
C: BEN
D: You walk right out the door.
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: What do you say to him?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: He's asleep.
C: BEN
D: Always?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
C: BEN
D: Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
C: BEN
D: But what about the noise from the car. What if -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: The driveway's on my side of the house.
C: BEN
D: We're talking.
E: smiling
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Calm down, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: Now let's keep going here.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Can I undress and talk at the same time?
C: BEN
D: Right.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Thank you.
C: BEN
D: Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: We don't.
C: BEN
D: So you don't - I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No we don't.
C: BEN
D: Well how long has this been going on.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: About five years.
E: looking at the ceiling for a moment
C: BEN
D: Oh no. Are you kidding me?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: You have not slept with your husband for five years?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Now and then. He geats drunk a few times a year.
C: BEN
D: How many times a year.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
C: BEN
D: Man, is this interesting.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Is it?
C: BEN
D: So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: We've talked enough, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Not exactly.
C: BEN
D: But you don't hate him.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
C: BEN
D: Well how do you feel about him, then?
E: unhooking her blouse
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I don't.
C: BEN
D: Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Is it?
C: BEN
D: I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
N: She nods and takes off her blouse.
C: BEN
D: Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I never did, Benjamin. Now let's -
C: BEN
D: Well, wait a minute. You married him.
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: Why did you do that?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: See if you can guess.
E: taking off her stockings
C: BEN
D: Well I can't.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Think real hard, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: I can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't tell Elaine.
C: BEN
D: Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Are you shocked?
C: BEN
D: Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: All right. Now let's get to bed.
C: BEN
D: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Not particularly.
C: BEN
D: Was he a law student at the time?
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: And you were a student also.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Yes.
C: BEN
D: At college.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Yes.
C: BEN
D: What was your major?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Why are you asking me all this?
C: BEN
D: Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Art.
C: BEN
D: Art?
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Kind of.
C: BEN
D: Well how did it happen?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: How do you think.
C: BEN
D: I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
C: BEN
D: I'm curious.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: We'd go to his car.
C: BEN
D: Oh no. In the car you did it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I don't think we were the first.
N: Ben thinks for a moment.
C: BEN
D: What kind of car was it?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: Do you remember the make of the car?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Oh my God.
C: BEN
D: Really. I want to know.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: It was a Ford, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
E: jumping up
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: That's enough.
C: BEN
D: So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
N: There is a pause.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't talk about Elaine.
C: BEN
D: Don't talk about Elaine?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: Why not?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Because I don't want you to.
N: She walks to the bed.
C: BEN
D: Well why don't you?
N: She pulls the bedspread down. Ben begins to remove his jacket.
C: BEN
D: I wish you'd tell me.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: There's nothing to tell.
C: BEN
D: Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
N: Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.
C: BEN
D: Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
N: Ben looks at her.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Do you understand that?
C: BEN
D: Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Good.
C: BEN
D: I was just kidding around.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Good.
C: BEN
D: But why shouldn't I?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I have my reasons.
C: BEN
D: Then let's hear them.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: No.
C: BEN
D: Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
N: She pulls the covers down.
C: BEN
D: I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Let's drop it.
C: BEN
D: We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to -
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin?
C: BEN
D: I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Yes.
C: BEN
D: You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I wouldn't know.
C: BEN
D: Well, I'm not.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: You're not.
C: BEN
D: No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic!
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I see.
C: BEN
D: And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
N: She nods.
C: BEN
D: Because - Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Are you?
C: BEN
D: You're goddamn right I am.
N: He starts putting on his shirt. She sits on the edge of the bed and watches him.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: That's how you feel about me.
N: He nods.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
C: BEN
D: Now don't start this.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: What?
C: BEN
D: Don't start acting hurt.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
C: BEN
D: Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Did I say that?
C: BEN
D: Of course you did.
N: She shakes her head.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
C: BEN
D: Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
C: BEN
D: You wouldn't.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Of course I wouldn't.
N: Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.
C: BEN
D: What are you doing?
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
C: BEN
D: Well look - I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: If that's how you feel -
C: BEN
D: But it's not.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
E: smiling at him
C: BEN
D: Oh no. Look - I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: But if it's sickening for you -
C: BEN
D: It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: You don't have to say that.
C: BEN
D: Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: May I stay then?
C: BEN
D: Yes. Please. I want you to.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Thank you.
C: BEN
D: Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
N: There is a long pause.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you? I want you to promise me that.
N: There is another long pause.
C: BEN
D: Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occured to me to take her out.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Then give me your word you won't.
C: BEN
D: This is absurd.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Promise me, Benjamin.
C: BEN
D: All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
C: MRS. ROBINSON
D: Thank you. Benjamin -
E: pause
C: BEN
D: Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.

T: CUT TO:
S: 93 INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY
N: Ben is lying on his bed. Mrs. Braddock stands in the doorway.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK

N: Ben gives a small whimper.
T: CUT TO:
S: 94 EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
N: Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the Braddock pool. The sun shines down. His diving mask is on over his eyes. His face is in the water, looking down at the bottom of the pool. Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around Ben. During the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
C: BEN
D: Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
C: BEN
D: Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
C: BEN
D: That has nothing to do with it -
C: MR. BRADDOCK
D: I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening - doing God knows what -
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -
C: BEN
D: I do.
C: MRS. BRADDOCK
D: - then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.

Ben is at the other end of the table, facing us. The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along the sides. Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is eating, looking down at their places. After a few moments Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream. As he continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs. Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair. The spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's face. As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes. The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it and holds it up in the air. The music stops and a DRUM ROLL starts. The stripper bends over Elaine's head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of Elaine's face. 108 SHOT - BEN He leans forward slightly to watch the action.

D: But could I just tell you this one thing?
C: ELAINE

She starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her. She closes her eyes. He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face. He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands. Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on. After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side.

His artificial smile disappears. The agony is such that he has to steady himself with his hand on the rail. He turns his face away, toward the cage. There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.

D: Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.

D: You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
C: BEN
D: No, I don't.

C: BEN
D: You miss the point.
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: Don't shout at me, Ben.

C: BEN
D: HUH?
C: MR. ROBINSON
D: I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
