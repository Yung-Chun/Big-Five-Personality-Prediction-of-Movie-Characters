C: VOICE

N: The page of a notebook turns, revealing neat cursive handwriting, covers the comic. PULL BACK TO
S: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home, with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela, attends to her notebook. On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.
C: MOTHER
D: Cat! Is your homework finished yet?
C: CAT
D: Working on it Mama.
N: Her mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara Croft comic and it's copy.
C: MOTHER
D: You draw beautifully my love, but if you want to be something in life you have to study.
C: CAT
D: I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero.
N: Her mother turns the page back to the lessons.
C: MOTHER
D: Better to be a doctor. A lawyer.
C: CAT
D: Are we going to see Uncle Emilio?
C: MOTHER
D: I don't know. Just waiting to hear from your father.
N: Cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat, her mother, and her father. Her face carries a bit of worry. CLOSE ON
C: DON LUIS
D: I can't believe this.
N: Mid 40'S, a gentleman, calm, courteous, impeccably dressed. PULL BACK TO
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S GARDEN - DAY
N: At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don Luis sits opposite...
C: FABIO
D: Why not?
N: Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man, MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive.
C: DON LUIS
D: Because I love you Fabio. Like a brother.
C: FABIO
D: And I love you Don Luis. Like a brother.
N: He turns to Marco.
C: DON LUIS
D: Can you believe this guy Marco? We started when we were little...how old were we Fabio?
C: FABIO
D: Ten.
C: DON LUIS
D: Ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market. After all we've been through. And now we're on top, he wants to leave...
C: FABIO
D: Luis, I'm going to be honest with you. You remember I had that operation?
C: DON LUIS
D: That was last year.
C: FABIO
D: Since then, I'm not a hundred percent. And you can't do this thing if you're not a hundred percent. I'm tired.
C: DON LUIS
D: So you'll take a rest.
C: FABIO
D: You know how many times we should have been dead?
C: DON LUIS
D: I don't even want to count.
C: FABIO
D: Neither do I. But you gotta think. How lucky we are to still be alive.
C: DON LUIS
D: Yeah. That's right. We're alive. And what about the future of this thing we built?
C: FABIO
D: It's yours. It's not my thing any more.
C: DON LUIS
D: I'm not going to talk you out of it, am I cabron?
C: FABIO
D: I'll always be there for you Luis. Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
C: DON LUIS
D: I'm gonna hold you to that. You bastard. I'm going to miss you.
E: EMOTIONAL
C: FABIO
D: And I'm going to miss you.
C: DON LUIS
D: OK. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! One last drink, huh?
N: He pours the liquor into the glasses.
C: DON LUIS
D: To the future.
N: They tap glasses.
C: FABIO
D: Bueno.
N: They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
C: DON LUIS
D: So. Business is all clear?
C: FABIO
D: All clear.
N: He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
C: FABIO
D: It's all here.
C: DON LUIS
D: No other copies?
C: FABIO
D: You even have to ask?
C: DON LUIS
D: Hey.
N: He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close as brothers.
C: FABIO
D: Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't get in too much trouble.
C: MARCO
D: Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
N: And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
C: DON LUIS
D: Kill this motherfucker.
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back, the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained, calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes off. Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.
C: FABIO
D: This fucker! The motherfucker!
N: He keeps banging the dash.
C: DRIVER
D: Not OK Boss?
C: FABIO
D: This bastard thinks I'm an idiot. Playing it all mellow and shit. If he would have yelled and screamed and threatened to kill my whole family, it would have been OK. We have an hour to get out of here. At most.
N: Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car...
S: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
S: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension filled face.
C: MOTHER
D: Fabio?
C: FABIO
D: We've got ten minutes.
C: MOTHER
D: Cataleya, go pack!
E: PANICKED
C: CAT
D: I'm packed Mama.
N: Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame, comes over to Cat.
C: FABIO
D: Listen to me my darling. Just in case of anything. This...
N: He holds the chip up.
C: FABIO
D: This is your passport. Do you understand?
N: She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card out of his pocket.
C: FABIO
D: You find yourself alone? You go to the address on this card. Show it to the man at the front gate.
C: CAT
D: I don't understand papa.
C: FABIO
D: You don't have to understand. You just have to listen, and remember.
N: As Cat looks at the chip.
S: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows roll down.
C: MAN
D: Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.
E: polite. smiling
C: BODYGUARD
D: He's not home.
C: MAN
D: You mind if we wait?
C: BODYGUARD
D: Your time.
S: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off, folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around his neck, drapes it over hers.
C: FABIO
D: And this will keep you safe.
N: Cat looks down at the medal. CLOSE ON THE MEDAL An imprint of a flower.
C: FABIO
D: The Cataleya orchid. It comes from one place on Earth. Our place. My mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. Every morning I would wake up to the sight of them. The smell of them. That's why I named you after them. It reminds us of who we are.
N: He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the doorway with two suitcases.
C: MOTHER
D: I'm ready.
S: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: The man in the SUV is on the phone.
C: MAN
D: They said he's not home yet.
N: He listens.
C: MAN
D: OK. OK.
N: He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up to Fabio's men.
C: MAN
D: Change of plans.
N: He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.
S: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
N: As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the street.
C: FABIO
D: Back!
N: He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window. Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door...
C: FABIO
D: Too late. Get ready!
N: The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room. Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
C: FABIO
D: I love you very much.
C: CAT
D: I love you too Papa.
N: CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife. And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.
C: FABIO
D: Alicia!
N: His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up shooter's positions facing the door. ANGLE ON CAT Sitting at the table, very still. Watching. ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles, sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting, waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come. But they never get the chance because... BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!! Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred. Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood splattering across the room, across her. And then... Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair. And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. Cat. Marco enters.
C: MARCO
D: You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back.
N: The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink. ANGLE ON MARCO Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of. ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
C: MARCO
D: Hey! What are you doing?
N: As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in his hand.
C: GUNMAN
D: Don Luis said kill everyone.
C: MARCO
D: He also said no names.
C: GUNMAN
D: She won't remember.
N: He is about to pull the trigger.
C: MARCO
D: HEY!
N: The gunman stops.
C: MARCO
D: She's a kid.
C: GUNMAN
D: So what?
C: MARCO
D: What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value.
N: The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her teeth.
C: GUNMAN
D: I couldn't even get ten bucks for her in the street.
N: The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
C: MARCO
D: Are you stupid or what? Here.
N: Marco hands him some cash.
C: MARCO
D: Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job.
N: Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart, looking for something. Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
C: MARCO
D: Remember me Cataleya?
E: SOFTLY
N: Cat shakes her head no.
C: MARCO
D: I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. I see he gave you his medal.
N: Alluding to the medal around her neck.
C: MARCO
D: The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him. I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.
E: BEAT
N: All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
C: MARCO
D: Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is?
N: Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips imperceptibly under the table. CLOSE ON HER HAND Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
C: MARCO
D: Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you?
N: Again Cat shakes her head.
C: MARCO
D: This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that?
N: Again Cat shakes her head.
C: MARCO
D: But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like...
N: He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
C: MARCO
D: This.
N: Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in her eyes.
C: MARCO
D: I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right?
N: Cat nods.
C: MARCO
D: Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than...
N: He holds up his thumbnail.
C: MARCO
D: This. Maybe it was in this.
N: He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of the wood.
C: MARCO
D: Do you know what I am talking about?
N: Cat nods. CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND Gripping the knife handle.
C: MARCO
D: Excellent. Do you know where it is?
N: Cat nods.
C: MARCO
D: Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want.
E: MORE
C: MARCO
D: But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?
E: CONT'D
N: Cat nods yes.
C: MARCO
D: So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. Will you do that?
N: Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles, kindly. He holds out his hand.
C: MARCO
D: You are a smart girl.
N: Marco opens his hand.
C: MARCO
D: And in this life, smart girls get everything they want. What do you want Cat?
N: And just as she is about to open her hand... CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped there.
C: MARCO
D: Just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?
N: In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
C: CAT
D: To kill Don Luis!
E: in his ear
C: MARCO
D: AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
N: The men searching look up, and before they can react, Cat races past them.
C: MARCO
D: Get her!
N: TRACK WITH CAT As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back, she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window. And she drops... Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father. ON THE BATHROOM One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!! Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon. ON CAT She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the barrage stops. ON THE GUNMAN His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one in... ON CAT She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running. ON THE GUNMAN Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand.
C: MARCO
D: We need her alive!
S: EXT. FAVELA - DAY
N: Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof. ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit. ON CAT She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.
S: EXT. FAVELA - DAY
N: Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt.
C: MARCO
D: Go! Go!
N: He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions. ON CAT As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley. She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door, which gives way and enters... AN OPEN COURTYARD Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it. ON THE GUNMEN They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between the rows of tomato vines. When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof. ON CAT She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets. ON THE GUNMEN They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out. ON CAT She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the alley... VRROOOM! And bear down on Cat. Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets... AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR THROATS. ON CAT She looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the hill. AND JUST AS SHE DOES... Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat.
C: MARCO
D: There!
N: The jeep screeches around. Cat dashes down an alley. ON CAT As she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on either side. ON MARCO The alley is too narrow for the jeep. The men spill out, spring up the alley.
C: MARCO
D: Alive!
N: ON CAT She runs up the alley, then ducks down another one. She comes to a ladder that leads up a fence, begins to climb. ON THE GUNMEN Running up the alley, turning into the next one. Where they see the ladder. One of the gunmen pulls out his cell phone. ON MARCO In the jeep, scouting as it rolls along. ON CAT She is running for all she is worth, out of breath, scared. ANGLE ON More thugs on bikes, on foot, in cars. They are everywhere. ON CAT She is leaning against a wall on a rooftop, gulping air, when she hears the roar of engines. Looks over the side of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area. ON GUNMEN Climbing the ladder. ON CAT Hearing them coming. ON GUNMEN Surrounding a building. Throwing grappling hooks onto the roof ledge. ON CAT Seeing the grappling hooks claw onto the roof edge. ON GUNMEN Cresting the roof from the ladder. ON GUNMEN Rappelling up the side of the building on the grappling ropes. ON GUNMEN Flooding onto the roof from both sides. Coming to the spot where Cat was only moments before. To find no Cat. One of the gunmen takes out his cell. Dials. ON MARCO On the phone.
C: MARCO
D: North! Go North! We're cutting off the southern streets!
N: Marco slams his phone shut. Heads for his car. ON GUNMEN
C: GUNMAN
D: North!
N: The gunmen clear the roof. As the last one leaves, he takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof, cannot figure where this wisp of a girl went to. His eyes briefly focus on the chimney...
C: GUNMAN
D: Let's go.
N: He clambers over the side of the roof. THE CAMERA STAYS FOCUSED ON THE CHIMNEY.
S: INT. CHIMNEY - DAY
N: Cat, holding her breath, listening keenly to the sound of the men departing, is wedged into the chimney, her hands and feet clinging like a lizard to the walls on either side.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney, mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress. The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She looks up to a jeep turning the corner. REVERSE ON MARCO In the windshield of the jeep, staring at her.
C: MARCO
D: We got her! Close the net!
N: ON CAT She sees Marco. She pauses for a moment, and then does something that stuns even Marco. She starts to run right towards the jeep! ON MARCO A bit stunned.
C: MARCO
D: What is she doing?
N: ON CAT She keeps sprinting toward the jeep. Another jeep appears over the hill behind her. Starts to come at her. ON MARCO As his jeep speeds right for her. ON CAT As she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a plan. And she executes it. Suddenly, she leaps for the curb and... A SEWER GRATE. ON MARCO Sees Cat dive to the curb.
C: MARCO
D: No!
N: ON CAT As she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate, with barely enough room to squeeze in. But in she does squeeze. ON MARCO In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb. Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at him. Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate... BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!! Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo, he peers down again. Cat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat.
C: MARCO
D: Get down there!
N: The gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole.
S: INT. SEWERS - DAY
N: The gunmen, following the beams of their flashlights, go tramping through the muck of the sewers, trying to find Cat. The only living things they find are rats, scurrying across their feet.
C: GUNMAN
D: We lost her!
E: ON PHONE
N: ON MARCO
C: MARCO
D: FUCK! FUCK!
N: He kicks every car in the street in frustration.
S: INT. SEWERS - DAY
N: The gunmen wait in the sewer, waiting.
C: MARCO V.O.
D: Come back out.
N: The gunmen retreat back the way they came. They do not see someone watching them go. ANGLE ON A small crevice in the sewer wall. Cat has squeezed herself into the crack, almost invisible.
S: EXT. STREET - SUNSET
N: Cars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare. CLOSE ON A SEWER GRATE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE CURB A hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the street. PULL BACK TO CAT RISING She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world away.
S: EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT
N: Two Marines stand guard. Looking straight ahead.
C: VOICE
D: Excuse me...
N: The Marine looks down to Cat. Bedraggled, covered in soot and blood and shit. Holding out the card her father gave her. CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A MIDDLE AGED AMERICAN PULL BACK TO
S: INT. EMBASSY OFFICE - NIGHT
N: The American looks at the card Cat gave to the Marine, hands it to another American. AMERICAN 1 And you say you have something for us? He turns to Cat, who nods yes. AMERICAN 1 May I see it? Cat takes a beat. Puts her fingers down her throat. And throws up all over the man's desk. AMERICAN 1 Oh jeez... Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk, who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her, gingerly. He looks at the chip, looks at Cat. AMERICAN 1 (REPULSED) Thank you. CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN Facts, figures, names, dates, a wealth of information scrolls down. PULL BACK TO THE TWO AMERICANS LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AMERICAN 1 We have to record this. Cat does not understand. The second American hits a button on a remote. ANGLE ON A HIDDEN CAMERA ROLLING BACK ON AMERICAN 1 Where did you get this?
C: CAT
D: My Papa.
N: AMERICAN 1 And where is your Papa?
C: CAT
D: Dead.
N: AMERICAN 1 Did he tell you what this is?
C: CAT
D: Yes...my passport.
S: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
N: Cat watches out the window as the plane's landing gear drops and the city of Miami spreads out before her in all it's shimmer and glistening glory.
C: VOICE
D: We are making our final approach to Miami International airport. Please fasten your seat belts.
N: She looks down at the medal around her neck. A tear forms in her eye. Rolls down her cheek. Impossible to tell if it is a tear of joy or sadness.
S: INT. JETWAY - DAY
N: Cat, with a plastic envelope holding her travel documents around her neck, accompanied by an airline rep, walks down the jetway toward the entrance to the airport, where a MAN is standing. Looking directly at her. All the passengers are filing to the left as they leave the jetway, but as Cat and her escort approach the man...
C: MAN
D: Come with me.
N: He walks to the right.
S: INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
N: Cat stands in front of a rotund bureaucrat, with the man who escorted her, handing over her passport.
C: BUREAUCRAT
D: She's the one?
C: MAN
D: She is indeed.
N: The Bureaucrat looks at her passport. As Cat glimpses through the slatted window looking out over the Customs floor, where all the other passengers are being processed in long lines.
C: BUREAUCRAT
D: You must have done something pretty important to get the royal treatment little lady.
N: Cat says nothing. He stamps her passport.
C: BUREAUCRAT
D: Welcome to America.
N: Cat looks at him, not sure if this is good news or bad news. ON THE MIAMI SKYLINE
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: Cat looks out the window of the car at the skyline passing by, silent, filled with wonder.
C: MAN
D: You like music?
N: Cat looks at him, doesn't respond. He turns the radio on. A god awful C&W song comes on. Cat looks at him for a moment, then reaches over, turns the radio off. Goes back to looking out the window.
S: EXT. BOARDING SCHOOL - EVENING
N: The car passes a gate with a sign: MISS PORTERS SCHOOL FOR GIRLS.

C: HEADMISSTRESS
D: To provide a safe, healthy nurturing environment where young women can get the education they will need to meet the challenges of that amazing adventure called life. How does that sound to you, my dear?

C: MAN
D: It's been a long day for her. Here's the check for the year's tuition.
N: He hands over a check.
C: MAN
D: And the five hundred dollars allowance for the first six months.

N: Three dozen girls of all ages go about their business. Some do homework on their beds, others do their hair, dance, run around. And suddenly, at the sound of a door opening, they all stop and look in the same direction at Cat and the MONITOR
C: MONITOR
D: Girls, this is your new classmate. Please welcome her and show her the ropes. Wake up is at seven. Sweet dreams.
E: TO CAT
N: She exits. All the girls stare at Cat. No one makes a move. In the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until... The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone, and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name is...
C: SHERRI
D: I'm Sherri. And you are?
C: CAT
D: Very tired.
N: The girls all around twitter. Sherri looks back at them, no good rising on her smirking face.
C: SHERRI
D: Well, 'very tired', I'm sure you want to lay down and rest your little head?
C: CAT
D: I do.
C: SHERRI
D: There's your bed...
N: She points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed. Cat is about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in her chest.
C: CAT
D: But it's gonna cost you. Twenty dollars.
E: BEAT
N: Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging on every word, waiting to see what jumps off. Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it over to Sherri.
C: SHERRI
D: A week. Peace has it's price, y'know what I'm saying?
N: Cat says nothing, just stares at Sherri.
C: SHERRI
D: Are we clear on that?
C: CAT
D: Twenty dollars a week.
N: Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other twenties.
C: SHERRI
D: We got a smart one!
N: The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand from Cat's chest.
C: SHERRI
D: You can go now. In peace.
E: BEAT
N: Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering resumes. Cat stares at the ceiling, her hand reaches inside her jumper, takes out the medal her father gave her. She holds it close in her hand, just lays that way.
T: FADE TO
S: INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT
N: All the girls are asleep in their beds. Silence reigns, except for the small cries and sighs of girls asleep. CLOSE ON CAT Her eyes still open, her hand clutching her father's medal. She gets up.
S: INT. HALL - NIGHT
N: Cat makes her way down the hall. At the end of the Hall is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A door marked: HEADMISTRESS. Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock. Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear, she enters.
S: INT. HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Cat tries the drawer where the Headmistress locked her money away. She looks around, takes a letter opener off the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her name on it.
S: INT. HALL - NIGHT
N: Again Cat walks down the darkened hall, looking for another door. Finds it marked: INFIRMARY.
S: INT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT
N: Cat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals until she finds what she is looking for. She smashes the glass door, reaches in, extracts one bottle. CLOSE ON SHERRI ASLEEP PULL BACK TO
S: INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT
N: Cat, with four belts slung over her shoulder, the bottle from the infirmary in one in one hand, a cloth in the other, stands over the sleeping Sherri. Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth. Seals the bottle. Puts it down. Then takes the cloth and places it over Sherri's sleeping face, ever so gently.
T: FADE TO BLACK
S: EXT. HORIZON - SUNRISE
N: The sun comes up over the horizon, casts it's first rays through the windows of...
S: INT. DORMITORY - MORNING
N: The sun hits the faces of the girls. As they wake, they find two very interesting things. 1. A twenty dollar bill on each bed. 2. Sherri fast asleep, her hands and feet tied to the post of the bed with belts, her shirt pulled up, her money belt gone. And the word THIEF written in magic marker across her stomach. And the drawing of the Cataleya orchid. CLOSE ON A kind faced Hispanic woman, a...
C: TICKET AGENT
D: Hola chica, where are we wanting to go today?
N: PULL BACK TO
S: INT. BUS STATION - DAY
N: Cat, barely up to the window, hands the ticket agent the piece of paper her father gave her. The woman looks at the paper.
C: TICKET AGENT
D: Chicago is not next door, you know.
C: CAT
D: How much?
N: Cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office. MONTAGE DAY/NIGHT The landscape of America passes by through the window of a bus. Clutching a new Lara Croft comic, nibbling on a big Mac and fries out of a bag, Cat sees... The sugar cane harvests in the Florida wetlands. Two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack shelling peas in the deep South. The Steel Mills of Pittsburgh fire up. The endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from horizon to horizon across Ohio. The giant milk barns of Indiana with their hundreds of cows. And finally, sees the great city of Chicago looming in the distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.
S: EXT. CHICAGO BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT
N: As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey. Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty sleazy types. Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points her in a direction. MONTAGE Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago. Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian. She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her onward. She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass. She hands one her paper, he points her on. She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques. She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue, over the bridges... Until she comes to...
S: EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
N: The denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to happen at every turn. ANGLE ON CAT Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
C: MAN
D: Hey kid. You know what time it is?
N: Cat shakes her head.
C: MAN
D: It's late, and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out. What are you doing here?
N: Cat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious.
C: MAN
D: Who are you?
C: CAT
D: Cataleya.
N: The man takes a moment...
C: MAN
D: Wait here.
N: He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond. Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches street life. She sees... Hookers soliciting men in passing cars. Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase. Men playing craps against a wall. Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than anything else. CLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE A very bloodied face. Once, twice, three times. PULL BACK TO
S: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
N: EMILIO RESTREPO, 35, a hard case, fuck with me at your own risk written all over his face, is about to deliver another crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to a chair when...
C: MAN
D: Emilio.
N: The beating stops, Emilio turns.
C: MAN
D: There's a girl looking for you.
C: EMILIO
D: I'm not interested in a girl right now.
N: He turns back to the task at hand. Cocks his fist.
C: MAN
D: It's not that sort of thing. She's eight.
N: Again, Emilio stops. The man hands her Cat's paper.
C: MAN
D: Says her name's Cataleya.
N: This focuses Emilio's attention.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who disappeared.
C: MAN
D: Come with me.
N: He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
S: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
N: Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals, on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth, stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat to enter.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she walks along. In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen merchandise. In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns, hand guns, assault rifles. Big artillery.
C: MAN
D: Hey!
N: Cat's attention is drawn away from the room with the guns, to the Man holding a door open for her at the very end of the hall.
S: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Cat enters an office with three women working on computers. Looks like any other business office. At the sight of Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind them. Cat is left alone. She looks around the office, when the sound of a door opening behind her. She turns to Emilio. Who approaches her cautiously, scrutinizing her.
C: EMILIO
D: Cataleya?
N: Now it is Cat who hesitates.
C: CAT
D: Uncle Emilio?
N: Emilio covers his mouth, seems rocked.
C: EMILIO
D: Madonna! I thought you were dead!
N: He crosses himself.
C: EMILIO
D: I thought you were all...
N: Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms, lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended, emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She bursts into tears.
C: EMILIO
D: You're safe now.
N: All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept locked away deep inside, rushes to the surface in one massive wave.
C: EMILIO
D: You're safe.
S: EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
N: The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as it ascends in the sky. CLOSE ON One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between a window and the shade covering it. CLOSE ON The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face. She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For a moment she does not remember where she is. PULL BACK TO
S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Cat looks around the clean, orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts. Her eyes move around the room. It is a boy's room. With models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster of Al Pacino as Tony Montana in SCARFACE. A poster with every imaginable type of assault rifle.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty breakfast. An elderly woman, grandmotherly, fills his coffee cup.
C: EMILIO
D: Gracias mama.
N: A noise turns both of them to the doorway and Cat.
C: EMILIO
D: Good morning.
C: MAMA
D: Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit. I'll make you some eggs.
N: Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a grandmother's love. Kisses her on the forehead, lovingly, whispers into her ear.
C: MAMA
D: You have your mother's beautiful eyes. Don't be scared. This is your home.
N: Slowly, hesitantly, Cat makes her way across the kitchen to the table, where she sits opposite Emilio, tentative.
C: EMILIO
D: When was the last time you slept?
C: CAT
D: I don't know. A long time ago.
C: EMILIO
D: Well good. A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after.
C: CAT
D: Whose room is that?
C: EMILIO
D: My son. Your cousin.
C: CAT
D: Where is he?
C: EMILIO
D: He's dead.
N: His voice holds anger, not sadness.
C: CAT
D: Killed?
C: EMILIO
D: Yes.
C: CAT
D: By who?
C: EMILIO
D: No one who is still alive.
N: Mama comes over, puts a plate of eggs in front of her. As she begins to wolf down the food. He holds up the page of her drawing, the one her Father put his address on.
C: EMILIO
D: You are very talented. Is this what you want to be? An artist?
C: CAT
D: I used to want to be like Lara. A super agent.
N: Shoveling more food into her mouth.
C: EMILIO
D: Not anymore?
N: Chewing, Cat shakes her head.
C: EMILIO
D: And now?
C: CAT
D: I want to be a killer.
E: matter of fact
N: She keeps shoveling food in her mouth. Emilio looks up at his mother, who crosses herself. Cat finishes the last mouthful, looks up.
C: CAT
D: Can you help?
N: Emilio blinks once.
C: EMILIO
D: Sure.
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Emilio walks Cat down the street. He is carrying a kids book bag.
C: EMILIO
D: The good news is your father bought you your life with what he gave you. The bad news is Don Luis was playing both sides, and has disappeared. You tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip. It is something he will not forget. There is a law in this thing of ours. If someone does you, the revenge goes all the way down the line. Women, children, Grandmothers, dogs, cats. No exceptions.
C: CAT
D: Are you trying to scare me?
C: EMILIO
D: I am trying to educate you.
N: CLOSE ON MONEY BEING COUNTED PULL BACK TO
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The PRINCIPAL watches Emilio count the money out.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Normally we don't accept students in the middle of the academic year, but under the circumstances, losing her parents in that tragic car accident...
N: Cat looks out the window, saying nothing.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Here.
N: He hands a list over to Cat. Who keeps looking out the window.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: These are the school supplies you'll need.
N: Emilio takes them.
C: EMILIO
D: She's still in a bit of shock.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Of course. See you Monday Cataleya. Such a pretty name.
N: She keeps looking out the window.
S: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
N: As Emilio walks along, with Cataleya, reading the list of supplies.
C: EMILIO
D: We'll get all this stuff, then go over to this little place I know down on Maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the Polish people make here.
N: He turns left at the cross street...
C: EMILIO
D: You like hot dogs?
N: He looks down, sees no Cat. Looks back to see Cat walking in the opposite direction.
C: EMILIO
D: Hey!
N: Cat keeps going.
C: EMILIO
D: Hey!
N: He hurries, catches up with her.
C: EMILIO
D: Where you going?
C: CAT
D: I've already been to school. I told you what I want to be. You don't want to help me, fine. I'll do it myself.
N: She walks off. Emilio grabs her.
C: EMILIO
D: Chica. Any idiot can be a killer. Look!
N: Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster, and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.
C: EMILIO
D: You want me to teach you to be a killer? No problema. I'll teach you. But you'll be dead in five years.
E: MORE
C: EMILIO
D: If you want to be a killer, and survive, you have to be a smart one. You have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. You have to know how the world works. How people think. You got to learn to be psychological. That I cannot teach you, unless you learn the basics at school. Got it?
E: CONT'D
N: Cat glares at him.
C: EMILIO
D: Now what's it going to be?
N: He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers, and people pour out of the school and the surrounding stores. As they put distance between the chaos and themselves.
C: CAT
D: But I still want to be a killer.

S: EXT. FRESNO - NIGHT
N: A sleepy California town on the way to nowhere. PAN DOWN TO
S: EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
N: A police cruiser sits on a quiet street, right off a wider avenue. Main street. There is no traffic either way. The nose of the cop car juts out just off the street.
S: INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT
N: Two cops are sitting, peeling back the wrappers on their burgers. COP 1 So then I suggest, y'know, we buy some things to spice it up a bit. COP 2 Define things. As they nibble and talk, they pay scant attention to a set of headlights coming up the broad avenue. COP 1 A garter belt, some of those stockings that come up the thigh...it's fourteen years. Know what I mean? The lights come closer... COP 2 Yeah. No matter how much you like steak, sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing. The lights shine right into the car. COP 1 Exactly. Only then, when the lights are directly on them, do the cops turn to see a car heading right toward their front end. COP 1 What the... CRASH!!!! The front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact. Glass shatters, metal crunches, airbags explode! ANGLE ON The other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle falls out, clinks to the sidewalk. And a moment later, two legs emerge from the car. Two very long, very shapely legs. Legs that never end. In very high heels, and a very short mini skirt. And the face on top of it, framed by a mane of wild hair, is drop dead think-you-have-died- and-gone-to-heaven gorgeous. The whole package reads SUPERMODEL. And by the way she is weaving when she stands, and the bottle at her feet, the read is; very drunk supermodel. Who looks at the crumpled police cruiser, looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops, and says in the most sweetly drunk voice...
C: SUPERMODEL
D: Oops...
N: The cops can't believe this. They regain their wits and bolt out of the car. COP 1 That's all you have to say? Oops? And, ever so sensually, she starts to laugh. The cops look at each other, perplexed. And she keeps laughing. The cops get pissed. COP 1 Funny? ...and she keeps laughing. COP 1 Wanna laugh you crazy bitch? I'll give you something to laugh about! And even when they slam her to the hood of the car, jam her hands behind her back, and slap the cuffs on, she keeps laughing, and laughing. CLOSE ON HER CHEST WHERE A VERY FAMILIAR MEDALLION ON A CHAIN HANGS BETWEEN HER EXPOSED CLEAVAGE. A MEDALLION ENGRAVED WITH THE CATALEYA ORCHID. IT IS CAT, ALL GROWN UP.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: A quiet night in the small station. Cat stands in front of the booking desk, so drunk the two cops have to hold her up. A surveillance camera over the desk innocuously records everything. Cat keeps her head down, her face, obscured by her mane of hair. As the SERGEANT goes through her purse, finds...
C: SERGEANT
D: No license, no registration. No ID except a library card. Well Ms...
N: He reads off the library card.
C: SERGEANT
D: Valarie Phillips in addition to all that...you're being charged here with DUI, destruction of police property, driving the wrong way on a two way street...
C: CAT
D: Is that it?
C: SERGEANT
D: Unless you can think of anything else you should be charged with.
C: CAT
D: Wearing no panties?
E: TIPSY
N: The Sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give her a long look, as do any of the other cops in ear shot, whose eyes go to her very short skirt.
C: SERGEANT
D: That's not a crime.
C: CAT
D: Thank goodness.
N: And she teeters over, passes out cold right on the Sergeant's desk.
C: SERGEANT
D: Take her in the back, lock her up, put a cup of coffee in with her. Let her sleep it off, we'll book her tomorrow.
N: The two cops who booked her drag her out. As they do, the Sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try and get a look up her very long legs and her very short skirt.
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Three black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO. The Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of the police station.
S: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: The station doors slam open. Marshal's barge in. The HEAD MARSHAL approaches the surprised Sergeant on the desk, flashes his credentials.
C: MARSHAL
D: US Marshal Warren. We have Gennaro Rizzo here on an overnight.
C: SERGEANT
D: Who?
C: MARSHAL
D: Rizzo. The Mafia guy? On the way to testify up in San Francisco tomorrow? They didn't notify you?
C: SERGEANT
D: Hold on a second.
N: He rifles through some papers. Finds one.
C: SERGEANT
D: Here we go. Says here you're not expected until tomorrow.
C: MARSHAL
D: Never expect the expected Sergeant. Secure this place.
E: to his men
S: INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
N: The Marshals come down the cell block, checking everything out. They pass Cat in her cell, passed out cold, her long legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit. After a long look, they move on.
S: INT. SECURE CELL - NIGHT
N: Rizzo is pushed into a cell. The door is slammed and locked.
C: MARSHAL
D: One man here. Two more outside the front door. Everyone else on the perimeter, in teams of two.
N: He hands out thermos bottles.
C: MARSHAL
D: It's a caffeine kinda night fellas. Eyes open.
S: INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
N: A lone cop passes Cat's cell, doing the nightly rounds. As soon as he is gone... ON CAT Cat's eyes snap open. She sits up, moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol. She takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin. She inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door, jiggles it. The door pops open. Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera. She uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.
S: INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
N: One lone cop sits in front of the various monitors. He does not notice that one tilts slightly up, points toward a blank wall.
S: INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
N: Cat, under the camera, unlocks the second door, slips out.
S: INT. HALL - NIGHT
N: Cat comes into the hall where several vending machines lean against the wall. On the far side is a door marked: ELECTRICAL. She is about to head for it, when she hears a door open at the far end of the hall. ANGLE ON THE DOOR At the far end of the hall. A cop comes in, looks down the hall. Where Cat was standing he sees only the vending machines. He heads right for the machines. Puts coins in the machine, waits for his food. ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE MACHINE Where Cat is pressed hard against the flat surface, inches from the cop. The sandwich falls, the cop retrieves it, moves off, exits down the hall. Cat waits until she hears the door shut on the far end of the wall. She crosses quickly to the door across the way, enters. CLOSE ON A UTILITY BOX PULLED OPEN Revealing the electrical control panel for the station. PULL BACK TO
S: INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall. Cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some
T: wire, a cutter, a spring.
N: Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand. When she is finished, she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. She takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has constructed. The device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. She sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell. The water begins to drip a drop at a time. She closes the panel door, sets her digital watch. Hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling, and is gone. CLOSE ON THE JURY RIGGED DEVICE Water dripping into the spoon a drop at a time.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Once inside the grate, Cat takes one of the buttons off her blouse and presses the top of it. The button becomes a pin light, which she clasps between her teeth, starts to crawl on her stomach, pulling herself along by her elbows and her wriggling hips and knees, the light still between her teeth. TRACK WITH CAT As she moves through the maze of ducts. On the way, she peers through the grates in each ceiling, down into one cell after another, catching various views of inmates asleep as she passes over them. Until she comes to a ventilation fan blocking the way. The fan blades go round and round. Cat looks at her watch, looks at the fan. CLOSE ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL And Cat's jury rigged device. The water has almost filled the spoon, one more drop, one more drop. CLOSE ON CAT LOOKING AT HER WATCH The digital counter goes from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1... CLOSE ON The last drop of water drips into the spoon, the spoon tips, tugging on the wire, the wire trips the switch it is connected to, the whole device comes apart, the separate pieces fall to the floor.

C: SERGEANT
D: Go take a look at the breaker on the ventilation system, will ya?
N: Doyle moves off.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow. When they have completely stopped she starts to move herself through the very narrow space between the now stilled blades, feet first.
S: INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Doyle enters the room, opens the electrical panel. The spoon, the weight, the spring, and the wire, fall to the floor. Doyle looks at them curiously for a moment.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Cat is half way through the fan blades.
S: INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Doyle looks at the switches, going down the printed list on the door, trying to locate the right one.

S: INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Doyle finds the switch that corresponds to the ventilation system.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Cat's neck passes through the fan blades. Slow going.
S: INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Doyle hits the switch for the ventilation system.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Cat is just through, when the blades start moving, brush against her forehead, as she makes it to the other side with no time, and no room to spare.
S: INT. AIR DUCTS - NIGHT
N: Cat comes to a vent, looks down, begins to loosen the vent screws.
S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Cat drops down into a bathroom. Looks at her watch. Sits down, waiting.
S: INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT
N: Rizzo is asleep in his cell. The Marshal on duty finishes his coffee. Looks at Rizzo. Then walks over to the door at the end of the wall. He hits a buzzer on the wall.
S: INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The cop manning the bank of monitors, wakes up, sees the Marshal in the monitor.
C: MARSHAL

S: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: The Marshal finishes peeing, zips himself up. Turns. Right into a devastating reverse wheel kick.
S: INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The cop on duty hears a buzz, looks up to the bank of monitors, and sees the Marshal standing at the door. Thinking nothing of it, he hits the buzzer.
S: INT. HALL - NIGHT
N: Cat, propping the unconscious Marshal up, hides behind him. As the door buzzes, she maneuvers the body around, pushes through. On the other side, she drops the body, and takes his gun.
S: INT. SECURITY MONITORING ROOM - NIGHT
N: On the monitor it looks like the Marshal is passing through.
S: INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - NIGHT
N: Rizzo is half asleep, when the barrel of a gun taps him on the head. He opens his eyes slowly to...

S: EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: The cops pour onto the roof, looking around, guns drawn. ANGLE ON CAT ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING Clinging to the wall like a gekko. The dun colored wall blending with her dun colored suit. How is she doing this? CLOSE ON CAT'S SHOES The blades fitted into the seam between the bricks. Her fingertips clinging to the small lip on the bottom of the roof's edge. ABOVE HER The cops look around the roof. ON CAT She holds there listening to the noise above. Hears noise below, looks down to see...
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Cops searching the alley below. ON CAT Hanging to the edge of the building. Listening, watching.
S: EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: The cops, finding nothing, head back out the door. A moment later... CLOSE ON THE ROOF LEDGE Cat's hand reaches up. ON CAT When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and falls below. ON THE COPS BELOW The crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop, he looks down, sees the crumbly gravel, looks up, sees nothing.
S: EXT. ROOF OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Cat is laying on her side, away from them, dead asleep, in the same position she was when the cop first checked on her. The cops pause for a moment, then move on. CLOSE ON CAT Her eyes are wide open. She listens for the outer door closing, and then she breathes out, relieved.

C: MARSHAL
D: OK! That's it. No one in or out! Lock down!
N: Cat just keeps walking, right past Ross, who heads into the station as the cops try to keep the reporters at bay. ANGLE ON CAT Walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind. As it recedes over her shoulder, she picks at her fingers where the fingerprinting ink has stained them. Her prints come off! She drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps walking.
S: INT. PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - MORNING
N: Ross scrutinizes Rizzo's cell as his team takes prints, photos, sweeps the cell for evidence.

S: INT. BUS STATION - DAY
N: Cat dressed in jeans, a scuffed leather jacket, a baseball cap, with the brim pulled low over her eyes, with her pony tail sticking out of the back, the knap sack on her shoulder, waits on line to board the bus.

N: Ross is pointing up at the camera Cat tilted.
C: ROSS
D: He tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard, not who was holding him.
N: He turns to his team.
C: ROSS
D: Twenty two murders in four years all with the same M.O. The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us.
N: AGENT 1 But we're the only ones with the information.
C: ROSS
D: And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we?
N: No one on the team can dispute this. It occurs to Ross...
C: ROSS
D: If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's see if anything comes back.
S: EXT. UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL NEW ORLEANS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
N: A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who wave him through.
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: The car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD, in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand. As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows them. They nod back. Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is waiting, he looks down at the paper. The door opens.
C: MARCO
D: Mr. Richard...
N: Richard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco.
C: MARCO
D: Been a long time.
C: RICHARD
D: Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?

C: MARCO
D: Only hurts when it's humid.

D: Should've let us relocate you to Arizona instead of New Orleans.

D: I brought you the morning paper.
N: He holds the paper up. CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF DEAD RIZZO ON THE FRONT PAGE.
C: DON LUIS
D: I've seen it.
C: RICHARD
D: And...?
C: DON LUIS
D: Coincidence.
C: RICHARD
D: Coincidence? Twenty two times? A flower that only grows in one place on earth? That used to be the calling card of...what was his name? Your former partner? The one who did your wet work?
C: DON LUIS
D: Fabio. Fabio Maria Restrepo. But I don't understand? Why come here with this?
C: RICHARD
D: Because when we find the end of a string we like to know where it begins.
C: DON LUIS
D: String? Now we are talking about string? I'm not a tailor.
C: RICHARD
D: Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase here, OK? When the Agency extracted your ass from Colombia fifteen years ago, and set you up here, we let you resume your business when what we should have done was lock you up for life. In exchange, you were supposed to keep the information flowing.
C: DON LUIS
D: And I have.
C: RICHARD
D: Not much, and not for a very long time.
C: DON LUIS
D: And this is what you traveled all the way down here to tell me?
C: RICHARD
D: No. What I traveled all the way down here to tell you, is there's a limit to our patience. The CIA is not an amusement park. There are no free rides. Everyone pays their way. And you, my friend, have not.
C: DON LUIS
D: OK OK. What would you want?
N: He slaps the newspaper down with the picture of Rizzo.
C: DON LUIS
D: I had nothing to do with this. I swear.
C: RICHARD
D: Then find out who does.
N: As he goes to leave.
C: RICHARD
D: And Don Luis, don't play the innocent with us. It won't sit well with my bosses if we find out you had anything to do with this. Have a good day.
N: Richard exits.

C: DON LUIS
D: Idiot! I told you. Everyone dead. Down to the dog.
E: MORE
C: DON LUIS
D: You screwed up the first time. Now go fix it. Find her. Before she finds us.
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: CLOSE ON A BUS DOOR OPENS Cat steps off the bus. Looks around to...
S: EXT. CHICAGO BUS STATION - DAY
N: The total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan bus terminal holds. She sees a surveillance camera tucked in a corner. She pulls the brim of her hat low over her eyes, takes off into the crowd.
S: EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY
N: Cat comes to a non descript high rise. She enters.
S: INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is nothing that identifies the person who lives here. White bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. Along one wall, a cabinet. On the window sill a single Cataleya orchid. Cat waters the orchid. Cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. Two of them are divided into quarters and show various views of the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the elevator, the hallway. The third screen is dark, until Cat hits a button and music fills the apartment. Music with a heavy sensual back beat. French Rap. Ooh la la. And the screen pulses and glows in time to the beat. Cat's body responds to the music, moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.
T: IN CUTS
N: Cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain, she is completely nude. She enters the shower. Turns on the water. Like a snake shedding a skin, she lets the water divest her of everything that came before.
C: ROSS V.O.
D: Since each and every one of the victims was a professional bad apple...
N: CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF RIZZO BEING PINNED TO A WALL

C: ROSS
D: Rizzo here...
N: He points to Rizzo on the wall.
C: ROSS
D: The most recent, was done to keep him from talking. Alexa Milshinova...
N: Points to a gorgeous dead woman with the word GRIFTER on her stomach.
C: ROSS
D: ...made a career of getting intimate with big stakes gamblers out of Vegas and then taking them off and sending them to meet their maker. D'Angelo James...
N: Points to a huge black man with USURPER written in white letters across his chest.
C: ROSS
D: ...tried to take over the heroin trade in Houston from...
N: He points to two Mexicans, identical twins, one with PAY written on his chest, the other with the word BACK...
C: ROSS
D: The Gemini cartel. Their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing...
N: He holds up a stack of folders from his desk.
C: ROSS
D: We have one. As we go to the video tape.
N: He hits a button and the video replay of Cat walking the unconscious guard through the door.
C: ROSS
D: We can't see the assassin, but we can see...
N: He freezes the tape. Points to the time mark on the tape.
C: ROSS
D: The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you.
N: He begins to hand the folders out.
C: ROSS
D: These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him. Before he kills again.

C: CAT
D: I've got nowhere to go.

D: It's just...
C: CAT
D: Just what?
N: She keeps kissing him, lightly on the neck...

E: BEAT
C: DANNY
D: I know. I'm just saying...
N: He fumbles for the words.
C: DANNY
D: Wouldn't you like to go to dinner sometime?
N: She keeps nibbling.
C: CAT
D: Uh-uh. This taste good enough.
C: DANNY
D: Or a movie?
N: Licking him.
C: CAT
D: No. They put me to sleep.
C: DANNY
D: So let's pop in a DVD and you can spend the night here?

C: CAT
D: Would you like the key back?
C: DANNY
D: No. I just want to get...I don't know...
C: CAT
D: Closer?
N: She resumes nibbling on his neck.
C: DANNY
D: Yes. Closer.
N: She runs her nails down his chest, slowly, teasing. Her hand finds his groin. What she finds makes her smile.
C: CAT
D: Is this close enough?
C: DANNY
D: ...Yes.
E: SMILES
N: She gently lowers his hands to his sides, holds them there. Kisses him deeply. Pushes him down onto the floor. And lowers herself on top of him. A small moan escapes his lips as she takes him inside her.
T: FADE TO
S: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAWN
N: Danny wakes. His face holds the smile of the memory of the night before. He turns his head, lazily. The pillow beside him is empty.

S: INT. LAUNDROMAT - MORNING
N: Emilio loads laundry from the shopping bag into a machine, puts in the coins, then sits down on a bench to watch the cycle. Seems to talk to himself.
C: EMILIO
D: Safe?
N: And then we see he is talking to...
C: CAT
D: On my end. You?
C: EMILIO
D: Safe.
C: CAT
D: What do we have?
N: Emilio takes a manila envelope out of the bag. Places it on the seat next to him. Cat picks it up, looks through it.
C: EMILIO
D: You remember the guy who was in the news for running that Ponzi scheme about a year ago?
N: CLOSE ON A MAGAZINE PULLED FROM THE ENVELOPE The cover features WILLIAM WOOGARD, 45, the most unassuming, baldheaded, pudgy faced man, a nerd. Under the headline: PREDATOR.
C: EMILIO
D: He disappeared fifty billion dollars. The money was never recovered. Skipped out and bought himself citizenship on some shit hole of a Caribbean island that calls itself a country with no extradition laws. Lot of very pissed off people lost everything.
N: Cat goes to get up.
C: EMILIO
D: There's something else.
N: He slaps the newspaper down with Rizzo's picture on the front page.
C: EMILIO
D: How long has this been going on?
C: CAT
D: Not long.
E: BLUFFING
C: EMILIO
D: The paper says twenty two. All like this. Tell me why.
C: CAT
D: No reason.
C: EMILIO
D: Since you're a kid, you don't do anything for no reason. Don't play dumb, it insults me.
C: CAT
D: I've got to get ready.
N: As she goes to rise, Emilio grabs her hand.
C: EMILIO
D: It's not just you in this. It's me, Mama.
C: CAT
D: Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees...
C: EMILIO
D: I watch your ass. Each and every job, I vet, I double vet. For every one I book you, I turn down five, ten. I promised to keep you safe. I KEEP YOU SAFE. Cataleya. It's a full time job, no matter what you think. Those pictures...they freaked me out. OK? I didn't realize...
C: CAT
D: I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind. I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever.
E: BEAT
C: EMILIO
D: Sure. Of course. But the way you're playing it. They even have a name for you. The Tag killer. I would have stopped it a long time ago. Had I known about this.
C: CAT
D: Why?
C: EMILIO
D: Because I love you.
N: Cat smiles. A smile that could melt ice in winter. But a knowing smile. A 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter' smile.
C: CAT
D: If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place.
N: The truth of her words deprive him of his. She kisses him him on the forehead.
C: CAT
D: I love you too.

N: OVER THE SOUND OF CHIMES...
S: EXT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY
N: A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal. And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying on their sides, asleep. The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to life, fangs bared, ready to kill. And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming into their domain. REVERSE ON CAT Holding two very full shopping bags.
C: CAT
D: Hi guys.
N: And the dogs jump all over her, licking her.
C: CAT
D: Hey! Hey!
N: She pets them, plays with them.
C: CAT
D: OK. OK. Now sit.
N: The dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly. Not making a sound.
C: CAT
D: Now let's see what good boys you can be.
N: She reaches into one of the shopping bags, pulls out two roasts!
C: CAT
D: Top cut sirloin.
N: Which she puts down on the ground. The dog's eyes go to the chunks of meat.
C: CAT
D: Nice, huh?
N: The dogs can barely contain themselves.
C: CAT
D: Red, juicy, delicious.
N: The dogs whimper in anticipation.
C: CAT
D: Stay.
N: She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes going from the meat to Cat. Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at her.
C: CAT
D: Good boys. Eat.
E: BEAT
N: The dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the sight, enters the warehouse.
S: INT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY
N: The warehouse, is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal, the cannibalized carcasses of cars, trucks, shipping containers, welding equipment, hammers tongs, all sorts of tools. In the corner is one fully built truck, a big red monster with huge demolition fenders. This is home to OLD PEPE, an ancient, blind man, who is working away, building yet another set of oversized chimes out of scrap metal.

D: Anyone else? The barking would only have stopped when their screaming began. You spoil them.
C: CAT
D: I train them.
C: PEPE
D: If that's what you want to call it.
N: Cat kisses Pepe, taps one of the chimes, it makes the most ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other. She opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area, and starts unpacking the groceries.
C: PEPE
D: Did you get the beans I like?
C: CAT
D: Of course.
C: PEPE
D: And the salsa Verde?
C: CAT
D: And the salsa Verde.
C: PEPE
D: Not the one in the short bottle.
C: CAT
D: The long one.
C: PEPE
D: I hate that other one, the chili they use sucks. Did you see your uncle?
C: CAT
D: Of course.
N: She moves from the kitchen, walks across to the far wall.
C: PEPE
D: We're going to church for Easter.
C: CAT
D: As always.
C: PEPE
D: And you?
C: CAT
D: Not this year.
N: Until she reaches a big discarded safe, taller than her, with an impregnable door.
C: PEPE
D: As always. You should, you know.
C: CAT
D: I should do a lot of things.
N: She turns the combination knob.
C: PEPE
D: You could start with that one. It would make us very happy.
C: CAT
D: Maybe next year.
N: The door opens, reveals shelves with dozens of passports, stacks of cash.
C: PEPE
D: Cataleya. No one knows what happens tomorrow, next year is a long time away. How was your trip?
N: Cat starts to remove some of the cash. Starts to count it. Stick it in her pocket.
C: CAT
D: Rewarding.
N: She takes a passport out.
C: PEPE
D: Passport?
C: CAT
D: Your ears are better than my eyes.
C: PEPE
D: You work too much. I keep telling that to Emilio. The girl should have a life while she is still young enough to enjoy it. You should take a vacation. Go some place warm. With a nice beach.
C: CAT
D: Good idea.
N: She slams the big safe door shut.
S: EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - DAY
N: From the air, surrounded by the bluest of waters. Bestowed with the greenest of verdant foliage. Surrounded by exquisite beaches. A spray of water fills the screen. Comes from... THREE OF THE HOTTEST NYMPHETTES IN THE SMALLEST BIKINIS SPLASHING AROUND A SWIMMING POOL HAVING THE BEST TIME SPLASHING WATER AT WILLIAM WOOGARD, AS HE CHASES AFTER THEM...
C: WILLIAM
D: GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!
N: PULL BACK TO
S: EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
N: An exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall. As the girls clamber out of the pool, ignoring the four armed body guards patrolling poolside, they are met by three maids holding robes for them to slip into.
C: WILLIAM
D: Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
E: SMILING
N: The robes disappear.
C: WILLIAM
D: That's better.
C: GIRL
D: Willie you are such a perv.
C: WILLIAM
D: I know. Anyone hungry?
C: GIRL
D: Always!
N: As William slips into a robe held open for him, he grabs the asses of two of the girls...
C: WILLIAM
D: Lunch is served.
N: Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
C: SERVANT
D: For you sir.
N: Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it, and his perplexed look goes to one of concern. CLOSE ON THE NOTE It says. SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL. A FRIEND.
C: WILLIAM
D: Where did this come from?
C: SERVANT
D: It was in the post box this morning.
N: William cannot fathom what this is all about. But he does not like it.
S: EXT. CARIBBEAN ISLAND - SUNSET
N: Over hot dance hall music, the sun sets magnificently into the shimmering sea...
S: INT. VILLA - EVENING
N: The music blasts throughout the villa. Sexy, hot. There are several bodyguards stationed all around.
S: INT. SALON - EVENING
N: Two of the girls dance erotically for William, who reclines on an oversized couch, smoking from a hookah. ANGLE ON The third girl is out in the foyer, laying on the glass floor, which is the top of a large aquarium, where dozens of sharks swim back and forth.
C: GIRL
D: Here fishy fishy!
N: She taps on the floor, the sharks ignore her.
C: GIRL
D: Willie! They're ignoring me!
E: POUTY
N: William comes over.
C: WILLIAM
D: Put a drop of blood in there and they'll be your biggest admirers. All the way down to your stripped clean bones. And speaking of stripped...
N: He lifts her up like a piece of luggage. As she squeals with delight...
C: WILLIAM
D: Bedtime!
N: The other girls come running. The party moves up the winding staircase. The bodyguards look at each other, roll their eyes.
S: INT. VILLA - NIGHT
N: William is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite, the girls are on the bed in the BG jumping around, in the skimpiest bra and panty sets, having a pillow fight.
C: WILLIAM
D: Bring extra security in for the night.
E: to head of security
C: HEAD SECURITY
D: Yes sir.
C: WILLIAM
D: And make sure we're shut down tight.
C: HEAD SECURITY
D: Yes sir. Have a good night, sir.
C: WILLIAM
D: I intend to.
N: The doors close, and lock. Wild shrieks come from inside.
S: EXT. VILLA - EVENING
N: A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men exit.
C: HEAD SECURITY
D: There are already guys in the garden and guys out back. I want you three upstairs, two on the roof. You three downstairs. Follow me.
N: As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
T: QUICK TIME CUTS
N: Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in the garden outside.
S: INT. VILLA - NIGHT
N: The Head of Security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure. His men are posted outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the salon. He closes lights as he goes. He walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. And he exits, closing the door behind him, turning the lock. CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM The sharks gliding back and forth. And then, a figure in a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back, comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass floor, takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels that makes up the floor. The diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet suit. It is Cat. Cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol. CLOSE ON THE BEDROOM DOORS OPENING Cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed where William is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls. Empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about. Cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at William. One of the girls rolls over onto William, ruining her shot. She hesitates. CLOSE ON WILLIAM'S FACE As sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. No one is in the room. He looks around, and notices the bedroom door ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror, opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya orchid. Panic starts to set in.
C: WILLIAM
D: Hello?
N: No answer. William tip toes to the ajar door. He peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood leaked out across the white marble floor. Really panicked, he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his breath coming in gasps.
S: INT. VILLA - NIGHT
N: William, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead guards. Growing more and more nervous by the moment, he tries a light switch on the wall, nothing. The only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below. He reaches the bottom of the stairs.
C: WILLIAM
D: Anybody?
N: No answer. He crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is right in the middle...
C: CAT
D: Stop right there.
N: Cat comes out of the dark. In her hand, a silencer fitted pistol.
C: WILLIAM
D: Who are you?
C: CAT
D: Doesn't matter who I am.
N: He pulls the trigger on his gun. Click, click, click. He tries the other one. Again click click click.
C: WILLIAM
D: What do you want?
C: CAT
D: I want you exactly where you are.
N: And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his knees.
C: WILLIAM
D: ARRRGGGHHHH!
N: He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto the glass. The sharks swim back and forth.
C: WILLIAM
D: Whatever they paid you, I'll double it!
C: CAT
D: You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.
C: WILLIAM
D: Please. I'll give you anything you want. Don't kill me!
C: CAT
D: I'm not going to kill you. They are.
E: BEAT
N: She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water. Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns and walks toward the door.
C: WILLIAM
D: Please! Please!
N: He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits. And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And hit.
C: WILLIAM
D: Please! Help! Help!
N: He is violently dragged under. CLOSE ON The front page of a newspaper with a picture of the remains of William under the headline: SHARKS EAT SHARK. The newspaper drops to reveal Richard at his desk.
S: INT. CIA OFFICE - DAY
C: RICHARD
D: I can't believe this.
N: He drops the paper, is about to leave his office when the phone on his desk rings. He answers.
C: RICHARD
D: Yes?
C: VOICE
D: Mr. Steven Richard?
C: RICHARD
D: Who is this?
N: CLOSE ON

D: FBI special agent Jack Ross. I'm lead agent on a case. A serial killer we call the tag killer.

C: ROSS
D: Marks his victims with a flower. From Colombia. A Cataleya orchid.
E: MORE
C: ROSS
D: When I try to access information, I get stuck with a CIA Access denied folder. I understand you were the station chief down there when this rash of murders with the same MO...
E: CONT'D
C: RICHARD
D: Listen, Agent Ross, we don't give out any type of information over the phone. So what I suggest is you file a formal request with the agency for any information you might want. And I'll be more than happy to get back to you as soon as I can.
N: He hangs up. Seething. ON ROSS Looking at his phone and the dial tone emittting from the handset.
C: ROSS
D: Thank you.
S: EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY
N: A plane lands.
S: INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY
N: People disembark. We think Cat is getting off the plane. It is Marco and two of his thugs. As he is crossing the terminal, he passes a newspaper machine. The headline of the paper in the window catches his eye: SHARKS EAT SHARK. As he stares at the picture of the dead William, his phone rings.
C: MARCO
D: Bueno?
S: INT. CAR - DAY
N: A pissed off Richard is on the phone.
C: RICHARD
D: No more bullshitting me Marco. I've got the FBI on my ass now. I want that problem taken care of. Yesterday. Do you hear me?
C: MARCO
D: Loud and clear.
N: The newspaper picture of William being pinned to a board. PULL BACK TO
S: INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY
N: Ross turns from pinning up the picture alongside the other twenty two, to his team.
C: ROSS
D: Where are we?
N: AGENT 1 We ID'd everyone who came in and out of the police station for the twenty four hours preceding the incident. The only one that we could not verify was a... He reads. AGENT 1 Valarie Phillips. Picked up for drunk driving four hours before the hit on Rizzo.
C: ROSS
D: A woman? Are you sure?
E: STUNNED
N: AGENT 1 It's our only lead.
C: ROSS
D: Let's see her booking report.
N: AGENT 2 (HESITANT) Well, there was a little problem. Seems she was too drunk to get a photo.
C: ROSS
D: But not to get prints.
N: AGENT 1 We ran the prints in the data base. No match was found.
C: ROSS
D: Lovely. So if there is no booking record, how did we get the name?
N: AGENT 1 A library card. The only ID she had was a library card.
C: ROSS
D: I don't believe this.
N: AGENT 1 There are the surveillance tapes. AGENT 2 From three angles.
C: ROSS
D: Well, let's see them.
E: HOPEFUL
N: The two agents look at each other, even more chagrined. One of them pushes a button on the computer. And the three angles come up. One has a shot of Cat's face covered by her hair, one has a shot of her face covered by her hand, and the third one has an angle of her nose.
C: ROSS
D: That's it?
N: AGENT 1 That's it. Ross sighs.
C: ROSS
D: It's not a lot to go on. But put them in the data base and let's see what matches.
N: The agents exit. Ross looks at the pictures on the board.
C: ROSS
D: ...a woman.
N: Cannot believe it.
S: EXT. MIAMI - LITTLE COLOMBIA - DAY
N: Marco and his thugs enter a small social club/bar.
S: INT. SOCIAL CLUB - DAY
N: A dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able and lining the bar are par for the course. EDUARDO, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to shoot. He looks up to...
C: MARCO
D: Hello Eduardo, que pasa?
C: EDUARDO
D: I have fifty bucks on this shot. That's what's que pasa.
C: MARCO
D: Hey sorry. Come on.
E: SMILING
N: He opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. As they break marco takes a roll of cash out.
C: MARCO
D: Here. For you.
N: He goes to hand it to Eduardo.
C: EDUARDO
D: For what?
C: MARCO
D: First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer?
C: EDUARDO
D: It's a long time. My memory...
C: MARCO
D: You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio?
C: EDUARDO
D: Like I said...my memory...
N: Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.
C: MARCO
D: I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it.
N: Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's shirt pocket.
C: EDUARDO
D: Look Marco. I gotta be honest with you. Everyone knows you guys were playing a double game, and when the shit went down, you were the only ones who got out of it clean.
N: The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and conspicuous at the same time.
C: MARCO
D: So you do have a memory.
C: EDUARDO
D: Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck out, and let me take my shot.
C: MARCO
D: OK...
N: Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball. At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun, and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of Marco's thugs. In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco, one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that blood has soiled his white shirt.
C: MARCO
D: Fuck...
N: Pissed, Marco yanks Eduardo up from the floor and slams him onto the pool table. Sticks his gun in his face.
C: MARCO
D: You don't tell me what I want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. One...two...
N: A buzzer sounds...
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

S: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Danny enters to a candle lit room and...
C: CAT
D: I brought you something.
N: She is in a very sexy lingerie top. Her hands are behind her back.
C: DANNY
D: That's real progress. Let's see.
N: She takes her hands out from behind her back, presents him with a cute little stuffed alligator.
C: DANNY
D: Wow! Just what I always wanted.
C: CAT
D: You're making fun.
C: DANNY
D: No. No. I mean, a gift from you. Something to show me you're thinking of me as more than your boy toy.
C: CAT
D: Well, there's that too.
N: She starts to peel off the lingerie.
C: DANNY
D: Wait.
N: She stops.
C: CAT
D: You don't want me?
C: DANNY
D: Of course I do. But can't we talk a little first?
C: CAT
D: What would you like to talk about?
C: DANNY
D: Oh, I don't know. Nothing. Anything.
C: CAT
D: You really want to do this?
C: DANNY
D: Yes, I do.
C: CAT
D: OK.

D: Where have you been?
C: CAT
D: On vacation.
C: DANNY
D: Really? Where?
C: CAT
D: Down south.
C: DANNY
D: Where there are alligators?
N: He wiggles the toy.
C: CAT
D: There was that one.
C: DANNY
D: Was it nice?
C: CAT
D: It was OK.
C: DANNY
D: What did you do?
C: CAT
D: Nothing much. A little swimming, fed the fish.
C: DANNY
D: OK. Now you.
C: CAT
D: Now me what?
C: DANNY
D: Conversation. It goes two ways.
C: CAT
D: OK. Want to fuck?
N: Danny starts to laugh. Cat, caught in the moment, begins to laugh as well.
C: DANNY
D: OK. OK. I get it. You want to protect yourself. I understand. But I'm...I don't just want to be here for the sex. I know a lot of guys would think this is perfect. She comes over, we fuck like mad. She leaves. But I need a little more.
N: She keeps staring, waiting.
C: CAT
D: Like what?
C: DANNY
D: Like...uh...some trust maybe.
C: CAT
D: That's a hard one for me.
C: DANNY
D: I got that. I'm not in a hurry. And just so you know. The past? If it's too painful right now?
E: MORE
C: DANNY
D: If you can't talk about? That's OK. But, you know, if someone hurt you before...like a broken heart or something. I'm not responsible for that. I just want want to be here for you. To know a little about what's inside. What you feel. Just a little.
E: CONT'D
N: Cat hesitates, standing there half dressed, feelings that she never wants to deal with coming to the surface.
C: CAT
D: I'm lonely sometimes.
N: She stops.
C: DANNY
D: ...And?
C: CAT
D: Isn't that enough?
C: DANNY
D: It's a good start.
N: He smiles, puts the stuffed animal aside.
C: DANNY
D: Now we can have sex.
N: Cat smiles, caught a bit off guard by his sweetness. He approaches her, she goes to touch him. He puts her hands down, gently.
C: DANNY
D: Let me this time.
N: And for the first time, she lets him touch her first. Let's him kiss her lips, her neck, and as he goes south, kissing as he goes, the CAMERA holds on her face, and for the first time she allows herself to receive, to give herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer. And she likes it.
T: FADE TO BLACK
S: EXT. CHICAGO - SUNRISE
N: The city wakes. CLOSE ON DANNY Waking. Turning over, expecting to find no one there. Surprise this time. Because there is someone there, sleeping peacefully, her face, half covered by her hair, bathed in the soft light of dawn... Cat. Danny smiles, so pleased.
S: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Danny puts the finishing touches on a breakfast tray. He looks at the stuffed animal she brought him. It warms his heart.
S: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Danny stands with the breakfast tray, looking at Cat sleeping. He cannot quite believe it. He puts the tray down, takes his iPhone, points it at her, goes to take a picture. REVERSE ON CAT She wakes with a start. To find Danny standing there with a breakfast tray, and a big smile on his face.
C: DANNY
D: Morning.
N: Cat is disoriented.

D: I shouldn't have done this.
N: Pulls on her jeans.
C: DANNY
D: Done what?
C: CAT
D: Any of it.

D: Why?
C: CAT
D: Because.
C: DANNY

D: We already talked. I'm late.
N: Slips into her shoes. Does not answer.
C: DANNY
D: I made breakfast.

D: Now you know something else about me.
N: And with a small smile, she is gone.
S: INT. HALL - MORNING
N: Outside Danny's door, Cat crosses to the elevator, waits for it to come. As she does, she fixes her clothes a bit, her eyes on Danny's door.
C: CAT
D: Don't come out. Please. Don't.

N: The door doesn't open. The elevator arrives. She takes a deep breath, enters. The door closes.
S: EXT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY
N: Cat comes running in.
S: INT. PAINT SUPPLY STORE - DAY
N: Cat hurries down the aisle, keeping an eye on the security camera. Making sure she stays on the far side, out of it's range. She stops in the middle of the aisle, starts to examine paint brushes.
C: CAT
D: Sorry I'm late.
N: ANGLE ON EMILIO Standing next to her, looking at a color chart, hidden from the security camera, as is she. He is pissed. He has the newspaper with Woogard's picture. He throws the paper in her face. Cat is taken aback by a display of anger she has never seen in this man before.
C: EMILIO
D: You said you would stop the writing!
N: Then he shoves an article cut from a paper in her face.
C: EMILIO
D: Read this!
N: As she starts...
C: EMILIO
D: Seven people slaughtered in a Miami bar. I knew one of them. Years ago, in school.
C: CAT
D: So what?
C: EMILIO
D: I don't like it. This is getting too close.
C: CAT
D: Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there.
C: EMILIO
D: And you are so blinded by your need for revenge that you are not seeing things that are. The handwriting is on the wall Cara. Let me read it to you. This is over. I will no longer accept jobs. I will no longer solicit jobs. You are retired.
C: CAT
D: How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge?
C: EMILIO
D: Cara. It's time to get a life, before you run out of time. Here.
E: CALM
N: He hands her an envelope.
C: EMILIO
D: Maybe this will help you understand what I am telling you.
N: Emilio leaves first this time. Cat just stands there, her world rocked. She opens the envelope, takes out a photograph, looks at it. CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF CAT WITH HER PARENTS Dressed for her first Communion. Everyone is smiling. She is holding a Cataleya orchid bouquet. ON CAT Her eyes well up. She can't hold it anymore.

D: Dude, you're in love.
C: DANNY
D: You're so smart.
C: RYAN
D: Seriously. This comes from the heart. OK? You're nuts. The girl comes over, strips down, rocks your world, gets dressed, asks for nothing. Leaves. The only thing she doesn't do is bring the pizza and beer. You are living my dream. And you want to go and fuck it up with love?
E: BEAT BEAT
C: DANNY
D: I knew you were the perfect guy to talk about this with.

C: RYAN
D: Whoa...total babe-age! When do I meet the future Mrs. Delaney?

C: SHARI
D: You know, if you weren't my brother's best friend...
C: RYAN
D: You're doing it for love Shari. Not for me. When they walk down the aisle, you can say you were the one made it happen.
C: DANNY
D: Maybe I shouldn't...
C: SHARI
D: Up to you Danny. I do it all the time. Photo goes in here. Bangs around the National Data base looking for a match. Bingo. Address, phone number, shoe size, dress size, rap sheet, anything you want to know. It's really no big deal.
C: DANNY
D: I just feel like, maybe, I'm invading her privacy or something.

D: Yes or no?
N: Danny can't answer.
C: RYAN
D: Of course yes.
N: He hits the button. Cat's picture appears on the screen with the message: BEGIN DOWNLOAD. CLOSE ON THE PROCESS Cat's picture gets turned into millions of pixels, which start combining and recombining into faces that look like her, don't look like her, looking for a match.

N: Ross is staring at his Cataleya orchid, looking over his reports, frustrated, when his computer screen lights up the the following message: DATA MATCH 62% And alongside the half assed pictures of Cat from the security tapes in the police station, the picture from Danny's iPhone starts to form. Ross picks up the phone.
C: ROSS
D: I want a trace put on an incoming transmission!
E: EXCITED
N: Ross continues watching his screen: DATA MATCH PROBABILITY 68%. A map comes up on his screen immediately. A grid map of the city with a focus finder bringing the search area closer and closer. Until the area is identified: One Police Plaza. OVER THE INTONATIONS OF A CHOIR SINGING EASTER MASS...
S: INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY
N: Emilio, Mama and Pepe are sitting in a pew during Easter mass. Someone comes up from behind, sits down next to them. They turn to Cat. Who smiles, like a child. Emilio smiles back. Mama takes Cat's hand, kisses it. They all sit and listen to the Mass, like all the other families around them.

S: INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Cat sits by the living room window. Takes the last drop of the drink. As she looks out on the night sky, she lights a cigarette. Feeling so alone. She takes one drag on the cigarette, stubs it out. She takes the picture of herself and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. A tear forms. Her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. For the first time, she seems a bit lost.
S: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Danny sits by his window, also feeling a bit lost, and also, so lonely. He stares at the picture of Cat on his phone. When the phone rings.

C: CAT
D: What picture Danny???
E: TIGHT
C: DANNY
D: I took a picture of you while you were sleeping. With my phone.

E: HARD
C: DANNY
D: Shari, that's Ryan's sister...she works at Police headquarters...
N: And now Cat knows everything.
C: DANNY
D: I just wanted to be...
N: On her surveillance screens, Cat sees FBI SWAT pulling up to the building.
C: CAT
D: Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny.
N: Cat hangs up, rushes into the bathroom, turns the shower on full blast. Hurrying out, on her screens, she sees the SWAT swarming into the building. Cat opens a cabinet. On the back of the door are a dozen keys. She chooses one. She checks the screens one more time, sees the SWAT rushing the stairs, the elevators. She turns off her screens.

S: INT. EMILIO'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Cat walks through the house like it could be a trap, a silencer in her hand. Her senses are keening, she is that alert. And then she finds the first body. Mama. Dead. A bullet in her head. Cat has all she can do to keep it together. Then she finds Pepe, a bullet in his head. It is almost too much for her to bear. And then she finds Emilio, tied to a chair, tortured. To death. This IS too much for her to bear. Cat cuts Emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently takes HIM in her arms. And begins to cry.

C: CAT
D: This won't take long. Hands up.
N: Ross raises his hands. Cat reaches around, removes his gun.
C: CAT
D: Turn around.
N: Ross faces her.
C: CAT
D: Sit.
N: She motions him into the chair behind him.
C: ROSS
D: Just so you know, all this? Being so smart? Covering all your bases? It's not going to matter. It's already over. The whole place is wired with web cams.
N: His moment of triumph is short lived. Cat reaches on the side of the counter. Holds up six web cams, wires ripped out.
C: CAT
D: You mean these?
N: Tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.
C: CAT
D: Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.
N: Ross looks under the chair. Sure enough, there are several wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. He looks further to the where the wires attach to a small charge. She puts her gun down on the table.
C: CAT
D: I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.
N: Ross does not move.
C: CAT
D: This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you.
C: ROSS
D: So what happened?
C: CAT
D: He did.
N: She takes out an old picture of Don Luis, lifted from the internet. She takes out the picture of her parents and her as an eight year old.

E: MORE
C: CAT
D: The next day they were dead. He killed them.
E: CONT'D

C: ROSS
D: And you figured sooner or later we would make this public.
C: CAT
D: It took you a long time.
C: ROSS
D: You're very patient.
C: CAT
D: What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them.

C: ROSS
D: You sent him a message. He sent you one back.
C: CAT
D: And now I want to finish it.
C: ROSS
D: I can't help you.
C: CAT
D: Yes you can. He's protected by your government.
C: ROSS
D: By a part of the government I have no way of reaching. It's CIA. I don't know why. But there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, I've tried.
C: CAT
D: You're going to have to try harder.
N: She takes a photo album out, opens it.
C: CAT
D: I found this on your table inside. Your family, right?
N: Begins to flip pages.
C: CAT
D: Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice.
N: Ross knows what is coming.
C: CAT
D: I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years.
N: She places the photo album in his lap. Puts his food in the microwave, starts it. Goes to exit.
C: ROSS
D: Wait...
N: She stops.
C: ROSS
D: What about...?
N: He points to the chair.
C: CAT
D: When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work.
N: And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave. When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair, tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat, waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he breathes a sigh of relief.

E: CONT'D
N: Ross points to Richard's chest where a red laser beam holds on his heart.
C: ROSS
D: Bright red.
C: RICHARD
D: What does she think this is? Amateur hour? Tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a fifty seven millimeter ordinance.
N: All of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying a picture of Richard standing with the President hanging on the wall just behind his head. The red dot is back on Richard in a heartbeat.
C: ROSS
D: She says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. And you have ten seconds to give her the address.
N: Richard starts to come unglued.
C: RICHARD
D: How can I be sure once she has the address she won't kill me anyway?
C: ROSS
D: You can't. But I can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. Trust me on this one.
N: After an interminable moment...
C: RICHARD
D: Eight seven six Magnolia Terrace... New Orleans.
N: There is a long pause on the other end of the phone.
C: ROSS
D: She asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential.
C: RICHARD
D: With pleasure.
E: SWEATING
N: A moment later, the red dot disappears from Richard's chest. Richard breathes out. Ross reaches out, shakes richard's limp hand.
C: ROSS
D: Thank you. Because honestly I didn't know how I was going to explain you splattered all over your walls.
N: Ross exits. Richard looks at the shattered picture. The President's head is intact. The bullet has ripped Richard's face clean off. CLOSE ON A BIG STEEL DOOR OPENING REVEALING An ARMORY OF WEAPONS FROM PISTOLS TO RPG's. PULL BACK TO

N: ON DON LUIS as he sips his cognac. He sees a big red truck approaching in the distance up the road. As he watches, squinting, curious, the truck does an abrupt U turn. Marco drones on in the background...
C: MARCO
D: We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it.
N: ...Don Luis watches, as a woman gets out of the truck. He cannot make out who it is, what with the fog and his vision...
C: DON LUIS
D: Marco?
N: He sees the woman open the rear door of the truck, and pull something out. He takes his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on. Just in time to see... CAT SHOULDERING A LAWS SHOULDER ROCKET!!!

They all leap out of the way, just as the rocket comes crashing through the bay window. And blows the salon to smithereens. Cat reenters the truck, drives off fast. As the debris falls, and the dust and smoke rises, Marco helps Don Luis up. He is a little stunned. Through the gaping hole where the bay window was, they see the red truck driving off.
C: MARCO

ON THE THUG He drops like dead lead, the two knives embedded in his back. ANGLE ON MARCO WITH DON LUIS Inside the house, seeing Cat through a window. ANGLE ON CAT Looking back at him. Pointing a finger at him. Before she disappears in to the drifting mists. ANGLE ON
C: MARCO
D: Don Luis! You hide here.
N: He opens a secret door in the wall, revealing a small space. Barely big enough for a man.
C: MARCO
D: Wait for my call. Either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. Take the van. The armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it.

S: INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Marco and the men are walking through the mansion, guns at the ready, when they come to a long stretch of hallway. Marco signals them to stop. He listens carefully. Signals for one of the men to move down the hall. As Marco and the other men wait, the first thug makes his way down the hall, looking left and right, opening doors... ANGLE ON UNDER THE FLOOR FROM THE CAMERA'S POV As the man walks along above, the floor creaks, dust drops down in a fine cloud. As the man progresses, and the dust gets closer and closer... ANGLE ON THE THUG ABOVE Turns to Marco to signal everything is OK. Just as he signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets. The man dances like a puppet on a string, before falling to the floor, dead. Marco takes a grenade out, flings it.
C: MARCO
D: Down!
N: Marco and the thugs dive for cover. BAARROOM! The grenade blows a big hole in the floor. As soon as the smoke and the debris stop falling...
C: MARCO
D: Go!
N: The thugs hesitate. Marco points his gun at them.
C: MARCO
D: Now!
N: Hesitant, the thugs approach the hole. Pointing their weapons, they unload a barrage of bullets. Then stop. Nothing moves. One of them peers over the side. BANG! A single shot pieces his eye.

D: Outside!

N: He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope. Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
C: MARCO
D: I think we got her.
E: WHISPERS
S: INT. CLOSET - DAY
N: Don Luis lets out a sigh of relief.
C: DON LUIS
D: Did you see the body?
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more, to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so, very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body into the opening to peer in. BANG! BANG! BANG! Is blown back by three fast shots.
S: INT. CLOSET - DAY
C: DON LUIS
D: Marco??
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
C: MARCO
D: Stay where you are!
E: INTO PHONE
N: And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to stand just off to the side.
C: MARCO
D: You know what bitch? I loved killing your father. He was a coward! And you know what else? I screwed your mother behind your father's back! We all did! She couldn't get enough of it! The whore! I killed her! I killed him! You want to avenge them? The whore and the coward? That's what you come from! Come out! I'm here! Come get the bullet with your name on it, Bitch!
N: Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two pistols.
C: MARCO
D: Kill her!
N: Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late. In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
S: INT. CLOSET - DAY
N: Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone.
C: DON LUIS
D: Marco! Marco!
S: INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY
N: Marco and the two thugs run into the small house.
C: MARCO
D: You two here! That door opens...
N: He points to the door they just came through.
C: MARCO
D: ...kill anything that comes through.
N: Marco runs into the bedroom.
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to the locks. None of them work.
C: MARCO
D: Shit!
N: He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on the knob, two shots ring out.
C: MARCO
D: Giorgio?
N: Nothing.
C: MARCO
D: Tonino?
N: No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo. He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down. His phone rings.
S: INT. CLOSET - DAY
C: DON LUIS
D: Marco! What the hell's going on???
S: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
N: Marco just stares at the door.
C: MARCO
D: Hold on.
N: There is a small sound outside the door.
C: MARCO
D: I will hold here! Run! Run!
N: The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen. Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come.
C: MARCO
D: Do it! Do it you bitch! Isn't this the moment you've been waiting for?
C: CAT
D: Yes, it is.
N: She empties her gun into him.
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He yanks open the door, runs inside.
S: INT. GARAGE - DAY
N: Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled Mercedes, jumps in the armored van.
S: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
N: Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse, bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van, bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the main road. Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns blazing.
S: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
N: As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and firing, losing ground.
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Cat reaches the end of the driveway, fires her last shots, runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off down the road.
S: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
N: Don Luis watches her run out of ammo, standing in the road receding.
C: DON LUIS
D: I beat you bitch! You can't kill me! I am unkillable!
E: LAUGHING MADLY
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Cat stands in the road, watching the van. She takes out Marco's cellphone. CLOSE ON THE SCREEN Cat scrolls the phone book. She highlights VAN. Presses SEND.
S: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
N: Don Luis is at a red light, so pleased with himself. Humming a tune. When the van phone rings. Surprised, he looks at the call coming in. MARCO. He presses the speaker.
C: DON LUIS
D: Marco?
C: CAT
D: It's Cataleya.
C: DON LUIS
D: I don't understand you. You should have been dead a long time ago. You got lucky. You escaped. You were given a second chance at a life. Why did you not take it? Why did you involve yourself with this insanity?
C: CAT
D: For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that.
C: DON LUIS
D: And because of that, you have ruined your whole life to try to kill me? You stupid bitch. Don't you get it? Someone like me?
E: MORE
C: DON LUIS
D: I cannot be killed. I do the killing. Not the other way around. And now it is your turn to be hunted. You will never find me. But as day follows night, believe me, I will find you. And I will kill you. And you know why? Because I will never be where you can kill me. I will never be where you want me to be.
E: CONT'D
C: CAT
D: Actually Don Luis...you are exactly where I want you to be.
N: Don Luis doesn't get it. And then he hears a low growling behind him. He turns a little, sees sitting there in the dark recesses of the van, two enormous dogs. Pepe's dogs. His eyes register confusion, then apprehension...
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Cat hears the growl over the phone. A small smile breaks across her face. And then se speaks into the phone one last time. One word.
C: CAT
D: EAT!
S: EXT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
N: Over the sounds of the dogs tearing Don Luis to pieces and his horrible screams, the van shakes as if it were caught in an earthquake.
S: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
N: Cat's shoulders sag, relax. Her face is peaceful as it has never been before. She looks at Marco's phone. Thinking.

C: DANNY
D: Can I have a cup of coffee?

S: EXT. COUNTRY BUS STOP - SUNSET
N: Cat, in jeans, t-shirt, a baseball cap with her pony tail sticking out the back, exits a phone booth, She boards a waiting bus. The doors close. The bus drives off down an endless road. THE END
