He begins, on his knees, to wash the entire surface of her left thigh, knee, calf, foot. Then he moves to her right foot and up her calf, knee and thigh. Cindy releases her breath. Then, Dean's hands move up between her legs.
C: CINDY
D: Okay.
N: Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water, Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back. Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow of water down the front of her body.
C: CINDY
D: Give me the soap.
E: CONT'D
N: She forms a quick lather in her hands. She rubs it into his chest, her strong hands making circles of suds. Dean is a tranquil participant. She lifts up his left arm, scrubs his armpit, then his right. Her hands build a lather and wash his penis. Dean catches his breath.
C: CINDY
D: Turn around.

She hears the music begin from the other room, knows the song - (Penny & the Quarters or Dynamite Four) It sounds really good right now. Drink in hand, she begins to sway to the rhythm. Dean peeks his head around the corner with a shit- eating grin. He starts to awkwardly dance to the music and make his way down the hallway to the bedroom. It's been years since they danced in front of each other, and it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now. The closer they get to each other, the less they can be seen, the less they are exposed. Soon, they are slow dancing, still holding drinks. They don't feel as vulnerable now. The cotton on Dean's robe feels good to Cindy's fingertips, she traces invisible pictures on his back. Dean burrows his nose into Cindy's neck, inhales deeply. There is a knock at the door. They both wish it would go away. It doesn't. DEAN (YELLS) (cont'd) Coming! Something about this makes Cindy laugh, Dean too. He backs away from her, slowly, as if pulled by some unseen force. The song continues as Dean opens the door and pays the ROOM SERVICE MAN. Cindy sets the table.

S: INT/EXT. BUS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The bus drives away. Inside, Dean stands. He is a little down. He feels around in his pocket. Finds the locket. He puts it on. The bus comes to a stop. A few passengers get on. One of them is Cindy. Dean watches her pay her fare and move to the back of the bus without noticing him. She finds a seat, pulls her hoodie low, anonymous.

C: DEAN
D: Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
C: CINDY
D: You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab.

D: Dean... Come on, it's time for bed.

C: CINDY
D: No... Dean... Wait a second.
N: She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his forehead.
C: DEAN
D: What!? I can't have sex with my wife!?
N: Cindy covers her face with her hand.
C: DEAN
D: Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a little affection. Do you want me to stop loving you? Do you want me to fuck other women? Do you want me to beat you?

C: CINDY
D: Stop... stop... stop...
C: DEAN
D: Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this?
N: Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57. He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her. Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder. The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing. His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling.
C: DEAN
D: I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and slips into the bedroom.
S: INT. ROMANTASUITES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. He talks to her. On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door. She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows, the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.
S: EXT. CITY. NIGHT. 6 YEARS EARLIER.
N: Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape of his chest, his abdomen, his back.

Jake's bedroom door opens and Jake walks out into the living room and into the kitchen. Dean and Cindy pantomime sleeping. They listen and hear Jake opening the refrigerator, pouring himself a bowl of cereal, crunching. They feel like he's watching them. Cindy tries her hardest not to laugh. Jake stares at the trembling sheet with contempt before returning to his room. Cindy releases her laugh. Dean tries to shush her, but he can't help laughing himself.
