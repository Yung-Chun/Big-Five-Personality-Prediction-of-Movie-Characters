S: EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)
N: ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as "Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps, richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks. Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted. A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX. Missing are the criminals... A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING. VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied, feared.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror. Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.
C: LANDON
D: Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
E: impatient, edgy
C: ERIC
D: I need to whizz.

N: ERIC's skinny, high-energy. A leg always jiggling.
C: LANDON
D: Eric. You're such a hummingbird.
C: BELINDA
D: I wanna dance.
N: BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad- girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet. Swatch watch.
C: LANDON
D: So go dance.
C: BELINDA
D: With you.
C: LANDON
D: I. Don't. Dance.
C: ERIC
D: Dee plane. Dee plane.
E: pointing, like Tattoo
N: They laugh. Clay's by the dumpster.
S: EXT. DUMPSTER
N: CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school, coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as the Camaro pulls up. Eric pushes a door open. Empties fall from the back seat. Clay climbs in.
C: CLAY
D: Go go go go.
N: PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio calculator watch, exits the gym.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.
C: LANDON
D: Kelly. He looks like his face caught fire and he tried to put it out with a fork.
E: mocking
N: Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing Kelly.
C: ERIC
D: He couldn't find his own butt with both hands at high noon in a hall of mirrors.
N: Sniggering laughter.
C: CLAY
D: Go!
N: Landon presses the gas. The CAR ROARS away.
C: CLAY
D: Kelly's so old he --
C: LANDON
D: We're done with that already, bonehead.
N: Clay smiles, good-natured. He often misses social cues.
S: EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING
N: Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the road. Another car runs it over.
S: EXT. ROAD
N: Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it. Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.
S: EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER
N: Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed. Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.
C: ERIC
D: So which is it?
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CAMARO
N: Eric finishes taking a leak.
C: ERIC
D: Landon. To save your life, you have to either go deaf or go numb in your dick and balls.
E: calling over, repeating
N: Eric climbs back in the car.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.
C: LANDON
D: I'm thinking.
C: ERIC
D: No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
C: LANDON
D: Could I lose one ear and one nut?
C: ERIC
D: No questions, no negotiating --
C: BELINDA
D: Where do you get these stupid questions -- ?
E: to Eric, annoyed
C: LANDON
D: Hypotheticals --
C: ERIC
D: I'm just wondering --
E: to Belinda
C: BELINDA
D: Don't wonder.
N: Landon's looking out at the night.
C: LANDON
D: Jamie Sullivan.
N: Everyone looks up. Derisive laughter. THEIR POV A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She lives in her mind, not her body. BACK TO SCENE
C: BELINDA
D: Brain.
C: ERIC
D: Bible freak.
C: LANDON
D: Cherry.
S: EXT. CAMARO
N: JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest.
C: JAMIE
D: Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any chance you could... turn them off --
E: to Landon, tentative
C: BELINDA
D: God give you this road?
E: leaning over Landon
C: JAMIE
D: No --
C: BELINDA
D: Then we'll be keeping the lights on.
C: LANDON
D: If you want the lights off, I'll turn them off.
E: to Jamie, seeming nice
N: And he does. Darkness.
C: JAMIE
D: Thank you. Thank you so very much.
N: She backs away from the car, grateful. From the car:
C: BELINDA
D: I can't see a friggin' thing.
E: O.S.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.
C: BELINDA
D: 'Thank you. Thank you so very much.'
E: imitating Jamie
N: But Landon's looking at Jamie. Almost counting the seconds... HIS POV Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it. BACK TO SCENE Landon quickly flicks the high beams. Belinda, Eric, and Clay snicker and snort as they see --
S: EXT. CEMETERY GATE
N: Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even. A moment later, she jumps down on the far side. Disappears.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing. Landon's smiling.
C: ERIC
D: Ten years. Where're you gonna be? Hypothetically?
E: to Belinda, mocking
C: BELINDA
D: Paris.
C: CLAY
D: Dead.
N: Laughter.
C: LANDON
D: Right here. With you.
N: He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where he'd really like to be.
C: CLAY
D: 'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark Side.'
C: ERIC
D: 'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.
C: LANDON
D: Don't call him a dipshit.
C: ERIC
D: You do --
C: LANDON
D: And you don't. What's she doing in there?
E: beat, re: Jamie
C: BELINDA
D: Nothing I'd be doing.
N: Laughter. Landon kisses her. With tongue. A blinding white light dances through the car and settles on Landon and Belinda's faces.
C: LANDON
D: Shit!
N: He scrambles out of the car.
S: EXT. CAMARO
N: Landon looks up at the fence. LANDON'S POV Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the headlights back into the car. BACK TO SCENE They stare at each other. His annoyance turns to mild respect. The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car. A GARBLED TRANSMISSION.
C: BELINDA
D: Landon!
E: O.S.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon leaps in. Pops out the Van Halen.
C: LANDON
D: The address?!
C: ERIC
D: York Ave.
N: Landon pops in a WHAM! tape. AMPS it UP. "Freedom."
C: LANDON
D: What number?
N: Nobody answers.
C: LANDON
D: Dildoes.
N: Landon turns the car around.
S: EXT. ACCESS ROAD
N: The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon drives recklessly. Rushing. He makes a SCREECHING turn. LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.

S: INT. CAMARO
N: Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road. LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement. A figure on the road.

S: EXT. ROAD
N: The Camaro swerves. TIRES SQUEALING. A LOUD, HEART- SEARING THUMP. The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt. The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole. CRUNCHING METAL. TINKLING GLASS.
S: INT. CAMARO
N: Quiet. Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.
C: CLAY
D: Christ, man.
C: LANDON
D: You okay?
C: ERIC
D: Yeah.
N: Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake. Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.
C: LANDON
D: Belinda?
N: She lifts her head. Looks at him. She's laughing. He kicks his door out.
S: EXT. STREET
N: The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed. Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him. No response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon. LANDON'S FACE Frightened, anguished. The real Landon showing for an instant. Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.
S: EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER
N: A battered Chevette steers through a working-class neighborhood.
S: INT. CHEVETTE
N: Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.
C: CYNTHIA
D: What if they expel you?
C: LANDON
D: Kelly wouldn't do that.
C: CYNTHIA
D: Why not?
C: LANDON
D: Cuz nothing happened at school.

S: EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM)
N: By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.
S: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM
N: Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit. Landon doesn't. His forehead still shows a bruise.
C: MR. KELLY
D: I had hopes for you.
C: LANDON
D: Like I'd grow up to be president, another Reagan.
C: MR. KELLY
D: Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
E: not laughing
C: LANDON
D: I'm no dummy.
C: MR. KELLY
D: That's right. You just act like one.
N: On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the Camaro.

D: They came from your car.
C: LANDON
D: I wasn't the one drinking.

D: That's right. The world is your oyster.

N: Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the courtyard. Not a care in the world.

S: EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER

D: You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.

N: Cynthia sets her jaw. He knows that look.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR
N: Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's making some headway; only two more to wash. MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair. Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's sink. Landon glimpses his future.

C: MR. KELLY

C: LANDON
D: When do I get time for me?
C: MR. KELLY
D: You don't. That's the point.
N: Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this. As he heads for the door:

D: Then you remember more than I do.
N: CLOSE ON BROOM pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.
S: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

D: -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter.
E: answering question
N: To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger.
C: JAMIE
D: This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid. Does anyone know what it is?
N: No one does.
C: LANDON
D: A star frame.
E: barely audible
N: But Jamie hears. She regards him a moment, then keeps going.
C: JAMIE
D: This is a star frame.
N: Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie.
C: JAMIE
D: A star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye --
C: CLAY
D: -- Did God create the sun?
E: scoffing, setting her up
C: JAMIE
D: Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws. Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible --
E: taking him seriously
C: ERIC
D: -- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater?
N: Landon laughs loudly. Members of the club look at him.
C: LANDON
D: That was a joke. Laugh.
N: Jamie smiles. She can laugh at herself. And she finds Landon funny.
S: INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING
N: Landon washes up while his mother sets the table. The MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.

C: LANDON
D: I don't want his money.
C: CYNTHIA
D: It could help with a new car --

N: He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.
S: INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING
N: Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing "Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing. She turns around to look at Landon. He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum. HIS POV To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view. Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.

D: -- 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are similar triangles?'
E: reading
N: Luis is lost, intimidated.
C: LANDON
D: Know what 'similar' means?
N: Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student, ISABEL.
S: INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON
N: The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard. He's late and heads for the rear bench seat. LANDON'S POV Jamie sitting there. And no vacant seats save next to her.

D: You going to visit Harold?
N: Landon scowls. What-who is she talking about?
C: JAMIE
D: They let him out of the hospital yesterday. He's in a rest home on Oak Street.
N: That old man.
C: JAMIE
D: He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
C: LANDON
D: -- This your idea of small talk?
C: JAMIE
D: I don't make small talk --
C: LANDON
D: -- Obviously.
C: JAMIE
D: I just wanted to tell you not to give up. Sometimes you've got to back into the teaching from somewhere else.
N: If he heard her, he makes no sign. She goes back to her book. A long beat, then:
C: JAMIE
D: What makes you volunteer? Want to know why I tutor reading?
E: pause
N: Not really.
C: JAMIE
D: Because, growing up, books were my world.
C: LANDON
D: Were?
E: mean
C: JAMIE
D: You don't know me.
C: LANDON
D: Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
C: JAMIE
D: -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
C: LANDON
D: You don't care what people say?
C: JAMIE
D: You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
C: LANDON
D: Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
C: JAMIE
D: Can't you have a normal conversation?
C: LANDON
D: I don't want to have any conversation.
C: JAMIE
D: Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
N: She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting, leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the bus. JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.
S: INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING
N: Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club. LANDON'S POV A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie. BACK TO SCENE Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.
C: MS. GARBER
D: We're waiting, Mr. Carter.
N: He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with his eyes squinched up.
C: LANDON
D: What's the play?
N: Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.
C: EDDIE
D: The-the-there's this drought an' -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make rain --
C: LANDON

C: EDDIE
D: Yeah. It's really g-g-good --
C: LANDON
D: -- It blows.

E: as Lizzie, sad
C: LANDON

E: as Starbuck
C: MS. GARBER
D: -- Landon, are you trying to be bad at this?
C: LANDON
D: No, it just comes naturally.
N: Jamie smiles. Garber taps her script -- continue.
C: LANDON
D: 'It's got to be inside you. Then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you. You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty. You'll be beautiful.'
E: as Starbuck
N: Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.
C: LANDON
D: 'Look at me. Tell me what you see!'

E: as Lizzie
C: LANDON
D: 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
E: as Starbuck, hamming
N: Hoots and laughter. Jamie looks away, humiliated.
C: MS. GARBER
D: Quiet! Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck.
E: announcing
N: Groans among the boys. Jamie is horrified. So is Landon.
C: LANDON
D: No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
E: to Garber
C: MR. KELLY
D: -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
E: O.S. offstage
N: Kelly's been standing in the wings.
C: MR. KELLY
D: With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster.
E: warning
N: Everyone stares at Landon. He's trapped.
S: EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING
N: Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.
C: LANDON
D: You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
E: rude
C: JAMIE
D: -- This play means a lot to me.
C: LANDON
D: This play -- ?
E: snorting
C: JAMIE
D: -- I know you don't suck at acting.
N: Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.
C: JAMIE
D: But you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater --
C: LANDON
D: -- What are you going on about?
N: Pause.
C: JAMIE
D: I can judge too.
N: He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.
C: JAMIE
D: You don't care about classes or graduating. But you like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again.
C: LANDON
D: That's deep --
C: JAMIE
D: -- Your act only works with an audience.
C: LANDON
D: My act?!
N: She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac. The last car in the parking lot. Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.
C: LANDON
D: A ride?! Please!
S: INT. PONTIAC
N: Jamie turns to look at him. JAMIE'S POV Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.
C: LANDON
D: We can talk about your helping me with my lines.
E: insincere
S: INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jamie's at the wheel.
C: JAMIE
D: I know you don't want help.
C: LANDON
D: Then we both know. I'll point. You drive. Faster.
E: beat
N: He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks. The wet road glistens.
C: JAMIE
D: We're following fire trucks?
C: LANDON
D: Yeah.
C: JAMIE
D: Why?
C: LANDON
D: Because that's where the fire is?
E: duh
N: He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out. He's searching the dash -- no cassette player.
C: LANDON
D: Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
C: JAMIE
D: Like me.
C: LANDON
D: No. Not like you.
N: She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.
C: LANDON
D: What the -- ?!
C: JAMIE
D: So you agree you need help?
N: LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD Headlights looming, a car coming. Closer and closer. BACK TO SCENE
C: LANDON
D: Yes!
N: She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling. A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.
C: JAMIE
D: Really?
N: Landon drops his attitude, his act. He toys with the glove compartment knob.
C: LANDON
D: Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave school if I screw up the play.
C: JAMIE
D: 28 and 42.
E: to herself
N: Pause. He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.
C: LANDON
D: What's with the friggin numbers?
C: JAMIE
D: 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
C: LANDON
D: I'm an enemy?
C: JAMIE
D: Kinda. Yeah.
S: EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER
N: Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.
C: JAMIE
D: The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
C: LANDON
D: Good thing.
N: If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.
C: LANDON
D: You got some kind of list?
C: JAMIE
D: Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
C: LANDON
D: Maybe a little of both.
N: They both smile.
C: JAMIE
D: I'll take a chance.
C: LANDON
D: Go for it.
C: JAMIE
D: It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
N: He smirks.
C: JAMIE
D: If you can't imagine the future, you won't have one.
N: He lights a cigarette. She reaches for it.
C: LANDON
D: Having a cigarette. 100.
E: joking
N: She grins and takes a drag. They share the cigarette.
C: LANDON
D: So what else is on this list?
C: JAMIE
D: It's private.
C: LANDON
D: You want to tell me...
E: cajoling
N: She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing her dreams with him.
C: LANDON
D: Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
E: guessing, rudely
C: JAMIE
D: Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
E: correcting
C: LANDON
D: Ambitious.
E: contemptuous
C: JAMIE
D: Being negative's a lot more work than being positive.
C: LANDON
D: Like you'd know.
C: JAMIE
D: I do know. Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
E: pause
N: He likes the frivolity of these.
C: LANDON
D: What's... Number one?
N: She looks away, embarrassed.
C: JAMIE
D: If you want help with your lines, I have two conditions. You have to promise not to fall in love with me.
E: changing subject smiling
N: He's certain she's joking.
C: LANDON
D: No problem --
C: JAMIE
D: And you have to meet my father.
N: He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.
C: LANDON
D: Fathers love me.
N: CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall. Ichabod Crane in a collar.
S: EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING
N: Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty. His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.
C: LANDON
D: Hey. Landon Carter.
N: Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: You're in the play?
E: surprised
C: LANDON
D: Lead man.
N: Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.
C: LANDON
D: They took my license for 30 days. But nobody's pressing charges.
E: explaining bike
N: The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush. Not the best place.
C: JAMIE
D: I'll get something for us to drink --
C: LANDON
D: Don't bother!
N: But she's already gone. The Reverend gestures toward the open front door.
S: INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely.
C: LANDON
D: You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off. But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic.
N: The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.
C: LANDON
D: Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
E: confidence flagging
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about. Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
E: beat
N: His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful.
C: JAMIE
D: I miss anything?
S: INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER
N: Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy. Her father comes in.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
C: JAMIE
D: He wants help with his lines --
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene --
C: JAMIE
D: By accident --
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
E: beat
C: JAMIE
D: I'm supposed to always be alone?
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
C: JAMIE
D: Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
N: Pause.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
E: gentler
C: JAMIE
D: Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
S: INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM
N: Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping. She tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.
S: EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER
N: Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.
C: JAMIE
D: I know. Don't say anything.
E: re: her father
C: LANDON
D: He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
C: JAMIE
D: You think so.
C: LANDON
D: Know so.
N: She grins, skeptical.
C: JAMIE
D: This way.
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.
C: JAMIE
D: People think I'm strange, don't they?
C: LANDON
D: Yes.
E: smiling
C: JAMIE
D: Because I try to be nice to people?
C: LANDON
D: Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
C: JAMIE
D: Do you think I'm strange?
N: Pause. Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.
C: LANDON
D: Yeah. But that can be good.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT
N: Jamie quickly scales the fence. Landon's right after her.
C: LANDON
D: Why are we here?
S: INT. CEMETERY
N: Jamie drops down. Takes a flashlight from her bag.
C: JAMIE
D: Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
C: LANDON
D: The world of the dead?
E: on top of gate
C: JAMIE
D: Could be...
E: being mysterious
N: He drops down, not sure what she means. She's already walking away. He follows.
C: JAMIE
D: My mother's buried near here.
C: LANDON
D: My father's alive but it's like he's dead.
N: She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made cylindrical device.
C: LANDON
D: What is that?
C: JAMIE
D: That is my telescope.
E: proud
N: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky. The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye- piece. POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat ring system. WIDEN.
C: LANDON
D: Saturn. Beautiful.
E: impressed
C: JAMIE
D: Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
C: LANDON
D: But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
C: JAMIE
D: Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
C: LANDON
D: Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
N: She looks at him. He smiles, embarrassed.
C: LANDON
D: I'm not smart. Just a sponge.
N: She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope and changes its view.
C: JAMIE
D: Sometimes I come here and just scan the heavens.
C: LANDON
D: Looking for intelligent life?
E: joking
C: JAMIE
D: Looking for something -- someone.
N: Pause. He doesn't know what to say.
C: LANDON
D: Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
C: JAMIE
D: I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.
E: beat
N: Their eyes meet. She looks away. Changes the subject.
C: JAMIE
D: I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
E: re: telescope
C: LANDON
D: The dirty snowball at its core.
C: JAMIE
D: Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
E: beat
C: LANDON
D: In 76 years, me neither.
N: She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.
C: LANDON
D: You're really into God, right?
C: JAMIE
D: In ten words or less?
C: LANDON
D: Yeah.
C: JAMIE
D: My relationship with God is my own.
C: LANDON
D: But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
C: JAMIE
D: Don't you?
C: LANDON
D: Not really.
N: Pause.
C: JAMIE
D: When you do, how do you?
N: Landon could joke or he could reveal something.
C: LANDON
D: Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
C: JAMIE
D: Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
C: LANDON
D: No.
C: JAMIE
D: I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
C: LANDON
D: There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
C: JAMIE
D: Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture.
C: LANDON
D: You have to believe to have faith.
C: JAMIE
D: You don't believe in anything?
C: LANDON
D: The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
C: JAMIE
D: Interpreted by another guy like my father.
C: LANDON
D: Your father doesn't like me.
N: Pause.
C: JAMIE
D: He doesn't trust you.
C: LANDON
D: Sometimes I don't even trust me.
N: He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She takes it.
C: JAMIE
D: I'm not afraid of you.
C: LANDON
D: Likewise.
S: INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door. A light glows under the door, then goes out.
S: INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM
N: He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.
S: INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
N: Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS, past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know what to write.
S: EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)
N: Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."
C: ERIC
D: Women are definitely evolving into men.
C: CLAY
D: The moustaches on some girls. Unbelievable.
C: BELINDA
D: Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at us?
N: They look. Jamie's watching them. They laugh.
C: ERIC
D: She wants to jump Landon's bones.
C: BELINDA
D: That is so pitiful.
C: LANDON
D: She's very confused.
C: CLAY
D: Deluded.
C: ERIC
D: Deranged.
C: LANDON
D: Demented.
C: BELINDA
D: She's coming over here...
C: LANDON
D: Heart be still.
N: They laugh more and she's there.
C: JAMIE
D: Hi.
E: to Landon
N: He doesn't respond. She shifts from foot to foot. Confused.
C: JAMIE
D: The play's going to be really good.
C: LANDON
D: I'm really glad you think so.
E: mocking her
N: His friends snicker and guffaw. She looks at them, then back to Landon.
C: JAMIE
D: I guess you don't want to practice lines tonight.
C: LANDON
D: You guessed right.
N: She gives him a funny look and walks away. A better person than he and he knows it.
C: BELINDA
D: That's one girl who can't take a hint.
C: LANDON
D: Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
N: They laugh. Landon the loudest. It feels good, but he also feels a little... bad.
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands, and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.
S: INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies, listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The DOORBELL RINGS.
S: INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Better not be the Carter boy.
E: O.S.
N: Jamie shuts the door.
S: EXT. SULLIVAN FRONT PORCH
N: Landon can't believe this. He presses the BELL again.
C: LANDON
D: Jamie? Open up. Open the door. Please. Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk to your daught--
E: talking to door beat beat long beat
C: JAMIE
D: What is your problem?
N: She's standing in the front yard.
C: LANDON
D: You're not in a very good mood.
C: JAMIE
D: You don't miss a thing.
N: WIDER He steps down off the porch.
C: LANDON
D: The play's in a couple of weeks.
C: JAMIE
D: Yes. And?
C: LANDON
D: I was hoping we could run lines together.
C: JAMIE
D: Oh. Just not at school...
C: LANDON
D: Yeah --
C: JAMIE
D: Or anywhere where people might see us.
C: LANDON
D: Belinda's a very jealous person.
C: JAMIE
D: That would be the reason.
N: Pause. He thinks she might be going for this.
C: JAMIE
D: So it's like you want to be secret friends.
C: LANDON
D: That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
C: JAMIE
D: Then maybe you can read mine.
N: She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and opens it. Before she goes in:
C: JAMIE
D: I thought I saw something in you, something good. But I was wrong.
S: INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out, glowers. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie would reject his generous offer of friendship.
S: EXT. FRONT YARD
N: Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.
C: LANDON
D: Why do you have to be so weird?!
N: The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.
S: INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Jamie sits on the sofa. Her father doesn't look up from his reading.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: The first time I met him I knew. I'm proud of how you're handling yourself.
N: Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her distress.
S: INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
N: Landon lies in bed watching another British nature DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's photo. CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama. Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.
S: INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING
N: Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly. Landon's eyes wander out the window. LANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP BACK TO SCENE
C: LANDON
D: Let's get outta here.
S: EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - BASKETBALL BLACKTOP - MINUTES LATER
N: Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court. Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.
C: LANDON
D: You, me, and the basket. We're the three corners of a triangle. Take one step in.
N: Landon and Luis both step forward.
C: LANDON
D: Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
C: LUIS
D: Yeah.
C: LANDON
D: Are you?
C: LUIS
D: Yeah.
C: LANDON
D: So what did we just make?
C: LUIS
D: A similar triangle?
C: LANDON
D: What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
C: LUIS
D: Scalene?
C: LANDON
D: Okay. Make me an isosceles.
N: Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.
C: LANDON
D: Yes! Two sides the same.
N: Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student, Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.
S: INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING
N: Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf. He picks out a book, then sits in a corner. But before he opens the text, he looks around him, suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all the knowledge that could be his.
S: EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - WEEK LATER
N: On the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, "All Invited." Under this, a full parking lot.
S: INT. AUDITORIUM
N: A full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers, booster club and rotary members. ON STAGE The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s. Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The play's underway... STAGE LEFT Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance. LANDON'S POV - STAGE BOY #1 (as H.C., the father) 'Then why don't you talk to her?'
C: EDDIE
D: 'Because if we do, she'll think we're trying to get rid of her.'
E: as Jim
N: BOY #1 (as H.C., the father) 'She'll sure think the same if I do it. You're her father and comes a time when a father's gotta mention.' BACK TO SCENE From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie. A collective gasp from the audience. LANDON'S POV Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair pulled back. BACK TO SCENE Landon can't take his eyes off her.
C: JAMIE
D: 'Morning, Pop. Boys. I dreamed we had a rain, rain coming down in sheets! Lightning flashed, thunder rolled up and down the canyon like a kid with a big drum!'
E: as Lizzie
N: AUDIENCE Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured. Principal Kelly -- hopeful. Cynthia Carter -- uncertain. Clay, Eric, and Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.
C: JAMIE
D: 'I know why you sent me to Sweetriver. Six boys in that family. The first three days, I stayed in my room.'
E: as Lizzie
N: BOY #2 (as Noah, the brother) 'What'd you do that for?' BACK OF AUDITORIUM A well-dressed man, DR. JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father, slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.
C: JAMIE
D: 'I knew what I was there for and they knew it, too!'
E: O.S. as Lizzie
N: BACK OF AUDITORIUM - LATER Dr. Carter hangs on every word. Others sit on the edge of their seats. Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda. Belinda leans forward to take a photo. BELINDA'S POV THROUGH CAMERA LENS As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger. ON STAGE Landon, Jamie, and the three boys. ON STAGE - LANDON is Starbuck.
C: LANDON
D: '... You'll look in that mirror and you'll be more than pretty. You'll be beautiful. Look at me. Tell me what you see!'
E: as Starbuck, genuine
N: Jamie looks. She sees something in his eyes she hasn't seen in them before. Love.
C: JAMIE
D: 'Is it really me?'
E: as Lizzie, choked up
N: LANDON'S POV Jamie, her face lovely. Her eyes shining, radiating, looking directly at him. BACK TO SCENE Landon is dumbstruck.
C: LANDON
D: 'Yes. You're beautiful.'
E: as Starbuck, heartfelt beat
N: Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself. Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation. He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently, genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled with tears. The curtain crashes down. End of act two. CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor. AUDIENCE Principal Kelly, pleased. Cynthia Carter, proud. Clay and Eric, surprised. Reverend Sullivan, frowning, concerned. Belinda's face is cold, hard.
S: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - HOUR LATER
N: Landon runs out, looking for his friends. Mr. Kelly shakes his hand, then deals with parents. LANDON'S POV Belinda getting into her car. WIDER
C: LANDON
D: Belinda!
N: Belinda stops.
C: BELINDA

D: Fine performance.
C: LANDON
D: Who invited you?
C: DR. CARTER
D: Ed Kelly. I thought we might get a bite --
C: LANDON
D: Not hungry.
N: Landon moves toward his Camaro.
C: DR. CARTER
D: Landon! Please. Don't walk away from me.
C: LANDON
D: Like you walked away from us?
N: Landon opens his car door and gets in. Not forgiving.
S: INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

S: INT. CAFETERIA - NOON
N: Landon walks along the lunch line, looking. No Jamie.

S: EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK
N: Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro. They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.
C: ERIC
D: She's like some Puritan.
E: contemptuous
C: LANDON
D: She's not. She's got her own ideas.
C: CLAY
D: Mutant ideas.
C: LANDON
D: Maybe to you.
N: Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?
C: ERIC
D: Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
C: LANDON

D: You weren't in school yesterday.
C: JAMIE
D: I went to the doctor with my father.
C: LANDON
D: He okay?
C: JAMIE
D: Healthy as can be.
N: Pause. She doesn't help him. She opens her locker, gets what she needs.
C: LANDON
D: You were great the other night.
C: JAMIE
D: Thank you. So were you.
N: Pause. He tries to touch her hair. She ducks.
C: LANDON
D: I haven't been nice to you.
C: JAMIE
D: You're hardly nice to anyone.

E: sincere
C: JAMIE

D: Landon!
C: LANDON
D: Later.
N: Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits. Making a public statement.
C: JAMIE
D: People can see.
C: LANDON
D: And that would ruin your reputation how?
N: She goes back to her book. Ignoring him.
C: LANDON
D: What's that?
E: re: her book
N: She doesn't look up. Shows him the spine: The Scarlet Letter.
C: JAMIE
D: I'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg's best American authors list.
C: LANDON
D: How many books are there?
C: JAMIE
D: A hundred. Then there's his classics list. And his European list.
E: annoyed
N: Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.
C: LANDON
D: That on your 'Life List.' To read all those books?
N: She doesn't deny it. He just dives in.
C: LANDON
D: Jamie. Maybe I want to try being positive.
N: She looks up. Examines his face for the truth.
C: LANDON
D: Maybe I miss doing that dumb play with you.
N: Students seated near them have overheard. Whisper.
C: LANDON
D: Maybe you inspire me.
C: JAMIE
D: That sounds like horseshit.
C: LANDON
D: Which part?
C: JAMIE
D: All of it.
C: LANDON
D: It's not.

D: I just did!
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL
N: Landon follows Jamie out of the building. Catches up.
C: LANDON
D: Jamie --
C: JAMIE
D: You lack honor. You lack compassion. You lack honesty. You lack humanity.
N: She heads to the old Pontiac. Landon jogs after her.
C: LANDON
D: Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
C: JAMIE
D: You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
C: LANDON
D: I don't want to be just your friend --
C: JAMIE
D: You don't know what you want --
C: LANDON
D: You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
C: JAMIE
D: And why would that scare me?
C: LANDON
D: Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
N: She gets into her car. Slams the door. STARTS the ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.
C: LANDON
D: But the real reason you're scared? You like me!
N: She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at Landon's spectacle.
C: LANDON
D: If you were really my friends, you'd be helping me, not running me down.
C: ERIC
D: The only one running you down is you.
S: EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT

D: Dad came to the play.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You saw him?
E: surprised
C: LANDON
D: We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
C: CYNTHIA
D: After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
E: disbelief
C: LANDON
D: He wants to show now.
C: CYNTHIA

C: LANDON
D: What's number one on your list?
N: She shakes her head.
C: LANDON
D: My number one would be getting out of Beaufort.
C: JAMIE
D: Getting out won't be your problem. It'll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere.

D: Why is he giving you a gift?
N: Jamie doesn't answer.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Did you give him a gift?
C: JAMIE
D: No.
C: REV. SULLIVAN

C: JAMIE

C: LANDON
D: I will.

N: Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.
C: LANDON
D: I don't. I expect you to pay me for yours.
N: The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills. Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away.

D: I don't want to see her hurt.
C: LANDON
D: I wouldn't do that --
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: This week.

C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Have her home by one. And drive carefully.

N: Landon's under the Yugo's hood. Josh, the kid from next door, is in the driver's seat.

C: LANDON
D: Swing! Keep your bat parallel to the ground. Follow through. Follow through!
N: Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd be embracing if the fence weren't there. In the b.g., kids from their school. Giggling, whispering. Landon looks over at them.

D: You're acting like a crazy person.
C: LANDON
D: You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.

C: JAMIE
D: I don't understand...
E: almost a whisper
C: LANDON
D: Maybe you're not supposed to.
N: He moves closer.

C: JAMIE
D: I might do it wrong.
C: LANDON
D: Not possible.

C: JAMIE
D: I can't. I can't -- explain.
E: overwhelmed beat
N: She turns back to him, her eyes shining. She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply. But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder.

C: JAMIE
D: You make me feel...
C: LANDON
D: Loved?
E: hopeful
C: JAMIE
D: That. And less strange.

D: Now they all match.
S: INT. CAFETERIA - NOON
N: Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful. She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's being diminished, ostracized.

D: Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
N: They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky.
C: LANDON
D: From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat. On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
E: beat
C: JAMIE
D: What would you do up here?
C: LANDON
D: Look. Talk. Not talk.
N: He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the deck. Shuffles like a card shark.

C: LANDON
D: I could take after Dad, too.
C: CYNTHIA
D: You do. You're handsome and charming.
C: LANDON
D: I meant he's a doctor.
C: CYNTHIA
D: That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
C: LANDON
D: I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
C: CYNTHIA
D: That'd be something.
N: She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic.
C: CYNTHIA
D: But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
C: LANDON
D: Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --

D: It's time to tell him. It would be the right thing.
E: pause

D: No. I want what's best for you.

D: This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!

C: LANDON
D: Time seems to be slowing down and speeding up at the same time.
N: She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder. He lets her.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH
N: The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall pile of parts is already at his car. Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup. Gravel flying. MUSIC BLASTING.
S: INT. PICKUP
N: Eric and Clay spy Landon.
S: EXT. CEMETERY
N: Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.
S: EXT. PICKUP
N: The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense moment, then:
C: ERIC
D: Hey.
C: LANDON
D: Hey.
N: Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup. Eric follows suit.
S: EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER
N: Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how they fit together. They are like a map for how to build the bigger one.
S: EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY
N: Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the house toward the back yard.
S: INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Sees her there. Smiles. BACK TO SCENE Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie. She's standing at the window.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: What's that boy doing?
N: She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors, pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN
N: The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire. The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.
S: INT. PATIENT ROOM
N: Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.
C: LANDON
D: You okay?

D: I'm not tired.
C: REV. SULLIVAN

C: JAMIE
D: Dad.
N: He kisses her forehead, then sits back.
C: JAMIE
D: So serious.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Jamie, God is not punishing you. No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer.
N: Pause.
C: JAMIE
D: When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
N: He lets this sink in.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care. I'm failing you.
N: She looks away, agreeing without saying so.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Jamie. I make you the same promise that God does. I will always be with you.
E: beat
N: She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never wanting to let him go. Her father.

C: LANDON
D: The next book on that list! The Old Man and... and...
E: insistent
C: MISS TARBOX
D: The Sea.
C: LANDON
D: Yeah. I need it today!

C: MR. KELLY
D: I'll drive a copy over to her.
N: Landon nods his appreciation.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY
N: Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath. The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome. Landon is sitting in a chair. He sees her, motions for her to come in. Quietly.
C: BELINDA
D: She asleep?
C: LANDON
D: I'll tell her you were here.
N: Pause. Awkwardness.
C: BELINDA
D: Give her this, okay?
N: She hands Landon a small photo album.
C: BELINDA
D: Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
C: LANDON
D: I'm sorry about how we --

D: I know.
C: JAMIE
D: It's gone now.
C: LANDON
D: Because you have hope that you'll get better?
E: gently
C: JAMIE
D: No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
E: pause, shrugging, accepting beat
N: He kneels on the floor. Puts his head on her pillow next to hers.
C: JAMIE
D: Maybe I believe God sent you to me because I am ill. To help me through.
N: He touches her face tenderly.

D: I want to go home.
E: almost whispering
N: Pause. He gets her meaning.
C: LANDON
D: I'll talk to your father.

C: JAMIE
D: Isabel?
C: ISABEL
D: Hi.
E: shy
N: Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling but reading. Jamie grins.

S: INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep. Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading. Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do. Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.
C: JAMIE
D: Don't wake Landon.
N: They tiptoe in. Stand on either side of her bed.
C: JAMIE
D: Do I look scary?

C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: In there.

C: REV. SULLIVAN

C: REV. SULLIVAN

N: The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand. Landon takes it. The two men shake. Allies now.
S: INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

C: JAMIE
D: Can I -- go out?
C: LANDON
D: You'll be fine for a few minutes.
N: Jamie looks at the nurse. Uncertain. The nurse nods.
S: EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT
N: Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky. She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.
C: JAMIE
D: It's beautiful... Thank you.
E: grateful, touching it
N: But she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them.
C: JAMIE
D: I don't know what we'll be able to see... Help me stand.

HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's hazy head and long tail.
C: JAMIE
D: The comet of the century...
E: O.S.
N: BACK TO SCENE She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:
C: LANDON
D: You love me?
N: She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.
C: LANDON
D: Will you do something for me?
C: JAMIE
D: Landon. I can't even do for myself.
C: LANDON
D: But if you could, you would?
C: JAMIE
D: Yes.
N: His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love.
C: LANDON
D: Will you marry me?
N: HER FACE Illness, happiness, disbelief.
S: EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL
N: A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms. Dogwoods, wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.
S: INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH
N: Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda; teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation; Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids; neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses. Landon stands with his father by the altar. The "WEDDING MARCH" begins... The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness. LANDON'S POV - JAMIE Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride. BACK TO SCENE Landon swells with pride. Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly makes her way down the aisle. In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her. Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath. A moment later, she and her father continue. A long, difficult walk. A walk to remember. AT ALTAR The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father near. Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side. Jamie sits. Exhausted. Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair. Pause. Dr. Carter kneels. Showing solidarity with his son. Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check. LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV Reverend Sullivan towering over them. BACK TO SCENE Reverend Sullivan kneels, too. Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's hand in her left. Linking the three together. The congregation silences. Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible. Struggling.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: As a father, I'm supposed to give away my daughter. But I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart. But I can let another share in the joy she has given me. May God's blessings be with you both.
N: He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon. Completing the circle.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Landon, repeat after me. Do you take...
N: As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar -- Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter. TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter, Josh, Eric, Clay. Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own work.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: 'Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes...'
E: O.S.
N: And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find... PARSONAGE in a different season. Winter. UP the front steps and INTO... LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY) As it is now, in present day. The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting. Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The Rainmaker... The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in. Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin parchment thin. The two men embrace. Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: You've been well?
C: LANDON
D: Yes. You?
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Getting by.
N: Pause. Why is he here? The Reverend waits.
C: LANDON
D: I'm -- I'm returning something.
E: fumbling
N: He twists the ring on his finger. Removes it.
C: LANDON
D: This belongs to you.
N: He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend. Pause. Landon searches for something meaningful to say.
C: LANDON
D: She taught me -- everything. She saved my life.
N: The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness. Realizing now why Landon has come.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: You're marrying again.
C: LANDON
D: Yes.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: Jamie wanted that. She told me.
N: Landon is grateful to know this. He makes a move to go. Then turns back.
C: LANDON
D: I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
C: REV. SULLIVAN
D: She did. It was you.
N: Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again. Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.
C: ADULT LANDON
D: Jamie once said when you're feeling love, you're also feeling God.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON
N: Landon walks alone. His hair and clothing tousled by a steady gentle wind.
C: ADULT LANDON
D: She made me a believer. In love. In life. In the journey that never ends...
E: V.O.
N: Landon stops. Faces the wind. Lets the air swirl over him.
C: ADULT LANDON
D: ... And in the mystery of all things you can't see but feel everywhere around you...
E: V.O.
N: He closes his eyes. She's there...
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
