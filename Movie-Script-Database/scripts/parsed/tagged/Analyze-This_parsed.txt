M: CREDITS BEGIN OVER BLACK.
M: DOMINIC MANETTA
N: a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE of related news photos.
C: MANETTA
D: 1957 was a big year. The Russians put that Sputnik into outer space, the Dodgers played their last game at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot Frank Costello in the head, and missed, and the Gallo brothers whacked Albert Anastasia in that barber shop in the Park Sheraton Hotel. It was total chaos. With Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese figures he's king shit, but Carlo Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both want to be boss of all bosses. So they call a meeting -- a big meeting.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY
N: CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps through the peaceful landscape.
C: MANETTA
D: It was the first time the whole commission was ever gonna meet face to face. Bosses and wiseguys were comin' in from all over the country, and all the New York families, too -- maybe sixty bosses, the whole wiseguy world -- all headin' toward this little town upstate to figure out what's what.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY
N: A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy, then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.
C: MANETTA
D: Your father and me, we were goin' up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.
E: V.O. MORE
C: MANETTA
D: He was running the family at the time. Anyway, I don't know what anybody was thinking, but some asshole thought it would be a good idea to have this meeting at Joe Babara's farm in the country where nobody would notice.
E: V.O.CONT'D
S: EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY
N: A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.
C: MANETTA
D: Turns out the local cops were watching Joe Babara like a hawk. So now you got about fifty Caddies and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin and some deputy sheriff with cow shit on his shoes notices all the traffic and calls the Feds.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY
N: The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and greeting each other on the big front porch. One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.
C: WISEGUY
D: You wanna be a ribeye? Get away from the fuckin' car.
S: EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME
N: Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed, wearing big FBI arm bands.
C: MANETTA
D: The meeting never even got started. The Feds moved in --
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
N: Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start breaking down the front door.
S: EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SAME TIME
C: MANETTA
D: -- and we moved out.
E: V.O.
N: Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows and leaping off balconies. WIDE - WISEGUYS fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields.
C: MANETTA
D: Your papa and me hid in a field with hay or corn, some kinda foliage, I don't know.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY
N: Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass. Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on them.
C: MANETTA
D: Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this .44 cannon he used to carry, and hijacks the goddamn tractor. Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
N: The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two wiseguys drive off on it. The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN. END CREDITS.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: SWIRLING CLOUD OF CREAM on top of an espresso. PULL BACK as a hand reaches in and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup. The espresso is picked up and sipped by MANETTA, the aging boss of a prominent New York crime family.
S: INT. RITZ CLAM BOX - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT)
N: The place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late forties, and a powerful boss in his own right.
C: MANETTA
D: Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now.
C: VITTI
D: I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business.
E: brooding
N: They finish eating.
C: MANETTA
D: The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul. We gotta change with the times.
C: VITTI
D: What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site?
C: MANETTA
D: You remember what else happened in 1957, Paul?
C: VITTI
D: Yeah, I remember.
C: MANETTA
D: When your father died, I promised him I'd always look out for you. Come to the meeting.
N: They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost out the door when Vitti hesitates.
C: VITTI
D: Wait a second. I'm just gonna grab a toothpick.
N: The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS. Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind the counter, shielding him with his body. Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up with tears.
T: CUT TO:
N: KLEENEX being pulled out of a box. CAROLINE, a woman in her early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue. She's sitting on the couch in --
S: INT. BEN'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
N: The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated.
C: CAROLINE
D: I kept telling him that I needed room to grow and find myself as a person. Not just as a woman but as an independent entity.
E: weepy
N: BEN SOBOL her therapist, seems to be listening intently.
C: CAROLINE
D: I told him I needed to get in touch with my uniqueness, but he couldn't handle that. He said I was driving him away. Do you think I was driving him away, Dr. Sobol?
N: Ben leans forward sympathetically. He's in his mid-forties, has an expressive face and a quick wit, and despite the occasional lapse, he is a gifted and caring psychologist.
C: BEN
D: Things end, Caroline. That's just a part of life. It's how we deal with things ending that's important.
C: CAROLINE
D: I just can't believe it's over between me and Steve. Maybe there's still hope.
C: BEN
D: Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign.
C: CAROLINE
D: But what should I do?
C: BEN
D: Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do... ... is stop whining about this pathetic loser! You're a tragedy queen! 'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives a shit! Get a fucking life! You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being I have ever met! Please, say something interesting before I lapse into a goddamn coma!
E: voice rising mocking
N: Caroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed.
C: CAROLINE
D: Dr. Sobol?
N: BEN Lost in his fantasy, not really listening. He comes to attention and tries to cover.
C: BEN
D: Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting on your whole -- situation. It's very interesting what you were just saying. I want you to think about it, and I'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when I get back from my vacation.
N: Caroline bursts into tears again.
C: BEN
D: Or not.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
N: Ben rushes upstairs and into his bedroom. His 14-year-old son MICHAEL is in his room putting on a tuxedo.
C: MICHAEL
D: You're late.
C: BEN
D: I know. I couldn't get rid of my last patient. I think she was a tick in a past life.
E: changing hurriedly
C: MICHAEL
D: Yeah, what's Caroline's problem? Your boyfriend's gone, he hates your guts, get over it.
C: BEN
D: Michael! What did I tell you? You can't listen to my sessions! It's private stuff.
C: MICHAEL
D: I can't help it. I hear you through the vent in my room.
C: BEN
D: Funny how that happens when you lie on the floor and put your ear up against it.
C: MICHAEL
D: Okay, okay. How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout?
C: BEN
D: Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant?
E: entering, putting on his tux shirt
C: MICHAEL
D: Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party? This blows.
E: struggling with the cummerbund
C: BEN
D: We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. Forget the tux. Regular clothes.
E: helping him looks at Michael and makes a quick decision
N: Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt.
C: MICHAEL
D: Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac?
E: taking off his tux shirt
C: BEN
D: Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff?
E: O.S. from his room
C: MICHAEL
D: Mom.
C: BEN
D: She's not supposed to do that, you know.
E: annoyed MORE
C: BEN
D: Your mother and I, when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other. So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it.
E: CONT'D comes back into Michael's room
C: MICHAEL
D: Oh, yeah. She really cares. She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes.
C: BEN
D: Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay?
E: fuming
C: MICHAEL
D: You gonna vent?
C: BEN
D: Yeah. I hate her! I really hate her! Okay. Dad again. Let's go.
E: venting a beat, then brightly
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME
N: Paul Vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse with his most trusted soldier, Jelly, a hulking bruiser, and his sidekick JIMMY, a tightly-wound ferret with chips on both shoulders.
C: VITTI
D: So what did you find out?
C: JELLY
D: The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh --
E: as they walk
N: He hesitates.
C: VITTI
D: What?
N: Jelly looks at Jimmy.
C: VITTI
D: What?
C: JELLY
D: A lot of people think you set him up.
E: reluctantly
C: VITTI
D: Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me.
C: JELLY
D: So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting.
C: VITTI
D: Oh, is that what they figure?
C: JELLY
D: It's alright with me if you did --
C: VITTI
D: I didn't kill him! I told you that! Don't you hear?
T: CUT TO:
S: 14A INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 14A
N: They enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers, EDDIE COKES, TUNA, and JOHNNY BIGS are waiting. In the middle of the room, a young rat named NICKY SHIVERS is tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence. 14A CONTINUED: 14A
C: NICKY
D: Please, Mr. Vitti, I told 'em I don't know anything but they don't believe me 'cause that one time I said Little Joe hit Dukey and it turned out he didn't but I didn't know because --
C: JIMMY
D: Shut the fuck up!
E: smacks him
N: Nicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe.
C: VITTI
D: Nicky, you know me, right?
C: NICKY
D: Yeah. You're Mr. Vitti.
C: VITTI
D: And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right?
C: NICKY
D: Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe?
C: JIMMY
D: It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot.
E: slaps him
C: VITTI
D: I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta?
C: NICKY
D: I don't know.
C: VITTI
D: Don't fuckin' lie to me!
E: roars
C: NICKY
D: Honest to God, I don't know!
E: in tears
C: VITTI
D: You little rat bastard...
N: 14A CONTINUED: (2) 14A Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe. They all wince in anticipation of the blow. But Vitti just freezes there with his arm upraised. Then he drops his arm and seems to sag.
C: VITTI
D: Forget about it. He doesn't know anything.
N: He tosses the pipe aside.
C: VITTI
D: Get him outta here.
N: Jimmy looks at Jelly in surprise.
S: INT. MINIVAN - LATER
N: Ben is driving to the party with Michael. Sitting in stopped traffic, he checks his mirrors anxiously.
C: BEN
D: Look at this. Everybody's nuts. Ooh, I hate walking into that house late.
E: to himself, urgently
C: MICHAEL
D: I think you're reacting like this because you're mad we have to go to this party.
C: BEN
D: No. Don't. I'm not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in Santa. Sorry, but we only have room for one Dr. Sobol in this family.
C: MICHAEL
D: But there's two Dr. Sobols. There's you and Grandpa.
C: BEN
D: Can we talk about something else?
E: a beat
C: MICHAEL
D: Are you going to read Grandpa's new book? Mom says you won't because you're...
C: BEN
D: Does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty-four hours a day?
N: Wham! Ben REAR-ENDS the CAR in front of them.
C: BEN
D: That's your mother's fault! Your mother did that! Damn!
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. EAST 90TH STREET - NIGHT
N: The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car. The trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming. Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over his mouth. Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to inspect the damage.
C: JIMMY
D: What's the matter with you? Are you some kind of moron?
E: heading Ben off
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry. It's totally my fault.
N: Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the worst of it. The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly is struggling to latch the trunk.
C: JIMMY
D: Did you see anything?
C: BEN
D: I was talking to my son. I took my eyes off the road --
C: JIMMY
D: Forget that bullshit. Did you see anything?
N: Jelly steps in to defuse the situation, warning Jimmy off with a look.
C: JELLY
D: That's all right, sir. It's our fault for being in front of you like that.
C: BEN
D: Well, I should have been watching. Let me give you my insurance information --
E: surprised
C: JELLY
D: It's okay. Forget about it.
C: BEN
D: Really? It looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up.
N: Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the trunk lid with duct tape.
C: JELLY
D: No, it was like that before.
C: BEN
D: Maybe we should call the police?
C: JELLY
D: Why? Fuck the police.
E: suddenly menacing
C: BEN
D: Right! Fuck 'em.
N: HORNS start HONKING behind them.
C: BEN
D: At least take my card. You might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind.
N: Jelly takes the card and reads it.
C: JELLY
D: You're a doctor?
C: BEN
D: Ph.D. Psychologist.
C: JELLY
D: A shrink. You talk to a lotta nuts, huh?
N: Ben hears KICKING from inside the car trunk.
C: JELLY
D: Pings and knocks. Cheap gas. Hey, how do those minivans handle?
C: JIMMY
D: Jelly! Let's go!
E: O.S.
C: JELLY
D: Take it easy, Doc.
N: Ben looks totally confused as Jelly hustles back to his car.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SOBOL HOME - LIVING ROOM - ISAAC SOBOL
N: Ben's father, at the piano in the spacious, elegant, tastefully-decorated living room, surrounded by adoring guests, playing and singing an exuberant rendition of "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby." Isaac is a silver- haired patrician, overloaded with self-esteem.
C: ISAAC
D: All right, neurotics only! Well, you must have been a beautiful ba-a-by, 'cause baby look at you now, thank God for Prozac, baby look at you now!
E: ending the sing- along
N: BEN AND MICHAEL standing off to the side talking to Ben's mother DOROTHY. In the corner is a large advertising display featuring Isaac's smiling picture on the front cover of his new book, Tell Me What You Feel, Tell Me What You Want.
C: BEN
D: What do you mean you're not coming? It's my wedding.
C: DOROTHY
D: We understand it's a special day for you, Benny, but your father and I can't just pick up and leave town every time you decide to get married.
C: BEN
D: Every time? This is a once-in-a- -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing.
N: Isaac joins them.
C: BEN
D: Dad, you're not coming to my wedding?
C: ISAAC
D: We want to be there, but I have three book signings next weekend. I can't piss off these big book stores. If I cancel, they'll stick me down on the bottom shelf. That's how they are.
C: BEN
D: Yeah, that's the word on the street. The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks.
C: DOROTHY
D: Ben! The language.
E: looking around
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry, but I've been alone for eight years, now I've finally met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and I would really like you to meet her before we get married. You're going to be her family. I think it's better she knows that up front.
C: ISAAC
D: You're really hostile tonight.
C: BEN
D: I'm joking.
C: DOROTHY
D: I think I'll go talk to the mayor.
E: jumping in
C: BEN
D: The mayor's here?
C: DOROTHY
D: I can only hope.
N: Dorothy exits.
C: ISAAC
D: What's wrong?
C: BEN
D: Nothing. Everything's fine.
C: ISAAC
D: How's your practice?
C: BEN
D: It's great. Just great. I've got some very interesting patients -- extremely interesting. Fascinating actually.
C: MICHAEL
D: Dad has a patient who dreams he shits trout.
C: BEN
D: Thanks, Mike.
C: ISAAC
D: Excuse us, Michael.
N: Isaac pulls Ben into the foyer.
C: ISAAC
D: Why are you wasting your time out there in the boondocks? New York City is the Mecca of Madness.
C: BEN
D: I'm just not sure I could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid.
C: ISAAC
D: It beats a guy with an ass full of flounder.
C: BEN
D: Trout! And don't minimize my practice.
C: ISAAC
D: Why are you getting so defensive? This is about your own feelings of inadequacy.
C: BEN
D: You always turn it back on me. Why do you do that?
C: ISAAC
D: Why do you think I do that?
C: BEN
D: Why do you think I think you do that? Go ahead, now you ask me why I think you think I think you do that.
C: ISAAC
D: Enough. I want you to think about what I said. And when you're ready to talk to me like a normal person, I'll be at the piano with Regis Philbin. Rege!
E: as he crosses away
C: REGIS PHILBIN
D: I'm not singing, Isaac!
C: ISAAC
D: Now, ladies and gentlemen, at the piano, Regis Philbin!
N: Applause and laughter from the guests. Ben grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter's tray.
C: BEN
D: Thomas Wolfe was right. You can't go home again -- because your parents still live there.
E: to the waiter
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OLD LION SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT
N: Vitti's men converse quietly while a soldier sweeps the room for bugs. He gives the "all clear" and SALVATORE MASIELLO, the old consigliere, speaks.
C: MASIELLO
D: The Manetta family is asking a lot of questions. They think we hit Dominic.
N: CARLO MANGANO, the burly underboss of the Vitti family, jumps in.
C: MANGANO
D: Forget Dominic! They were after Paul. It's a miracle you survived. I thank God.
E: to Vitti
C: VITTI
D: Yeah, thank God. All I know is if I didn't have some veal stuck in my teeth, I'd be laying there with Dominic.
C: JOHNNY BIGS
D: This is all about the big meeting. Primo Sindone wants to run the whole show.
C: MANGANO
D: Yeah, but Primo's a boss. He knows the rules. He couldn't go after Dominic and Paul unless the other families gave their permission.
C: VITTI
D: If they did, we're heading for one big fuckin' war. Talk to Zello and Baldassare. Find out what you can. We got two weeks. If the other New York bosses are against us, I want to know it before I walk into that meeting.
E: starting to sweat having trouble breathing
N: He feels a stabbing pain in his chest.
C: MANGANO
D: You all right, Paul? You don't look good.
C: VITTI
D: I'm a little choked up here. I gotta get some air.
N: He walks outside. Jelly follows. Mangano looks quizzically after them.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OUTSIDE THE OLD LION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Vitti is having trouble breathing.
C: JELLY
D: You feel all right?
C: VITTI
D: I feel like shit. This whole thing is like a huge fuckin' headache.
C: JELLY
D: You havin' one of those mindgrains?
E: concerned
N: Sweating profusely now, Vitti feels another stabbing chest pain.
C: VITTI
D: Get the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER
N: Vitti is putting on his shirt. He looks considerably better. Jelly is sitting down, tapping his own knee with the little rubber hammer. Nothing moves. DOCTOR SHULMAN, a young cardiology resident, enters.
C: DOCTOR
D: Good news, Mr. Evans. Your heart is just fine.
C: VITTI
D: How could it be fine? I've had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks.
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, based on everything, I'd say you probably had an anxiety attack.
C: VITTI
D: What?
E: a beat
C: DOCTOR
D: An anxiety attack. A panic attack. I can give you some Xanax if it happens again soon --
C: VITTI
D: Look at me. Do I look like a guy who panics?
E: menacing
C: DOCTOR
D: There's nothing -- I mean -- it's a common thing --
E: nervous now
C: VITTI
D: Where did you go to medical school? I had a heart attack, you quack bastard.
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, not according to these --
E: very scared now
N: As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck.
C: VITTI
D: Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a mild heart attack and now it's over. You understand?
E: low and deadly, pumping up the cuff with the squeeze-ball
N: The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the pressure around his neck increases.
C: VITTI
D: If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and I was never here. Is that clear?
C: DOCTOR
D: Yes.
E: strangled
C: VITTI
D: Good. Take the chart.
E: to Jelly
N: Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and follows Vitti out the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit. Vitti stops.
C: VITTI
D: Jelly, I need you to do something for me as my friend.
C: JELLY
D: Anything.
C: VITTI
D: You have to find me a doctor.
C: JELLY
D: We just came from the doctor.
C: VITTI
D: Not that kind of doctor. I need a head doctor.
C: JELLY
D: You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig.
C: VITTI
D: Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out?
C: JELLY
D: It saves time.
C: VITTI
D: I need you to find me a psychiatrist.
C: JELLY
D: Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me.
C: VITTI
D: Is he any good?
C: JELLY
D: Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy. He had a business card and everything --
C: VITTI
D: He had a card? That's a real fuckin' achievement.
C: JELLY
D: What do you need a shrink for anyway?
C: VITTI
D: It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend.
C: JELLY
D: Got it.
C: VITTI
D: And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean?
C: JELLY
D: Of course. Absolutely. Can I ask you one thing?
E: then
C: VITTI
D: What?
C: JELLY
D: This friend. Is it me?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BEN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung milquetoast in his late forties.
C: BEN
D: Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things.
C: CARL
D: You're right. I do.
C: BEN
D: No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed.
C: CARL
D: You're right. I did.
C: BEN
D: Why do you think you do that?
C: CARL
D: I don't know.
C: BEN
D: Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you.
N: The door opens and Jelly enters.
C: JELLY
D: Dr. Sobol?
C: BEN
D: Excuse me! I'm in a session here.
C: JELLY
D: Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
C: BEN
D: You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night.
C: JELLY
D: Bingo. Get outta here.
E: to Carl
N: Jelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the couch.
C: JELLY
D: Upsa-daisy. You got a coat, nutbar?
C: BEN
D: What are you doing?
C: JELLY
D: He's leaving.
C: BEN
D: The hell he is. He's not going anywhere until we're done with his session.
N: Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties.
C: JELLY
D: I'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here.
E: to Carl
N: Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive look.
C: BEN
D: Don't take it, Carl.

D: He's not leaving.
C: CARL
D: Three hundred.
E: trembling
C: JELLY
D: You're not that fuckin' crazy.
E: pays him
N: Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for someone to come in.
C: BEN
D: Listen, if you're upset about your car, I can understand that. But you don't just barge in here --
N: Paul Vitti steps into the office. Ben freezes. Jelly crosses to take Vitti's coat.
C: VITTI
D: You know who I am?
C: BEN
D: Yes.
C: VITTI
D: No you don't.
C: BEN
D: Okay.
C: VITTI
D: You've seen my picture in the papers?
C: BEN
D: Yes. And no. Sometimes. Never.
C: VITTI
D: Jelly, wait outside.
N: Jelly exits. Vitti walks around the room, taking everything in. He picks up the phone and listens. Hangs up.
C: VITTI
D: Sit down.
C: BEN
D: Sure.
N: Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass. Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them.
C: VITTI
D: Tony Bennett, huh?
C: BEN
D: Yeah. He's my favorite.
N: Vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from Ben's desk.
C: BEN
D: Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it. Seriously, I tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me.
E: puts up his hands
C: VITTI
D: I was just gonna ask if you liked baseball.
C: BEN
D: Yes. Big Yankee fan.
N: Vitti puts the bat down.
C: BEN
D: Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's -- not good. I think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think?
C: VITTI
D: I don't care about the car.
C: BEN
D: Then what -- ?
C: VITTI
D: A friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Do we sit?
C: BEN
D: Whatever makes you comfortable.
N: Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first. Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.
C: VITTI
D: Okay, the first thing I gotta know about is privacy. You must hear a lot of weird shit in here. How do I know you won't go testifying -- not testifying -- but, you know, talking about it to somebody else.
C: BEN
D: I won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless I know the patient may be a danger to himself. Like if I'm concerned a patient might kill himself...
C: VITTI
D: Not fuckin' likely --
C: BEN
D: -- or kill someone else.
N: Ben looks to Vitti for a response. Vitti stares at him for a long, uncomfortable beat.
C: VITTI
D: So who starts?
C: BEN
D: Why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy?
C: VITTI
D: I don't need therapy. I'm helping out my friend. You didn't hear me say that?
C: BEN
D: Right. I'm sorry.
C: VITTI
D: You guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening. You can't remember what I said two seconds ago.
C: BEN
D: I'm very sorry.
C: VITTI
D: I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this point.
C: BEN
D: Why don't you tell me about your friend?
C: VITTI
D: He's a powerful guy. Never had a problem dealing with things, you know? Now all of a sudden, he's falling apart. He cries for no reason. He's having trouble sleeping. And then he started having these attacks. You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die.
C: BEN
D: Panic attacks.
C: VITTI
D: What's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? Did I say panic?
C: BEN
D: Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks.
C: VITTI
D: Right. So the question is, what can he do to make it stop?
N: Ben decides to go for it.
C: BEN
D: I'm going to go out on a limb here. I think your friend is you.
C: VITTI
D: You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend. Go on.
C: BEN
D: Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy.
C: VITTI
D: With you?
C: BEN
D: With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm very heavily booked right now and I'm going on a short vacation tomorrow.
E: hedging
C: VITTI
D: Where you going?
C: BEN
D: I don't really share that information with...
C: VITTI
D: Where?
C: BEN
D: Miami Beach.
C: VITTI
D: You know, this could be good. Just getting that off my chest, I feel better already. It's like a load is off my shoulders. Thank you.
C: BEN
D: Well, I really didn't do anything --
C: VITTI
D: You did something. The load? Off. Where is it? Don't know. You're good, Doctor. I'll be in touch. But listen to me. If I talk to you and it turns me into a fag, I'll kill you. You understand?
E: leaning close, menacing
C: BEN
D: Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up --
N: Vitti silences him with a wave of his hand.
C: VITTI
D: I go fag, you die. Got it?
C: BEN
D: Yes.
N: Vitti gives Ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns and exits. Ben is stunned.

C: LAURA
D: So judging from the mob scene around the pool here today, I think you'd have to say that there's nothing 'off' about the 'off-season' in Miami Beach this summer. Now, on a personal note, this is my last report for W.V.B.F. I'm getting married to a wonderful man and moving to New York, so if you're up that way, watch for me on the W.P.I.X. news team. Thanks for everything, Miami. For the last time, this is Laura MacNamara, W.V.B.F. news.

C: LAURA
D: This is Michael? I don't think so. If I remember correctly, Michael was a little boy, and this, this is a great big kid. Hey, you. Tell us what you did with Michael Sobol.
E: a little too big
N: Ben and Michael look at each other out of the corners of their eyes.
C: LAURA
D: Okay. Come on. Give me a break. I'm trying.
C: MICHAEL
D: No, it was nice, but I'm fourteen so it wasn't -- you know -- age appropriate.
C: LAURA
D: Sorry. Just smack me if I do that again. How are you, Michael?
E: smiles appreciatively hugs him
C: MICHAEL
D: Great.

N: They embrace.
C: LAURA
D: You are? And you still really want to get married?
C: BEN
D: Of course.
C: LAURA
D: But what if you get tired of me? I know so many couples that were really happy, then they got married and just completely lost interest in each other.
C: BEN
D: That's not going to be us.
C: LAURA

C: SOUND GUY
D: Uhh, Laura? You want me to take your mic, or at least turn it off?

D: I got news for you. I'm still fucked up. Whatever you did the other day, it didn't take. You did nothing for me.
C: BEN
D: I did nothing? What did you expect? I saw you for five minutes. I don't work miracles, Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you something else. I don't appreciate it when someone breaks into my hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't go for that. I have a family and a life and a serious practice, and I don't have time for your bullshit! That got away from me near the end.
E: indignant sheepishly
N: Vitti stares at Ben.
C: VITTI
D: I couldn't get it up tonight.
C: BEN
D: You mean sexually?
E: stopped cold
C: VITTI
D: No, I mean for the big game against Michigan State. Of course sexually!

D: Did you see that embroidered on a pillow somewhere?
C: VITTI
D: Are you gonna help me or not?

D: The dead dick thing? Never. Well, one time. Tonight. And another time.

D: Do the math. Two times. There was another time. But it was after a big meal, so, you know, that don't count.

C: VITTI
D: Five.
C: BEN
D: Five times -- it isn't the end of the world.

D: Maybe not to you -- look at you -- but if I can't get it up, that makes me less of a man and I can't have that.
E: MORE
C: VITTI
D: In my business I deal with animals. They may seem dumb to an educated guy like you, but make no mistake about it, Doctor, animals are very cunning. And they sense weakness. Right now I'm an injured animal. It's only a matter of time before one of the lions out there catches the scent. Then I'm dead. That's the way it is. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand the life I live and you don't understand me.
E: CONT'D moving closer to Ben

D: I can't tell you and you don't want to know.
C: BEN
D: It's impossible. I can't do anything that fast. And even if I could, what's my goal here? To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?
C: VITTI
D: Look, the other day I saw a commercial on television, some kid playing with a couple of puppies. I cried for 45 minutes. Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman!
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry. I can't help you.
C: VITTI
D: You're turning me down?
C: BEN
D: Mr. Vitti, when I got into family therapy, this was not the family I had in mind. I'm turning you down.
C: VITTI
D: You with your schmucky little office in your schmucky little house out there in Schmuckville -- you're turning me down? What, so you can spend more time listening to housewives piss and moan about how nobody fucks them right?
C: BEN
D: I'd like to go now.
C: VITTI
D: You see this? This is what I'm talking about! I'm a dead man!
E: starts to cry
N: Ben turns away and starts for the door.
C: VITTI
D: You call yourself a doctor? You should be ashamed. A real doctor couldn't turn his back on a person who's suffering!
E: through the tears
C: BEN
D: All right. What happened with your wife tonight?
E: finally hands him a handkerchief
C: VITTI
D: I wasn't with my wife. I was with my girlfriend.
E: wiping away his tears
C: BEN
D: You have a girlfriend? We could do two months on that alone.
C: VITTI
D: What, you're gonna start moralizing with me now?
C: BEN
D: Okay. Do you have marriage problems?
C: VITTI
D: No.
C: BEN
D: Then why do you have a girlfriend?
C: VITTI
D: I do things with her I can't do with my wife.
C: BEN
D: Why can't you do those things with your wife?
C: VITTI
D: Hey. That's the mouth she kisses my children good night with. What's the matter with you?
C: BEN
D: Okay, okay. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
C: VITTI
D: You mean like seeing your best friend murdered? Yeah, I got stress.
C: BEN
D: Well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, I'd say that's probably it then.
C: VITTI
D: It's just stress?
C: BEN
D: I doubt if there's anything physically wrong with you.
C: VITTI
D: You. You. You're very good.
E: brightening, pointing a finger at Ben
C: BEN
D: There's a lot more to it --
C: VITTI
D: No, you're right. You're right on the money. I can feel the juices rushing back to my manhood as we speak.
C: BEN
D: Well, I didn't need to know that.
C: VITTI
D: This settles it. You're my shrink.
C: BEN
D: I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with --
C: VITTI
D: Listen to you. The honesty. Nobody -- and I mean nobody -- talks to me like this. I'm ready. Let's do it.
C: BEN
D: You don't hear the word 'no' that often, do you?
C: VITTI
D: I hear it all the time. Only it's more like, 'No, no, please, no!'
C: BEN
D: All right. I'm here for two more days. When we get back to New York, I'll treat you exclusively for two weeks. I just need to figure out what to tell my other patients.
E: relenting
C: VITTI
D: You want me to clear your schedule for you?
C: BEN
D: No thanks, I'll handle it. Now can I go?

D: No.
C: LAURA
D: Tell me you're not.
C: BEN
D: I'm not!

E: looking down at the tailor
N: Sindone nods for the tailor to get out.
C: MOONY
D: Primo? What about Vitti?
C: SINDONE
D: Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we were growing up, he was the smart guy; I was the dope. My father was a nickel-and-dime shitheel; his father had it all. Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin because he forgot to kill Gambino before the meeting.

D: Okay. What's going on?
C: VITTI
D: I had an episode. Not an actual panic attack, but I started panicking a little thinking I might have one. Does that seem weird to you?
C: BEN
D: I'm redefining 'weird' on an hourly basis. What were you thinking about when you started feeling anxious?

D: I don't know what they're doing. He's talking to some guy. Looks like Vitti is drawing something in the sand... What's he drawing? What am I, Superman? I'm a hundred yards away -- I can't see shit... No way, he's got that fat Jelly with him and his partner, Jimmy Boots. We could take him out with a rifle and a scope, but I don't have any of that shit with me. My scope's in the shop... Nah, it's a warranty item... Hey, don't sweat it. You told me to take care of him, I'll take care of him... Okay, I'll call you back.
N: BACK ON BEACH Vitti finishes drawing.
C: VITTI
D: There. You happy?
C: BEN
D: Where are the people?
C: VITTI
D: What people? You told me to draw a house.
C: BEN
D: I know. But usually when people draw a house they draw people. Where are the people who live in your house?
C: VITTI
D: Well, you see, they'd come out and say hello, but the whole family's in the Witness Protection Program. It's very sad. What the fuck you want from me?
N: They start walking.

C: BEN
D: How?
C: VITTI
D: Heart attack. Sudden thing.
C: BEN
D: Were you and your father close?
C: VITTI
D: Close? Yeah, you know, pretty close. I guess we weren't getting along that great right then.
C: BEN
D: Why was that?
C: VITTI
D: I was hangin' out in the neighborhood. I had a borghata -- like a kid gang -- hooligan shit, nothin' big. But my father didn't like it.
C: BEN
D: You fought about it?
C: VITTI
D: He slapped the shit out of me.

C: VITTI
D: Yeah, I guess.
C: BEN
D: Any feelings of guilt?
C: VITTI

C: VITTI
D: English.
C: BEN
D: Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his mother.
C: VITTI
D: Fuckin' Greeks.
C: BEN
D: It's an instinctual developmental drive. The young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother.
C: VITTI
D: Are you saying I wanted to fuck my mother?
C: BEN
D: It's a primal fantasy --
C: VITTI
D: Have you seen my mother? That is the sickest fucking thing I've ever heard.

C: BEN
D: Call the Vatican. Ask them if anything's missing.
C: MICHAEL
D: So cool!
C: JANET
D: Michael, get your bags out of the car, please.
C: MICHAEL
D: It's almost as tall as the house!
N: Michael crosses away. Laura glares at Ben.
C: BEN
D: He felt bad. It's a wedding gift.
E: reads the card
C: LAURA
D: Well, we're not married, so I guess we'll have to send it back.
C: BEN
D: Hey, don't blame me. You didn't want to finish the ceremony.
C: LAURA
D: What did you expect? You think that's what I want to remember on our anniversary? 'Gee, honey, let's go look at the wedding video. There's my parents, there's your parents, and there's the guy who plunged to his death.'
C: BEN
D: I just want to marry you.
C: LAURA
D: I'm starting to think that's not going to happen.
C: BEN
D: Come on. Next Saturday. It's all set. I even asked for a room with a low ceiling, just to discourage the jumpers.
C: LAURA
D: And who's going to be there?
C: BEN
D: Us three, a clergyman, and any family members who've completed their crisis counseling.
C: LAURA
D: And no guests without necks. Everybody has to have a neck.
C: BEN
D: We'll do a neck check at the door.
N: They kiss.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SOBOL FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: The back door opens and Ben, Laura and Michael enter, struggling with the luggage. They freeze. Sitting in the family room are the three FBI agents: Steadman, Ricci and Provano.
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: Doctor Sobol, Mrs. Sobol -- I'm Agent Steadman, Agent Ricci, Agent Provano, Federal Bureau of Investigation, O.C.D.
E: showing his badge
C: BEN
D: Obsessive-compulsive disorder?
E: stunned
C: AGENT PROVANO
D: Organized Crime Division. We need to talk.
N: Laura recognizes Provano from the hotel and glares at him.
C: MICHAEL
D: The FBI! This is better than the fountain!
C: BEN
D: Michael, go to your room.
C: MICHAEL
D: But --
C: BEN
D: Go!
C: MICHAEL
D: Fine. I can hear better in there anyway.
N: Michael exits. On the coffee table are dozens of pictures of Ben and Paul Vitti taken in Miami and just about everywhere else.
C: BEN
D: So. FBI.
E: a beat
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: Can you explain these photographs, Doctor Sobol?
C: BEN
D: I'm a psychotherapist. Paul Vitti is my patient.
C: LAURA
D: Was your patient.
C: BEN
D: Right. Was. That's what I meant.
C: LAURA
D: But not like a real patient.
C: BEN
D: Right.
C: PROVANO
D: So why did he send you that fountain?
C: BEN
D: That was a gift to celebrate the completion of his therapy. We got our television from an agoraphobic, so it's not that unusual -- you know, maybe you should discuss this with my attorney.
C: LAURA
D: Yeah, maybe you should.
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: Doctor Sobol, Paul Vitti is an extremely dangerous man. We're talking conspiracy, fraud, extortion, racketeering, grand theft, murder...
C: BEN
D: Well, yeah, but don't forget, the man is a sociopath. You've got to expect that kind of behavior --
N: Ben looks out the window and does a double take. BEN'S POV Isaac and Dorothy are standing in the yard, gawking at the fountain. BACK IN FAMILY ROOM
C: BEN
D: Excuse me, fellas. My folks are here and I'd like to -- well, die would be my first choice. Can I go out?
C: AGENT RICCI
D: It's your house.
C: LAURA
D: Too bad you didn't remember that when you were breaking in.
C: BEN
D: Honey, maybe the federal agents would like something to drink? Could you see what we have?
E: as he goes
C: LAURA
D: No.
E: firmly
C: BEN
D: I tried, guys.
E: to the Agents
N: Ben exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Ben rushes up to Isaac and Dorothy.
C: BEN
D: Hi! What a surprise.
N: Ben kisses his mother as she stares at the fountain.
C: DOROTHY
D: That certainly makes a statement. It's a little big for the yard, don't you think?
C: BEN
D: What can I tell you, Mom? It looked much smaller in the store.
C: ISAAC
D: Think it'll affect your water pressure?
C: BEN
D: I think it'll affect the tides. What are you doing here?
C: DOROTHY
D: Your father and I are just very concerned about what happened in Florida.
C: ISAAC
D: How was your flight home? Anyone hang themselves in first class.
C: DOROTHY
D: We got in last night, we couldn't sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?
C: BEN
D: Yeah, but she and Michael are spending some time alone, you know, getting to know each other. That's important. I don't want to disturb that dynamic.
C: DOROTHY
D: So you're not going to invite us in?
E: a beat
C: BEN
D: No.
E: a beat
C: DOROTHY
D: Well, I'm going to wait in the car. There's too much spray.
E: insulted
N: Dorothy crosses away.
C: ISAAC
D: All right. What's with you and Paul Vitti?
C: BEN
D: Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
C: ISAAC
D: He's your patient? Are you joking? Have you thought about what this could do to your reputation?
C: BEN
D: You, know, I always wanted to be great, but then I realized that I might have to settle for just being good enough. Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great.
C: ISAAC
D: Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's going to be hurting. I want you to stop seeing him.
C: BEN
D: Didn't you read your own book? Instead of trying to run my life, why don't you just close your eyes, take a deep breath, tell me what you feel, tell me what you want.
C: ISAAC
D: This is bullshit.
E: uncomfortable
C: BEN
D: You wrote it.
C: ISAAC
D: Okay. I love you -- and I'm afraid for you -- I want you to be safe -- and I want you to have a good life.
E: with difficulty
C: BEN
D: Is that really it?
E: deeply touched
C: ISAAC
D: That's it.
N: They embrace awkwardly.
C: BEN
D: You know why I became a shrink? Because I grew up with a great one walking around the house.
C: ISAAC
D: I thought you became a shrink because you were sleeping with your psychology professor at Columbia.
C: BEN
D: Yes, and because of you.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MINUTES LATER
N: Ben comes back to Laura and the Agents.
C: BEN
D: Okay, so you were saying?
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: Let me cut to the chase. Sometime in the next week or so, the heads of every major crime family in the United States are going to meet together somewhere in the New York area.
N: Ben nods, finally understanding Vitti's two week deadline.
C: AGENT PROVANO
D: We think the stage is set for a major bloodbath. Has he mentioned anything about it to you?
C: LAURA
D: A bloodbath?
C: BEN
D: No. If he said anything about a bloodbath, I probably would've remembered it. Bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation.
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: You could really help us out by supplying information about that meeting.
E: gathering photos
C: BEN
D: And if I don't?
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: If you don't, I will personally make your life a living hell. I want you to think about that and call me at this number when you change your mind.
C: BEN
D: You mean if I change my mind.
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: I mean when.
C: LAURA
D: Okay. Guess what, fellas? You don't scare me.
E: tough
C: BEN
D: Laura --
C: LAURA
D: Sit down! There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us? That ain't the way it works here, boys. Whatever he and Paul Vitti talked about is privileged. He doesn't have to tell you a thing.
E: to the Agents MORE
C: LAURA
D: Tarasoff vs. The University of California. Look it up. Now, if he's done something wrong, take him downtown and book him. Otherwise, I'll ask you very kindly to get the hell out of my house.
E: CONT'D
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: We'll be in touch.
N: The Agents exit.
C: BEN
D: Laura, that was really --
E: impressed
C: LAURA
D: Oh, shut up!
E: furious
N: Laura storms out of the room in a fury. Ben stands, looking miserable, then we hear Michael's voice from the vent.
C: MICHAEL
D: You are in trouble.
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OLD LION SOCIAL CLUB - DAY
N: Vitti is conferring with Sal Masiello, his consigliere.
C: MASIELLO
D: Paul, I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. You know I was a good friend to your father and I will always be a good friend to you. But the word is out that you've been talking to a shrink. Is that right?
N: Vitti shoots Jelly a sharp look. Jelly looks away.
C: VITTI
D: What's the point here?
C: MASIELLO
D: This concerns the whole family. Right now, we're the only ones who know about it, but if it gets out on the street -- what then? Who knows what you've been saying in there?
C: VITTI
D: It's none of anybody's business what I say in there.
C: MASIELLO
D: Paul, I beg to differ. If you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing. But everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good. They'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable. Sindone would take over everything.
C: VITTI
D: So what do you want me to do?
C: MASIELLO
D: It's time to end it.
C: VITTI
D: What do you mean, end it?
C: MASIELLO
D: Get rid of this shrink. He knows too much already.
C: VITTI
D: You want me to whack my doctor?
C: MASIELLO
D: If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
C: VITTI
D: No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?
T: CUT TO:
S: 64A FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET ON LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY 64A
N: Vitti and Ben are walking down the street. For some reason, Vitti is wearing a hat.
C: BEN
D: I'm going to buy some fruit. You want anything?
C: VITTI
D: No, go ahead.
N: Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car. More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off. Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his head, knocking off his hat.
C: VITTI
D: Papa! Papa!
S: 64B INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 64B
N: Ben jerks upright in bed, knocked awake by the nightmare.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: HOLY WATER FONT Someone dips their fingers in.
S: INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NEXT DAY
N: It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on the cross.
C: VITTI
D: You look lousy. You all right.
C: BEN
D: Listen, Paul, please don't send me any more gifts.
C: VITTI
D: You didn't like the fountain?
C: BEN
D: That's not the point. It's a boundary issue.
C: VITTI
D: Boundary issue? I say if more people gave from the heart, we'd all be better off. Let's see your watch. Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex.
E: as Ben shows his wrist
C: BEN
D: Don't buy me a Rolex.
C: VITTI
D: Who said anything about buying it?
N: They cross to the main aisle of the church.
C: BEN
D: Listen, I really need to talk to you.
N: Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar. A funeral service is in progress.
C: VITTI
D: Tommy Angels. We grew up together. Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.
C: BEN
D: How did he die?
C: VITTI
D: He was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor. Got hit by a truck -- twice.
C: BEN
D: Do I need to know that? I'm having nightmares as it is.
N: The funeral procession comes down the aisle.
C: BEN
D: Last night I dreamed we were walking down the street, I stopped to buy some fruit, and they shot me -- like Brando in The Godfather.
C: VITTI
D: Good scene. Was I there?
N: A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man kisses Ben and walks off.
C: BEN
D: You dropped your gun, then you ran over to me and started yelling, 'Papa, Papa!'
C: VITTI
D: I was Fredo. I don't think so.
N: An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks. Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as they walk by.
C: VITTI
D: You're losing it, Doc. You may need therapy yourself.
N: A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks, embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the whole scene with Ben and exits. Ben looks at Vitti.
C: VITTI
D: Him I don't know. Let's get private.
N: 65A OMITTED 65A 65B 65B
S: EXT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ben and Vitti come out of the cathedral.
C: BEN
D: Don't you see? You called me 'Papa.' It's all about your father.
C: VITTI
D: What're you, nuts? It was your dream.
C: BEN
D: Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too.
C: VITTI
D: Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my dream, I'm bringing the baby the black milk.
C: BEN
D: Freud believed you're everyone in your dreams.
C: VITTI
D: Yeah, well, that guy I don't need to hear about. I can't even call my mother on the phone after that thing you told me.
C: BEN
D: Let's say you are the baby. What kind of milk did you get from your father?
C: VITTI
D: Could we stop talking about my father?
C: BEN
D: That's the whole point! We have to start talking about your father. You know what it's like dealing with you? This is you. You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a mess. I'm in pain. Okay, Paul, I can help you. Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti.
E: losing it imitating Vitti as himself as Vitti
C: VITTI
D: Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father.
C: BEN
D: Let's not.
C: VITTI
D: Is he still alive?
C: BEN
D: Yes, he's still alive.
C: VITTI
D: What kind of work does he do?
C: BEN
D: That's not important.
E: a beat
C: VITTI
D: You paused.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: VITTI
D: You paused. That means you had a feeling. What does he do?
C: BEN
D: He's a psychiatrist.
C: VITTI
D: Ooh, you're fucked up. Next patient, please.
C: BEN
D: We're running out of time, Paul. Let's not waste it talking about my problems.
C: VITTI
D: Your father's a problem?
C: BEN
D: No!
C: VITTI
D: That's what you just said! You seem upset.
C: BEN
D: I'm not upset!
C: VITTI
D: Hey, I'm good at this.
C: BEN
D: We have three days left. If you want to spend it screwing around, I can't help you. Call me when you're ready to get serious.
E: hailing a taxi
C: VITTI
D: Say hello to your father for me!
N: A cab stops at the curb.
T: CUT TO:
S: 66A EXT. CHURCH - SAME TIME 66A
N: Handsome Jack and Potatoes watch from a vantage point in the park nearby.
C: POTATOES
D: We could just pop him right now.
C: HANDSOME JACK
D: In front of a church? What are you, a fuckin' animal? It's a holy place.
C: POTATOES
D: Is the sidewalk holy, too? I mean, where does the holiness end?
C: HANDSOME JACK
D: I don't know. Second Avenue?
E: thinks
T: CUT TO:
N: DIGITAL SOUND MIXER in the FBI van. A technician works at the computer console. Steadman listens. Through speakers:
C: VITTI
D: You want me to whack my doctor?
E: V.O.
C: MASIELLO
D: If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
E: V.O.
C: VITTI
D: No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?
E: V.O.
N: Then the technician plays an altered version.
C: VITTI
D: You want me to whack my doctor?
E: V.O.
C: MASIELLO
D: If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.

E: V.O. after a beat
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Steadman shuts off a tape recorder, having just played the altered tape for a stunned Ben and Laura. A long beat, then Ben looks up at the agents.

E: quietly
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JIMMY'S CAR - SAME TIME
N: Jimmy is parked at the corner watching the Sobol house as the three FBI agents leave.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. OLD LION SOCIAL CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Masiello is face to face with Vitti.
C: MASIELLO
D: Paul, he talked to the Feds.
C: VITTI
D: I know this guy. He would never talk to the Feds.
N: Jelly's CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. He steps away and answers it quietly during the following.
C: MASIELLO
D: The FBI was at his house today.
C: JIMMY
D: It's the truth. I saw 'em.
C: MASIELLO
D: You'll see. Next thing is he's gonna call you and ask for a meeting.
C: VITTI
D: Come on. You don't know this guy.
N: Jelly covers the phone and turns to Vitti.
C: JELLY
D: It's Dr. Sobol. He says he needs to see you right away.
N: Vitti nods.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
N: Ben waits on a deserted corner in Brooklyn. A black Town Car appears and stops to pick him up. The windows are heavily tinted. Ben takes a deep breath, crosses to the car and opens the back door.
S: EXT. JELLY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Ben finds Jelly sitting in the back seat next to Vitti.
C: JELLY
D: Sit up front with Jimmy.
C: BEN
D: You want me to sit in front? Paul usually sits in front.
E: anxiously
C: JIMMY
D: So this time you'll sit up front. Why you making a federal case?
C: BEN
D: Federal case? I'm not making a federal case? Let's go.
E: getting in the car
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARETTI'S RESTAURANT (JERSEY CITY) - LATER
N: A waiter pours red wine. Ben is eating out of pure anxiety. Jelly and Jimmy watch him intently. Vitti stares off.
C: BEN
D: Wow, this is really good. Delicious. I love Italian food. I've never been to Italy but I'd love to go. I've been to France. And Jamaica. That's nice, but I'm sure it's very different from Italy. A whole different, uh -- So what's everybody doing this summer?
E: prattling nervously silence
N: Carlo Mangano comes to the table. Vitti gets up, hugs and fraternal kisses all around, then Mangano sits down with them.
C: VITTI
D: This is Ben. He's a friend of mine. Say hello to Carlo Mangano.
E: to Ben
C: MANGANO
D: How you doin'?
C: VITTI
D: Carlo was on my father's crew. He's always been like a -- I don't know -- like a cousin to me.
E: to Ben
C: MANGANO
D: I am your cousin.
C: VITTI
D: I know, that's what I'm saying. It's like a family thing. The closeness.
C: MANGANO
D: Anything you need, anything I can do for you, Paul, you know. I'm here for you.
C: VITTI
D: I know. So did you take care of that thing I asked you about?
C: MANGANO
D: Is it all right to talk business in front of your friend?
C: VITTI
D: It's okay.
C: MANGANO
D: Yeah, I took care of it.
C: VITTI
D: How about that other thing?
C: MANGANO
D: I'm waiting for that first thing to come through. I can't move until it does.
C: VITTI
D: Did the guy give you a problem?
C: MANGANO
D: A little. He's a lunatic.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FBI VAN - SAME TIME

D: What did he say?
E: V.O.
C: MANGANO
D: The usual.
E: V.O.
C: VITTI
D: Did you tell him you weren't going for it?
E: V.O.
C: MANGANO
D: What was I gonna do?
E: V.O.
N: BACK IN PARETTI'S
C: VITTI
D: You always gotta nip that shit in the bud.
C: MANGANO
D: Yeah. But if the first thing is okay, that should fix everything.
C: VITTI
D: Including the second thing.
C: MANGANO
D: Yeah, but --
C: VITTI
D: Exactly. Don't repeat any of that to anyone.
E: to Ben
C: BEN
D: What? The first thing or the second thing?
C: VITTI
D: That's Stevie Beef over there. I gotta go say hello to him for a second. Come on.
E: to Mangano
N: Ben watches Vitti and Mangano cross the room, then turns to Jelly and Jimmy.
C: BEN
D: Stevie Beef. Interesting name. When he was younger they probably called him Stevie Veal. You guys come here often?
E: off no response
C: JELLY
D: Paretti's has a very special meaning to Paul.
C: JIMMY
D: Yeah, this is where his father got whacked.
C: JELLY
D: Hey!
C: JIMMY
D: What's the big secret?
C: BEN
D: Wait a second. Paul's father was murdered?
E: incredulous
C: JIMMY
D: Right at that table. With his whole family there.
C: JELLY
D: Hey, just shut up.
C: BEN
D: Paul, too? He was there?
C: JELLY
D: He don't like to talk about it.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENT LATER

S: INT. STALL - SAME TIME
N: Ben hastily unbuttons his shirt, revealing a small microphone taped to his chest. He picks at the edge of the tape, takes a deep breath, then rips it off.
C: BEN
D: Ahhhh!
N: JELLY at the urinal, reacts to Ben's cry.
C: JELLY
D: You need more roughage. A bran muffin in the morning would help with that.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PARETTI'S - BACK AT TABLE - FEW MINUTES LATER
N: Ben and Jelly rejoin Vitti. Ben starts right in on him.
C: BEN
D: I have to talk to you -- in private.
C: VITTI
D: Leave us alone.
E: to Jelly and Jimmy
N: They exit without hesitation.
C: BEN
D: Why didn't you tell me about your father?
C: VITTI
D: What about him?
C: BEN
D: You said he died of a heart attack.
C: VITTI
D: So what's the problem?
C: BEN
D: What's the problem? Your father was murdered!
C: VITTI
D: Heart attack, murdered, what's the difference? He's dead.
C: BEN
D: There's a big difference. Why didn't you tell me?
C: VITTI
D: Because it's private. You think I tell you every little thing?
C: BEN
D: That is not a little thing!
C: VITTI
D: Okay, you want to know? Analyze this. I was twelve years old, the whole family was having dinner together right over there, two guys walked in and shot him dead right in front of us. Okay?
C: BEN
D: And you didn't think this was important enough to tell me?
C: VITTI
D: What am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life crying about the past? Forget about it.
C: BEN
D: You know what? I think you want to talk about it.
C: VITTI
D: No, I don't want to talk about it.
C: BEN
D: I think you do.
C: VITTI
D: No, I don't.
C: BEN
D: Then why did you choose this restaurant?
C: VITTI
D: 'Cause I like it, okay?
N: ANALYZE THIS - Rev. 6/25/98 99.
C: BEN
D: Of all the places we could've gone, why this one?
C: VITTI
D: White clam sauce. The best.
C: BEN
D: No, we're here because you wanted me to know about your father. You're reaching out to me.
C: VITTI
D: I'll reach out to you --
N: Vitti suddenly reaches over and rips Ben's shirt open. All he sees is a bald patch on Ben's chest where the bug was taped.
C: BEN
D: I think we have some major trust issues here.
T: CUT TO:
S: 78A INT. SINDONE HEADQUARTERS - SAME TIME 78A
N: The cutting room is deserted except for Primo and his men. Sindone is at his desk reading the entertainment section of the New York Times.
C: SINDONE
D: I'd like to see a movie but there's nothing out there. It's all this shoot-'em-up action bullshit. I get enough of that at work.
E: studying the paper
N: They all laugh. Moony finishes a call on his cell phone.
C: MOONY
D: That was our friend. He marked your guy at Paretti's.
C: SINDONE
D: Yeah? Then let's make it the last supper. Jack?
C: HANDSOME JACK
D: You got it, Primo. Let's go.
E: to Potatoes
N: ANALYZE THIS - Rev. 6/25/98 99A. 78A CONTINUED: 78A

N: Ben looks to Vitti for help.
C: VITTI
D: Do what he says.
C: BEN
D: You know, we call this a transference neurosis. It's when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world. It's usually considered a good sign. Not for me, in this case, but --

N: Vitti leans back against the car, slumps to the ground and starts sobbing, 35 years of pent-up grief finally finding expression. JELLY AND JIMMY Standing around smoking, waiting for the death shot.
C: JIMMY
D: What's taking so long? I'm ruining my goddamn shoes here. Fuckin' $350 Bruno Maglis.
C: JELLY
D: What's wrong with you? Don't you have any respect? This is a very difficult thing for Paul.
C: JIMMY
D: Shoulda let me do it. I'd be home watchin' E.S.P.N.2 by now. World's strongest man. You should see these guys.
N: VITTI AND BEN Ben is comforting Vitti.
C: BEN
D: You couldn't save him, Paul. He was trying to save you. That's what you fought about. He didn't want this for you, and you don't want it for Anthony. You don't want him to grow up the way you did -- without a father.
N: Vitti just cries louder. JELLY AND JIMMY hearing the crying.
C: JELLY
D: Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart.
C: JIMMY
D: Why doesn't he just pop him? It's embarrassing.
N: ANALYZE THIS - Rev. 6/10/98 106A. BEN AND VITTI Ben tries to comfort Vitti who is still crying.

C: BEN
D: Paul! For God's sake, shoot somebody!

HANDSOME JACK He sees Potatoes fall and starts moving out, covering his retreat with another BURST from his MACHINE GUN. JELLY'S CAR Something snaps inside Ben.
C: BEN
D: Goddamn it!
N: He takes the GUN out of Vitti's hand and starts FIRING WILDLY. JELLY He sees Handsome Jack emerge from cover and takes him out with FIVE QUICK SHOTS. HANDSOME JACK He goes down FIRING, dead before he hits the ground. SCRAP YARD It's suddenly quiet. After a long moment, Jimmy rolls over and moans. Jelly goes to him and starts examining his wound. JELLY'S CAR Ben stands up, still holding Vitti's gun. He sees Handsome Jack lying dead on the ground.
C: BEN
D: Oh my God! Did I do that?
C: JELLY
D: No, Doc. That one's mine. You got the Chevy Camaro and the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.
N: Vitti emerges from behind the car looking red-eyed but composed again and looks at Ben.
C: VITTI
D: Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it? You can give me back the gun now, Doctor.
N: Vitti holds out his hand. Ben hesitates for a moment, then hands him the gun.
C: VITTI
D: It's okay. I wasn't really gonna whack you. All right, maybe I was gonna whack you, but I was real conflicted about it. Progress, right?
E: off Jelly's skeptical look
C: BEN
D: I don't think I can see you anymore.
C: VITTI

N: ELAINE, a fortyish, tired-looking wife and mother sits on the couch across from Ben. Ben looks bored and depressed.
C: ELAINE
D: I want to please him in bed, but whatever I do it seems like it's never enough. Now he wants me to say things when we're making love.
C: BEN
D: What kinds of things does he want you to say, Elaine?
C: ELAINE
D: Well, he wants me to call him 'big boy.' And he's my bucking bronco, and I'm supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet.
N: Michael's laughter is heard coming through the vent. Ben closes his eyes and sighs deeply.
C: ELAINE
D: Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?
C: BEN
D: Let me suggest something, Elaine. If the man wants you to say things ... damn it, you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if that's going to get the job done. Break out the wine, baby. Smoke a joint. Do what you have to do, because life is too short. It's just too fucking short.

C: BEN
D: Can't someone else in the family go for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie the Lip? What about you? You go?
C: JELLY
D: That would work except for one little detail. I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it. You have to go.
E: a beat
C: BEN
D: Me? You must be a moron.
N: 100A CONTINUED: 100A
C: JELLY
D: Hey! Watch that.
C: BEN
D: You just said it yourself.
C: JELLY
D: It's different when I say it. When you say it, it sounds very negative.
C: BEN
D: I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting --
N: He turns to go back into the hotel.
C: JELLY
D: Doc.
N: Ben feels a gun pressed against his back. BEN You can't shoot me, Jelly.
C: JELLY
D: Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't shoot you. But here's something about me you should know. I never got married, Doctor Sobol. I don't have a hobby. I never got a dog or a cat. I don't even have a goldfish. I live for one reason only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and he's what I'm thinking about when I close my eyes to sleep. If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would I do it, I would hope to survive so I could do it again and again until he told me to stop. This is all I know. This is all I got. So please don't think I won't kill you, because I'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one. You're going to that meeting.

N: Ben looks away nervously.
C: BEN
D: I can't do this.
E: to Jelly, borderline hysterical
N: He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down. Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.
C: MOONY
D: All right, gentlemen. I think we better start. We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags.
N: Laughter around the table. Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben.
C: SINDONE
D: I'm Primo Sindone. They call me Sonny Long. It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. I see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today. All I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows.
N: Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.
C: JELLY
D: Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment.
E: stands up, rattled
C: SINDONE
D: Detained? What kind of bullshit is that? What's more important than this? As the host of this meeting, I take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here.
C: JELLY
D: Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect. The thing is, he's not feeling well. He's sick and he -- didn't feel well --
N: Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face.
C: BEN
D: Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr. Vitti's health outside the family. You know better.

D: All right, who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here?
C: BEN
D: In answer to your first question, my name is Ben Sobol -- -- leone. Sobboleone. They call me -- 'The doctor.' As for your second question. I'm here representing Paul Vitti. As his conser -- conghili --
E: off Sindone's look
C: JELLY
D: Consigliere --

D: Don't you ever correct me again! As his consigliere, I'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and I'm prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti on all matters.
E: slaps him again
C: SINDONE
D: Okay, Doctor, then let's get down to business. Everybody knows there's been this thing between me and Paul Vitti for a long time.
C: BEN
D: Which thing are you talking about? The first thing or the second thing?
C: SINDONE
D: What second thing? I only know one thing.
C: BEN
D: Well, I don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing. Didn't you talk to the guy?
N: He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.
C: SINDONE
D: What guy?
C: BEN
D: The guy with the thing.
C: SINDONE
D: What thing? What the fuck are you talking about?
C: BEN
D: How should I know? You brought it up. This is the whole problem. You can't have an intelligent conversation with the man.
E: gestures helplessly to the others
C: SINDONE
D: How about if I just break your fuckin' neck? What do you think of that?
C: BEN
D: It's not important what I think. What do you think?
C: SINDONE
D: What do I think? I think it's a good idea! Why would I say it if I didn't think it was good?
C: BEN
D: I don't know. Why would you?
C: SINDONE
D: I wouldn't! That's what I'm saying!
E: frustrated
C: BEN
D: Have you always had a problem dealing with your anger?
C: SINDONE
D: What are you talking about?
C: BEN
D: What do you think I'm talking about?
C: SINDONSINDONE
D: I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
E: explodes
C: BEN
D: See, you're angry again. Do you feel you have to get angry to be heard?
N: Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, FRANK ZELLO and JOE BALDASSARE.
C: SINDONE
D: What's he talking about?
C: ZELLO
D: I don't know. But you do have a tendency to get angry a lot.
C: BALDASSARE
D: I agree, Primo.
C: SINDONE
D: I'm trying to talk about Vitti! Why are we talking about me?
C: BEN
D: Interesting. Do you feel you're not worthy enough to be talked about?
C: SINDONE
D: What does that mean?
C: BEN
D: What do you think it means?
C: SINDONE
D: Fuck you!
C: ZELLO
D: Primo, calm down.
C: SINDONE
D: Calm down? How can I calm down when this prick won't stop with the questions?
C: BEN
D: Could you pass the fruit, please?
C: SINDONE
D: That's it! You're a dead man!

C: VITTI
D: Primo!
E: O.S.
N: All eyes turn. PAUL VITTI He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent. Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben. Jelly gets up to greet him.
C: VITTI
D: Wait outside with the car running.
E: quietly, to Jelly
N: Jelly nods and exits.
C: BEN
D: What are you doing here?
C: VITTI
D: Saving your ass. Sit down. I'll take it from here.
N: Ben sits, greatly relieved.
C: VITTI
D: I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was late. Those of you who know me will know I meant no disrespect. If it's all right with you, there's something I'd like to say, then I'll leave you to your business.
E: to the group
N: Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and clarity he's never seen before.
C: VITTI
D: About two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, Dominic Manetta.
N: He looks straight at Sindone.
C: SINDONE
D: Don't look at me. Everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything.
C: VITTI
D: What I really came here to say is that I've come to a very important decision in my life. I want out.
N: A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room. Ben looks at him proudly.
C: VITTI
D: I'm going away for a while, but I will respect the oath I took the day I was made, and whatever I know about anyone else's business, I take with me to the grave. You have my word.
N: A negative buzz among the bosses.
C: VITTI
D: As for my own organization, I know Carlo Mangano would like to be the new boss.
N: Mangano smiles gratefully.
C: MANGANO
D: Thank you, Paul.
C: VITTI
D: That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in Miami.
N: Mangano is stunned.
C: VITTI
D: But I leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. And even though it's my right, I won't take revenge, mostly because I'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me.
C: ZELLO
D: I don't know, Paul. I can see where some people might have a problem with this.
E: perplexed
C: VITTI
D: I realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, I've taken the liberty of writing down everything I know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family.
N: There's a long tense silence while the other bosses consider all this. Then, finally --
C: ZELLO
D: I don't know what anybody else thinks, but I say good luck and God bless, Paul.
C: BALDASSARE
D: Good luck, Paul. Salut.
N: They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti. Ben raises his glass to Vitti and drinks.
C: BEN
D: Well done.
E: to Vitti
N: Vitti smiles at him and drinks.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the car. Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the MOTOR RUNNING, and Jimmy is in the front seat with him.
C: VITTI
D: Let's move.
N: Sindone and Mangano come out with guns drawn, flanked by two wise guys.
C: SINDONE
D: Vitti!
N: Vitti and his crew turn and face Sindone and Mangano across the parking lot.
C: VITTI
D: I don't want to do this, Primo.
C: SINDONE
D: You don't want to do this? That's fuckin' rich. What did you think, you could just quit and walk away? You think this is a fuckin' civil service job? What are you, crazy?
C: VITTI
D: Not anymore. Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were?
E: to Mangano
N: Mangano stares at him, cold and hard.
C: MANGANO
D: I'm not gonna stab you in the back, Paul. I want to see your face when I do it.
C: VITTI
D: I don't think so. Mo-Mo!
E: calls out
N: Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at Mangano and Sindone.
C: VITTI
D: Bigs!
N: Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an assault rifle.
C: VITTI
D: Eddie!
N: The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod.
C: VITTI
D: It's over, Primo. Now get the fuck outta here.
N: Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano and the soldiers. Vitti and Ben relax.
C: BEN
D: Good thinking. I was going to bring a machine gun but I don't have one. Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet.
N: Suddenly, Sindone whirls and FIRES at Vitti. Ben staggers in front of Vitti and takes the bullet in the shoulder.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: The assembled bosses hear the sound of GUNFIRE outside. Zello looks at Baldassare.
C: ZELLO
D: Oh, shit.
N: The bosses all jump up and run for the exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
N: As the GUN BATTLE CONTINUES, Sindone jumps into a car and tries to escape, but Eddie Cokes RIPS his car with the MACHINE GUN, stopping it dead. 113A GATES 113A An NYPD armored assault vehicle bursts through the gates. Police cruisers and SWAT vans come racing up to the scene, SIRENS SHRIEKING. Then, from out of the sky, the FBI helicopter descends, blaring a warning.
C: AGENT STEADMAN
D: Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground. I repeat. Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground.
E: V.O. on a loudspeaker
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Bosses and fat capos go running through the alleys and clambering over fences in their silk suits and expensive loafers.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Agent Ricci, wearing a flak jacket and FBI baseball cap, has Sindone down on the ground with his foot on Primo's neck and a .45 aimed at his head.
C: AGENT RICCI
D: Don't move! Don't you fucking move!
E: screaming
C: SINDONE
D: Hey! Take a pill, Robocop.
N: Vitti is tending to Ben who is on the ground leaning against the side of the limo.
C: VITTI
D: I can't believe it. You took a bullet for me. What doctor ever did that much for a patient? I'll never forget that.
E: deeply moved
C: BEN
D: Paul -- I tripped.
C: VITTI
D: Yeah. You tripped over your unconscious.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - MANY WEEKS LATER
N: It's a beautiful summer day. Convicts are playing basketball and lounging in the yard.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON LIBRARY - SAME TIME
N: Ben in a sport coat, and Vitti, in prison whites, are sitting around in a circle with several other convicts. DONNY, a heavyweight con with a shaved head and numerous tattoos is talking.
C: DONNY
D: I don't think my mother really listens when I talk. She never listened.
C: VITTI
D: And how does that make you feel?
C: DONNY
D: It makes me feel angry.
C: VITTI
D: I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't you?
C: DONNY
D: Yes, I do.
E: suddenly vulnerable
C: BEN
D: Paul, what would you say about what Donny's feeling?
C: VITTI
D: Donny, when you're thirsty, you don't go to the wall -- you go to the well. You know what I'm saying? Your mother may never be able to listen to you, but you have friends here who will. Okay?
N: Ben is proud of Vitti's new sensitivity.
C: BEN
D: And be patient, Donny. Most people's problems take months, sometimes years to resolve.
C: DONNY
D: I'm doing twenty-five to life.
C: BEN
D: That should be plenty of time.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - LATER
N: Ben and Vitti have just left the therapy group.
C: BEN
D: You know they found Primo Sindone dead in a field near LaGuardia.
C: VITTI
D: I heard. I had nothing to do with it. There were guys lined up from Canarsie to Atlantic City who wanted to whack that bastard.
E: off Ben's look
C: BEN
D: Okay, just checking.
C: VITTI
D: You know, Doc, I don't think I ever thanked you properly for curing me.
C: BEN
D: We don't say 'cured.' We say you had a 'corrective emotional experience.'
C: VITTI
D: You, you, you're very good.
C: BEN
D: No. You. You.
E: pointing
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SOBOL BACK YARD - NIGHT
N: Ben and Laura are dancing in the yard. Paper lanterns are hung here and there. A bottle of champagne sits open on the table. A great TONY BENNETT SONG can be heard playing.
C: BEN
D: Happy?
C: LAURA
D: I just can't get used to it.
C: BEN
D: What?
C: LAURA
D: It's been three weeks since the last time you were kidnapped. I don't know if I can adjust.
N: They kiss as the SONG ENDS. Ben turns and speaks to someone O.S.
C: BEN
D: What do you say, Tony? One more?
N: TONY BENNETT and his trio are set up on the back porch.
C: TONY BENNETT
D: Whatever you want, Dr. Sobol. My friend told me to stay as long as you wanted me. What do you want to hear, Mrs. Sobol?
C: LAURA
D: Your choice, Tony.
C: TONY BENNETT
D: I was hoping you'd say that. 'World on a String,' fellas.
E: quietly, to trio
N: Tony sings "I've Got the World on a String" as Ben and Laura continue to dance. The CAMERA PANS UP and we see Michael smiling and shooting video from his bedroom window, then the CAMERA PANS UP TO a starry sky, and we...
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
