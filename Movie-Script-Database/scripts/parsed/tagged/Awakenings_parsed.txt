N: 1. A dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset. Only there is something unsettling about it all. The colors are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective. Pulling slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden picture frame ...
S: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1930
N: Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room. Across Venetian blinds, open, letting in moonlight, across intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and comic books, across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth, and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to the rhythm of the metronome, the word, " L E O N A R D . "
S: 2. INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING - 1930
N: The pendulum of a clock. An adult hand placing a bowl of cereal on a table. Leonard, ten or eleven, waits a moment for the adult to leave, grasps his spoon, and manipulates it from bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the clock.
S: 3. EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - MORNING - 1930 3.
N: Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy his age, a classmate, move along a street. All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk, the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic pounding of an elevator train. As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the ground.
S: 4. INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930
N: An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard. Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson. All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are trembling slightly and whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack of rhythms. A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk. The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently tapping the end of his pen against his desk. Leonard, "guided" by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write. (o The teacher's hand at the blackboard hesitates. Distracted by 4. the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences him with a look. Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined than the last, until they begin melding together into what resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean waves. The teacher resumes chalking on the board. The boy from the train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean waves," to form recognizable letters.and words. The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the irritating noise. The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing again becomes formless.
S: 5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930
N: The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom, o at his desk grading the penmanship lesson. He circles offending errors on the last page of the last composition book. He scribbles a grade opposite the student's name in a grade book. He notices the absence of a grade in Leonard's column. . Leonard's desk. The teacher locates the missing composition book buried under textbooks. He takes it back to his own desk, opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or rather Leonard's illegible representation of it. He considers earlier lessons in the book. He begins to see in the script a pattern of deterioration. He reaches the last entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning In "the waves."
S: 6. INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - DAY - 1930 - WINTER
N: The painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime novels. The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight. Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house:
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: When can I see him?
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: When he's well.
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) Pg.3
C: 6.C0NT. BOY'S VOICE 6.CONT,
D: When will he be well? After a moment --
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: I don't know. -- and the sound of a door closing. A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below. Leonard's friend, crossing it, glances back . . . then disappears around a corner. And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light.
T: FADE TO BLACK
S: 6A. EXT. BAINBRIDGE -HOSPITAL - THE. BRONX - DAY - 1970 . 6A
N: Tight on the face of a man (SAYER), late thirties, glasses, staring up at the face of a building, imposing in its institutional dullness.
S: 6B. INT. LOBBY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY 6B.
N: A dim, sleepy cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard operator thumbing through a magazine. Echoing footsteps reach her station and she glances up and at the man from outside.
C: OPERATOR
D: Yes?
S: 7. INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
N: He seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the suit. Or the place. Or the situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he's in. When he does finally speak, it's with great sincerity --
C: SAYER
D: When you say people ... you mean living people, . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what?
C: DIRECTOR
D: Living people, yes. Patients.
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) Pg.4 7.C0NT. 7. There's some mistake. And Sayer's chair begins to feel more * uncomfortable. He tries to clear up the confusion -
C: SAYER
D: I ' m here for the research * position . . . in your neurology * lab.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Neurology lab? He doesn't laugh at Sayer, just at the thought of it.
C: DIRECTOR
D: We have an x-ray room. Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it. Kaufman seems * to have less time for this, and in plain English, unadorned - *
C: KAUFMAN
D: - The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist. . Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he * knows about the world is wrong. f
C: DIRECTOR
D: A doctor ... doctor. The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands, Sayer's resume.
E: pause
C: DIRECTOR
D: The Camel Institute. Tell me * about that, anything with patients * there? Or . . . *
C: SAYER
D: Earthworms. The Director isn't sure he heard right.
E: burying it
C: DIRECTOR
D: Sorry? ,
C: SAYER
D: It was an immense project. " I was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms.
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) Pg.5 7.C0NT. DIRECTOR 7. (pause) Really.
C: SAYER
D: I was on it for five years. I was the only one who really believed in it. The rest of them said it couldn't be done. t
C: KAUFMAN
D: It can't.
C: SAYER
D: Well, I know that now. I proved it. The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Maybe before. At Saint Thomas. All research. Earth - ?
E: Sayer is already shaking his head no
C: SAYER
D: Pigs brains . . . theyre quite similar to human brains.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Are they?
E: hopefully
C: SAYER
D: Oh, yes . . . three years. As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business being here. He should leave.
C: SAYER
D: Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here. Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background. He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out. But the * director keeps searching the resume.
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) Pg.6 7.C0NT. SAYER . 7. I've taken enough of your time. You must have a hundred applicants more suitable.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Thanks anyway.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Back in medical school ... Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says, No, we're not that desperate.
C: DIRECTOR
D: I mean, you couldn't have graduated without some clinical experience. . Sayer hesitates. And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a n od ., v'
C: DIRECTOR
D: Well, there we are, doctor. Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says, We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director.
C: DIRECTOR
D: You do want the job, don't you? Sayer isn't so sure. He thinks about it long and hard . . .
E: not far from v begging
S: 8. INT. CORRIDOR - BAINBRIDGE - DAY 8.
N: Moving along a corridor crowded "with patients, some ambulatory, some in wheelchairs, "living people" living with profound neurological disease.
C: ANTHONY O.S.
D: Spent much time in chronic hospitals, doctor? A patient approaches, and, passing Sayer and the orderly who's escorting him , offers - FEMALE PATIENT 1 Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . . .
E: ANTHONY
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) pg.7 8.C0NT. ANTHONY 8. (to Sayer) You'd remember.
C: SAYER
D: I guess not. As they pass an old patient in a wheelchair -
C: ANTHONY
D: Hey, how you doing? Dr. Sullivan. Staying on the old patient, he eventually manages, too late -
E: calling to someone down the hall
C: OLD PATIENT
D: Fn ... ie Down the hall in an alcove, Dr. Sullivan glances up long sufferingly from-a.patient~with'.an .Ouij a-board who !.s mumbling, * complaining, unintelligibly. Anthony and Sayer arrrive.
C: ANTHONY
D: Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer;
N: There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's been here too long.
C: SULLIVAN
D: Not the neurologist, that'd be asking too much. You're not the neurologist.
C: SAYER
D: I think I am. Sayer extends his hand. Instead of shaking it -
C: SULLIVAN
D: Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake. - Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand. 9. OMITTED 9. 10. INT. DAYROOM - DAY 10. A woman in a wheelchair uttering high-pitched screams . Sayer in a lab coat trying to calm her.
E: A FEMALE PATIENT 2
N: REV.12/15/89 (GREEN) Pg.7 10.CONT. SAYER . 10. They're just pencils, pens. He tries to prove it to her by removing one of them from the pocket of his white coat. Screaming louder at the sight of it, she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being beaten senseless.
S: 11. INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY 11.
N: A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice - MALE PATIENT 1 X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae, New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided a£ the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the* hell >are.*v.ou? .
S: 12. INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY 12.
N: Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it. Glancing at the chart in his hand -
C: SAYER
D: Mrs. Cohen?
C: MRS. COHEN
D: Hes here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means.
C: SAYER
D: I 'm here. To examine you.
E: pause
C: MRS. COHEN
D: Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home.
N: (6 Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her and crosses the room to a nurse.
C: SAYER
D: Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13. OMITTED .
S: 14. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE- LATER - DAY
N: Silence. Institutional beige walls. Glass cabinets, locked, containing medical instruments. A metal examination table with leather straps. Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still unsettled from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it. It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way, sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash over his face as he stares out absently at children on an elementary school playground beyond a debris-strewn field.
C: MISS COSTELLO O.S.
D: It gets easier. Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all. She's standing in the doorway.
E: a matter of fact
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: You don't think it will, but it does. A moment and she A urns and leaves.
S: 14A. EXT. TENEMENT (LUCY'S) - ESTABLISH - DAY 15. INT. TENEMENT - NEW YORK.- DAY 1
N: The needle of a Victrola clawing at the endless music-less inner bands of a 78 . . . .* . Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette table. A puddle of coffee on the floor. Ceramic shards, a broken cup. . An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs of a discarded marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a shuttered living room. Furniture from another era and the clutter of a lifetime. A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola. Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and preposterously still. The back of her head is flat and bald, the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades. On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses. Insane or retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just barely audibly, a melody.
C: SAYER'S VOICE
D: Can you hear me? .
S: 16. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY
N: Distant music of children's laughter. Perhaps real, emanating from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote region of the woman's damaged mind. Arrested of all movement, she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan.
C: SAYER'S VOICE
D: Do you know where you are? Do you remember being brought here? Do you know what has happened? If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere , cut adrift by her illness, living in a private world .
E: nothing back nothing back or nowhere or hell
C: SAYER'S VOICE
D: Can you hear me? Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes. Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable. .
N: REV. 12/5/89 (BLUE) Pg.-lO 16.CONT. 16. Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from it. He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are loose, bent out of shape*-- and gently slides the temples back over her ears. He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood. The form in the machine, at the top, reads -- BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in a lower section headed -- FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS. He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand clutching the glasses. She is not moving, but she has moved. That, or she is dead. Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face. He studies her for a moment, and for that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her. He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the floor. He waits. She doesn't retrieve them. He picks them up and holds them out to her. She doesn't move to take them. He lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the instant before they hit the floor. Sayer just stares.
C: SAYER«S VOICE
D: Her name is Lucy Fishman . . .
S: 16B. INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 16B.
N: Dr. Kaufman, the hospital's Chief of Medicine, notices a number of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on his way into Sayer's examination room -
C: SAYER'S VOICE
D: She was found by neighbors with * her sister, several days after the , sister had died . . .
S: 17. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 17.
N: The same room as before. The same woman. All that has changed is the light. It's late afternoon.
C: SAYER
D: According to the neighbors, * she's never set foot outside her * apartment, has no other living * relatives, and has always been the * way she is now - without any * comprehension or response. *
E: CONT'D
N: Kaufman tries to feign interest. He glances to the others 1 Sayer has summoned to the room -- two other doctors, Tyler and Sullivan, and Miss Costello.
C: SAYER
D: And yet . . . Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it. And stays there, stiff, still. Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --
C: DR. KAUFMAN
D: A reflex.
C: SAYER
D: If she batted it away I might call that a reflex. She doesn't bat it away, she catches it.
C: DR. KAUFMAN
D: - It's still a reflex.
C: SAYER
D: I'm sorry, if you were right I'd agree with you. Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment. Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any.
C: SAYER
D: It's as if . . . having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball. Awkward silence. Eventually--
C: DR. TYLER
D: The "will of the ball?" Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd.
C: DR. SULLIVAN
D: Excuse me. Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room. So does Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.
N: DR. KAUFMAN . I (hopefully) You're trying to make a good impression. That's it, isn't it? You're still settling in. Sayer isn't sure if he should agree or not. He does neither.
C: DR. KAUFMAN
D: Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr. Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow?
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: Yes, sir.
C: DR. KAUFMAN
D: Good night. Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy, looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one, doesn't.
S: 18. EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: C'\ Sayer climbs into his Toyota and, as he buckles his seat belt, -*© recites in a mumble to himself --
C: SAYER
D: One . . . . Two . . . Three . . . Four . . . Five. Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his window. He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down.
E: he turns the key puts on sunglasses releases the brake shifts out of 'park'
C: SAYER
D: What'd I forget?
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: I just wanted to say to you I preferred your explanation. () It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to.
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: And that I'll look after things for you until you've "settled in." Good night, doctor. She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard. To it eventually, quietly --
C: SAYER
D: Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection --
C: SAYER
D: Thank you very much.
S: 18A. EXT. SAMMY'S FISH GROTTO - ESTABLISH - NIGHT 18A. 19. INT. SAMMY'S GROTTO, CITY ISLAND, THE BRONX - NIGHT 19.
N: Sayer at a table eating dinner alone. He should've brought along something to read. He glances at the little "Catch of the Day" notice on his table for the tenth time, then absently in at an eel in a fish tank, which seems to be peering back out at him.
C: SIDNEY V.O.
D: I am not mad ... not mad . . .
S: 20. EXT. SCHOOLYARD & BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - DAY 20.
N: A tether ball dangling from a rope, resting against a pole. The chains of a swing. Pigeons scavenging scraps on the asphalt of the elementary school playground, deserted.
C: SIDNEY V.O.
D: I know the difference between what is real and what is not . . . Beyond a chain-link fence, across the field, on the roof of one of Bainbridge's brick buildings, peering down from the edge of it, coat over his smock, hat on his head, an elderly man.
S: 21. INT. SIDNEY'S DAYROOM - DAY 21.
N: Tight on the elderly man's face.
C: SIDNEY
D: The voice was real.
N: REV.12/12/89 (PINK) Pg.14 21.C0NT. 21. Sayer nods in agreement though he is not altogether as certain of tne claim. They are in a ward crowded with many patients who are mad, obviously and irretrievably so.
C: SAYER
D: What did the voice say?
C: SIDNEY
D: "Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat, go up to the roof and jump off."
C: SAYER
D: Did you recognize it as belonging to a person? Or was it just a voice? Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously ... then smiles slyly. *
C: SIDNEY
D: You don't deny it was you. *
C: SAYER
D: Me? Sayer is taken aback. As is Sidney. One of them, and Sidney believes he knows which, is lying or crazy. ' ' * SAYER ' . I do deny it. It wasn't me. It wasn't real. We've only just now met, sir. » Sidney, suddenly completely disoriented, withdraws.
E: pause
C: SIDNEY
D: If that's true . . . I'm in a predicament.
S: 22. INT. STAFF CAFETERIA - BAINBRIDGE - DAY 22.
N: Sayer in line with Drs. Tyler and Sullivan, both younger than * himself. He seems distracted, Sayer, lost in the color of the beets on his tray. Or a thought. Like George telling Lenny again about the rabbits:
C: DR. SULLIVAN
D: We'd be high up - 40th, 50th floor, nice midtown view - suite * of offices, carpeted, good-looking * receptionist - *
N: REV.12/12/89 (PINK) Pg.15 22.CONT. DR. TYLER 22 fp\ Aquarium in the waiting room, \_J) George. ,
C: DR. SULLIVAN
D: We could have all that ... but we'd miss all this. We'd miss the wards.
C: DR. TYLER
D: The smell of them.
C: DR. SULLIVAN
D: We'd miss this place - We'd miss this . . . Whatever this is. .
E: this cafeteria the plate of mush as it's set down onto his tray
C: SAYER
D: Ye .... Sayer glances up at them, having paid attention to nothing they've said, and nods at some other thought. . ' SAYER Yes . . . ,' He leaves his tray where he stands, and heads out of the cafeteria. v
S: 23. INT. SIDNEY'S DAYROOM - DAY 23.
N: Sayer back with Sidney.
C: SAYER
D: Did you see me when-1 "spoke?" Sidney thinks about it, tries to remember, to summon back the moment in question, to picture it exactly as it happened, or didn't happen.
C: SIDNEY
D: No.
C: SAYER
D: You see me now though.
C: SIDNEY
D: Yes.
N: REV.12/12/89 (PINK) Pg.l5 23.CONT, (continuity only) Sidney turns to a patient, an elderly woman in a wheelchair beside him. Her state resembles that of Lucy's, that is, she appears to have no awareness of Sidney, Sayer, or anything else in her environment. It is only now, in fact, as Sidney spoons soup into her mouth, careful not to spill any, that Sayer notices her. sr^ SAY ER (y--\ I f it ha p pe n s ag a in , M r.

N: REV. 10/13/89 p. 17 He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper. (P\ Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move. Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket, hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go. The man, lightning quick, catches it.
S: 25. INT. ANOT HE R DAYRO OM ( B) - L ATE R - DAY 2 5.
N: Another man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a television set with a horizontal hold problem. Sayer drags a chair over, stands on it, adjusts the set, corrects it, gets a picture . . . but the man's "attention" slowly drifts away. Sayer "read justs" it, gets the jumping horizontal lines again, and the man's vacant eyes return.
S: 26. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY . 26.
N: Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs. It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness. Sayer considers her from all angles as one considers an abstract art piece that baff les but in trigues. Unlike the others, she's on her feet. A nd unlike the others, she seems, to Sayer, to have been headed somewhere before turning to stone again. He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that has arrested her progress. He moves the table. In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And another. And another before encountering and being "blocked" by an empty wheelchair. She stops. Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again. Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her. Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost" (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive. "At" Sayer.

C: MISS COSTELLO
D: "Atypical Hysteria," this one. Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of the file. "No change since last examination" it reads. He turns the page. "No change, no therapy recommended." He turns the page, the last entry. "No change." The date, "11/9/44."

Accompanying the text are grainy black and white photographs taken in an old operating theatre. An anatomical skeleton, a doctor in a white coat, subjects-- men, women and children with haunting eyes.

He smiles at a thought, at once wistful and bitter.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: That's the problem with a unique disease. Once it no longer rages, I'm telling you, it becomes very unfashionable. . He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: What would I be without this thing? A man with a1 shred of dignity le_ft.

D: God forbid, no. He lights a cigarette, coughs and puts it out.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: How many have you found there?
C: SAYER
D: Five. So far. I think there may be more. The old doctor nods. He has the torn look of someone reminded of an unfaithful lover just when he'd managed to forget about her. He wants and doesn't want to know how they're doing. Finally --
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: How are they?

N: o 40. INT. OLD DOCTOR'S STUDY - DAY 40 Boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage, the emphysema-plagued doctor's post-encephalitic research, files and photographs and cans of 16mm film.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: Most died during the acute stage of the illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn't be roused. A sleep that in most cases lasted several months. The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage projected onto a screen by a pre-World War II Bell & Howell - a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from invisible strings.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: Those who survived, who awoke, seemed fine, as though nothing had happened. Years went by - five, ten, fifteen - before anyone suspected they were not well. . They were not. A doctor, this doctor decades younger, appears beside the subject on the screen and lowers the man's arms.
C: OLD DOCTOR
D: I began to see them in the early 1930's - old people brought in by their children, young people brought in by their parents - all of them complaining they weren't "themselves" anymore. They'd grown distant, aloof, anti-social, they daydreamed at the dinner table. I referred them to psychiatrists. The man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal- shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside. They conspire against her, torment and harass her, force her to perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands, to paw her chin, to flutter, to adjust glasses that aren't there.
N: REV.12/5/89 (BLUE) Pg.24 40.CONT. DOCTOR 40 0< ID Before long they were being referred back to me. They could no longer dress themselves or feed themselves. They could no longer speak in most cases. Families went mad. People who were normal, were now . . . * (searches for the word) . . . elsewhere ... The woman on the screen is replaced by a young man, a teenager, who seems composed less of flesh than wax, a wax figure with real eyes.
C: SAYER
D: What must it be like to be them? On the screen, the young man's eyes, entranced, gaze upward as if trying hard to remember something. Or trying hard to forget it.

D: Sorry. .
S: 41. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY
N: Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone. He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient. It remains suspended, doll-like. He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze. It leads only to blank space. He considers another who appears "deeply involved" in some minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of tearing, shredding motion. . v Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair. Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she "draws" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until it reaches a "vanishing point" in the center.
S: 42. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY 42.
N: The results of standard perception tests scotch-taped to a wall of the examination room. Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider each for a moment before moving onto the next. Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square, triangle and daisy. In the right are the post-encephalitics' failed "attempts" to copy them. REV. 10/13/83 p.26 Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the shapes, seemingly violently. Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him. Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker--
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: It's different.
C: SAYER
D: Quite. It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it.
C: SAYER
D: Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses.
E: more to himself
C: SAYER
D: Could he be saying, "I can't draw a triangle, don't make me"? Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the "badness" of the patient's scrawl. To himself -
E: before she can respond:

D: Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . .
S: 43. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - DAY 43.
N: The painting of the Western town from the prologue - saloon, livery stable, sunset. Below it, in his wheelchair, Leonard. His face is unlined and passive, like a mask. His body is still, like the dead. SAYER'S VOICE >| v Does he ever speak to you? Leonard's mother, a woman of seventy or so, is combing her son's hair, being careful to get the part straight.

N: Sayer, trailing after Mrs. Lowe and her sonr becomes momentarily distracted by Lucy, the most recently arrived post- encephalitic, the one he tried unsuccessfully to coax to the drinking fountain. She is there again, "stuck" at the same point, angled toward the fountain but unable to reach it. Sayer brings her a cup of water and rejoins Mrs. Lowe. -
C: SAYER
D: I'd like to examine him again-if that's all right with you. MRS. LOWE , He did well.
C: SAYER
D: In a sense.
C: MRS. LOWE
D: He's very clever. Aren't you, Leonard. . Sayer shows her the perception test "drawing** Leonard made.
C: SAYER
D: Does this mean anything to you? MRS. LOWE . ; It's very good. ' She glances back to Sayer who nods uncertainly. She recognizes. the look on his face; she's seen it before on the faces of more doctors than she cares to remember. ' f
E: more to Leonard
N: REV. 10/13/89 p.28
C: MRS. LOWE
D: Well it's abstract, isn't it. Sayer can't bring himself to agree with her.
E: becoming impatient with him
C: MRS. LOWE
D: That's the problem with all you doctors, you have no imagination. Everything has to be real to you. No longer having any use for him, she pointedly ignores him. Taking the hint, Sayer's wanders off, past Lucy, looking like a statue, holding the paper cup he brought her.

S: 44A. INT. MRS. LOWE'S APARTMENT - LEONARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 44A.
N: An old photograph. A sixth grade class picture from 1930?, Moving slowly across the young faces to Leonard, eleven, at the end of a row. MRS. LOWE 0.8. Something was wrong, they said, with his hands. He couldn't write anymore, he couldn't do the work, I should take him out of school, they said. He was eleven. They're in Leonard's old bedroom, Sayer and Mrs. Lowe. Except for the Western painting that's missing, nothing has changed in it in thirty years. REV. 10/13/89 p.28A
C: MRS. LOWE
D: He slowly got worse. He'd be talking, suddenly he'd come to a stop. After a few seconds he'd finish what he was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer. Sometimes he'd call to me and I'd come in and find him at his desk in a trance. An hour, two hours. Then he'd be okay again.
N: Sayer glances around the room. It's been preserved, like a shrine.
C: MRS. LOWE
D: One day I came hone from work and found him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. "What do you want, Leonard?" She pictures the moment in her mind, and waits, it seems, for the young Leonard to speak, to tell her what it is he wants. Finally she lowers her arm and shrugs.
E: pause
C: MR.S LOWE
D: He never spoke again. It was like he'd disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty. Sayer glances away from her to the room itself again.

N: A monkey flipping switches on a panel built into a laboratory room, searching for a sequence. In an observation booth, years of collected data - charts and graphs, EEG's and notes. There, Dr. Mann, a contemporary of Sayer's, stares at Sayer Ay curiously. Eventually he manages --
C: MANN
D: When you say you're working with people, you don't mean living people. (
C: SAYER
D: Living people, yes. Patients. Mann just stares. He's a scientist, they both are, and the idea of Sayer working with living people, rather than expired ones laid out on the pathology table, is inconceivable to him.

C: MANN
D: How's Hank? He's great, he's brilliant, look at him. Sayer glances away to Hank the monkey, watches him. Mann studies Sayer, chagrined and incredulous.
C: MANN
D: A physician? You? He slaps him angrily across the shoulders with some papers. The monkey completes a complex sequence which opens a chamber revealing an electric train. The animal jumps and hoots with wild glee. Sayer reaches out and presses the button on the stop watch dangling from Mann's neck.

While Mann, with something less than great enthusiasm, considers an EEG Sayer has brought, his monkey drags toys over to Sayer and tries to engage him in play. One of the toys is an Ouija Board.
C: MANN
D: Don't look at me like that. It's for his alphabet lessons. We're busy, Hank, go play solitaire. The monkey obediently goes off in search of a deck of cards. Gesturing at patterns on the EEG --

E: shrugs again
C: SAYER
D: You have them backwards. This is him awake . . . This is him asleep.
E: points to one EEG; then the other
N: Mann thinks Sayer is kidding. He isn't.
C: MANN
D: This is him awake? This is him asleep? Sayer nods. Mann tries, without success, to make some sort of sense out of that.
C: MANN
D: What are you saying? When he's awake, what, he's dreaming?
C: SAYER
D: When there's any brain activity at all, which is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating.
C: MANN
D: And when he's asleep . . . ?
C: SAYER
D: When he's asleep he manages to create a kind of reality. What we might call reality.

S: 49. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY 49
N: Tight on Leonard. Something blurs past him but his eyes don't follow it. Pulling back, the object blurs by again from the other direction. Tight on Sayer. The thing blurs past his face. His eyes don't follow it either. Pulling back, it blurs again. REV. 10.13/89 p.33 A circle of patients in wheelchairs. The post-encephalitics reunited. "Waking" just long enough to catch and release the object, a small beach ball. Leonard and Sayer, on opposite sides of the circle, ignoring the ball and the other patients. He's reached a dead end, Sayer, right where he began, his only "accomplishment," this, ball-catching patients.
S: 50. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 50.
N: Sayer alone in the examination room, tired, at its window staring blankly out. His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses. And beyond the lot, the elementary school playground. Laughing children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether balls. Playing hopscotch. Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot. Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt.
S: 51. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY 51.
N: From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up -- is interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood -- before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow "sea," the white area, on either side of which lies "land." At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish, "bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. ' Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to Leonard. He seems to be "watching." His mother, nearby, idly thumbing through a magazine as she brings Leonard up to date on neighborhood news, isn't. t, . Sayer crosses to Lucy. Lifts her gently out of her chair. Points her in the direction of the drinking fountain. She begins to move. To step slowly over each tile. She reaches the "bridge" and hesitates. Then crosses it. REV. 10/13/89 p.34 Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither, burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and watches as Lucy, "delivered" to the other side, free now, lets the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain. She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . . To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the outside. She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of figuring out where she is. And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer. These people are alive inside.

D: Leonard?
S: 68. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - LATER - NIGHT 68.
N: In a far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light, two silhouetted figures. Sayer and Leonard. Sleeping patients all around them. Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places his hand on Leonard's. After a moment, the contact brings the useless appendage "to life." As it slowly turns over and grasps the doctor's hand, a glimmer of life seems to appear in Leonard's eyes as well. Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the feeling the contact produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand on Leonard's other. Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer's. The doctor draws both of Leonard's hands toward him and sets them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board.
C: SAYER
D: I'll begin moving the pointer toward the "L." For "Leonard." Once I feel you beginning to move it, I'll stop and you'll take . over. Do you understand? Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not. The look on his face is "thoughtful." The look on Sayer's, hopeful and foolish.
C: SAYER
D: I'm beginning . . . The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons. Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's movement of it and, presumably, stops his own.
C: SAYER
D: Yes, good . . . The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "L" without stopping. It stops on the "R."
C: SAYER
D: No. No, I didn't make myself clear. My fault. I . . . . The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer. It passes the "L" again, reaches the "I" and stops. SAYER ' "., No. No, I . . . . .
N: REV. 10/13/89 p.40 But the pointer is moving again. It stops on the "L."
C: SAYER
D: Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. . "L." Good. Now the "E." It begins moving again. But not to the "E." To the nK," where it hesitates briefly before moving again.
C: SAYER
D: . . . you're spelling something el e . . . Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to "write": RILKESPA
E: realizing, to himself
S: 69. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Sayer alone in the examining room, standing over his desk. The lab coat is on it. And on it is scrawled:
C: RILKESPANTHERILKE
D: He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a slash between the "S" and the "P," so that it reads: R I L K E s/p A N T H E R BmBJUP*

N: Professional and professorial types filing in past a placard, an enlargement of an article from the Journal of Neurochemistry titled: LEVADOPA IN THE TREATMENT OF PARKINSONISM. Below it: A DISCUSSION WITH MARTIN S. THOMAS, PH.D. There's excitement (and jealousy) in the air.

N: An anatomical skeleton dangling from a metal stand.
C: NEUROCHEMIST
D: There's an ordinary medicine with which we are all familiar. An everyday medicine of stubbed toes and bunions and boils. A man at a podium in a modern version of the 1920's basement operating theatre.
C: NEUROCHEMIST
D: And then there is another kind. A medicine that holds out to the afflicted the promise of restored life. He glances to a point above his listeners, and an overhead projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure onto a screen. The neurochemist traces the shadow to its maker in the audience.

S: 75. INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - LATER - AFTERNOON 75,
N: Refreshments on tables. Sayer, uncomfortable in his suit, wandering around the crowded room with a glass of wine. He approaches its hub of activity, the neurochemist surrounded by several impressed colleagues, but can't manage to get close enough to speak with him.
S: 76. INT. MEN'S ROOM, AUDITORIUM - LATER - AFTERNOON 7
N: The neurochemist walks in and crosses to the urinals. A moment later, he hears the door opening, and footsteps, and then nothing, until --
C: SAYER O.S.
D: Do you think it's possible that simple Parkinsonian tremor taken to its furthest extreme could appear as no tremor at all? When no one answers, the chemist glances over his shoulder. Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him.
C: NEUROCHEMIST
D: Are you speaking to me? Sayer is. And really wants to know the answer. The chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands.
C: SAYER
D: If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow accelerated - - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone? He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post- encephalitic's, staring. The chemist slowly dries his hands with a paper towel.
E: demonstrating what he means he's become a mass » of tics and accelerated speech
C: NEUROCHEMIST
D: Dr. Sayer, yes? I'm a chemist, doctor. I leave it to you guys to do the damage. He drops the paper towel into the trash and leaves
E: Sayer nods
S: 77. EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - MORNING 77
N: Emerging from his car with some papers, Dr. Kaufman is ambushed by Sayer. .. REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW) Pg. 77.CONT. SAYER 77. Did you have a chance to look at any of the -.
C: KAUFMAN
D: Freud believed in miracles. Prescribing cocaine like it was candy . . . Sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads toward the hospital.
C: KAUFMAN
D: We all believed in the "miracle" of Cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it. Now it's L-Dopa. He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back.
C: SAYER
D: With all due respect, I think it's rather too soon to say that.
C: KAUFMAN
D: With all due "respect," it's rather way too soon. Let the chemists do the damage. The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another. Kaufman disappears into the building.
S: 77A. INT. KAUFMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - MORNING 77A
N: The stack of papers drops onto Kaufman's desk. The one on top reads, NEW DRUG LETS SHAKING PALSY PATIENTS EAT JELL-O.
C: SAYER
D: Did you read the case - the husband who came home to find his wife singing. She hadn't felt like singing in years. Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets down the receiver.
N: REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW) Pg.
C: 77A.CONT. KAUFMAN 77A.
D: I read them all. Soberly. All thirty cases had mild Parkinson's. Your Parkies - if that's what they are - haven't moved for decades. You know better than to make a leap like that, you want to believe there's a connection, that doesn't mean there is one.
C: SAYER
D: What I believe, what I know, is that these people are alive inside.
C: KAUFMAN
D: How do you know? Because they catch tennis balls?
C: SAYER
D: I know it. Sayer doesn't elaborate, but his tone is resolute. And it has the intended effect on Kaufman, causing him to consider the possibility that Sayer could, somehow, know it as a fact.
C: KAUFMAN
D: r..iiJi! And what if this drug were to kill them? SAYER - > And what if this drug were to cure them? Somewhere behind Kaufman's eyes Sayer can see, he thinks, a change, or reminiscence, long ago, long buried, of things he once believed or wanted to believe.
E: right back
C: KAUFMAN
D: How many did you think I ' d let you put on it?
C: SAYER
D: All of them ... some of them ... one of them . . .
C: KAUFMAN
D: One. With the family's consent. Signed. Sayer tries to hide his elation and turns to leave before Kaufman changes his mind.
N: REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW) Pg.46
C: 77A.CONT. KAUFMAN 77A.
D: Sayer - Sayer turns. He was almost to the door. He had almost made * it out.
C: KAUFMAN
D: That "immense" project of yours. The myelin? The worms? When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab supervisor? Sayer thinks about lying, but senses Kaufman knows the answer * already and just wants to hear him say it. So he does:
C: SAYER
D: He asked me to leave. . Kaufman nods like, Just checking. And - KAUFMAN . Good luck. Sayer leaves.
S: 78. INT. MRS. LOWE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 78.
N: A standard consent form and pen on a kitchenette table. Two coffee cups. One used tea bag.
C: SAYER
D: People with ordinary Parkinson's Disease sometimes complain that they've "lost their grace . . . " They have to think about the things we just do . . . It has to do with a chemical in the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move more naturally. He picks up the cup again, gracefully, and sets it down.
E: he picks up a cup with a shaking hand with great "trouble" he sets it down
C: MRS. LOWE
D: Leonard has Parkinson's Disease?
N: REV.12/13/89 (YELLOW)

E: pause

D: I don't know.
C: MRS. LOWE
D: What db< you hope it will do?
N: REV. 10/13/89 p.47

D: To the world.
C: MRS. LOWE
D: What's here for him after all these years? '
E: pause
C: SAYER
D: You are here. She ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation, all the while staring at the consent form.
S: 79. INT. PHARMACY, BAINBRIDGE - DAY
N: The hospital pharmacy, a subterranean structure built into the basement, cluttered from floor to ceiling with medicines. Ray, the pharmacist, dips into a bag of powder. He spoons some out onto a scale and looks to Sayer to tell him the dosage.
C: SAYER
D: I have no idea. What do you say we ease into it with ... what, » . fifty milligrams? Ray begins to measure five milligrams.
C: SAYER
D: Let's say a hundred. Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder, removing all but 100 milligrams.
S: 80. INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY 80
N: Leonard, sphinx-like in his wheelchair, his mother by his side. Sayer, stirring the L-Dopa into a paper cup of orange juice. Miss Costello, in the doorway, watching.

C: SAYER
D: Leonard? Your mother's going to give you some juice. There's medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual. Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat. Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer. And they all wait.

S: 90. INT. DAYROOM - LATER - NIGHT
N: A claw of a hand dragging a crayon across a sheet of paper. Tight on Sayer, framed in a doorway, as still and silent and entranced as a post-encephalitic. His perspective of the dayroom -- deserted except for a figure, a patient, Leonard, hunched over the table. As Sayer crosses toward him, Leonard's head slowly rises. Sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other in silence for several moments. Leonard struggles to speak, to form words. They come out in a halting cadence, flat, without inflection, and are only barely . recognizable as words: .
C: LEONARD
D: It's quiet.
C: SAYER
D: It's late. Everyone's asleep>
C: LEONARD
D: I'm not asleep?
C: SAYER
D: No. You're awake. Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath Leonard's hands.
C: SAYER
D: May I? Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name.
C: LEONARD
D: Me.
S: 91. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAWN 91
N: Alone in the room, Leonard moves slowly around it, feeling things: the smoothness of the cabinet glass/ the warmth thrown by a desk lamp, water from the cooler splashing onto his hand.
C: SAYER O.S.
D: Leonard? Leonard turns to Sayer's voice with an expression of child-like , wonder on his face.
C: SAYER
D: Your mother is here. She appears in the doorway of the room. She's done her hair, her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared for this reunion. She can do nothing but stare at her "infant son" who is now, "suddenly," a man. As he slowly crosses toward her, she is struck by the fact she must look u£ in order to meet his eyes. He reaches her. Reaches out to her. And she embraces him.

N: A corridor crowded with patients in wheelchairs with nowhere to go and nothing much to do.
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: My name is Elizabeth. It's a » pleasure to meet you. Leonard, standing, reaches for her hand and struggles to pronounce her name correctly. Fighting to keep from crying in front of him, Miss Costello glances to Sayer and Mrs. Lowe.

N: The cooks and kitchen workers around Leonard and his entourage, shaking his hand.
S: 96. INT. STAFF CAFETERIA - LATER - DAY 9
N: A tray of truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer and Miss Costello, watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush- like concoction and manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into his mouth. He seems amazed by its flavor.
C: LEONARD
D: It's delicious.
C: FERNANDO
D: I wouldn't go that far, Len. Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles.
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: I don't think I could deal with losing 3D years of my life. I can't even imagine it.
N: REV. 10/13/89 p.53 Sayer's smile fades. The possibility that Leonard might not have realized the extent of the passage of time had not, until this moment, occurred to him. He stares blankly at Miss Costello.
C: MISS COSTELLO
D: He does realize it, doesn't he? Sayer nods uncertainly.
C: SAYER
D: He must.
S: 97. INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY

D: Splendid. Sayer makes a note. They are alone in the examination room which, like most of the hospital, has little in it to indicate that it is not the 1930's.
C: SAYER
D: Can I see you walk the length of the room? * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features. He stares at the photograph of himself, trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended. He's not younjg anymore. 98. OMITTED 99. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - NIGHT 99.

D: . . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby.

C: SAYER
D: You don't have to read them now, Leonard. They're yours. At your leisure. Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like they're gold.

D: I'd like to go outside.
S: 101A. EXT. BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - DAY 101A
N: Sayer and Leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees along a path toward the parking lot. At a point, the doctor realizes his patient is no longer at his side; he's several steps back, feeling the sunshine on his skin.
S: 102. EXT. PARKING LOT, BAINBRIDGE - MORNING 102
N: (p\ Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard, resembles something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary, apparently, to make the car go. The car pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out -- Leonard's mother.
S: 103. INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING 103
N: Tight on the radio. Sayer switches it on. To Leonard's amazement, classical music fills the interior and CONTINUES OVER:
S: 104. EXT. THE BRONX - MOVING SHOTS - MORNING 104
N: Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers. Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale. "Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations. "Futuristic" cars. Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to the world and stares at it all with wonder. Everywhere he looks there is something "extraordinary."
C: LEONARD
D: What a wonderful place The Bronx has become. The music CONTINUES OVER:
S: 105. INT/EXT. NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY 105
N: A rose. , Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance. He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly astonished by the tactile sensation. Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the purity or intensity Leonard can. Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of countless thousands of roses.
S: 106. INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY 106
N: Leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to it bemused but intrigued. It's John Lennon singing "A DAY IN
C: THE LIFE"
D: and it CONTINUES OVER:
S: 107. EXT. PARK - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY 107
N: Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs running around, nannies with prams, lovers. A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it pathetically not halfway back to its owners. The music CONTINUES OVER:
S: 108. EXT. STREET CORNER JOINT - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY 108.
N: Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt. Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his charge's attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally, glances away, up, to a sound overhead. The music CONTINUES OVER:
S: 109. EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
N: A 747 roaring down a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off and thunders over Sayer and Leonard and the parked Toyota. Exhilerated, Leonard waves. The music CONTINUES OVER: 110. OMITTED 110
S: 111. EXT. THE BRONX / CITY ISLAND - DAY 111
N: An expressway. The Toyota traveling at "astounding" speed, passing a sign that reads CITY ISLAND. R!V. 10/13/89 p.58 Boats and fish markets and lush vegetation. Paradise compared to the Bronx. The Toyota turns down a side road near the water t and into the driveway of Sayer's small wooden house. w '.. . ' And the mus ic ends.
S: 112. INT. SAYER'S KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - DAY 112.
N: Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter. Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can offer his guest. He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the spines of books. Noticing Sayer watching -
C: LEONARD
D: You just moved here.
C: SAYER
D: Yeah. Well, five years ago. , Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment . . . before ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop.
C: LEONARD
D: Your son?
C: SAYER
D: Me, actually. ' ,," t
C: LEONARD
D: You seem uncomfortable.
E: looking closely at ' the photograph
C: SAYER
D: I probably was. Sayer disappears into the kitchen again. And a moment later glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged.
C: SAYER
D: Each has a specific purpose.
N: REV. 10/13/89 p.59 As Leonard considers each pair of glasses ...
C: SAYER
D: Those are my normal interior glasses. And spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one. Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses -
N: Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely.
C: SAYER
D: That's heavy-gauge metal so when I fall asleep and roll over on them I don't wreck them. They're indestructible. Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together.
C: SAYER
D: As long as I pretty much know ahead of time what I'll be looking ' at, it works out, I don't have to carry all five pairs around.
C: LEONARD
D: What if you just want to go for a walk?
C: SAYER
D: Walks are a problem. Walks are the hardest thing. You just never know. He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma. He retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and some saltine% on a tray.
E: pause

N: They've cleared places on the sofa and chair and sit there Q sipping their tea. * REV. 10/13/89 p.60
C: SAYER
D: I can date my interest in science precisely, actually. I'd been * sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across the periodic table of elements. I memorized it. Which I admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort. The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were. Each element had its place, and nothing could * change that. They were secure, no * matter what. * Leonard nods, perhaps more out of politeness than * understanding. Sayer nods too, feeling, perhaps, a little * exposed.
E: smiles at the thought

D: I'm not terribly good with people. I like them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them. Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . . He shrugs. Silence again.

D: What'd she say? LEONARD ' That you're a kind man. That you care very much for people. Sayer shifts in his chair uncomfortably. a.

STAFF CAFETERIA, BAINBRIDGE - LATER - DAY 115 Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen. Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished' meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and Kaufman at a table near the door.
C: KAUFMAN
D: z^ When you say expensive, what are we talking about?
N: To put them all on the dosage Mr. Lowe is on . . . about twenty thousand dollars. Kaufman stares at Sayer aghast. He knew L-Dopa was expensive, but not that expensive. He manages to recover somewhat.
C: KAUFMAN
D: That would be for how long?
C: SAYER
D: About a month.
C: KAUFMAN
D: A month? Sayer nods. Kaufman glances away. Stares blankly at faces at other tables. Back to Sayer.
C: KAUFMAN
D: I can't go before the board with that. I could . . .
N: He laughs to himself at the futility of it.
C: SAYER
D: I was thinking of speaking to the patrons.
C: KAUFMAN
D: The few patrons this hospital has give what they can.
C: SAYER
D: Well, we'd have to convince them to give more than they*re accustomed to giving.
N: He hadn't intended as impudent a tone as that which came out. More calmly ~
C: SAYER
D: Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe.
C: KAUFMAN
D: I think you overestimate the effect Mr. Lowe has on people. We're talking about money here. Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware of the silence around them. No one is talking. He glances up as Miss Costello walks by setting something on the table in front of him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word.
N: CD Kaufman glances down. She has left a Bainbridge payroll check )\cz> made out in her name. Kaufman turns it over. She has endorsed it back to Bainbridge Hospital. Fernando walks by and out, leaving his salary check on the table. Then Ray, the pharmacist, leaving his. Then the nurse who reluctantly read "Moby Dick" to the patients. Then a cafeteria worker. A secretary. A clerk. A janitor. The cafeteria is soon empty, except for Sayer and Kaufman. Long silence.
S: 116. INT. BOARD ROOM - NIGHT 116
N: 8mm film of Leonard before L-Dopa -- a wide shot of him absolutely motionless in his wheelchair.
C: SAYER O.S.
D: There was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature . . . only vague available motion in the neck . . . no voluntary movement in the limbs . . . A tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen.
C: SAYER O.S.
D: Perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking -- which we now know should not have been confused with apathy. * Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his face.
C: SAYER
D: Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, "h .. . " In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. "Less scientific" it reads.
C: SAYER
D: Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello. She nods, "Good, that's better."
C: SAYER
D: The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.
C: SAYER
D: This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something.

D: My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . .

Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another patron, an elderly man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket. Another already has hers out in front of her ... Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance. The room is absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on paper.
S: 118. INT. THE PHARMACY - DAY
N: The raw L-Dopa powder, 20,000 dollars worth, has arrived. It sits on a pharmacy counter in large clear bags. Sayer and Ray peer between racks of medicine at two teenage girls and two very old men chatting in a corner of the pharmacy.

But as they near the ward, as they're joined by others, other nurses, orderlies, their steps and hearts quicken. They break into a trot.
S: 122. INT. LEONARD'S WARD - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
N: They appear at the threshold, Sayer, Miss Costello, the night nurse, the others, and peer into the darkened room: In the quiet, in the shadows, in the moonlight filtering in through the windows, the post-encephalitics are emerging from their "cocoons," rising from the "dead" like Lazarus from the earth, reborn. Moving slowly past the beds: A figure rediscovering the feeling of her skin; another, the sound of his breath; another,' the beating of her heart. A figure still asleep . . . wakes. And for the first time in nearly half a century sees herself in the world. Tight on Sayer, on the look of awe on his face as he stares at the scene going on in the darkened ward. His glance finds Leonard who is sitting up in his bed, smiling.
