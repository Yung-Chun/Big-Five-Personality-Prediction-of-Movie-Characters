C: NARRATOR
D: To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and
N: CONTINUED 2 CONTINUED sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order. 4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed: Wï¿½LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL THE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5 1914, POPULATION 2682 STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _

E: baiting him
N: CONTINUED 5 CONTINUED Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike.
C: TECTOR
D: I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid.
C: ANGEL
D: Nor I with dogs.
C: DUTCH
D: ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks.
E: grinning at Pike
C: PIKE
D: Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON Aï¿½M BOXCARS into a side street.
E: t0 Teotor and Angel
S: EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY
N: THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside.
C: SPEAKER
D: Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.
E: OS
N: CONTINUED CONTINUED SPEAKER (OS) (CONTID) (THEN) That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.-
C: CONGREGATION
D: I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same.

N: 13, THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE OF A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R. 14. PIKE PAUSES.

N: 16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them. on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long time, and they are tired. 17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL- ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall, Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he has lived is still. intact. CONTINUED CHANGE 2/27/68 18 CONTINUED' HARRIGAN (HARSHLY) The soldiers sit up -- take a look! Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a little.
C: HARRIGAN
D: Pike?
C: THORN TON
D: He's there. The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- â¢ing, ready to fire..
E: after a long moment
N: HARRIGAN (HISSING) Hold your fire; -- We wait till they come out -- catch them in the act. (to Thornton) Then.you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward him, his.face white, remembering-

C: PAYMASTER
D: What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means. military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw their\guns and Pike steps towards him.
C: PAYMASTER
D: What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot

BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces. 29 ON THE ROOF TOP -- HARRIGAN AND THORNTON NERVOUSLY WATCH THE BAND..
