N: MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow... We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...

C: BOURNE
D: So we got in the way? Is that why Neski died? Is that why you killed Marie?

C: BOURNE
D: I told you people to leave me alone! I fell off the grid. I was half way around the world.
E: V.O.
C: ABBOTT
D: There's no place it won't catch up to you. It's how every story ends. It's what you are, Jason. A killer! You always will be.
E: V.O.
N: THUMP!
C: CRONIN
D: We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then--
N: He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun to Abbott's head.
C: ABBOTT
D: Go ahead! Go on! Do it!
E: V.O.
C: BOURNE

C: KRAMER
D: Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago?
C: LANDY
D: Right.
C: KRAMER
D: So what does he do now?
C: LANDY
D: I think he's looking for something he hasn't found.
C: KRAMER
D: Like what? What's he after?
C: LANDY
D: I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't gotten his memory back yet. Not all of it.
N: A look from Kramer...
C: KRAMER
D: Pam, what I need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us?
C: LANDY
D: If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to CNN.
C: KRAMER
D: Maybe he still will. Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. I don't know. I just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst." As far as I'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise.

He waits for the change and then--- -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching out down below him- a sniper's heaven. PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes to work on it. Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the trigger- and just enough cover to disappear. He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack.

S: 64H INT. HUB 64H
N: Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross, dead on the concourse. The room -- normally full of chatter has gone dead silent... Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental screw up and everyone here knows it. He just had the wrong man killed....

D: Ma'am?
E: handing her the menu
C: LANDY
D: Nothing for me.
N: Vosen looks at her, surprised.
C: VOSEN
D: I'm buying.
N: She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat off. She's not staying long.
C: VOSEN
D: When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on--
C: LANDY
D: Suggested? Are you sure it was just a suggestion?
E: beat
C: VOSEN
D: Funny how different things look depending on where you sit. I look at this as doing a favor for you. Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business.
C: LANDY
D: Meaning?
C: VOSEN
D: Jason Bourne.
C: LANDY
D: Bourne's finished.
C: VOSEN
D: Really?
C: LANDY
D: It was finished the moment I realized I was chasing him for something he didn't do. The case is closed.
C: VOSEN
D: So what do you make of this? French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday. He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone. That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree?
E: handing her surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris
C: LANDY
D: This doesn't feel like Bourne to me.
C: VOSEN
D: Why's it so hard for you to believe?
C: LANDY
D: Probably because it's coming from you, Noah.
C: VOSEN
D: Lets try and be adults okay? We all thought he was done, off the grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe he's a threat. We both want the same thing here.
C: LANDY
D: So what happened at Waterloo?
C: VOSEN
D: We have a leak. Bourne showed up in our surveillance. We had very little time to react.
C: LANDY
D: And the reporter ended up dead?
C: VOSEN
D: Bourne saw us coming.
N: Landy looks at him, suspicious.
C: LANDY
D: So what was he doing?
C: VOSEN?
D: We don't know. But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think? Maybe he's the source?
C: LANDY
D: The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station.
C: VOSEN
D: Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam. It's not fair.
C: LANDY
D: I'm going to the office now. I'll make my own introductions.

C: TECH#1
D: Sir, we just hacked Ross's email account at the Guardian and found a round trip ticket to Turin, yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05 departure.
C: LANDY
D: I think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source then?
C: VOSEN
D: How?
C: LANDY
D: Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed. His met his source in Turin.
C: VOSEN
D: So?
C: LANDY
D: So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo?
C: CRONIN
D: Maybe they were even on the same flight?
E: Needling Wills
C: VOSEN
D: Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there
N: TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.
C: LANDY
D: The guy you're after is a CIA operative with clearance above Top Secret. He was committing treason by talking to Ross. Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track?
N: TECH 3 (JIMMY) Zero results on the cross check. VOSEN stares daggers at her.
C: WILLS
D: Do you have a better idea?
C: LANDY
D: Yeah, I'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin.
C: WILLS
D: Do it Jimmy.
N: TECHNICIANS start tapping.
C: LANDY
D: I mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do, the list should be pretty small
E: looks at Cronin
N: TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin, Neal Daniels. The names display on the screen: Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin Neal Daniels. The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY. WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.
C: LANDY
D: Now check everything in Ross's apartment against those names. Look for common patterns, look for -
C: CRONIN
D: Initials .....Bring that up on main.
N: LANDY turns. CRONIN is leaning down in front of a computer screen. Point to something for the tech --- who puts it on the big screen, blown up. In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per N.D."next to several scrawls.
C: LANDY
D: Neal Daniels. He's Station Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?
C: WILLS
D: Jesus Christ.
C: VOSEN
D: Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he's there. If he's not, get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house. Send them in heavy and tell them we'll assist with entry.
C: LANDY
D: "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--
C: VOSEN
D: I'm worried about Bourne. If he's not Ross's source, then he must be after Ross's source -- just like us.
N: Off LANDY...

D: Oh, yes I do, Pam.
N: Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe. It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."

C: LANDY
D: You just decide? No oversight. No checks and balances.

N: The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them. The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on Bourne.

S: EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY
N: Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot. He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete railing at the east end of the roof. Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the window of one to set off its alarm. Then a second and a third, setting off their alarms. The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in. Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks handful of wires off the steering column and starts to expertly hotwire the car.

C: TACTICAL TEAM LEADER
D: He's on the roof. He's trapped.
E: to Vosen
S: EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY
N: Bourne works to hotwire the car. A CRI car gets to the roof. Two agents come from the elevator lobby. The three car alarms distract them. They search for Bourne, but can't find him at first... Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still locked. A second CRI car arrives. Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed. He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops. Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him. A third blocks the exit ramp. Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead on him. Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

S: EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY
N: The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward Bourne-- But before they can get a bead-- Bourne slams the car into reverse again. Petal to the metal in reverse-- The agents open fire. Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield. But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass. As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill. Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline. Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him. Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure. Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall. Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's car, to the shooters. Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars. The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof. Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over- turned car.

S: 274A INT/EXT. CIRCULAR RAMP 274A
N: Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level Bourne's on.
S: INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP
N: Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him. Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge. The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode. Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents. Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one. The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver. The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires. The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire. The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot. The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio.
C: BOURNE
D: 10-13. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four.
N: Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer. Then he hands the cop his radio back.
C: BOURNE
D: Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive.
E: CONT'D
N: Bourne disappears. We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits. CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps. But that's all the time Bourne needs--
S: EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY
N: Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a CRI sedan. As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the right. It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control. 277A OMITTED 277A
S: EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY
N: Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper. Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car. The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.
S: INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY
N: Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US 95." Bourne turns right-- Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg. REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car. Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path.
S: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY
N: Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit. Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of. Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path. Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards. As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake. Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle. 284A OMITTED 284A
S: INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY
N: On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead. Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right: The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car. Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic. Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead. The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked cars. Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road. SMOKE and STEAM -- SIRENS -- CHAOS BOURNE kicks the window out of the police car. Gun up... Ready-- NEARBY 287A PAZ in the car. Still. Bloody from the crash, really 287A fucked up. He comes to...and Bourne is there. Gun pointed at his head... The two assassins look at each other...then Bourne lowers his gun...and disappears... ON PAZ -- as the wheels start to turn...
