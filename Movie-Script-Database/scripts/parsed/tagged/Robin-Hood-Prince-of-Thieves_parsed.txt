M: PRINCE OF THIEVES
T: FADE IN:
C: SUNSET
D: The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.
C: BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
D: A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened, almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer. Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to their devotions.
S: EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
N: Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation. Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.
S: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET
N: A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
C: INTERROGATOR
D: He says you stole his bread.
C: PETER
D: It is a lie. I caught him stealing ours. The lowlife jabbers some more. The Interrogator debates.
C: INTERROGATOR
D: Cut off the infidel's hand. The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
C: ROBIN
D: No!... I took the bread.
C: PETER
D: That's not true.
C: ROBIN
D: They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
C: INTERROGATOR
D: Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble... As you wish... Cut off this one's hand as well!... But first... He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward. His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
C: INTERROGATOR
D: Show them the courage of Allah. The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket. Twitching. Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out, forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter catches his eye... Robin winks. The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame. Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
C: ROBIN
D: And this is English courage. He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming.
C: PETER
D: That's for five years of hell.
N: A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
C: VOICE
D: Behind you! Warned, Robin ducks away. Slams the jailer's head into the wall. Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered. While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN. Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even his bald head is ornamented.
E: O.S.
C: ROBIN
D: You speak English?
C: SARACEN
D: The king's own. Set me free.
C: PETER
D: No, Robin.
C: SARACEN
D: For pity's sake. Mine is a sentence of death. Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
C: PETER
D: Don't trust him. Two more guards attack, yelling fury. Robin eyes the curved scimitar.
C: ROBIN
D: What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook. A guard swings at him with a giant axe. Robin slashes... shears the axe handle in two.
C: ROBIN
D: Hmm! Not bad. He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand. Commotion outside. RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
C: SARACEN
D: Free me and I will show you a way out.
C: ROBIN
D: Why should we trust you?
C: SARACEN
D: If you don't, you are dead men.
C: ROBIN
D: He makes a point. The door bursts open. More guards rush in.
C: ROBIN
D: A good point. He slashes the man free.
C: PETER
D: Robin!
C: ROBIN
D: Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here.
C: SARACEN
D: This way! He beckons them to the back. A hidden door leads into a tunnel.
S: INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
N: They wade through foul water up to their waists. The Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin lops off its head.
C: SARACEN
D: You are fast, my friend.
C: ROBIN
D: Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast. Guards drop down from above, carrying torches. Blocking the way.
C: SARACEN
D: You will need to be yet faster. A narrow opening to their left... they splash through. Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
C: SARACEN
D: Poison air. Hold your breath. Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it with one mighty twist.
C: PETER
D: Thanks. I misjudged you.
E: coughing
C: SARACEN
D: Save your breath.
N: Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down- ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead. Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use. They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways, bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake. Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it works.
C: SARACEN
D: Allah be praised.
C: ROBIN
D: Amen, brother. A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a grating.
S: EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
N: Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps Peter up.
C: ROBIN
D: God willing, we may now be safe.
N: Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching.
C: ROBIN
D: Come, Peter. We must hurry. Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
C: PETER
D: It is mortal. Leave me.
C: ROBIN
D: Hold on to my shoulder.
N: Peter shakes him off.
C: PETER
D: My mother... my little sister. Tell them I love them. Tell them I died a free Englishman. Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
C: SARACEN
D: His wound is by the heart. We cannot save him. Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's hand.
C: PETER
D: Take this to my sister. Swear you will protect her for me... Swear it, Robin!
C: ROBIN
D: I swear it. Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
E: reluctantly
C: PETER
D: For England. He fells the first Arab. The Saracen pulls Robin away.
C: SARACEN
D: Come now! Do not fail your friend. Make his sacrifice an act of honor. They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos- sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.
N: DESERTED ALLEY - LATER Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
C: ROBIN
D: Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way.
C: SARACEN
D: Our way is together. With the speed of Allah. He grins. This strange man has a sense of humor.
C: ROBIN
D: I go to England.
C: SARACEN
D: Then I go to England.
C: ROBIN
D: England? Why?
C: SARACEN
D: You saved my life. I must stay with you until I save yours.
C: ROBIN
D: Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation.
C: SARACEN
D: Only Allah can do that.
C: ROBIN
D: And if I don't want you?
C: SARACEN
D: You have no choice... unless you think you can kill me. He grins broadly. Offers his hand.
C: SARACEN
D: My name is Aslan. Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
C: ROBIN
D: Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan? CUT TO:
S: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)
N: Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney. SUPERIMPOSE: LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND
S: INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
N: FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
C: VOICE
D: Enough of that din, Remus. I can't think. Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc- tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
E: O.S.
C: LOCKSLEY.
D: Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores over a wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself for solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the vast table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances at a portrait over the fireplace... Robin. The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged, desperate, KENNETH.
C: KENNETH
D: My Lord! Help me. He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN. Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth back.
C: DUNCAN
D: You must wait... I am sorry you were disturbed, Master.
C: KENNETH
D: My Lord, please!
E: high anxiety
C: LOCKSLEY
D: It is alright, Duncan. You are Kenneth of Cowfall? The peasant falls to his knees.
E: to Kenneth
C: KENNETH
D: They've taken my Gwen. My daughter.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Who has taken her?
C: KENNETH
D: Men on horses. In masks. We tried to stop them. My son is dead.
E: touches his wound
S: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
N: Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain him.
C: DUNCAN
D: You cannot go alone, Master. Let me ride for help.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: That may be too late. Kenneth, lead the way. He kicks his horse into motion.
C: DUNCAN
D: Master, stay! There is an evil moon tonight.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Good will overcome, Duncan. Trust in that. Duncan looks up. Crosses himself. Dark clouds race across the moon. CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODED TRAIL
N: Kenneth checks the ground. Locksley waits.
C: KENNETH
D: They came this way, my Lord.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Onward then. What is this place?
C: KENNETH
D: Nearby the Gregor Caves. Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on... Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out. He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat. Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Steady, man. They are to dissuade the faint of heart. Think of Gwen. From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge. A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality. Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
C: KENNETH
D: Druids.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: I trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago.
N: An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood. The reveler is ecstatic.
C: KENNETH
D: Is it the devil?
E: petrified
C: LOCKSLEY
D: If it is, I have some Christian steel that will test his hide. He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt. A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his head.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Gwen? Kenneth nods. The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who is carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk raised. A masked figure stands at the head of the altar. The high priest of the dark rite. The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
C: DEMON
D: Come, my virgin flower. Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move- ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation... A warrior's yell! Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
C: DEMON
D: Kill him! Kill him! The followers throw themselves at Locksley. He beats them off. The high priest issues orders to armed guards, who run to intercept. One aims a spear. Locksley hacks the shaft in half. Cuts men down left and right. Reaches the altar stone.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Gwen! Up, girl, up! Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: In the name of God! His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face... Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
N: The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. The guards close in. Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening. The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked. Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown. Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in recognition.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Nottingham! The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard, cruel intensity in every feature.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You are an unwelcome surprise, Locksley.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: The King shall hear of this, Nottingham.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: I think not. Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.
C: LOCKSELY
D: God help us.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: One day all England will worship with us.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Never. The crone spits venom in his face.
C: DEMON
D: I am Mortianna. You will die with my name on your lips. Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill- side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five masked figures block his way.
S: EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
N: A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor. A cross on its sail. A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.
C: ROBIN
D: Home. Thank you, Lord. Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his hand.
C: ROBIN
D: My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...
C: ASLAN
D: Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them. A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
E: SARACEN
C: ROBIN
D: I thought you'd say that. He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.
C: ASLAN
D: No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic. Robin laughs. The Saracen remains intense.
C: ASLAN
D: If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded. He smiles broadly. Robin claps him on the shoulder.
C: ROBIN
D: Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.
S: EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY
N: CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at them, laughing. Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing. Searching. GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback. Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony. He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, FANNY.
C: GISBORNE
D: You owe the sheriff three bushels of flax.
C: FANNY
D: You starve us. First the drought, now you take what food we have left.
C: GISBORNE
D: For starving people, you look fat enough.
C: SOLDIER
D: He's not here, sir. None but the woman and children.
E: emerging from the hut
C: GISBORNE
D: Where is your mate? The man they call Little.
E: to Fanny
C: FANNY
D: He died last winter.
C: GISBORNE
D: Is that so? We hear he is very much alive. Hiding out in the forest. He probably ran away to escape your scolding tongue. The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
C: FANNY
D: Norman swine! A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at Gisborne's throat.
C: FANNY
D: No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only make it worse. Wulf backs off. Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
C: GISBORNE
D: Seize him! While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
C: GISBORNE
D: This is Lord Nottingham's deer. Is this how you repay the Sheriff for his protection?
C: WULF
D: Like a wolf protects sheep.
E: BOY
C: FANNY
D: I killed it. We needed the meat.
C: GISBORNE
D: Poachers hang. Either he dies or you die.
C: WULF
D: My mother lies to protect me.
C: FANNY
D: No, Wulf! Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.
C: GISBORNE
D: You have deprived us of a hunt, boy. He cups his hand in the deer's blood. Smears it on Wulf's face.
C: GISBORNE
D: The hounds know the scent well. He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
C: GISBORNE
D: Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us some pleasure before you die.
N: To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
C: GISBORNE
D: Unleash them!
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
N: Nearing home, Robin is buoyant. The Saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him.
C: ROBIN
D: Why must you walk in back of me?
C: ASLAN
D: In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil?
C: ROBIN
D: Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point.
C: ASLAN
D: Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal.
C: ROBIN
D: For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.
C: ASLAN
D: Those are my burdens.
C: ROBIN
D: You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
C: ROBIN
D: So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman?
N: The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
C: ROBIN
D: By the Lord, that's it! Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
C: ROBIN
D: They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so? Ignoring him, the Saracen stops. Examines the darkening sky.
C: ASLAN
D: It is close to sunset.
C: ROBIN
D: Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right? No reply. Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
C: ROBIN
D: Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it!
C: ASLAN
D: Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your cursed country?
C: ROBIN
D: You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name?
C: ASLAN
D: Which way is East?
C: ROBIN
D: Her name?
C: ASLAN
D: East?
C: ROBIN
D: Her name?
C: ASLAN
D: East?!!! Robin folds his arms. A standoff.
C: ASLAN
D: Damn you!... Jasmina.
C: ROBIN
D: Ah, Jasmina! Is she beautiful?
C: ASLAN
D: Which way is East?
C: ROBIN
D: That way. Aslan throws his rug on the ground. Kneels.
C: ASLAN
D: Are you sure?
C: ROBIN
D: I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it?
C: ASLAN
D: Worth dying for. Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the branches. A hound savages his leg. The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep- titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses.
C: GISBORNE
D: You're not playing by the rules, boy. Deer don't climb trees... Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird. Shall we teach him to fly? Cut it down! The soldiers hack at the trunk. The tree quivers.
C: ROBIN
D: Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.
C: GISBORNE
D: Stand back, stranger. This is no affair of yours.
C: ROBIN
D: Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal.
C: GISBORNE
D: I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is the Sheriff's land.
C: ROBIN
D: Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.
C: GISBORNE
D: I grow dangerously tired of your wit... Chop it down!
C: ROBIN
D: The man who strikes that tree dies. He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
C: GISBORNE
D: Chop down the hooded fool.
C: ROBIN
D: Perhaps we could discuss this.
E: backing up
N: The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape... the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
C: GISBORNE
D: Kill him!
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan! It's time to redeem that vow.
C: GISBORNE
D: Set the dogs on him!
N: Aslan ignores him, lost in his prayers. Robin lifts the other arm -- a second concealed crossbow. WHUMPF! The bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack. Dead or not, he soon will be. Robin unsheathes his sword.
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered. The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of flashing steel.
C: ROBIN
D: I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all. Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly. Blood flows from his arm. His sword falls.
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan!! Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back. Robin freezes.
C: GISBORNE
D: Well, hooded stranger, allow me to know your name before I run you through.
N: A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins, kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his pilgrim's hood.
C: GISBORNE
D: Robin of Locksley!
C: ROBIN
D: On your knees, Gisborne. Pray. He obeys. Robin raises his sword.
C: GISBORNE
D: Please, Locksley! No! Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear. The man leaps.
C: ROBIN
D: Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people. Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab. Keeps running.
C: ROBIN
D: You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.
E: to Aslan, furious
C: ASLAN
D: I will fulfill my vow when I choose.
C: ROBIN
D: Which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time I'm outnumbered six to one!!
C: ASLAN
D: You whine like a mule. You are still alive.
C: ROBIN
D: Barely. Aslan examines Robin's wound. Dismissive.
C: ASLAN
D: A flesh wound. Why did you let their leader go?
C: ROBIN
D: After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands. Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
C: ROBIN
D: Have no fear, boy. The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
C: ASLAN
D: The conquering hero returns.
E: laughing
C: ROBIN
D: Ha! It was you he was scared of. Aslan's humor is infectious. Robin's anger relents.
C: ROBIN
D: Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
C: ASLAN
D: With feather pillows?
C: ROBIN
D: With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace.
S: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
N: Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted. Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck dumb with horror. The dark courtyard. Heartsick, Robin stumbles over debris.
C: ROBIN
D: Father! Hello! His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.
N: CLOSE - MEDALLION round the corpse's neck. The Locksley crest.
C: ROBIN
D: Noooooo! A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture. Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained, Aslan looks on.
C: ROBIN
D: I should have been here. Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... Duncan.
C: ROBIN
D: Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down?
E: shaking him
C: DUNCAN
D: Master Robin, is it you? A miracle. I thought God had abandoned us.
C: ROBIN
D: You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows.
C: ASLAN
D: Easy... Look at him. Duncan steps into the moonlight. His face crudely- scarred.
C: ROBIN
D: What has happened?
C: DUNCAN
D: They say they captured him worshipping with the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford.
C: ROBIN
D: Did they have witnesses?
C: DUNCAN
D: Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit.
C: ROBIN
D: Did you believe the charges?
C: DUNCAN
D: Not even when they took my eyes.
C: ROBIN
D: Who did this to you, Duncan?
C: DUNCAN
D: Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff looking on. Robin holds the old retainer to his chest. Stares into the night in silent rage.
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
N: Marked contrast. A forbidding fortress. Cliff-like battlements.
S: INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
N: Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving, stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak door.
C: SENTRY
D: Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to be disturbed.
C: GISBORNE
D: Away, fool. He shoves the Sentry aside.
S: EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
N: Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis- tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she covers up.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Who bade you cover up? He smashes his fist into his chair. She timidly uncovers.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Cousin, I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value. His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black- ness.
C: GISBORNE
D: I met a hooded man today. He bade me warn you not to harm his people.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: His name?
C: GISBORNE
D: Robin of Locksley.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him.
C: GISBORNE
D: This whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Your men were probably drunk. Yet you survived, cousin? Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW, wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. MORTIANNA.
C: GISBORNE
D: You brought her here?
E: stunned
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Quiet! The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes. Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter. The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con- tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone dice -- Runes. She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every move. A connoisseur.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: What do you see?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Change the seat of power.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: London?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Change it.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Move the capitol to Nottingham? Excellent. How?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Ally with royal blood.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who?
C: MORTIANNA
D: That is not revealed. The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind. Mounting intensity.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Ally with royal blood. What else do you see?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Armies.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Whose?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Yours. Men and weaponry in great numgers.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: And victory?
C: MORTIANNA
D: Much blood will be spilled.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Whose?
C: CLOSE SHOT
D: A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol. Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands again. Again the grinning skull.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: The tray smashes to the ground. The hag runs at Gisborne.
C: MORTIANNA
D: Who have you seen?! She shakes him. Screams spittle in his face.
C: GISBORNE
D: No one. I have seen no one.
E: freaked
C: MORTIANNA
D: You lie! A man... A painted man.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: What is wrong?
C: MORTIANNA
D: I have seen my death. She whimpers. Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.
C: MORTIANNA
D: The painted man. He haunts my dreams.
C: GISBORNE
D: Locksley has a companion. A dark- skinned foreigner. He had the marked skin of Islam. Mortianna trembles like an epileptic. Eyes wide with terror.
C: MORTIANNA
D: Kill them! Kill them! She throws herself at Nottingham for protection. He caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake.
C: MORTIANNA
D: And the painted man! Kill him.
E: frantic
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Kill them both. He continues to stroke her. Her trembling subsides.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You have done well, Mortianna. Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it. Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the girl's hand.
N: Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's. Take her. You have earned her. Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist. Drags her away.
E: to Mortianna
C: GISBORNE
D: It is madness bringing the hag here.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power.
S: EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN
N: Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees. Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave. Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
C: ROBIN
D: Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right. Please forgive me, Father.
E: looks to Aslan, then back to the grave
C: DUNCAN
D: He loved you till the end, young master. He never gave up hope of your return.
C: ROBIN
D: I failed him. I should have been here at his side.
C: DUNCAN
D: You must leave, head north to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge.
C: ROBIN
D: Leave me.
C: DUNCAN
D: I know what you're thinking. But one man can achieve nothing against so many. You would need an army.
C: ROBIN
D: Leave me.
C: ASLAN
D: Come, friend. He leads the old man away. CUT TO:
N: GRAVE SIDE - LATER Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side. Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
C: DUNCAN
D: He still stands vigil?
C: ASLAN
D: Like a rock. Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
C: DUNCAN
D: A curse on the Saracens! Were it not for their ungodly ways, he would never have left. This would never have happened.
C: ASLAN
D: It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long.
C: DUNCAN
D: I do not recognize the style of your voice, friend. Are you Irish? A Cornishman?
C: ASLAN
D: Er... no.
C: DUNCAN
D: What manner of name is Aslan then?
C: ASLAN
D: A fine Saracen name.
C: DUNCAN
D: Lord, no! He chokes in shock. Spitting bread.
C: ASLAN
D: Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no offense. By the prophet! What is the man doing? Robin raises his dagger over his wrist. Aslan runs to him.
E: glances at Robin
C: ASLAN
D: Wait! Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm. Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.
C: ROBIN
D: I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name. ... Or until I am dead.
E: a whisper
S: EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY
N: Ooze sucks at feet. The three men stomp through mud and rain.
C: ROBIN
D: We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool.
C: ASLAN
D: A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land?
C: ROBIN
D: This is summer.
C: ASLAN
D: Then Allah truly is great.
C: ROBIN
D: Why, pray?
C: ASLAN
D: No food, no shelter, and weather that would curse the end of the earth. We will all quickly be dead, and I shall be rid of my vow. They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched mansion.
C: ROBIN
D: You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends.
C: ASLAN
D: What is this place?
C: ROBIN
D: Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together.
S: EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
N: Robin pounds on the door. A hatch opens. An OLD WOMAN's face.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: No beggars! The hatch slams shut. Robin pounds again.
C: ROBIN
D: Open up!
N: A pause. The hatch slides back.
C: ROBIN
D: Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Her ladyship is not at home. She slams the hatch again. Robin jams in his hand.
C: ROBIN
D: Aagh! He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
C: ROBIN
D: Is the child Marian at home?
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. Remove that hand. Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly the hatch slams.
C: ASLAN
D: The hospitality here is as warm as the weather.
N: They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Leave your weapons. The three start forward. Her bony finger points at Robin.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Just you.
S: INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
N: The hall. Deer heads. Boar heads. Portraits of ancestors.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Wait here. He waits. CREAKING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony.
C: GIRL
D: Who are you? Dim lighting. Robin cannot make out who it is.
C: ROBIN
D: I am Robin of Locksley.
C: GIRL
D: You lie. Robin is dead.
C: ROBIN
D: I may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. But for now I am real enough.
C: GIRL
D: Step into the light. Turn around.
C: ROBIN
D: By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are you?
C: GIRL
D: I am the maid Marian.
C: ROBIN
D: Then show yourself, child. For we knew each other well.
C: GIRL
D: With the king away, these are lawless times. There are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of his.
C: ROBIN
D: You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you.
C: GIRL
D: Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully.
E: laughs
C: ROBIN
D: Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed.
N: She moves into the light... Fat. Rotten teeth. Ugly as sin.
C: ROBIN
D: Er... the years have been kind.
C: GIRL
D: Thank you. Now remove yourself from this household. A figure steps behind Robin. Sticks a sword in his back.
C: GIRL
D: As you can see, we are already well protected.
E: turning away
C: ROBIN
D: Wait, Marian! ...ouch!
N: The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man -- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
C: ROBIN
D: You are truly courageous against an unarmed man. The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps. Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head. Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.
C: OUTSIDE
D: The SOUND of the fight indoors. Aslan hurls himself at the door. It doesn't give.
C: INSIDE
D: Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts. The horns get shorter. Robin retreats. Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops. Robin wrenches off the mask. Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN. The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young woman stands over Robin.
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: As she was saying, we have no need of your protection. Robin croaks through clenched teeth.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian. CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN
N: Liquid tumbles into a goblet. The three men at a table in the kitchen. The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves. Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin -- "Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An impish grin.
C: MARIAN
D: I trust Lord Locksley has recovered from his indisposition. Aslan laughs. Robin glares.
S: EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
N: Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in her voice.
C: MARIAN
D: Why would he wish me to be protected by the boy who burned my hair when I was a child?
C: ROBIN
D: We were together five terrible years in a Saracen prison.
C: MARIAN
D: How do I know you didn't abandon him there to save your own skin. Robin hands her Peter's ring. She is shocked.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian, I'm sorry.
C: MARIAN
D: I will forward your condolences to my mother. She turns her back. He searches for a way to reach her.
C: ROBIN
D: On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands.
C: MARIAN
D: The people fear the Druids so much they'd believe anything. Nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property.
C: ROBIN
D: Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there.
C: MARIAN
D: I will not retreat. Besides, I have no interest in life at court. Gossip-mongering and currying favor. Here I am my own person.
C: ROBIN
D: The you must allow me to be your guardian.
C: MARIAN
D: I do not need a guardian. She turns to face him. Streaming tears.
C: MARIAN
D: My brother is dead. You cannot take his place. Robin grabs and holds her.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian, I don't want to replace him.
C: MARIAN
D: What do you want? Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.
C: MARIAN
D: This is wrong. She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her. Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
C: ASLAN
D: Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast. He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside.
C: ASLAN
D: Twenty or more. In battle armor.
C: MARIAN
D: Soldiers coming here? Is this your protection?
C: ROBIN
D: I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger.
C: MARIAN
D: I can take care of myself. There are horses in the stable. Go! Aslan runs into the stables.
C: ROBIN
D: I'm not leaving. Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers.
C: MARIAN
D: Stop them! They're stealing my horses!
C: ROBIN
D: Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall.
C: ROBIN
D: He can ride. He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
C: GISBORNE
D: You have been sheltering outlaws, Lady Marian.
C: MARIAN
D: They're thieves, you imbecile. Bring back my horses, or the Sheriff will know of your cowardice. Gisborne knows she is lying.
C: GISBORNE
D: You're lucky he didn't steal your virtue too. A crown to the man who brings me Locksley's head. He leads the pursuit. A SOLDIER hangs back. Grabs Marian's hair.
E: to his men
C: SOLDIER
D: A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
C: MARIAN
D: Kiss this!
N: She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt. Jabs the blade into his wrist.
C: MARIAN
D: Try me again, if you want to leave a hand behind. Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently. CUT TO: EXT. STREAM Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men. Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It backs away.
C: ROBIN
D: Damn you, animal! Aslan shouts from the far bank.
C: ASLAN
D: Treat it like a woman. Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or die.
C: ASLAN
D: Have you never had a woman? Gently, man. Soothe it!
C: ROBIN
D: Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. He pats the horse soothingly. The animal edges forward.
C: ASLAN
D: Softly. With your knees.
C: ROBIN
D: I know! I know! The soldiers reload. Robin urges the horse at the steep drop.
C: ROBIN
D: Easy, easy. Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
C: ROBIN
D: I love you! The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps. Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
C: GISBORNE
D: Robin of the Hood! Son of the devil worshipper.
E: yelling
C: ROBIN
D: What is your pleasure, Gisborne?
C: GISBORNE
D: It was I who strung your father's corpse to the castle gate. My pleasure will be in doing the same to you.
C: ROBIN
D: You survived one meeting. Our next will be your last.
C: GISBORNE
D: Your father died a coward, cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig.
C: ROBIN
D: That's a lie!
N: Incensed, he is losing his judgement.
C: ASLAN
D: Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap. A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to follow.
E: shouts
N: Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub. Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
C: ROBIN
D: We have lost them. I'll lame this mare if I ask her to go any farther. He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye. A primitive telescope. Robin watches, curious.
C: SCOPE POV
D: Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind them.
C: BACK TO SCENE ASLAN
D: Here they come. Look. Robin puts the device to his eye...
C: SCOPE POV
D: The soldiers are close!
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself. Then realizes they are still in the distance.
C: ROBIN
D: Is this Arab magic?
C: ASLAN
D: No. Arab science. He replaces the tube in his pouch.
C: ASLAN
D: How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem?
C: ROBIN
D: God knows!
N: Aslan laughs. Robin points towards an endless expanse of trees.
C: ROBIN
D: We can lose them in the forest.
C: DUNCAN
D: Sherwood is haunted, Master.
C: ROBIN
D: Either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves. He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin looks back.
C: ROBIN
D: They're not following.
N: Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
C: GISBORNE
D: Come on, damn you! There are only three of them.
C: SOLDIER
D: It's not the men we fear, sir. Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones. Aslan draws his sword.
C: DUNCAN
D: Banshees. They say they fly in your mouth and suck you dry of blood before you can scream. He wraps his scarf over his mouth.
C: ROBIN
D: Be quiet! Listen. WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air.
C: ASLAN
D: Allah protect us from the evil spirits. Duncan clings to his back. Robin points.
C: ROBIN
D: Behind you! Aslan slashes out, futilely.
C: ROBIN
D: No, there! And there! Aslan flails. Robin cracks up.
C: ASLAN
D: Cease your mad laughing. I can feel them. Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN.
C: ROBIN
D: Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Ring around the rosie!
E: singing
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan! Aslan makes no move to intervene.
N: The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down. Beg for mercy, rich man.
C: ROBIN
D: I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man?
C: VOICE
D: Yeah, bollocks, mate.
E: O.S.
N: Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet. His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes when he laughs, which is often.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: What are ya, m'old cock?
C: ROBIN
D: Er... Robin... He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
C: ROBIN
D: ...Hood. Robin Hood. Who are you?
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: John Little. Bestman o' the woods.
C: ROBIN
D: Bestman? You lead this rabble?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: We waste time. Tax him.
C: ROBIN
D: Tax? For what?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: For passage through Sherwood.
C: ROBIN
D: I will pay no tax. Besides, I have nothing but my cloak and my sword.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: A man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar. Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily, Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: And this one is a liar. Ahah! Gold! The men cheer. John snatches the medallion back from Will.
E: he bites the metal
C: ROBIN
D: That is sacred to me.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Sacred to us too, mush. This here'll feed us for a bloomin' month. Robin draws his sword.
C: ROBIN
D: You will have to fight me for it.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: I'd love to, mate. He grins hugely. A boy pushes his way through the throng.
C: WULF
D: Wait, father! I know him.
C: ROBIN
D: This man is your father? Tell him how I saved your hide from the Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I believe. He reaches for the medallion. John pulls it away.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Naw ya don't, laddie.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: You must be Robin of Locksley. The blackguard who abandoned us to Nottingham's plundering.
C: WULF
D: Be careful, Father. He fights like a demon. He walloped six o' Sheriff's men?
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Is that so? Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free. Bends it into a pretzel.
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan!
N: Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut. John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's stomach. Robin folds.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Oh dear! The little rich boy is lost for words. Thanks for the taxes, Locksley.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: And for the laughs. The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into the tree. Will administers one final kick before leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously at Aslan.
C: ROBIN
D: Son of an Arab whore! Once again your assistance was invaluable.
C: ASLAN
D: You seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life.
C: DUNCAN
D: I recognized some of the voices. Many were from your father's farms.
C: ASLAN
D: Your avenging army, my friend.
C: ROBIN
D: That rabble?
C: ASLAN
D: All they need is a leader.
C: ROBIN
D: They have a leader. A very large one.
C: ASLAN
D: Defeat him and they will follow you.
C: ROBIN
D: Allah has taken your brains.
C: DUNCAN
D: I hear the voice of a spoiled child, Master Robin. I suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north.
C: ROBIN
D: You, too? You expect me to fight that behemoth?
C: DUNCAN
D: Your father would expect you to act like a man. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff.
C: ROBIN
D: This is my bridge. No one crosses without paying tax.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Just bugger off, mate, huh?
C: ROBIN
D: If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff for one day?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: If he's in a hurry to end his mortal misery, help him.
C: ROBIN
D: You don't have the courage to face me again, John Little? Or should I call you 'Little John'? John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff. Strides to the bridge.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Alright, m'old cock. You wanna nuther good wallopin'? His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin connects a blow on John's foot. The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings, which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing. Enjoying the time of his life. Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength. Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly. Aslan watches impassively. Robin scrambles back onto the bridge. John waits, grinning.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Don't fool with him. Get him!
N: John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks. John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows him time to right himself. John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Swimmin' time again, ol' chum. The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters. Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank. No sign.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave 'un. Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might. John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Help! Cain't bloody swim. He submerges again. Robin pulls his head above water.
C: ROBIN
D: Do you yield?
N: The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the surface.
C: ROBIN
D: Do you yield?
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Yes!
C: ROBIN
D: Good. Now put your feet down. John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water only reaches his chest.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: I'll be buggered.
C: ROBIN
D: Pay me the tax. A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
C: JOHN LITTLE
D: Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid rock. He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
N: A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Mead. Made it m'self.
C: ROBIN
D: A fine brew, Little John. He spits black objects from his mouth. Dead bees. John grins.
E: drinks
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Real honey. He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to Aslan.
C: ASLAN
D: With regrets, I decline.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: An Englishman's mead not bleedin' good enough for ya?
C: ASLAN
D: On the contrary. I thank you, but my faith prevents me from partaking in such enjoyments.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Your bloody loss, mate. He swigs. Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks heartily. Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: What is it, boy? Speak up!
C: WULF
D: I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley. I owes ya m'life.
C: ROBIN
D: You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am glad I chanced by in time to help.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put hair on your bloomin' chest. Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant. He turns green and runs. His father cracks up.
C: ROBIN
D: Tell me about your men, John. John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree trunk.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: This stumpy one 'ere's David o' Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull.
C: ROBIN
D: How do you come by the name, Bull?
C: BULL
D: 'Cuz o' my size, Sire.
C: ROBIN
D: Because you are short?
C: BULL
D: Nay. 'Cuz I be so long.
N: Proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
C: ROBIN
D: No, Bull. Save it for the ladies. Drunken laughter. Robin turns to the next man at the fireside.
C: ROBIN
D: Your name, friend? The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a comprehensible word.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: That be Hal Brownwell, but the lads call i'm Hal Hiccup. The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his tormentors.
C: ROBIN
D: Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I'd be glad to have you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me. There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects to try it.
C: ROBIN
D: How is it there are so many of you in hiding?
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: We're outlaws. Got prices on our 'eads, every man jack. Blasted Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.
C: ROBIN
D: How do you fare?
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: We get by, I reckon.
C: ROBIN
D: While the Sheriff steals your land and your families starve?
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: What in bloody blazes'd ya have us do?
C: ROBIN
D: Your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so long, my friend. Soon the Sheriff will hunt you down and hang you. You must fight back.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: We show as much as a toe outside the forest, they'll slaughter us like bleedin' sheep.
C: ROBIN
D: We must organize. Win by guile.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: 'We'? Ya lookin' to join us, matie?
C: ROBIN
D: No. To lead you.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Ha! I would never be led by the son of a Druid.
C: ROBIN
D: There are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror. Murmurs of agreement from around the fire. Robin turns to Will.
C: ROBIN
D: What is your name, friend?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Count me not a friend, Locksley.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will. The man's our guest. Will gets up. Angrily pushes his way out of the group.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.
C: ROBIN
D: He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all, mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army? Ya must be bloody jokin'.
C: ROBIN
D: We can win. And I believe we will.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood, but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky! Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack that blasted noble head in two. Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long draught of mead.
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE
N: A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess. Robin sits, brooding.
C: ASLAN
D: I have led you wrong. This is no army. These men live like dogs.
E: gloomily
C: ROBIN
D: English dogs. They can learn.
C: ASLAN
D: Learn what? To build kennels? He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side. The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously hung-over.
C: ROBIN
D: Too much mead, old friend. What day is it?
C: DUNCAN
D: Sunday, I believe.
C: ROBIN
D: Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass?
C: DUNCAN
D: They do. These days the need for mercy is greater than ever.
C: ROBIN
D: Then I must ask you a favor. EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY
N: Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham. Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin, dressed as Duncan.
S: EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
N: Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.
C: GUARD
D: Hey, you! Robin keeps going. A hand clasps his shoulder. Spins him 'round.
C: GUARD
D: Do I know you? Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind. The Guard sniffs his soiled hand.
C: GUARD
D: My God, you stink!
C: ROBIN
D: Pardon my blindness, sir. I'm always falling down.
C: GUARD
D: Yeech! Get away from me.
N: He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away, hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on the wall.
S: INT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
N: Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD, bedecked in ermine.
C: BISHOP
D: We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on all your people, but most especially on our noble Lord Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city. Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega- tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
C: BISHOP
D: Grant him also the strength to bring to justice the lawless men who threaten its safety. Help him to stamp out the curse of the dread Druids who would seize from us our children, even as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers. The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children. Among them, Robin. The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are galvanized. Begging hands reach out.
C: VARIOUS
D: 1. Alms! 2. Have mercy, milady. 3. Pity, fine sir. 4. For my baby. 5. Etc. The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble. Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her wrist.
C: ROBIN
D: Alms for a blind man. For one who cannot see your beauty.
C: MARIAN
D: This is dangerous.
E: recognizing him
C: ROBIN
D: So you care for my safety?
C: MARIAN
D: No, for mine. I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.
C: ROBIN
D: Under the Sheriff's law, that's a badge of pride.
C: MARIAN
D: He's put a price on your head.
C: ROBIN
D: How much?
C: MARIAN
D: A hundred gold pieces.
C: ROBIN
D: Is that all? I have not annoyed him enough. Soon he will offer ten thousand.
C: MARIAN
D: For ten thousand I would turn you in myself. Nottingham is mounting an army.
E: glances back at the Sheriff
C: ROBIN
D: How do you know?
C: MARIAN
D: He has rounded up every blacksmith in the county. He has them holed up in the castle making swords and armor.
C: ROBIN
D: What is he planning?
C: MARIAN
D: I don't know, but there's no limit to the man's ambitions. Go!
E: as Sheriff heads towards them
C: ROBIN
D: If you need me, I will be with the woodsmen. Send for me as 'Robin Hood.'
C: MARIAN
D: Robin! Do something for me.
C: ROBIN
D: What?
C: MARIAN
D: Take a bath.
C: ROBIN
D: Care to join me? With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham arrives.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You shine like the sun, my lady. He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle. Kisses it.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You have been meeting with young Robin of Locksley. My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses.
E: as she tries to hide her shock
C: MARIAN
D: Yes. A most disagreeable experience.
E: recovering
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: I deeply regret it, and I promise you he will be brought to justice. For subjecting you to such treatment, I will hang him from the walls with his own entrails. That gleam of insanity. Robin watches from a distance.
C: MARIAN
D: I would like to see that, my lord. The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: My dear, a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone. If you would consent to bring your household within the city walls, I could give your needs my most personal attention.
C: MARIAN
D: I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from the heart, but for now I prefer to stay in my family's ancestral home. My cousin, King Richard, will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Alas, the King has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.
C: MARIAN
D: Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will return. When he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects. The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards a side door.
C: BEGGAR
D: Alms, my lord. Nottingham makes to shove the man aside. With a swift move, the beggar grabs the Sheriff in a headlock. Slides Nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags him out of sight.
E: Robin
C: ROBIN
D: A hundred crowns, Sheriff? You insult me. Nottingham starts to struggle. Robin draws blood.
C: ROBIN
D: Remember young Robin of Locksley, Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your nemesis. Your avenging angel.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: If you kill me, you will hang.
C: ROBIN
D: If I kill you, I will hang happy.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: What do you want?
C: ROBIN
D: I want to give you a chance. A chance you do not deserve. A chance to right your wrongs.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: I'm listening.
C: ROBIN
D: From this day forward you will cease to tax my people. You will renounce the charges against my father, and you will return his lands to me.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Why should I?
C: ROBIN
D: Because for every harm you do, I swear by God I shall visit on you threefold in return.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Empty words.
C: ROBIN
D: I am here with a blade at your throat. As long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again. A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them. Robin digs the knife a little deeper.
C: ROBIN
D: Your answer?
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Never, fool.
C: ROBIN
D: Then it will begin.. Gisborne yells orders. Robin hurls Nottingham against the wall.
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
N: Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks him. A sure shot. Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly into the air.
C: MARIAN
D: Please excuse my clumsiness. Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks the guard who hasseled him into the wall.
E: innocently
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
N: Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.
C: ROBIN
D: A personal loan from the Sheriff.
C: ASLAN
D: You should not have left without me, Englishman.
E: furious
C: ROBIN
D: How so? You have not raised a finger to protect me.
C: ASLAN
D: Before I had a choice.
C: ROBIN
D: It was my choice to do this alone.
C: ASLAN
D: A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge.
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan, if I didn't know better, I would swear you were worried about me.
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL
N: The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Starve them out. Slaughter their livestock. I want to see Locksley's own people fighting each other to bring him to us.
C: GISBORNE
D: I swear he will not live to see the next full moon.
S: EXT. HAMLET - DAY
N: A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.
C: FARMER
D: Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the sow. She's with young 'uns. The next litter'll feed us through the winter.
C: SOLDIER
D: You've heard of Robin Hood?
C: FARMER
D: Yes, sir. The Soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground.
C: SOLDIER
D: Then pray he is brought to us before winter.
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
N: A trail of refugees. Women and children carry their belongings into camp. Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings. A contingent of woodsmen confronts Robin.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: You brought this misery on us, Locksley. We can barely feed ourselves.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody pot to piss in.
C: ROBIN
D: Then we shall take from him and his rich friends.
N: This provokes a barrage of protests. The men are angry.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Brave talk, Locksley. I say we take the rich boy in. Murmurs of general agreement.
C: ROBIN
D: Will, do you think the Sheriff will give everything back after I am gone?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: He will give us the reward, and our pardons.
C: ROBIN
D: Alright, Will. You can take me in on one condition. You must fight me. You may use the Sheriff's horse and arm yourself as you please. I will fight on foot. Unarmed.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Unarmed?
C: ROBIN
D: If you lose, you will accept me as your leader. If you win, you may take me in. Dead or alive.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Dead, Locksley. CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY (LATER)
N: Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators. Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves, while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan. Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged with scars.
C: ASLAN
D: This man has true purpose. He means to kill you.
C: DUNCAN
D: And you have given him the means.
C: WULF
D: Will is ruthless, Robin. Guard your back.
C: ROBIN
D: I am grateful for your concern, friends, but I have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds. I am ready, Will. Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins back to the attack. His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.
E: shouts
N: Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder. Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away. Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's chest. Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly. Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword. Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough. Douses his face. Yells at Will.
C: ROBIN
D: Come on, you little piss pot. Do your worst! Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.
C: ROBIN
D: The horse is smarter than you are, Will. Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges. Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.
C: ROBIN
D: Here, Will! You aim like a girl, Will! Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away. Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back- wards off his mount. Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
C: ROBIN
D: Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull.
N: The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is about to strike.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off, eh? Overpowered, Will relents. With a defiant glance, he skulks away.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya got us by the short and curlies, Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya got to bleedin' say.
N: Robin scans the faces. He has their attention.
C: ROBIN
D: Nottingham has taken from us everything we own. Now we are going to start taking from him.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: 'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do that?
C: ROBIN
D: We are going to tax him. DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
N: Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange, and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his telescope raised.
C: ASLAN
D: Here they come.
C: ROBIN
D: How many?
C: ASLAN
D: Two wagons. Twenty escort.
C: ROBIN
D: Twenty? They usually have five. He grabs the telescope.
C: SCOPE POV
D: A phalanx of mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with barrels, and a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on wheels, with crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne commands the escort.
C: BACK TO SCENE ROBIN
D: This is no ordinary convoy. Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods- men lies nervously in ambush.
C: BULL
D: 'ow many?
C: ROBIN
D: Er, about ten. Why scare them? They can't count anyway.
E: then, to Aslan
C: ASLAN
D: And they call me the barbarian.
C: ROBIN
D: Let's go. Together they run down the hill, keeping low. Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. The mounted soldiers charge them. The woodsmen run into the trees. As the horsemen close in, the runners leap into a trench. Lift up matted screens of brush and grass. It's as if they disappeared. The soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods- men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches.
N: The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the river gorge. Momentum carries many of them over the cliff.
C: BACK ON ROADWAY
D: Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins, steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are unable to fire at them. Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse, driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen is lifted into place, covering their route.
N: Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone. He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and cursing.
S: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
N: Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof. Angry shouts from inside.
C: ROBIN
D: Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free. In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near his feet.
C: ROBIN
D: Ah, I feared as much. He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside, panic. Drowning rats. The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead. Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at them. CUT TO:
C: COUNTRYSIDE
D: Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around. Cheers of celebration.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: I'll be buggered.
E: awestruck
C: ROBIN
D: This treasure had a purpose. We must find out what. He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart. The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
C: ROBIN
D: Get off him. He's a man of the cloth. Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet. Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.
C: FRIAR
D: The Lord's blessing on you, kind sir. These sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks of St. Catherine's. He indicates his cargo of barrels.
C: ROBIN
D: It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person. Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.
C: FRIAR
D: A thousand pardons, sir, but duty beckons. I must hasten on.
C: ROBIN
D: A moment, my reverend friend. You travel with poor company when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
E: grabbing the bridle
C: BULL
D: Aye, tax him. This sparks a chorus of comments.
C: ROBIN
D: My men are thirsty and have much to celebrate.
C: FRIAR
D: Lord bless me, sir, are these your men? I had mistook them for common thieves. Kindly step aside.
C: ROBIN
D: Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a few barrels to good Christian men. The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
C: FRIAR
D: Well, sir, if you wish them to share in the good Lord's brew... Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club. Smites Robin with it.
C: FRIAR
D: ... you must best me for it. Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed, Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal full in the face.
C: FRIAR
D: Giddyup, nag! The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the cart.
C: ROBIN
D: You leave when I say. Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
C: FRIAR
D: Protect me, Lord. He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
C: FRIAR
D: Yield! He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe. The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
C: FRIAR
D: Confess that Friar Tuck is a better, holier, and braver man than thou art, knave.
C: ROBIN
D: Never! Whoomf!
C: FRIAR
D: Yield, I say! Yield to Friar Tuck. Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls. Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
C: ROBIN
D: Yield yourself! He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the ground.
C: ROBIN
D: Yield to Robin Hood. Tuck holds up a hand in surrender. Robin eases off.
C: FRIAR
D: Thank you, Lord, for teaching me humility.
E: feeling his head
C: ROBIN
D: Well, Friar Tuck. We have need of an honest man of God, to minister to these men and their families. What do you say?
N: The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the grinning Saracen.
C: FRIAR
D: I'd rather roast in hell. He punches Robin in the gut. CUT TO:
C: FRIAR TUCK
D: strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly follows.
C: ROBIN
D: Giddyup, Friar.
N: He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch his robe in wonder.
C: ROBIN
D: What do you say now, Tuck? Here are the meek of the earth. Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a moment of prayer.
C: FRIAR
D: The Lord moves in mysterious ways. I accept.
C: ROBIN
D: You will not regret it.
C: FRIAR
D: Aye, but you may. CUT TO: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP A blazing fire. Deer carcasses roast. Tuck's barrels supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out coins to each family.
C: ROBIN
D: Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.
C: FARMER
D: Thankee, Robin. Little John and Bull approach. John indicates the two prisoners roped to a nearby tree.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa 'em, Rob.
C: BULL
D: They'd be spittin' it out good if they'd knowed anythin'.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Reckon the Cap'n knows summat, Rob, but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is.
C: ASLAN
D: Perhaps it is time for some heathen persuasion. CUT TO:
C: CAPTAIN OF SOLDIERS
D: stares up at Robin defiantly.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Spare your breath. I know nothing.
C: ROBIN
D: I believe you. But this Arab here, he's got it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than nothing.
E: reasonable MORE
C: ROBIN
D: And when he gets like this, he's very hard to reason with. With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan leaps INTO VIEW. Stripped to the waist, brandishing his scimitar. The Captain tries to back away. Robin tries to restrain Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling, drooling at the mouth, Aslan explores the Captain's body with his hands. A butcher checking meat.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBIN
D: I strongly advise you to talk. He hasn't eaten in weeks.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What does he want?
E: rising terror
C: ROBIN
D: You.
C: CAPTAIN
D: For Godsakes, get him off me!
C: ROBIN
D: No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan. ... How about this other one?... Fatter, yes... more meat. The other soldier, who definitely has more flesh on the bone, is struck dumb with horror, as Aslan turns his attention to him. With one swing of his sword, Aslan slices through the man's ropes. Drags him to his feet. Little John runs over.
E: very deliberately
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin' men.
E: urgent
C: ROBIN
D: I cannot stop him, John. Besides, if they will not tell what they know, then they must pay the price.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Kill 'em aye, but not like this. 'Tain't Christian. Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then silence.
N: The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm. Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates wildly at the Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What does he say?
C: ROBIN
D: Well, roughly, he says that he doesn't care for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you.
C: CAPTAIN
D: No, God, no! I'll talk. Just keep him away. Keep him away!
C: BEHIND WAGON
D: Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed, except that he's missing a glove.
S: INT. WOODSMAN'S HUT - NIGHT
N: The walls shake with Little John's laughter.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Sure changed the color of 'is britches, didn't 'e?
C: ROBIN
D: Thanks to our cannibal friend. Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of venison.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
C: BULL
D: Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold north o' the border?
C: ROBIN
D: To hire mercenaries. The Celts are savage tribesmen, trained to kill from birth.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Aye, the Romans built a bleedin' great wall to keep 'em out.
C: BULL
D: What does 'e want wi 'em?
C: ROBIN
D: Since he also has every Smith in the country working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Agin' who?
C: ASLAN
D: England.
S: INT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT
N: Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the smithy's fires. A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white- hot.
C: GISBORNE
D: We were ambushed. In Sherwood Forest. Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger than our native blades. Any losses?
C: GISBORNE
D: All the men are gone.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Yet again you are the sole survivor, cousin? Interesting. And the gold?
C: GISBORNE
D: Well, it er... disappeared.
N: The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Robin Hood?
C: GISBORNE
D: They were woodsmen, dressed in green.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Robin Hood. He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us. Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's belly.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me. It is indeed fine steel.
E: turning to the horrified smithy
S: EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
N: A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed. Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.
C: FRIAR
D: God bless you, sir.
C: VILLAGER
D: An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar. They says as 'ow none o' the Sheriff's cronies dare go within miles o' Sherwood for fear o' havin' their pockets pinched.
C: FRIAR
D: Ah, the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Unless Robin Hood takes it first!
N: Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his jug in greeting.
C: FRIAR
D: Good morrow, brothers.
S: EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
N: Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS. He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye. Marian jumps down.
C: MARIAN
D: How dare you!
E: to Robin
C: ROBIN
D: Good morning, Lady Marian. In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
C: MARIAN
D: You send men to drag me from my home in the middle of the night, like some slave girl? Is this the way the famous Robin Hood treats a lady?
C: ROBIN
D: Ah well... er, let me finish this bath you wished me to take. Then I'll explain.
C: MARIAN
D: I demand an explanation right now!
C: ROBIN
D: If you will be patient, I could spare your propriety by...
C: MARIAN
D: I will decide when my propriety is compromised.
C: ROBIN
D: As you wish.
N: He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her. She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body, glistening with water.
C: MARIAN
D: How dare you expose yourself to me?! She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water. Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own black eye.
C: BULL
D: The big 'un did the same to me.
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
N: An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at his shot.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Right m'lad. Let's see how close you can git to that bugger. Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
E: to Wulf
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Take a gander at this 'un, mates. Never seen nuthin' like it in my bloomin' life.
N: Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac- ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses, camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not about to admit it.
C: MARIAN
D: This better be damned important. Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap- tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws back the lid. Marian is speechless.
C: ROBIN
D: Nottingham robs the poor. We rob Nottingham and give back to the poor.
C: MARIAN
D: Do you think he's going to let you get away with all this? The man is without mercy. He will annihilate you.
C: ROBIN
D: Somebody has to take a stand.
C: MARIAN
D: You're taking a stand with the lives of these people. These young ones. A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's. Is there a hint of concern for him also?
C: MARIAN
D: What do you want from me?
C: ROBIN
D: Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard.
C: MARIAN
D: Nottingham would not dare challenge the King.
C: ROBIN
D: The King is not in England to be challenged, is he? While he is away, he may lose his country. You are Richard's cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you.
E: Marian masks her concern
C: MARIAN
D: Now you want me to participate in your folly? A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering. CUT TO:
C: BOUQUET
D: protrudes from Marian's saddle. She is mounted, ready to go. Sarah giggles as she takes her leave of Bull.
C: ROBIN
D: I am sending Duncan with you. Give him some warm food and a real bed. I grow tired of his bellyaching.
E: to Marian
C: DUNCAN
D: Hah! I have endured more hardship in my lifetime than any man here. Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper.
C: ROBIN
D: Don't tell him I told you, but he may be useful to you. There is no one to whom I would rather entrust your safety.
C: MARIAN
D: Duncan, you are most welcome. Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away.
C: ROBIN
D: Will you send word to the King?
E: calls after her
C: MARIAN
D: I'll think about it.
S: INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
N: A globule of red liquid. A signet ring. Marian seals a letter.
S: INT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY
N: The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office.
C: MARIAN
D: It is a personal matter, my Lord, but one of vital importance.
C: BISHOP
D: I understand, my dear lady. This is my most trusted emissary. He hands the letter to a solemn courier.
C: MARIAN
D: You will travel to France immediately. You must give this directly into the hands of the King, and him alone. The courier bows in acknowledgement. Marian indicates Sarah.
C: MARIAN
D: My lady-in-waiting will accompany you. Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop.
C: BISHOP
D: My dear, I could not vouch for her safety. The journey is fraught with danger.
C: MARIAN
D: I appreciate your concern, my Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished rider. I must insist that she goes along.
C: BISHOP
D: As you wish.
E: a beat
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
N: An informal council of war. Robin uses a stick in the dirt.
C: ROBIN
D: We have to be ready to move camp at any time. The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night. Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.
C: WULF
D: Father! Come quick. Mother's dying.
S: INT. WOODSMEN'S HUT - DAY
N: Fanny Little writhes in agony. John rushes in. Tuck looks up from Fanny's side.
C: FRIAR
D: The child comes early. Fanny screams. John kneels beside her, taking her head.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Hush, m'lass. Ya'll be fine.
C: FANNY
D: 'S not like t'others, John. Oh God, it pains me so.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya're sittin' thar like a fat sow. Help her, man, help her!
E: angrily, to Tuck
C: FRIAR
D: I am doing all I can. Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming creatures.
C: ASLAN
D: By Allah, leeches! He starts to pull the parasites off. Tuck jumps at him.
C: FRIAR
D: Get away from her! Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.
C: ASLAN
D: Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she and the child will die. John is paralyzed with confusion. Tuck appeals to Robin.
C: FRIAR
D: He lies. He is the devil's seed, sent to lead us astray.
C: ASLAN
D: Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct us to preserve life. Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.
C: ASLAN
D: Your baby has not turned. It cannot be born without help.
E: soothing
C: FRIAR
D: What do you know, you damned savage?
C: ASLAN
D: If you will allow me, I can help her. It will not be without danger.
E: to John
C: FRIAR
D: Do not listen to him! He will kill her.
C: ASLAN
D: If you do not listen to me, she will certainly die. And the child, too. Fanny cries out. John looks to Robin, pleading for advice.
C: ROBIN
D: The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest you let the Arab try. If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my life.
E: as John is undecided
N: John's eyes meet his wife's. She nods.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: So be it.
C: FRIAR
D: Then it will be on your head. I have warned you. He storms out. All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf.
C: ASLAN
D: Bring me a needle, thread, water, a skinning knife, and burning ashes. Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They whisper.
C: ROBIN
D: What are you going to do?
C: ASLAN
D: The child must be taken out by the knife.
C: ROBIN
D: The knife?
C: ASLAN
D: I have seen it many times with horses.
C: ROBIN
D: Horses? By the Lord, what are her chances?
C: ASLAN
D: After wasting so much blood... not good.
C: ROBIN
D: Now you tell me! Wulf runs back in. Aslan holds up a piece of wood.
C: ASLAN
D: Are you ready?... Bite down on this... Robin, hold her steady. He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.
E: to Fanny
N: OUTSIDE Little John paces. Wulf comes out of the hut. Families hover and wait. From inside, MUFFLED GROANS.
C: FRIAR
D: I tell you, the barbarian is killing her. John moves to the hut. Wulf restrains him.
C: INSIDE
D: The mother heaves, then drops.
C: ROBIN
D: Is she gone?
N: Aslan ignores him, keeps working over Fanny's body. Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something in awed Arabic.
C: ROBIN
D: What did you say? Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
C: ASLAN
D: It is a boy. The mother revives. Aslan places the child on her breast.
C: ASLAN
D: Your son, my lady... Robin, hold her skin together while I sew her up. He picks up the needle and thread. Robin's eyes turn to the woman's abdomen... He faints. CUT TO:
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one side. Bloody and exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut door. Tuck jumps to his feet, drawing his knife. Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily, behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across his own wrist.
C: FRIAR
D: This day God has taught me a fine lesson. He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
C: FRIAR
D: I would be honored. Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone cheers.
C: FRIAR
D: You are a good man, my barbarian friend.
E: MORE
C: FRIAR
D: We shall open a barrel together and I shall do my damndest to save your heathen soul.
E: CONT'D
C: ASLAN
D: Alas, I am not permitted...
C: FRIAR
D: Our God made this brew, brother. I merely combined the ingredients. Do you dare to insult his works?
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
N: Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier. The courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.
C: SARAH
D: What is wrong?
C: COURIER
D: My horse seems to be favoring a foreleg. Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.
S: INT. DUBOIS MANSION - MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
N: Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved, she calls out.
C: MARIAN
D: Who is there? Duncan!
S: INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!... A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She shoos him down.
C: MARIAN
D: Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice. She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind. A masked SOLDIER.
C: SOLDIER
D: We meet again. He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods her with his sword.
C: SOLDIER
D: Drop your blade.
C: MARIAN
D: You are still overmatched, soldier. She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table. Lays his blade against her chest.
C: SOLDIER
D: You owe me favors, wench. Bare your breasts... or I will do it for you. Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face. Screaming, he grabs his face. She reaches for her dagger. He slashes with his sword. She backs to the fireplace, grabs a spit of roasted chickens... drives the point clean through his chest. He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging the servants. Duncan is shoved through the door.
C: DUNCAN
D: I am sorry, my lady. There were too many. She stares at the invaders with studied calm.
C: MARIAN
D: Is there something you need, gentlemen? I remember no masked ball on my calendar. CUT TO:
C: AERIAL SHOT
D: FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green, intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in...
S: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT
N: The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model. These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with a white rat on his arm.
C: REDHEAD BARON
D: Forget about Locksley. He is no threat.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero.
C: GREYBEARD BARON
D: It is impossible to attack him in the forest. We have tried everything. He is cunning.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Then we will be more cunning. I must be rid of him. We may not be able to intercept his next warning to the King. Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open. Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor. His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable ferocity in his eyes.
C: CELTIC CHIEFTAIN
D: I want the heads of the men who stole my gold.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood.
C: REDHEAD BARON
D: My Lord Nottingham, I must protest. It is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners.
C: GREYBEARD BARON
D: What can these Celts do that we cannot?
N: The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head... and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full three seconds. An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest. He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees. The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated. DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - NIGHT
N: The campfire. Aslan shrieks a war cry. Dervishes 'round the fire, swigging from a jug. Equally drunk, the Friar follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin and the others watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another jug and hands it to Aslan.
C: FRIAR
D: Come, you son of Saladin. A toast to all of Jehovah's children. The saved and the damned.
C: ASLAN
D: This must be a truly evil potion, to make the soul feel this good. He downs the entire jug in one long draught. Refills it.
C: ASLAN
D: Come, holy man. A toast to all of Allah's children. The true believers and the fat infidels. Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck looks at Robin.
C: FRIAR
D: How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem when they can't even hold their brew? DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FOREST LANE - DAWN
N: A masked soldier gallops along. Hurls a bundle to the ground.
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAWN
N: The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey grass. Tuck snores. Robin shakes Aslan, who grabs for his weapon. The hangover hits him like a mallet. He clutches his temples.
C: ROBIN
D: The dancing demon! Good morning.
C: ASLAN
D: If it was Jehovah who created this brew, he is truly wise. He built the punishment into the crime. An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree. Robin reacts.
E: wincing
C: ROBIN
D: They need help.
S: EXT. FOREST LANE - DAY
N: Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body. Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence. Fighting his emotions.
C: BULL
D: A bloke wearin' a mask o' the Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.
C: ROBIN
D: Are you sure it was a Druid mask? Damn them to hell! They must have Marian. Do you know where they meet?
E: as Bull nods
C: BULL
D: The Gregor Caves, I 'eard tell.
C: ASLAN
D: We will go there.
C: ROBIN
D: No! You stay here, dammit! I will go alone.
C: ASLAN
D: You forget yourself. I am not your servant.
C: ROBIN
D: Then be my friend. There are women and children here in greater need of your courage.
C: ASLAN
D: Take my eyes, then. He hands Robin his telescope. CUT TO:
E: considers
S: EXT. CAVES
N: SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin rides up the path to the caves that his father took. Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves cautiously forward. POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes. Remnants of a recent ceremony.
C: BACK TO SCENE
D: Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar. Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form, lying face down.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian!
E: under his breath
N: He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into blackness.
S: INT. CAVE - DAY
N: Robin's eyes -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark smoke-filled recesses of the caves. The walls weave. Eerie WATERY sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men. He tries to stand.
C: VOICE
D: Robin!... Robin!
E: O.S.
N: A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name. Reaches out his hand.
C: MARIAN
D: Death is not to be feared, Robin. Embrace it. Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover- ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
C: MARIAN
D: Drink this. Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup. Her hand grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
C: MARIAN
D: Drink.
N: The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus. Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
C: MARIAN
D: Look at me. Listen to me. You belong to me. Your soul is mine. You will obey my every word. Do you understand? Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his subconscious sounding alarms.
C: ROBIN
D: Why, Marian?
C: MARIAN
D: Because you love me. Say it. You love me. Say it!
E: as Robin struggles
C: ROBIN
D: I love you.
E: sinking
C: MARIAN
D: Kiss me. He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of Mortianna. He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision, we see he is surrounded by masked men.
C: ROBIN
D: Where is Marian?
E: slurred
C: MORTIANNA
D: She is with friends. Your resistence is strong, but useless. Sign this. You are a Druid like your father. You consort with the devil. Your confession will be witnessed by the Bishop of Hereford. A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be- tween his shoulders. In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
E: cackles as quill is forced into his hand
C: MORTIANNA
D: The painted man! Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A curved scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in the other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked guards are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats, scurry- ing into the depths of the cave.
E: horror
N: Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark- ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his feet... and lunges.
C: ASLAN
D: Behind you! Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks. Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's. Robin is slumped against a rock.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian? Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
E: groggy
C: BULL
D: Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian burial. Promise me, boy.
C: WULF
D: I promise. Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be- low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock. For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom, hatred, fear -- then is gone.
S: EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
N: Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering, glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks the light from his eyes.
C: ASLAN
D: They have poisoned you. There are herbs that can alter a man's brain. I know of only one cure. He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers down his throat.
C: ASLAN
D: It worked for me this very morning. You will thank me for this later.
E: as Robin heaves
S: EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY
N: Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up in front of him.
C: ROBIN
D: You have fulfilled your vow. Now you can leave.
C: ASLAN
D: Your gratitude warms my heart.
C: ROBIN
D: You ignored my request.
C: ASLAN
D: It is fortunate that I did.
C: ROBIN
D: Because of you, another good man is dead.
C: ASLAN
D: He urged me to bring him. He was a brave man and I grieve for him. Praise be to Allah that I do not grieve for you also. Or for my broken vow.
C: ROBIN
D: To hell with your damn vow.
C: ASLAN
D: I am glad you are feeling better. Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the sky.
C: ROBIN
D: The forest! Ride!
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
N: Fire. Blazing rampant. Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming arrows ignites the trees. Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback. One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.
S: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
N: Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing. Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John vainly attempts to instill calm.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke ain't gonna kill ya. Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees. Full retreat.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: It's burning for miles, John. It's hotter than hades, and them damn screens ain't worth nothing. Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able- bodied men to his side.
E: running up
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: 'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must make a stand. Most of them keep on running.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Damn y'all! Ya're no more use than a load o' wet farts.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Where's that damn Locksley? I'll swear he betrayed us.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Bollocks, Will. Quit yer bloody bellyachin'. Hal runs to join them, stuttering.
C: HAL
D: C... cccc...
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: C... ccc? What the bloody hell ya sayin'? Cows?... Cowards?...
C: HAL
D: Cccc... elts!
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Celts? Where?
C: HAL
D: Gggg... God help us.
E: pointing behind him
S: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
N: Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight. Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head- pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up to the Chieftain.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: I want prisoners. The Chieftain does not turn his head.
C: CHIEFTAIN
D: We came to fight.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Nevertheless, I need prisoners. With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits. Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol- diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword. Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors. They charge forward.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
N: The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the edge of the clearing.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: What are we gonna do, John?
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight 'em, that's what. Whadya say, lads? Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including Tack.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin' wi' the wenches.
C: FRIAR
D: This holy man believes in doing God's work with his hands.
N: He snatches a quarterstaff. John slaps him on the back. The men are encouraged.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Let's give 'em a bloody good wallopin' an' all, lads.
S: EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
N: Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em- battled woodsmen.
C: ROBIN
D: Wulf, stay here. I need your horse. He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.
C: ROBIN
D: What are you doing? Out of my way!
C: ASLAN
D: I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose.
C: ROBIN
D: Out of my way, damn you!
C: ASLAN
D: Does the witch still have possession of your senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help. And do some damage to the enemy.
N: Robin debates. Relents. They urge their horses into a gallop.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
N: The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest. From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat, turn and fire again. They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are being decimated. Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy, inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant. Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
C: FRIAR
D: Surely you would not harm a man of the cloth? The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
C: FRIAR
D: You would? Then to hellfire with you. He pummels the man to the ground with his staff. The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group, including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others fight on.
N: Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through them, slashing with his sword.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: 'Bout bleedin' time, mush. Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver- ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck glances heavenwards.
C: FRIAR
D: Thank you, Lord. And thank you, Allah.
E: an afterthought
N: Aslan is a wild man. Steering his horse with just legs and knees, he strikes out with both swords to left and right. The momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the edge of the clearing. Starts picking off stragglers. His father spots him.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger. Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet. The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit.
N: Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over. All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
C: ASLAN
D: It was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK
N: A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery. Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor and weapons into a growing pile.
C: ROBIN
D: You were an honor to your countrymen today, Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights.
C: ASLAN
D: This war is the God of Abraham against the forces of evil.
C: ROBIN
D: Well, the war is over. He stares across the desolate clearing.
C: ROBIN
D: There is too much blood on my hands.
S: INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT
N: A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol- lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime. Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Would you prefer pain or death?
E: wry smile
C: FIRST WOODSMAN
D: Death.
N: Dignity masking his terror. Nottingham appears to consider.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Torture him. The man is dragged away by guards. The next PRISONER --
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: And you? Pain or death?
C: SECOND WOODSMAN
D: ... Er... pain.
E: PRISONER pure terror
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Torture him... you see, it makes no difference.
E: MORE
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You will all be tortured. You will all tell me all you know about Robin Hood, and then you will all be hanged. Then we will catch your beloved Robin Hood and do the same to him.
E: CONT'D
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I will kill him for you.
C: WULF
D: Will, no! Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Why would I need you?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: All your attempts to kill him have failed. Your army failed. Your Celtic mercenaries failed. Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: And you can succeed?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I am one of his men. He would never suspect me.
C: WULF
D: He knows you always hated him, traitor.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: He is a trusting fool. He will believe me. If he doesn't, he will kill me and you have lost nothing. Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: If you fail, I will personally cut out your lying tongue. He withdraws the blade. Will tries to smile.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: And if I succeed?
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: His friends will.. ... torture him! He turns back to Will. A smile of mock apology.
E: to a guard
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: It will look better.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
N: A winter's night. Bitterly cold. Sad figures huddled around a small fire. Fanny tends to John's wounds, their little ones asleep by their feet. John drinks and passes the jug to Tuck, who numbly shakes his head. Too depressed even to drink. Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
C: ROBIN
D: My pride brought us to this.
C: ASLAN
D: No, friend. It was you who gave these men pride.
C: ROBIN
D: I gave them nothing but false hope. Tomorrow we will disperse. These people can move south and start over. You must go home and win your Jasmina.
C: ASLAN
D: And you?
C: ROBIN
D: I am no longer your responsibility.
C: ASLAN
D: That is for me to decide.
C: ROBIN
D: Damn you, Arab. I want you out of my life. Can't you understand that? Go home. Go back to your own kind. Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips it from his neck.
E: raging
C: ROBIN
D: Damn you, too, Father. You reared a coward and a fool. He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging branch. CUT TO:
C: NOVEMBER MOON
D: Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion, dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white moon against the black sky... DISSOLVE TO:
C: ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
D: -- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner. The round medallion has become a noose. In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another -- Bull. Another -- Marian.
C: MARIAN
D: Kiss me, Robin. The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.
N: Next, Robin's father. He stares accusingly right AT us.
C: LOCKSLEY
D: Why have you betrayed me? Why? Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope. His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous cacophony. DISSOLVE TO:
C: ROBIN'S FACE
D: DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror.
N: The first streaks of light fight their way through a thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure, at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence, Robin looks up.
C: ROBIN
D: Will! I thought you were taken.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I was.
C: ROBIN
D: How did you escape?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I promised to kill you.
C: ROBIN
D: And will you? Before Will can answer, Little John runs up. Grabs Will's throat.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a bloody favor an' all. Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with kids clinging to her skirts.
C: FANNY
D: Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im if Wulf be still alive. Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold just enough for Will to splutter out...
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Y... e...
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put the bleedin' weasel outa 'is misery.
C: ROBIN
D: John, wait. Let us hear what he has to say.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff, 'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin' pockets.
C: ROBIN
D: A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness. Will walked in and announced himself.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Aye. 'E always did 'ave balls o' brass.
E: dismissive
C: HAL
D: Let's sss... string 'im up.
C: ROBIN
D: Let him speak.
N: John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his shoulders.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a bloody blade on 'im somewheres. Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and fresh burns.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Bugger me. He steps back. Ready to listen.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I bring a message from Nottingham. Our men are to be hung in the square on Saturday. At high noon.
C: FANNY
D: What about my boy?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: The boy, too. Ten men in all. Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Their deaths are a warning. Anyone who associates with the outlaw Hood is to suffer the same fate. Man, woman, or child. Even anyone who so much as utters his name.
C: FRIAR
D: Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin Hood! May as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.
E: chuckles
C: WILL SCARLET
D: The hangings are to be part of the celebration for the Sheriff's marriage.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Marriage, eh? What lucky wench gits to play with the Sheriff's codpiece? Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Lady Marian.
C: FRIAR
D: He takes a bride of royal blood?
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Aye, and then with King Richard gone, he takes the bloody throne. Everyone reacts with shock. Only Robin appears unsur- prised.
C: ROBIN
D: You were to use this news to get close to me, and then kill me? Right, Will?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Not straightway, of course.
E: sly grin
C: ROBIN
D: What is your intention, Will?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: That depends on you, Locksley.
C: ROBIN
D: How so?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I've never trusted you, that's no secret. What I wanna know is, are you gonna finish what you started?
N: Robin is on the spot. All eyes on him. Will presses his point.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Will ya stay and keep us fightin' till every man jack of us is dead? Or will you run like the spoiled little rich boy I always took you for?
C: ROBIN
D: You present quite a choice. What would you have me do, Will?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: If you run, I will kill you.
C: ROBIN
D: And if I stay, will you all stay with me? Robin checks the other faces.
C: ASLAN
D: To the end, friend.
C: FRIAR
D: If my heathen brother stays, I stay.
C: HAL
D: Mmmm... meee... tttt... He can't get it out. Little John covers Hal's mouth.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: 'E's in. We're all bloody in. Daft buggers.
C: ROBIN
D: There's your answer, Will. We finish it.
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM TOWN SQUARE - DUSK
N: Ten gallows, silhouetted against the setting sun. The black-armored Celt tests a gallows, springing the hatch. A heavy sack dangles from the rope. Grim-faced peasants watch. Among them -- Fanny Little.
S: INT. DUNGEON - DUSK
N: The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He fingers his wooden crucifix.
C: WULF
D: If it be your biddin' that this be my last night o' life, Lord, gimme the pluck to die proud. An' look 'ee kindly on my folks an' the young 'uns. The light in the cell melts to total darkness.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: BRANCHES
D: Sunlight glistens on frost-laden branches. A COCK ROBIN CHIRPS.
S: EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAWN
N: In the troubled human realm, Tuck says his morning prayer.
C: FRIAR
D: Lord, grant us the courage to endure, and if you're as smart as I believe you are, grant us victory... and the victuals to celebrate it with.
N: Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.
C: FRIAR
D: Will you pray with me, son of Allah?
C: ASLAN
D: I have prayed for you, often, my brother. But, let us put prayer aside and help our gods in a more practical manner. I must reveal to you the mysteries of the black powder. Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can react, Robin walks up.
C: ROBIN
D: Will it work? Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire- ball rips ten feet in the air... Tuck falls on his ass in terror.
C: ROBIN
D: You are truly a wizard.
E: impressed
C: ASLAN
D: There is no such thing. But if there was... ... I would surely be one. Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's hand as he speaks.
E: chuckles
C: ROBIN
D: We have no armored knights, no glorious banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all England. A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand.
C: ROBIN
D: We may be only six men, but...
C: FANNY
D: Seven!
N: She strides towards them from the trees.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: What in blazes ya doin', woman? Where's the little 'uns?
C: FANNY
D: Them's safe, wi' my mother. Robin, I been to town an' seen the scaffold and the guard towers.
E: pushes past Little John
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?
C: FANNY
D: You go an' birth eight babies and then you can come an' tell me 'bout hurtin', ya big ox. I ain't gonna sit aroun' an' let one o' 'em die, neither.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya should be bloody well mindin' the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob. Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a stick.
C: ROBIN
D: Fanny, show me the exact location of the scaffold. Little John double-takes.
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM - DAY
N: The gallows. Swathed in a pink glow. A brilliant, wintry morning. Breath billows from the mouths of the sentries.
S: INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...
S: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
N: ... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked by two armed guards.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: How is my bride? Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his face.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Ah... You are overwhelmed with happiness. He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.
C: MARIAN
D: I will never marry you. Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet she used at the Druid ceremony.
E: calm, uncowed
C: MORTIANNA
D: Hold her! Marian struggles against her bonds.
C: MARIAN
D: Get away from me, you disgusting hag. I will not... augh!
N: The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham watches with amusement.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: When we are married, thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king. As you predicted. Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood. Clasps the dice-like runes.
E: to Mortianna
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: What do you see in the portents? Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
C: MORTIANNA
D: The union. The blood of the lion and the house of Nottingham. New faith. New power. New souls. She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented.
C: MORTIANNA
D: If there is no union, there will be darkness, despair, death. Ours!
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Di not give me riddles, woman. We are to be married within hours. How can we be in danger?
C: MORTIANNA
D: The blood does not lie.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Tell me how it will result.
E: shouting
C: MORTIANNA
D: I have told you what I know.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Confound you, crone. Without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it.
N: Mortianna runs at him. Points her bony finger at his heart.
C: MORTIANNA
D: Without me, you are nothing. You are straw, a fleabite, a speck. Laugh, fool. I birthed you from this body. I stole a babe in this very castle, and killed it so that you might rise in its place. You are my son. Together we are strong. Now is not the time to doubt. Now is the time to believe, to be bold. The bold will prevail.
E: as Nottingham laughs Nottingham is too shocked to react
S: EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
N: Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war- rior in a boar's head helmet. Soldiers prod and harness the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels. A GUARD stops him.
C: GUARD
D: What you got there, Father?
C: FRIAR
D: The Lord's finest brew for the good Nottingham's fighting men. It has a mighty kick.
C: GUARD
D: I'll warrant. Pass.
E: smiling
S: EXT. DUNGEON GATE - DAY
N: Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out. Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son, crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed. On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel amusement. A yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being shoved back by guards.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have word for you! Of Robin Hood! Nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides over, grabs Will by the collar, and drags him to his side.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I found his lair, but alas he still lives. The Sheriff strikes down with his armored hand. Will crumples.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Stretch his neck with the others. Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak. Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...
C: WILL SCARLET
D: ...He... He... is here!
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Locksley, here? Where ? Will struggles to get free of his holders.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Call off your dogs.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Release him!... Now, where is he?
C: WILL SCARLET
D: I want your word, in front of these witnesses. If I tell you, I will go free.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: We will find him.
E: scoffs
C: WILL SCARLET
D: He is concealed. He is going to free the prisoners and stop the wedding. Nottingham's jaw tightens. Eyes the prisoners, the scaffold.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Put Hood in my hands, you go free.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: With the reward. Ten thousand crowns.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Damn your worthless hide! Just tell me where he is.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: The reward! The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to intervene, gets hurled down.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You'll get your reward. Where is he? CUT TO:
E: to Will
S: EXT. SCAFFOLD
N: Tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.
C: FRIAR
D: Out of the way. Make way for the Lord's business.
N: Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's direction.
S: EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
N: A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John. He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall itself. He slips frequently.
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf staggers, from his beating. Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart. He watches them nervously.
S: EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
N: Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls... desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Step down, friar.
C: FRIAR
D: As you wish, sire. Is there something amiss?
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: This man claims you have outlaws concealed in these barrels. Among them the cursed Robin Hood. Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
C: FRIAR
D: This man will rot in hell as a knave and a liar. These are libations for the celebration of your lordship's nuptials.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Break one open!
C: FRIAR
D: Why waste fine vintage, my lord? A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
E: nervous
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Try another. There are many barrels, only a few outlaws. A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the steps -- Wulf. Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes a flame.
S: EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
N: John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks the man's view.
C: SENTRY
D: What is your business, woman?
C: FANNY
D: Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear. Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly view up 'ere, ain't it? She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times. He slumps unconscious.
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree- branch crutch.
C: WOUNDED SOLDIER
D: Give room for a fightin' man and his ma. Step aside, or I'll make ya. I wanna see the bastards walk on air.
S: EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
N: John struggles over the battlement. Collapses.
C: FANNY
D: 'Bout time, ya gurt lug. She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an arrow.
C: FANNY
D: We be too late.
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose. SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow. The executioner's eyes glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns. Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge. His eyes close. An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. Wulf's body plunges. The rope snaps tight. Little John yells. Fanny screams. A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling. His hands wrench at the choking cord. The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked... by the Celt with the boar's head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass confusion. Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's rope. He hauls him onto the platform. Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig... It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm.
C: HAL
D: Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
C: WOODSMAN
D: Hal! What happened to your stutter?
C: HAL
D: It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap! A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
C: HAL
D: Take that, ya mug. No stutter this time! The woodsmen join battle with the guards. The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head. The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
C: CHIEFTAIN
D: Impostor! You dishonor the clan. Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering blows.
C: FROM PARAPET
D: John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Fight fair...
N: He aims. Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a shaft.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: ...Or don't fight at all.
C: ON SCENE
D: Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the trap hole. Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and around the horse's legs. Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat. Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood. Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
C: EXPLODES.
D: The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the parapet.
C: GREYBEARD BARON
D: Up there! No mercy, shoot them! Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire. Bolts ricochet all around Little John and Fanny.
N: ON SCAFFOLD Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.
C: ON SCENE
D: Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black armor. The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war. Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in. He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his horse. Will leaps on him.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: Pain or death, you butcher? The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him. Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by four men.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Here's another message to Robin Hood, written in your blood. He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's belly.
C: WILL SCARLET
D: It's over, fool. You can kill my body, but you cannot kill our spirit. He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle. Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose, using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers. As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men.
C: REDHEAD BARON
D: It's Hood! Get him! The Chieftain knocks Aslan down. Aslan loses his sword.
C: CHIEFTAIN
D: I am iron. I am rock. I am your death. Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
C: ASLAN
D: You talk too much! He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples, his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck. Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
C: ASLAN
D: Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray.
N: Nottingham runs through the castle gate. Angry peasants pursue.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Lower the portcullis! Now! A guard winds down the giant gate. Nottingham hurls him aside.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Too slow, fool! He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.
N: Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees with dismay that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he staves off the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly peasants are swarming over his attacker. The baron is dragged off and trampled down.
C: ROBIN
D: Friends! We must raise the gate.
S: EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY
N: Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both sides.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers. Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies. He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs his sword.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind if I borrow this? He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to one.
S: EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
N: Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis.
S: INT. CASTLE - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
N: The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Seal the entrance. Guard it with your lives. ... Bring the bishop to my chapel.
S: INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
N: Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway, lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Come! It is time for the union. The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet. She is oblivious.
S: INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
N: Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed to the practice of black magic. The crucifix on the altar is upside down. Marian stands before it, between the Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged in. Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.
C: BISHOP
D: They are rebelling. We must escape.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Marry us. When I am declared king, that rabble will not dare go against us.
C: BISHOP
D: Is is madness to delay. Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows.
C: MORTIANNA
D: Face them, or face me.
S: EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
N: Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart.
C: ROBIN
D: Light all the barrels, Tuck.
N: Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels. FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.
C: ROBIN
D: Jump! Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is blown to kingdom come. Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger. Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.
S: INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY
N: Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier. He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire. Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at Fanny with a knife.
S: EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
N: Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated men. Aslan's a whirlwind, striking out in all directions. Each blow for a cause.
C: ASLAN
D: For Allah!... For Jehovah! For brotherhood!... For justice!
S: INT. CASTLE HALLWAYS - DAY
N: A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him as a shield, using the man's own sword against his companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is off and running. Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down on his pursuers.
C: ROBIN
D: Where is she? Where is Lady Marian?
E: grabbing a servant
N: The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor, sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door- way.
C: ROBIN
D: Ah! There is my answer. He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.
S: INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
N: Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage- ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer. A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
C: FRIAR
D: My son, there is a holy war being waged outside. Release all these wretches and God shall surely find you a place in heaven.
E: pious
C: JAILER
D: I'd rather go to hell! WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest. Flies back.
S: INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
N: Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
C: BISHOP
D: ...your bodies to be bound in immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian Dubois, take... The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward. Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another pew, taking down a third.
C: ROBIN
D: Marian, run! It's me, Robin. Run! Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side. Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin prepares to fight him.
C: ROBIN
D: I warned you, I would find you no matter what.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: No companions? No army? You rush to your death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool... Recognize this, Locksley? He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: Appropriate I should use it to kill you with, don't you think? He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying desperately.
S: INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
N: Tuck picks himself up from the floor. The jailer is amazed.
C: FRIAR
D: The Lord helps those who help themselves. Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor ... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified, the man catches the smoking bomb.
C: FRIAR
D: Give my regards to the devil. The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.
S: EXT. PARAPET - DAY
N: John is in deep trouble, but undaunted.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Ya gutless bloody sissies. Someone attacks his assailants from the rear. The tide turns.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Wulf! I told ya to keep outa the fightin'.
C: WULF
D: Sorry, Father. Couldn't help myself.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: Well, ya'll get a bloody good wallopin' if we get 'ome... For now, let's see how well I taught ya. Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.
S: EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
N: A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades. He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their weapons.
C: HAL
D: No! Fight on. Fight! He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
C: FRIAR
D: Sinners, beware! God's avengers are at hand. Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
C: HAL
D: Go' bless ya, Tuck.
N: Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.
C: FRIAR
D: Repent, heathen! The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning... Aslan!
S: INT. CASTLE - KITCHENS - DAY
N: The chef raises his knife. Fanny appeals to the whole room.
C: FANNY
D: Listen! Outside, your countrymen rise against the Sheriff.
E: MORE
C: FANNY
D: Is there one man or woman here who does not hate him? Who has not suffered at his hand? Turn that on the Sheriff and his bullies. A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying food and cutlery.
E: CONT'D to the chef
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms, knives, hooks, and bedpans.
S: INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
N: Nottingham slashes maniacally. Robin is cornered, weakening.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: You should have stayed away, Locksley. Fools like you never learn. A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan, followed by Tuck.
C: ASLAN
D: Ali akbar!
C: FRIAR
D: Amen!
C: MORTIANNA
D: Agh... the painted one! Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!... Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the floor. Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
E: seeing Aslan
N: The Bishop makes his escape. Tuck blocks his path.
C: FRIAR
D: So! You sold your soul to the devil?
C: BISHOP
D: No, I swear it, in God's name.
C: FRIAR
D: Blasphemer! You accuse innocent men of Druid worship while you practice the black arts yourself. The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.
N: A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on Aslan.
C: ROBIN
D: Watch out! Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to the floor. Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword. Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows. Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet. Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with all his strength. The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.
E: glimpsing her
C: BISHOP
D: I am sure you would not strike a man of the cloth.
E: innocently
C: FRIAR
D: Think again! Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.
S: EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
N: Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.
C: ASLAN
D: What you fear is not below. He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest. Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it further through her body in her effort to get at him. Clutching, screeching, hissing. Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle- ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to the ground.
S: INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
N: Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the altar.
C: NOTTINGHAM
D: What can your puny God do for you now? The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked. Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand. He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the temple. The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries to squirm away.
C: ROBIN
D: This is for my father.
N: He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still. Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside. Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on the edge of the steep parapet.
S: EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
N: Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes out. A spitfire.
C: MARIAN
D: Let me go! Who are you?
C: ROBIN
D: I'm your sworn protector. Any way I see fit.
E: restraining her
S: EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
N: Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder, Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into the freezing water. She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back. Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers, enjoying the show.
C: MARIAN
D: Robin? Oh God, is that you? She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him, pounding her fists on his chest.
C: MARIAN
D: How dare you?! Robin grins at the crowd.
C: ROBIN
D: I think she's feeling better. Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against Robin's chest. Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and Fanny.
C: LITTLE JOHN
D: We done it, mate. We clobbered the buggers.
C: FANNY
D: Are you 'urt?
C: ROBIN
D: It will mend. He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's head.
C: ROBIN
D: Aslan, my friend.
C: ASLAN
D: I'm going home the easy way, Robin.
C: FRIAR
D: You die on me, you son of satan, and I swear I'll bury you as a Christian in St. Catherine's Cathedral with a thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul. You hear me?
E: shaking Aslan
C: ASLAN
D: I have no strength, Brother Tuck.
E: weakly
C: FRIAR
D: A fine friend you are! By the grace of Allah and Jehovah we have won the day, and you want to give up the ghost. I'll pickle your remains in mead, lay you in your grave with a pig for a companion, and mark it with a cross as big as this castle.
E: kicking him
C: ASLAN
D: Please! It hurts when I laugh.
C: FRIAR
D: See. There's life in the heathen dog yet.
C: ROBIN
D: Here, Tuck. Look after him. You deserve each other. Robin stands, Marian joins him. Around them cheering grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
E: laughs
C: CROWD
D: Robin Hood! Robin Hood! DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY
N: A VOICE ECHOES from the vaulted roof. A wedding is in progress.
C: FRIAR
D: By the power vested in me by God's holy church, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
E: O.S.
C: FRIAR
D: You may kiss the bride. The husband draws back the bride's veil. Robin and Marian. They kiss... long.
C: FRIAR
D: Hurry. We waste good celebration time. They break the embrace, turn to the congregation and start down the aisle. They pause at the front pew, where KING RICHARD and members of his court are sitting. Robin bows, Marian curtsies.
E: whispers
C: KING RICHARD
D: May I kiss the bride?
C: ROBIN
D: Who would dare refuse his king's request?
C: KING RICHARD
D: You look radiant, cousin.
E: kissing Marian's cheek
C: ROBIN
D: We are deeply honored by Your Majesty's presence.
C: KING RICHARD
D: It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley. Thanks to you I still have a throne. They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre- gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin embrace.
C: ASLAN
D: My friend, a word of advice... Ride her better than your horse. Robin laughs.
E: whispers
S: EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
N: WEDDING BELLS PEAL. Robin and Marian step out into the sunlight. The crowd cheers. At a signal from Little John, the ex-outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the sky... FIREWORKS...
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
