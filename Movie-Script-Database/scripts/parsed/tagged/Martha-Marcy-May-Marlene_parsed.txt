S: EXT. FARM - DAY
N: It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden. TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line. TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car. FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The others knit a large blanket. TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole. A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading. A MAN chops wood. A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.
S: INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
N: A large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor. TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food. MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
S: INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING
N: The men sit around a table eating dinner. One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK. Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard.
S: INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside. The women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food.
S: INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: The women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
N: The kitchen is filled with dishes. TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib. People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame.
S: EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up the driveway. She carries a small bag. Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window watching. Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins to run. SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS. Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently yells out: "MARCY MAY" The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind. For a moment everything is quiet. Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into the woods, chasing after Martha.
S: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
N: The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man and two women are chasing her. Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls. Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and begin their descent. Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her pass by.
S: EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits. She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.

N: Martha thinks for a moment.
C: LUCY
D: Martha!
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days. The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They are seated. Martha returns to eating.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Marcy May?
E: O.S.
N: It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.
C: WATTS
D: What are you doin'?
N: Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits across from her. Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
C: WATTS
D: We were worried about you.
E: CONT'D
C: MARTHA
D: I'm fine.
C: WATTS
D: Patrick's worried about you.
C: MARTHA
D: I just wanted to come into town.
C: WATTS
D: I could've brought you.
C: MARTHA

D: Through the woods?

D: Can I get you something?
E: TO WATTS
C: WATTS
D: No.
C: WAITRESS
D: You done?
E: TO MARTHA
C: MARTHA
D: Yeah.
N: The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his hand out to stop her.
C: WATTS
D: You not gonna eat that?
E: TO MARTHA
N: Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate. Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.
C: WATTS
D: You ready to go?
E: CONT'D
N: Martha doesn't respond.
C: WATTS
D: Come on!
E: CONT'D
C: MARTHA
D: Not right now.
C: WATTS
D: No?
N: The waitress drops the check on the table. Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
C: WATTS
D: I'll get this.
E: CONT'D
N: He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces eye contact with her. Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips. Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
T: cuts through the kitchen.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
N: Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and vomits behind the bench.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
N: Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.
S: INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY
N: Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against the window watching the road behind her in the side view mirror.

N: Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a scotch.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst. The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces herself to slowly turn and look. She puts her head down and quickly returns to her room.
S: INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.

C: LUCY
D: From what?

C: LUCY
D: You mean where I picked you up?
N: Martha nods.
C: LUCY
D: About 3 hours. Why?
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: MARTHA
D: Just wondered.
N: Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the lake.

Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out.

C: MARTHA
D: What?
C: LUCY
D: Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked.
C: MARTHA
D: Why?
C: LUCY
D: You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
C: MARTHA
D: So?
C: LUCY
D: So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow.

E: CONT'D
C: MARTHA
D: When do you think that'll happen?

C: PATRICK
D: If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down.

S: INT. FARM HOUSE/SMALL DARK ROOM - NIGHT

D: I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us. Do you believe me?

N: Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play. The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song. The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by him.
C: PATRICK

C: ZOE
D: Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.
C: MARTHA

C: SARAH
D: I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried everything pretty much, except heroin.
C: ZOE

And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.

E: CONT'D
C: MARTHA
D: Yep.
S: EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY
N: Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her underwear and dives in. Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up. Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for air. She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is swimming. Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock, he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact. He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water, puts on his shirt and just sits there. Martha swims back to the house.
S: INT. TED'S CAR - DAY
N: Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the breaks.
C: TED
D: Jesus Christ.
C: LUCY
D: Are you okay?
C: TED
D: Yeah.
C: LUCY
D: Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
N: The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car drives behind Ted's car. Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back again to see that he is still there. She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in silence.
