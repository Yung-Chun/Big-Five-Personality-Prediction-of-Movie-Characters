N: Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue. He wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.
C: ALVY
D: There's an old joke. Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the food at this place is really terrible." The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and such ... small portions." Well, that's essentially how I feel about life. Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly. The-the other important joke for me is one that's, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious. And it goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... "I would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member." That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women. Tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, tsch, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis or something, I don't know. I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging. I'm not one o' those characters, you know. Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me. I, uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get older, you know? I think I'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know? 'Less I'm neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism. Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't get my mind around that. You know, I-I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were... tsch, in love. You know, and-and-and ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a morose type. I'm not a depressive character. I-I-I, uh, you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess. I was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II.
E: Sighing Laughing

S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY
N: Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his mother in an old-fashioned, cluttered doctor's office. The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a cigarette and listening.
C: MOTHER
D: He's been depressed. All off a sudden, he can't do anything.
E: To the doctor
C: DOCTOR
D: Why are you depressed, Alvy?
E: Nodding
C: MOTHER
D: Tell Dr. Flicker. It's something he read.
E: Nudging Alvy Young Alvy sits, his head down. His mother answers for him
C: DOCTOR
D: Something he read, huh?
E: Puffing on his cigarette and nodding
C: ALVY
D: The universe is expanding.
E: His head still down
C: DOCTOR
D: The universe is expanding?
C: ALVY
D: Well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!
E: Looking up at the doctor
N: Disgusted, his mother looks at him.
C: MOTHER
D: What is that your business? He stopped doing his homework.
E: shouting she turns back to the doctor
C: ALVY
D: What's the point?
C: MOTHER
D: What has the universe got to do with it? You're here in Brooklyn! Brooklyn is not expanding!
E: Excited, gesturing with her hands
C: DOCTOR
D: It won't be expanding for billions of years yet, Alvy. And we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here. Uh?
E: Heartily, looking down at Alvy
N: He laughs.
T: CUT TO:
N: Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it. A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window of the house a band shakes a dust mop.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the roller-
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOUSE
N: Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while his father sits on the sofa reading the paper. The house shakes with every move of the roller coaster.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think.
T: CUT TO:
N: Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman in a skirted bathing suit. They all turn and run toward the foreground. The girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss. The sign over the concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar. Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller coaster is moving in full gear in the background.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: You know, I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some trouble between fantasy and reality.
T: CUT TO:
N: Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: My father ran the bumper-car concession. There-there he is and there I am. But I-I-I-I used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time.
E: Alvy as a child moves into the frame driving a bumper car. He stops as other cars bombard him. His father continues to direct the traffic
N: Alvy backs up his car off screen.
S: INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY
N: The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the blackboard. The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard. - "2 X 10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: I remember the staff at our public school. You know, we had a saying, uh, that "Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym." And ...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school. I must say-
T: CUT TO:
N: A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom. The blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration. The camera pans her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks. Alvy as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity; there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: I always felt my schoolmates were idiots. Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time. And-and Ivan Ackerman, always the wrong answer. Always.
N: Ivan stands up behind his desk.
C: IVAN
D: Seven and three is nine.
N: Alvy hits his forehead with his hand. Another student glances over at him, reacting.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Even then I knew they were just jerks. In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-
E: The camera moves back to the teacher, who is glaring out at her students
N: As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl. She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to his seat.
C: 1ST GIRL
D: Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.
E: Making noises
C: TEACHER
D: That's the second time this month! Step up here!
E: Off screen
N: As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves over to her. Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their heads to watch what will happen next.
C: ALVY
D: What'd I do?
C: TEACHER
D: Step up here!
C: ALVY
D: What'd I do?
C: TEACHER
D: You should be ashamed of yourself.
N: The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, sitting in the last seat of the second row.
C: ALVY
D: Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
E: AS ADULT First off screen, then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom
C: TEACHER
D: Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
E: The younger, Alvy standing next to her
C: ALVY
D: I did.
E: AS ADULT Still sitting in the back of the classroom
N: The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and speaks.
C: 1ST GIRL
D: For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks of a latency period.
C: ALVY
D: Well, I never had a latency period. I can't help it.
E: AS ADULT Gesturing
C: TEACHER
D: Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? Now, there was a model boy!
E: With young, Alvy still at her side The camera pans over to Donald, sitting up tall in his seat, then back to the teacher
C: ALVY
D: Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
E: AS CHILD Still standing next to the teacher
C: DONALD
D: I run a profitable dress company.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Right. Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today.
N: The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, the teacher standing in the front of the room. One at a time, the young students rise u from their desks and speak.
C: 1ST BOY
D: I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.
C: 2ND BOY

C: 2ND GIRL
D: I'm into leather.
S: INT. ROOM
N: Close-up of a TV screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show. He sits next to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right. Static is heard throughout the dialogue.
C: ALVY
D: I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian. They did not take me in the Army. I was, uh ... Interestingly enough, I was-I was four-P.
N: Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.
C: DICK CAVETT
D: Four-P?
C: ALVY
D: Yes. In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a hostage.
N: More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.
S: INT. THE HOUSE WHERE ALVY GREW UP
N: Alvy's mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and talking as she looks off screen.
C: MOTHER
D: You always only saw the worst in people. You never could get along with anyone at school. You were always outta step with the world. Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world.'
S: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET-DAY
N: A pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried. The screen shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk beyond. As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation. They eventually move past the camera and off screen. Traffic noise is heard in the background.
C: ALVY
D: I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
C: ROB
D: You're crazy!
C: ALVY
D: No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
C: ROB
D: Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
C: ALVY
D: Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
C: ROB
D: Ah, Max, you, uh ...
C: ALVY
D: Stop calling me Max.
C: ROB
D: Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
C: ALVY
D: No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this -so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
C: ROB
D: Right, Max. California, Max.
C: ALVY
D: Ah.
C: ROB
D: Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
C: ALVY
D: Forget it, Max.
C: ROB
D: -we move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
C: ALVY
D: No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
C: ROB
D: Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
E: Checking his watch
C: ALVY
D: I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
S: EXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY
N: Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him just inside the glass doors. The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy. He looks at him, then moves away. He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy again. Alvy looks away, then back at the man. The man continues to stare. Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy.
C: 1ST MAN
D: Hey, you on television?
C: ALVY
D: No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
E: Nodding his head
C: 1ST MAN
D: What's your name?
C: ALVY
D: You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
E: Clearing his throat
C: 1ST MAN
D: You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
C: ALVY
D: Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
C: 1ST MAN
D: What's your name?
N: Alvy is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people move through the doors of the theater.
C: ALVY
D: I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
E: Nervously
C: 1ST MAN
D: Come on.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks very much ... for everything.
N: They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm. The man in turn looks over his shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and calls out. Alvy looks impatient.
C: 1ST MAN
D: Hey!
C: 2ND MAN
D: What?
E: Off screen
C: 1ST MAN
D: This is Alvy Singer!
C: ALVY

C: ALVY
D: Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
E: Overlapping 1st man
C: 1ST MAN
D: This guy's on television.
E: Still ignoring Alvy's protestations
C: ALVY
D: I need a large polo mallet!
C: 2ND MAN
D: Who's on television?
E: Moving into the screen
C: 1ST MAN
D: This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

C: ALVY
D: You don't want my autograph.
C: 1ST MAN
D: Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
E: Overlapping, Alvy's speech
C: ALVY

C: 1ST MAN
D: It's for my brudder. Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
E: To passersby
C: 2ND MAN
D: You really Alvy Singer, the ... the TV star?
E: To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech
N: Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the sidewalk. The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise.
C: 1ST MAN
D: -Singer!
C: 2ND MAN
D: Alvy Singer over here!
N: A cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb. Alvy moves over to it about to get in.
C: ALVY
D: I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
E: Overlapping the two men and stuttering As Alvy opens the cab door, the two men still behind him, Annie gets out
C: ANNIE
D: Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
E: Overlapping Alvy
N: Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of the theater as they continue to talk.
C: ALVY
D: Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
C: ANNIE
D: You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
C: ALVY
D: Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
C: ANNIE
D: Okay. (They move into the ticket line, still talking. A billboard next to them reads "INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE
C: TO FACE ,'LIV ULLMANN")
D: Please, I have a headache, all right?
C: ALVY
D: Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
N: They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets and walking off screen.
C: ALVY
D: A li-little louder. I think one of them may have missed it! H'm, has the picture started yet?
E: Gesturing To the ticket clerk
C: TICKET CLERK
D: It started two minutes ago.
C: ALVY
D: That's it! Forget it! I-I can't go in.
E: Hitting his hand on the counter
C: ANNIE
D: Two minutes, Alvy.
C: ALVY
D: No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We-we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
E: Overlapping Annie
C: ANNIE
D: In the middle? We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
E: Alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh
C: ALVY
D: You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
C: ANNIE
D: Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
N: She moves past the ticket clerk.
C: ALVY
D: Go ahead. Good-bye.
E: Waving to Annie
N: Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.
C: ANNIE
D: Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
C: ALVY
D: Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
E: Watching people with tickets move past them
C: ANNIE
D: Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
C: ALVY
D: I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie? So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
E: Annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks at her
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
C: ALVY
D: Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.
C: ANNIE
D: H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
E: Laughing now
S: INT. THEATER LOBBY.
N: A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and Annie among them. A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing scene.
C: MAN IN LINE
D: We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday. It is not one of his best. It lacks a cohesive structure. You know, you get the feeling that he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say. 'Course, I've always felt he was essentially a-a technical film maker. Granted, La Strada was a great film. Great in its use of negative energy more than anything else. But that simple cohesive core ...
E: Loudly to his companion right behind Alvy and Annie
N: Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie begins to read her newspaper.
C: ALVY
D: I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
E: Overlapping the man's speech
C: ANNIE
D: Well, stop listening to him.
E: Reading
C: MAN IN LINE
D: You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
E: Overlapping Alvy and Annie
C: ALVY
D: He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
E: Sighing
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly ... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
C: ALVY
D: Key word here is "indulgent."
E: Overlapping
C: MAN IN LINE
D: -without getting ... well, let's put it this way ...
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: What are you depressed about?
E: To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking
C: ANNIE
D: I missed my therapy. I overslept.
C: ALVY
D: How can you possibly oversleep?
C: ANNIE
D: The alarm clock.
C: ALVY
D: You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
E: Gasping
C: ANNIE
D: I know-because of our sexual problem, right?
C: ALVY
D: Hey, you ... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
C: MAN IN LINE
D: - It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't ... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
C: ALVY
D: I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
E: To Annie
N: The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk.
C: ANNIE
D: Stop it, Alvy!
C: ALVY
D: Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
E: Wringing his hands
C: MAN IN LINE
D: And then, the most important thing of all is a comedian's vision.
C: ANNIE
D: And you know something else? You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you!
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Gal gun-shy is what it is.
E: Lighting a cigarette while he talks
C: ALVY
D: Probably on their first date, right?
E: Reacting again to the man in line
C: MAN IN LINE
D: It's a narrow view.
E: Still going on
C: ALVY
D: Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy." Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
E: He sighs; then to Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Oh!
C: ALVY
D: I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
C: ANNIE
D: Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
N: The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.
C: ALVY
D: I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual ...
C: MAN IN LINE
D: It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand? A hot medium ... as opposed to a ...
E: Even louder now
C: ALVY
D: What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
E: More and more aggravated
C: MAN IN LINE
D: ... as opposed to a print ...
N: Alvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the camera.
C: ALVY
D: What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you? I mean, it's just maddening!
E: Sighing and addressing the audience
N: The man in line moves toward Alvy. Both address the audience now.
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
C: ALVY
D: I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And-and the funny part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of validity.
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: Oh, do yuh?
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Yes.
C: ALVY
D: Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So ... so, here, just let me-I mean, all right. Come over here ... a second.
N: Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back of the crowded lobby. He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.
C: MAN IN LINE
D: Oh.
C: ALVY
D: Tell him.
E: To McLuban
C: MCLUHAN
D: I hear-I heard what you were saying. You-you know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing.
E: To the man in line
C: ALVY
D: Boy, if life were only like this!
E: To the camera

E: Off screen
C: ANNIE
D: M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
C: ALVY
D: You? You kiddin'? If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
E: Off screen He moves into the frame, lying across the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a face
C: ANNIE
D: That movie makes me feel guilty.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
N: He starts kissing Annie's arm. She gets annoyed and continues to read.
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, I ...
C: ALVY
D: What-what-what-what's the matter?
C: ANNIE
D: I-you know, I don't wanna.
C: ALVY
D: What-what-I don't ... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
E: Overlapping Annie, reacting
C: ANNIE
D: I know, well, it's just that-you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
C: ALVY
D: It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What ... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly ... We're- we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
E: Overlapping Annie again
C: ANNIE
D: I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
E: Patting Alvy's band solicitously
C: ALVY
D: M'm.

N: Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various people. Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her. The sounds of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience. Allison stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.
C: ALLISON
D: Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... about twenty minutes, something like that.
E: Looking down at the clipboard
C: WOMAN
D: Oh, thank you.
N: Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison. He taps her on the shoulder; she turns to face him.
C: ALVY
D: Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?
E: Coughing
C: ALLISON
D: Who are you?
E: Looking down at the clipboard
C: ALVY
D: Alvy ... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
C: ALLISON
D: Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh ... you're on next.
C: ALVY
D: What do you mean, next?
E: Rubbing his hands together nervously
C: ALLISON
D: Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
E: Gesturing
C: ALLISON
D: Yes.
C: ALVY
D: So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
C: ALLISON
D: Why not?
C: ALVY
D: No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't ... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
C: ALLISON
D: It's okay.
C: ALVY
D: No, because they're-they're laughing, so I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
E: He starts laughing nervously
C: ALLISON
D: Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: I prefer not to, because ... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
E: Overlapping
N: They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.
C: ALLISON
D: Yes.
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh? They-they they're laughed out.
E: Overlapping Off screen
C: ALLISON
D: Do you feel all right?
E: Off screen
N: As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai Stevenson. The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in clusters around the room. The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage. Alvy is swinging his hands nervously.
C: COMEDIAN
D: You know ...
E: Off screen, onstage
N: Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about.
C: ALVY
D: Look, what's your-what's your name?
E: Above the chatter around him
C: COMEDIAN
D: ... General Eisenhower is not ...
E: Off screen
C: ALLISON
D: Allison.
E: Looking out at the stage
C: ALVY
D: Yeah? Allison what?
C: ALLISON
D: Portchnik.
E: Still looking off screen
C: COMEDIAN
D: ... a group from the ...
C: ALVY
D: Thank you. I-I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political comedian at all.
E: Coughing He clears his throat
N: The audience starts to laugh.
C: ALVY
D: I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the Eisenhower Administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years.
N: The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.
S: INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.
N: Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing. There are books all over the room; a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.
C: ALVY
D: H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!
C: ALLISON
D: Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
N: Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands.
C: ALVY
D: It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
C: ALLISON
D: Alvy.
N: Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs. He then snaps his fingers and starts walking again.
C: ALVY
D: I'll tell you this! He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range. But ... if there was a second assassin ... it- That's it!
E: Clears his throat
N: Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.
C: ALLISON
D: We've been through this.
C: ALVY
D: If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
C: ALLISON
D: Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
E: Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette
C: ALVY
D: Well, why not?
C: ALLISON
D: Yeah, Earl Warren?
C: ALVY
D: Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
E: Moving toward the bed
C: ALLISON
D: Lyndon Johnson?
C: ALVY
D: L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
E: Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing
C: ALLISON
D: Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
C: ALVY
D: Tsch.
E: Nodding his head
C: ALLISON
D: The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
N: Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again.
C: ALVY
D: I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room attendant.
C: ALLISON
D: You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, my God! She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real ... intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
E: Then, to the camera Sighing
S: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
N: Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor. Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of groceries sit on the counter. There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator.
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
C: ALVY
D: Look, I told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
C: ANNIE
D: Stop it! Don't ... don't do that! There.
N: The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor. Annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it.
C: ALVY
D: Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
C: ANNIE
D: Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
C: ALVY
D: If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
N: She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail. Laughing, she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.
C: ALVY
D: Don't give it to me. Don't!
C: ANNIE
D: Oooh! Here! Here!
E: Hysterically
C: ALVY
D: Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
E: Pointing They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him
C: ANNIE
D: Get him!
E: Laughing, to the lobster
C: ALVY
D: Talk to him. You speak shellfish! Hey, look ... put it in the pot.
E: Laughing He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water
C: ANNIE
D: I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
E: Overlapping
N: Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.
E: Overlapping Alvy and making sounds She screams
C: ALVY
D: Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
E: Overlapping Annie
C: ANNIE
D: All right. All right. All right.
N: She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster. Smiling, she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall.
C: ALVY
D: Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna get my camera.
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: You know, I-I think ... if I could pry this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
N: Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier. Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink. Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.
C: ANNIE
D: Great! Great! Goddammit! Ooooh! These are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
E: Screaming Screaming
C: ALVY
D: All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
C: ANNIE
D: It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!
C: ALVY
D: All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
E: Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier
N: Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face.
C: ANNIE
D: Don't be a jerk. One more, Alvy, please, one more picture. Oh, oh, good, good!
E: Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture
S: EXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK.
N: The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore.
C: ALVY
D: So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what ... Am I your first big romance?
E: He clears his throat
C: ANNIE
D: Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
C: ALVY
D: Well, then, w-who was?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT Behind him is a movie theater with "MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' " on the marquee. He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the frame. They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
E: Off screen
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
E: Off screen, laughing
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: Then there was Jerry, the actor.
T: CUT TO:
N: FLASHBACK OF BRICK-WALLED APARTMENT - NIGHT The younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall. Jerry is running his band down Annie's bare arm. Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger Annie, in jeans and T-shirt, with Jerry.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.
E: Laughing
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: I look pretty.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ...
C: JERRY
D: Acting is like an exploration of the soul. I-it's very religious. Uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness. It's like a visual poem.
C: ALVY
D: Is he kidding with that crap?
E: Laughing
C: YOUNGER ANNIE
D: Oh, right. Right, yeah, I think I know exactly what you mean, when you say "religious."
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: You do?
E: Incredulous, to Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
E: Still watching
C: ALVY
D: Hey, that was last year.
C: JERRY
D: It's like when I think of dying. You know how I would like to die?
C: YOUNGER ANNIE
D: No, how?
C: JERRY
D: I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
C: ANNIE'S VOICE
D: Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
N: Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as she raises her foot toward his chest.
C: JERRY
D: Touch my heart ... with your foot.
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: I-I may throw up!
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: EXTERIOR. BEACH-DUSK It's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light. The camera moves over the scene. The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the camera always one step ahead of them.
C: ANNIE
D: He was creepy.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
C: ALVY
D: Well, no ... not just, not only.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I'd say so. You married-
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT
N: A cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and Robin make their way through the people. A waiter, carrying a tray, walks past them. Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks it of the tray first. There is much low-key chatter in the background.
C: ANNIE
D: -two of them.
E: Off screen
C: ROBIN
D: There's Henry Drucker. He has a chair in history at Princeton. Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
C: ROBIN
D: Why are you so hostile?
C: ALVY
D: 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
E: Sighing
C: ROBIN
D: Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."
E: Squinting
N: They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.
C: ALVY
D: I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
E: Taking Robin's hand
C: ROBIN
D: Commentary.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
C: ROBIN
D: No jokes-these are friends, okay?
S: INT. BEDROOM
N: Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.
C: TV ANNOUNCER
D: Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New York Knicks.
E: Off screen
N: Robin enters the room, slamming the door.
C: ROBIN
D: Here you are. There's people out there.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now ... they're ahead two points.
E: Clears his throat
C: ROBIN
D: Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
C: ALVY
D: What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand ... the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
E: Looking at Robin Clears his throat
N: Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed. He kisses her and moves farther up on the bed.
C: ROBIN
D: Stop acting out.
N: She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.
C: ALVY
D: No, it'll be great! It'll be great, be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in there, you know, like ... discussing models of alienation and we'll be in here quietly humping.
N: He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.
C: ROBIN
D: Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
C: ALVY
D: "'Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?' he said as he removed her brassiere..."
E: Clears his throat
C: ROBIN
D: There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
E: Pulling away again
N: She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress. She turns and moves toward the door.
S: INT. APARTMENT-NIGHT
N: Robin and Alvy are in bed. The room is in darkness. Outside, a siren starts blaring.
C: ROBIN
D: Oh, I'm sorry!
C: ALVY
D: Don't get upset!
C: ROBIN
D: Dammit! I was so close.
N: She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side. Alvy turns to her.
C: ALVY
D: Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
E: Gesturing
C: ROBIN
D: I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
E: Reaching over for her eyeglasses on the night table
C: ALVY
D: Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's ... You got crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
C: ROBIN
D: Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
E: Interrupting
N: She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can-we can start again.
C: ROBIN
D: I can't.
C: ALVY
D: What-
C: ROBIN
D: My head is throbbing.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, you got a headache!
C: ROBIN
D: I have a headache.
C: ALVY
D: Bad?
C: ROBIN
D: Oswald and ghosts.
C: ALVY
D: Jesus!
N: He begins to get out of bed.
C: ROBIN
D: Where are you going?
C: ALVY
D: Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
S: EXT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM OF THE TENNIS CLUB.
N: Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker room to the lobby. They are dressed in tennis whites. They walk toward the indoor court.
C: ROB
D: Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
C: ALVY
D: Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
C: ROB
D: Max, the city is terribly worried.
C: ALVY
D: But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
C: ROB
D: No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
C: ALVY
D: Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
C: ROB
D: Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
C: ALVY
D: Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college ...
S: INT. TENNIS COURT
N: Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets and balls. They are chattering and giggling.

E: Overlapping Alvy
C: JANET
D: I've had four lessons!
E: Laughing
N: The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are. They start to play mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her.
C: ALVY
D: Holy gods!
E: Hitting the halt back
S: INT. LOBBY
N: Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag. One knee is on the bench and his back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder. Seeing Alvy, she stops and turns.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi. Hi, hi.
C: ALVY
D: Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
E: Looking over his shoulder
C: ANNIE
D: Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.

C: ALVY
D: You-you play ... very well.
E: Clearing his throat
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta- whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away ... I have to say well. Oh, oh ... God, Annie. Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la.
E: Making sounds and laughing She gestures with her hand
N: She turns around and moves toward the door.
C: ALVY
D: Uh ... you-you wanna lift?
E: Still looking over his shoulder
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car?
E: Turning and aiming her thumb over her shoulder
C: ALVY
D: No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, no, I have a car.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: You have a car? So ... I don't understand why ... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

D: Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...
N: Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.
C: ALVY
D: So sorry.
E: Laughing
C: ANNIE
D: I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Yeah.

N: They walk out the door.
S: EXT. NEW YORK STREET- DAY

C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I'm in her acting class.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Oh - you're an actress.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I do commercials, sort of ...
N: She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way. A horn blows.

E: Finally reacting
C: ANNIE
D: Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- -a very good driver. So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
E: A car moves closer to the VW, almost on top of it in the wrong direction. Annie swerves away at the very last minute Alvy rubs his head nervously, staring out the window as Annie speeds along
N: Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.
C: ALVY
D: No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
C: ANNIE
D: Well, where is it? I-
C: ALVY
D: No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch the road. I'll get it-

C: ALVY
D: -for yuh.
C: ANNIE
D: Okay, that's good.
N: Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets.

C: ALVY
D: You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
E: He pulls a half-eaten sandwich out of her bag
C: ANNIE
D: Huh? Oh, yeah.
S: EXT. STREET-DAY
N: Cars are parked on both sides of the street as the VW rounds the corner.
C: ANNIE
D: I live over here. Oh, my God! Look! There's a parking space!
N: With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot. Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.
C: ALVY
D: That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
C: ANNIE
D: Don't be funny.
C: ALVY
D: You want your tennis stuff?
C: ANNIE
D: Huh? Oh ... yeah.
C: ALVY
D: You want your gear? Here you go.
N: Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment. He hands her her things. People pass by on the street.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
E: Sighing

N: Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, you do? Yeah? Oh, well, it's uh ... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, from Grammy Hall.
N: Annie flips the bottom of the tie.

C: ANNIE
D: Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, really?
S: INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT
N: Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment. There are lots of books, framed photographs on the white wall. A terrace can be seen from the window. He picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen carrying two glasses. She hands them to Alvy.
C: ALVY
D: Sylvia Plath.
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm...
C: ALVY
D: Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yeah.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, sorry.
C: ANNIE
D: Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
C: ALVY
D: Neat?
C: ANNIE
D: Neat, yeah.
C: ALVY
D: Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century. Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
E: Annie laughs
C: ANNIE
D: Oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my ... brother, Duane.
E: Moving over to the photographs
C: ALVY
D: Duane?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
E: Pointing
C: ALVY
D: Well, who's Sadie?
C: ANNIE
D: Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie... Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh ...
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Uh, narcolepsy.
C: ANNIE
D: Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so ... George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was ... shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. Anyway, so, so ... George is standing in line, oh, just a sec ...uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so... so, he's dead ... he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
E: Laughing Annie points her fingers to each side of her head, indicating George was a little crazy Laughing hysterically, she opens a cabinet door and takes out a bottle of wine Laughing through the speech Laughing Laughing
N: Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I ... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know ...
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, really? Oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh ...
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: ... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you know, I-I-I...
N: They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the wine. They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the held-out glasses.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
C: ALVY
D: No, I know, but ... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a shower at the club?
C: ALVY
D: Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
C: ANNIE
D: Why not?
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh ...
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I see, I see.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
C: ALVY
D: -'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
C: ANNIE
D: Fifteen years, huh?
E: Sipping her wine and laughing
C: ALVY
D: Fifteen years, yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Oh, God bless!
N: They put their glasses together in a toast.
C: ALVY
D: God bless.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, uh ... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
E: Laughing Pausing
C: ALVY
D: Oh, thank you.
E: Clearing his throat
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
E: Smiling
C: ALVY
D: So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
E: pointing toward the apartment after a short pause
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
E: Nodding, her hand on her hip
N: Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble? Listen to me-what a jerk!
C: ALVY
D: They're ... they're... they're wonderful, you know. They have ... they have, uh ... a ... a quality.
N: As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take a serious photography course soon.
N: Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo
C: ALVY
D: Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.
N: And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?
C: ANNIE
D: Aesthetic criteria? You mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not?
N: I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there
C: ALVY
D: The-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. That's-
N: I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow
C: ANNIE
D: Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know. I mean, I just try to uh, feel it, you know? I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.
N: God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others
C: ALVY
D: Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective, I think.
N: Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping. The sounds of distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace. Annie, laughing, speaks first.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess-I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
C: ALVY
D: You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... well, are you busy Friday night?
C: ANNIE
D: Me? Oh, uh. No.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
E: Putting his band on his forehead
C: ANNIE
D: Oh ... nothing. Not-no, no!
E: Nodding
C: ALVY
D: Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see.
C: ANNIE
D: I know.

D: -you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
E: Overlapping
S: INT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT
N: Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her. A Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness. There are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation, curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You.
S: EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.
N: Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk.
C: ANNIE
D: I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.

N: They turn and start walking again.
C: ANNIE
D: We can digest our-
C: ALVY
D: Okay. Yeah.
S: INT. DELI-NIGHT
N: Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth. The deli is fairly well lit and crowded. Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue. The waiter comes over to them to take their order.
C: ALVY
D: I'm gonna have a corned beef.
E: To the waiter
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?

C: ALVY
D: Hey?
C: ANNIE
D: H'm?
C: ALVY
D: I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
C: ANNIE
D: That's, uh ... that's pretty serious stuff there.
E: Looking at the books Alvy is bolding Laughing

D: -big subject with me, yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah?
N: They move over to the cashier line.
C: ALVY
D: I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
E: Gesturing
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: Those are the two categories ...
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.

C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So-so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky ... to be ... ... to be miserable.
E: Overlapping Annie's laughter
C: ANNIE
D: U-huh.
S: EXT. PARK-DAY
N: It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park. People are sitting on benches, others strolling, some walking dogs. One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons. Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before them. An older man and woman walk into view.
C: ALVY
D: Look, look at that guy.
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know? He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.

D: You see, like you and I ...
C: ALVY
D: You are extremely sexy.
C: ANNIE
D: No, I'm not.

C: ALVY
D: Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
C: ANNIE
D: Ooooh!
N: They stop walking. Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him. The South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.
C: ALVY
D: You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps ... you get excited.
C: ANNIE
D: Come on. Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
E: Laughing

S: INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT
N: Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures. They both carry cartons.
C: ALVY
D: Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
C: ANNIE
D: Of course.
E: Putting down the carton
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.

D: I have a tiny apartment.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I know it's small.
C: ANNIE
D: That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
E: Picking up the suitcases and walking into the bedroom
C: ALVY
D: All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a ... ... rapidly growing field.
E: Picking up some pictures and following Annie into the bedroom Annie, reacting, tosses the suitcases and some loose clothing onto the bed. She sits down on the edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, pictures and carton in band, still talking
C: ANNIE
D: You don't want me to live with you?
C: ALVY
D: How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
C: ANNIE
D: Mine.
C: ALVY
D: Ye-ah. Was it ... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
C: ANNIE
D: I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
E: putting pictures on the mantel
C: ALVY
D: No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
N: He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in. He starts tossing books off screen.
C: ANNIE
D: How is it any different?
E: Looking up at Alvy
C: ALVY
D: It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we're not married.
E: Gesturing Holding a book, he starts walking around the room
N: He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.
C: ANNIE
D: That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
E: Still sitting on the bed
C: ALVY
D: That place is four hundred dollars a month?
E: Looking at Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Yes, it is.
C: ALVY
D: It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
E: Whistling
C: ANNIE
D: You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
E: Shaking her head
C: ALVY
D: Hey, don't be ridiculous.
N: Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
C: ALVY
D: 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
E: Putting his hand to his forehead
S: EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing through a school catalogue. Alvy lies in bed reading.

E: Laughing
N: Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.
C: ALVY
D: No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for? You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
E: He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds
C: ANNIE
D: Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?

E: Off screen
C: ALVY
D: Me, no. You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
C: ANNIE
D: It relaxes me.
E: Moving back into the room and lighting a joint
C: ALVY
D: Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
C: ANNIE
D: Well, what's the difference, anyway?
E: Closing the door
C: ALVY
D: Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
E: She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana
C: ALVY
D: Oh, come, you don't need that.
N: Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.
C: ANNIE
D: What are you doing?
C: ALVY
D: No, no, no, what ... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
E: Kissing her
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. M'mrnm.
E: Laughing and making sounds
C: ALVY
D: M'm, wait, I got a great idea. Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. I just ... there ... There's a little Old New Orleans ... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there. M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
E: He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table He turns the lamp back on, having replaced the bulb with the red one from the closet He undresses and crawls into bed, taking Annie in his arms
N: ANNIE Uh-uh-why?
C: ALVY
D: I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
C: ANNIE
D: No, I'm fine.
N: As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits down on a chair, watching.
C: ALVY
D: Really?
C: ANNIE
D: U-huh.
C: ALVY
D: I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
C: ANNIE
D: Let's just do it, all right?
C: ALVY
D: Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
E: Kissing and caressing Annie
C: ANNIE'S SPIRIT
D: Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad? Because while you two are doing that, I think I'm gonna do some drawing.
C: ALVY
D: You see, that's what I call removed.
E: Reacting
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, you have my body.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I need grass and so do you.
E: Sighing
C: ALVY
D: Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
E: Clearing his throat
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: -so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
E: Overlapping
C: ANNIE
D: Were you always funny?
C: ALVY
D: Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE.
N: A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room. The agent, chewing a cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who stands with his hands in his pockets. A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair nearby watching.
C: AGENT
D: This guy is naturally funny. I think he can write for you.
C: COMIC
D: Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good. Well, lemme explain a little bit o' how I work. You know, you can tell right off the bat that I don't look like a funny guy when I come-you know, like some o' the guys that come out. You know, right away they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're gonna fall down, but I gotta be really talented. Material's gotta be sensational for me 'cause I work, you know, with very, very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you know what I mean? Uh ... uh ... lemme explain. For instance, I open with an opening song. A musical start like and I walk out "Place looks wonderful from here and you folks look wonderful from here! "And seein' you there With a smile on your face Makes me shout This must be the place." Then I stop right in the middle and then I open with some jokes. Now, that's where I need you, right there. For instance, like I say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada, you know, they speak a lotta French up there. The only way to remember Jeanne d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!" "Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."
E: Buttoning his jacket Gesturing Ad-lib singing Ad-lib singing Singing He laughs. Seated Alvy looks up smiling
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Jesus, this guy's pathetic.
E: To himself
C: COMIC
D: ... big lumberjack ...
E: Overlapping above speech
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: Look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute. You wanna throw up. If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes. I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business, I know it.
E: To himself while the comic continues his routine
C: COMIC
D: "'Cherie, come back. I love you. But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you make me so mad."' Oh, they scream at that. Now, write me somethin' like that, will yuh? Kinda French number, can yuh do it? Huh, kid?
E: Overlapping above speech Shaking his lips and mimicking Laughing
S: INT. THEATER - NIGHT
N: The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering, excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone.
C: ALVY
D: W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to reorient myself. This is the University of Wisconsin, right? So I'm always ... I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a col- I've a very bad history with colleges. You know, I went to New York University and, uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final. You know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me- -and when I was thrown out, my mother, who's an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles. And, uh, tsch, I was depressed. I was ... in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a matter of fact, uh, I would have killed myself but I was in analysis with a strict Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they make you pay for the sessions you miss.
E: Gesturing The audience laughs; they're with him More applause and laughter
S: INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER.
N: Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs. Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
C: ALVY
D: C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
C: ALVY
D: Are yuh?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: ALVY
D: Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: May I have your autograph?
E: Interrupting
C: ANNIE
D: Oh.
E: Over lapping above speech
C: ALVY
D: You're so sure about it.
E: To Annie, while autographing
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
N: They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a flash camera as they walk through the crowd.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. Thank you.
E: To one of his fans
C: ANNIE
D: No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
C: ALVY
D: Yeah.
C: ANNIE
D: It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
S: EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY
N: The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green
T: lawn, then cuts to:
S: INT. DINING ROOM.
N: Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner. The sun is pouring through a big picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.
C: MOM HALL
D: It's a nice ham this year, Mom.
E: Holding her wine glass
N: Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yeah. Grammy always does such a good job.
E: Smiling at Duane
C: DAD HALL
D: A great sauce.
E: Chewing
C: ALVY
D: It is. It's dynamite ham.
E: Smacking his lips
N: Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries not to notice.
C: MOM HALL
D: We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
E: To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair
C: ANNIE
D: We really had a good time.
N: Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.
C: MOM HALL
D: Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.
E: Lighting a cigarette and turning to Alvy
C: ALVY
D: Yes. I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib.
E: Setting down his glass and coughing
N: Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning. Grammy continues to stare.
C: DAD HALL
D: Duane and I went out to the boat basin.
C: DUANE
D: We were caulkin' holes all day.
C: DAD HALL
D: Yeah. Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.
E: Laughing
C: MOM HALL
D: Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yes, yes.
N: Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.
C: ALVY
D: I can't believe this family. Annie's mother. She really's beautiful. And they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew hater. And, uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and ... like they never get sick or anything. Nothing like my family. You know, the two are like oil and water.
E: To the audience Making chewing sounds Pointing to Grammy
N: The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father, aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table. They eat quickly and interrupt one another loudly. On the left the Halls in their dining room. Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.
C: ALVY'S FATHER
D: Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
C: ALVY'S MOTHER
D: His wife has diabetes!
C: ALVY'S FATHER
D: Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
C: ALVY'S UNCLE
D: The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job.
C: ALVY'S AUNT
D: Is that a reason to steal from his father?
E: Putting more meat on her husband's plate
C: ALVY'S UNCLE
D: Whatta you talkin' about? You don't know what you're talking about.
C: ALVY'S AUNT
D: Yes, I know what I'm talking about.
C: ALVY'S MOTHER
D: George, defend him!
E: Interrupting
C: ALVY'S UNCLE
D: No Moskowitz he had a coronary.
E: Over Alvy's father's muttering
C: ALVY'S AUNT
D: You don't say.
C: ALVY'S MOTHER
D: We fast.
C: MOM HALL
D: Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the Veterans Hospital.
C: DAD HALL
D: My God, he's the new president of the El Regis. Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else.
C: MOM HALL
D: That's Jack's wife. We used to make that outta raisins.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
C: MOM HALL
D: Oh, you remember her, Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes, I do.
N: The two families start talking back and forth to one another. The screen is still split.
C: MOM HALL
D: How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer?
C: DAD HALL
D: Fast?
C: ALVY'S FATHER
D: Yeah, no food. You know, we have to atone for our sins.
C: MOM HALL
D: What sins? I don't understand.
C: ALVY'S FATHER
D: Tell you the truth, neither do we.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT
N: Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.
C: DUANE
D: Alvy.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
E: Walking in
C: DUANE
D: This is my room.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, yeah? Terrific.
E: Looking around He clears his throat
C: DUANE
D: Can I confess something?
N: Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser. Duane's face is big lighted by a single lamp.
C: DUANE
D: I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving ... on the road at night ... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion. The sound of shattering glass. The ... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
C: ALVY
D: Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
E: Reacting and clearing his throat
N: He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.
S: INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.
N: Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.
C: MOM HALL
D: Now, don't let it be so long, now.
C: ANNIE
D: No.
C: DAD HALL
D: And look up Uncle Bill, you promise.
C: ANNIE
D: Okay. Okay.
C: MOM HALL
D: Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: You think so? Do you really?
C: MOM HALL
D: We're going to take them to the airport.
C: DAD HALL
D: Oh, no-Duane can. I haven't finished my drink.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes, Duane is. I'll be right-
C: MOM HALL
D: M'mmm.
C: ANNIE
D: I just have time to get the, uh-
N: She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead. It is raining very hard, the windshield wipers are moving quickly. The headlights of another car brightens the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.
S: EXT. STREET- DAY
N: The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.
C: ANNIE
D: You followed me. I can't believe it!
E: Off screen
C: ALVY
D: I didn't follow you!
E: Off screen
C: ANNIE
D: You followed me!
C: ALVY
D: Why? 'Cause I ... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
C: ANNIE
D: Well, what is your definition of following?
C: ALVY
D: Following is different. I was spying.
E: Gasping
C: ANNIE
D: Do you realize how paranoid you are?
C: ALVY
D: Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
C: ANNIE
D: That is the worst kind of paranoia.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
C: ANNIE
D: "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
C: ALVY
D: What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
E: Stopping for a moment
N: She walks away.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
E: Catching up to her
C: ANNIE
D: We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
E: Continuing to walk quickly
C: ALVY
D: "Neat"! There's that- What are you-twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
E: Still walking next to her
C: ANNIE
D: Who cares? Who cares?
C: ALVY
D: Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
N: They both stop in the middle of the street.
C: ANNIE
D: You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
C: ALVY
D: David? You call your teacher David?
C: ANNIE
D: It's his name.
C: ALVY
D: Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
N: He walks away.
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy! Alvy! You're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment. You don't think I'm smart enough! We had that argument just last month, or don't ou remember that day?
E: Calling after him
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KITCHEN.
N: Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last month's argument. Annie's voice is heard.
C: ANNIE
D: I'm home!
E: Off screen
C: ALVY
D: Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
E: Turning
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, it was ... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
E: Comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table Laughing
C: ALVY
D: Yeah?
C: ANNIE
D: And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
C: ALVY
D: M'm.
C: ANNIE
D: And then she mentioned penis envy ... Did you know about that?
C: ALVY
D: Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so ... you know.
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: G-go on, I'm interested.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
C: ALVY
D: M'hm.
C: ANNIE
D: And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
C: ALVY
D: Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
C: ANNIE
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got ... nothing like that in-
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
C: ALVY
D: You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic ...
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
E: Taking groceries from the bag
C: ALVY
D: I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
C: ANNIE
D: In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
C: ALVY
D: Sinatra?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, and he's strangling me ...
C: ALVY
D: Yeah?
C: ANNIE
D: ... and I keep, you know, it's-
C: ALVY
D: Well, well, sure ... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic ... kind of insight.
E: Taking a bottle of juice and some celery from the bag
C: ANNIE
D: She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
E: Pointing her finger at Alvy
C: ALVY
D: Whatta you mean? Me?
E: Turning to Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.
C: ALVY
D: Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
E: Putting his band to his mouth
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
E: Turning, ajar in her hand
C: ALVY
D: Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
E: Thinking
C: ANNIE
D: Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, Will it change my wife?
E: Putting away some groceries
C: ALVY
D: Will it change your wife?
C: ANNIE
D: Will it change my life?
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
C: ANNIE
D: No, I didn't. I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife. Will it change ...
C: ANNIE
D: Life. I said, "life."
E: Yelling out, angry
N: Alvy turns toward the camera.
C: ALVY
D: She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
E: To the audience
C: ANNIE
D: And, Alvy ... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
N: She walks out of the room.
C: ALVY
D: Why do you always bring that up? Because I encourage you to take adult-education courses? I think it's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors'.
E: To Annie's back, gesturing
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET
N: Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people and cars move by.
C: ALVY
D: Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
C: ANNIE
D: A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
C: ALVY
D: David! David! I can't believe this!
E: Interrupting
C: ANNIE
D: And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
C: ALVY
D: I'm following you and David, if you-
C: ANNIE
D: I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
E: Interrupting
N: Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.
C: ALVY
D: That's fine. That's fine. That's great! Well, I don't know what I did wrong. I mean, I can't believe this. Somewhere she cooled off to me! Is it-is it something that I did?
E: He turns toward the camera as the cab drives away Gesturing He walks up to an older woman walking down the street carrying groceries
C: WOMAN ON THE STREET
D: Never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades.
N: She moves on down the street.
C: ALVY
D: Love fades. God, that's a depressing thought. Have to ask you a question. Don't go any further. Now, with your wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?
E: Scratching his head He stops another passer-by,a man
C: MAN ON THE STREET
D: We use a large vibrating egg.
N: He walks on.
C: ALVY
D: Large vibrating egg. Well, I ask a psychopath, I get that kind of an answer. Jesus, I-I, uh, here ... You-you look like a really happy couple. Uh, uh ... are you?
E: Continuing to walk He moves up the sidewalk to a young trendy-looking couple, arms wrapped around each other
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Yeah.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah! So ... so h-h-how do you account for it?
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Uh, I'm very shallow and empty and I have no ideas and nothing interesting to say.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: And I'm exactly the same way.
C: ALVY
D: I see. Well, that's very interesting. So you've managed to work out something, huh?
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Right.
C: YOUNG WOMAN
D: Yeah.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me.
N: He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if to speak.
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: You know, even as a kid I always went for the wrong women. I think that's my problem. When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White. I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.
N: The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her mirror. Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him.
C: WICKED QUEEN
D: We never have any fun anymore.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
D: How can you say that?
C: WICKED QUEEN
D: Why not? You're always leaning on me to improve myself.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
D: You're just upset. You must be getting your period.
C: WICKED QUEEN
D: I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon character. Can't I be upset once in a while?
N: Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked Queen.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ROB
D: Max, will you forget about Annie? I know lots of women you can date.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
D: I don't wanna go out with any other women.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ROB
D: Max, have I got a girl for you. You are going to love her. She's a reporter-
N: The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball. Rob's voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter. It's very crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.
C: CARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER
D: -for Rolling Stone.
C: FEMALE REPORTER
D: I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert. I covered the Dylan concert ... which gave me chills. Especially when he sang "She takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl." Up to that I guess the most charismatic event I covered was Mick's Birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden.
E: They move toward the aisles as a guard holds up his hands to stop them
C: ALVY
D: Man, that's great. That's just great.
E: Laughing
C: REPORTER
D: You catch Dylan?
C: ALVY
D: Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
E: Coughing
C: REPORTER
D: You have a raccoon?
C: ALVY
D: Tsch, a few.
E: Gesturing

C: YOUNG ALVY
D: What an asshole!

C: ALVY'S MOTHER
D: I was always the sister with good common sense. But Tessie was always the one with personality. When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie.
N: She touches Tessie's shoulder. Tessie starts to laugh.
C: ADULT ALVY
D: Do you believe that, Max? Tessie Moskowitz had the personality. She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.
E: Pointing, to Rob
C: ALVY'S MOTHER
D: She was once a great beauty.

S: INT. MOVIE THEATER.
N: The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. Subtitles pop on: "The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats tried to flee with their gold and jewels" as a narrator explains in German.
T: CUT TO.
N: Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor. The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him. This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood. The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.
C: ANNIE
D: That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
E: To her doctor
C: ALVY
D: Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
E: To his doctor
C: ANNIE
D: Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
C: ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST
D: How often do you sleep together?
C: ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST
D: Do you have sex often?
C: ALVY
D: Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
C: ANNIE
D: Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
C: ALVY
D: She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
C: ANNIE
D: And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
C: ALVY
D: I mean ... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and ...
C: ANNIE
D: But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because ... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
C: ALVY
D: The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
C: ANNIE
D: I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
C: ALVY
D: You know ... it's getting expensive ...my analyst ... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
E: Simultaneously, with Annie
C: ANNIE
D: Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
E: Simultaneously, with Alvy
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. APARTMENT
N: Alvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment. Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background. Excited, they talk almost all at once.

C: ANNIE
D: Well, I always wanted to try, you know, but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, don't put it on me. You kn- Wh-what is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal membranes ...
N: They all start talking at once.
C: ANNIE
D: You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
C: ALVY
D: How can you say that? I mean, who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
E: Counting on his fingers Making sounds
C: ANNIE
D: That's sick!
E: Reacting
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
N: Annie laughs, chatters.
C: WOMAN FRIEND
D: Just come on, Alvy. Do your body a favor. Try it, come on.
E: All four are now sitting on the sofa. The male friend starts to prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy and Annie look at each other, reacting
C: ALVY
D: Oh, yeah?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
E: Moving forward on the couch
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
E: Laughing
C: MALE FRIEND
D: It's great stuff, Alvy. Friend of mine just brought it in from California.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell yuh, we're going to California next week.
C: GIRL
D: Oh, really?
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah ...
C: ALVY
D: ... I'm thrilled. As you know, uh ... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
C: ANNIE
D: No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
E: Interrupting
C: GIRL
D: You're kidding?
C: ALVY
D: It's so phony, and we have to leave New York during Christmas week, which really kills me.
C: MAN
D: Alvy, listen, while you're in California, could you possibly score some coke for me?
E: Interrupting
N: Annie laughs.
C: ALVY
D: Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I have in my boot, you know. H-h-how much is this stuff?
E: Over Annie's laughter Alvy picks up the small open gold case of cocaine base the man placed on the coffee table and looks at it, reacting
C: MAN
D: It's about two thousand dollars an ounce.
C: ANNIE
D: God.
C: ALVY
D: Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never ...
N: He puts his finger into the drug, smells it and then sneezes. The powder blows all over the room as the man, woman and Annie react silently.
T: CUT TO:
N: CALIFORNIA. BEVERLY HILLS STREET-DAY It's a warm, beautiful day. Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are moving past the spacious houses, the palm trees. The sunlight reflects off the car. Annie, excited, is taking the whole place in. Background voices sing Christmas carols.
C: VOICES
D: We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry Christmas, And a -Happy New Year.
E: Singing
C: ROB
D: I've never been so relaxed as I have been since I moved out here, Max. I want you to see my house. I live right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max. He lets me use the Jacuzzi. And the women, Max, they're like the women in Playboy magazine, only they can move their arms and legs.
E: Over the singing

D: -Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese.
C: ANNIE
D: God, it's so clean out here.
C: ALVY
D: It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
C: ROB
D: Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will yuh? It's Christmas.
N: Annie starts snapping pictures of the view.
C: ALVY
D: Can you believe this is Christmas here?
C: VOICES
D: Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree ...
E: Singing
N: They pass a large house with spacious lawn. Sitting on the lawn is a Santa Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer. Voices continue to sing Christmas carols; Annie continues to take pictures.
C: ANNIE
D: You know, it was snowing-it was snowing and really gray in New York yesterday.
C: ROB
D: No kidding?
C: ALVY
D: Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
C: ROB
D: Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
C: ALVY
D: There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
C: ROB
D: While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
N: They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand. "Tail-Pup" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs.
C: VOICES
D: Remember Christ our Savior Was born on Christmas day To save us all ... from Satan's power As we were gone astray.
E: Singing, louder now
N: They pass a theater, the marquee announcing "House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil. Rated R. Starts at 7:15."
S: INT. TV CONTROL ROOM.
N: Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console. Rob and Alvy, along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy. They chatter, analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy.
C: ALVY
D: Oh.
E: Overlapping the chatter
C: ROB
D: Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
C: ROB ON TV SCREEN
D: A limousine to the track breakdown?
C: ROB
D: A little bigger.
E: Watching
N: TV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh track.
C: ALVY
D: Do you realize how immoral this all is?
C: ROB
D: Max, I've got a hit series.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
N: Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another character, Arnie.
C: ARNIE
D: Oh, I'm sorry.
C: ROB ON TV SCREEN
D: Arnie.
C: ARNIE
D: Yeah.
C: ROB
D: Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
E: Turning to the technician
C: ALVY
D: Look, uh ...
N: Loud laughter from the TV monitors.
C: ROB
D: We do the show live in front of an audience.
E: To Alvy
C: ALVY
D: Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
C: ROB
D: Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
C: ROB ON TV SCREEN
D: You better lie down. You've been in the sun too long.
C: ROB
D: Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a medium-size chuckle here ... and then a big hand.
E: To the technician

N: The monitors show a woman on the screen.
C: WOMAN

C: ALVY
D: Oh, Max, I don't feel well.
E: Overlapping the TV
C: ROB
D: What's the matter?

D: I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.
E: Coughing
C: ROB
D: Well, sit down.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, Jesus.

C: ROB
D: You all right?
C: ALVY
D: I don't know, I mean, I-
C: ROB
D: You wanna lie down?
E: Crouching before Alvy, looking at him
C: ALVY
D: No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting ...
C: ROB
D: How about a ginger ale?
C: ALVY
D: Oh, Max ... no, I maybe I better lie down.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM.
N: Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking concerned. The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at it. Annie, in the background, is on the phone.
C: ANNIE
D: Yes.
E: Talking into the phone
C: DOCTOR
D: Why don't you just try to get a little of this down? This is just plain chicken.
E: Holding out the food
C: ALVY
D: Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous. If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank ... and give out an award on a TV show.
E: Taking a piece of chicken and holding it He gasps and makes sounds
C: ANNIE
D: Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes, I'll tell him.
E: On the phone, overlapping the doctor and Alvy
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, there's nothing wrong with you actually, so far as I can tell. I mean, you have no fever, no ... no symptoms of anything serious. You haven't been eating pork or shellfish.
N: Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy.
C: ANNIE
D: Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
E: Sitting on the edge of the bed
C: ALVY
D: I'm nauseous. Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
E: Making sounds He sighs and gasps
N: Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of chicken he has been holding. The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah. Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.
C: DOCTOR
D: Now, Mrs. Singer, I can't find anything --
C: ALVY
D: Christ!
C: ANNIE
D: Nothing at all?
C: DOCTOR
D: No, I think I can get a lab man up here.
C: ALVY
D: Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?
E: Grabbing the rest of the chicken from the plate
C: ANNIE
D: What do you mean? Do you think he's-
C: DOCTOR
D: Yes, excuse me. Perhaps it would be even better if we took him to the hospital for a day or two.
E: Handing the salt to Alvy To Annie
N: Alvy begins to eat.
C: ANNIE
D: Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, otherwise, there's no real way to tell what's going on.
C: ALVY
D: This is not bad, actually.
E: Making sounds, gasping
S: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY
N: Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an attendant walks over to the car. A sprawling house is seen to the right; a couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other parked cars. Loud music is heard.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta walk from the car to the house. Geez, my feet haven't touched pavement since I reached Los Angeles.
E: Getting out of the car
S: INT. HOUSE
N: A Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people, circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks. It's all very casual. French doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, guests move from the room to outside and back in. It is crowded; bits of conversation and clinking glasses can be heard. Two men, California-tanned, stand by the French doors talking.
C: 1ST MAN
D: Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
C: 2ND MAN
D: I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
C: 1ST MAN
D: All the good meetings are taken.
T: CUT TO:
N: FULL GROUP SHOT A man stands talking, people in groups behind him. Two born like gadgets are attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume.
C: 3RD MAN
D: Right now it's only a notion, but I think I can get money to make it into a concept ... and later turn it into an idea.
T: CUT TO:
N: Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house.
C: ROB
D: You like this house, Max?
C: ALVY
D: M'hm.
C: ROB
D: I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
C: ALVY
D: Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
C: ROB
D: What difference does that make?
N: Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated conversation.
C: ALVY
D: I think he has a little thing for Annie.
C: ROB
D: Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
C: ALVY
D: Where?
N: Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a group of people close-by.
C: ROB
D: The one with the V.P.L.
C: ALVY
D: V.P.L.?
C: ROB
D: Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you?
C: ROB
D: There are no twos, Max.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
C: ROB
D: M'hm.
C: ALVY
D: And ... uh-
C: ROB
D: How do you like this couple, Max?
E: Interrupting
N: A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy. The man's arm is around the woman; they stand very close. In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.
C: ROB
D: And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, intensive care ward. My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I think she's giving me the eye.
E: Watching the woman in white
N: As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward them.
C: ROB
D: If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
C: ALVY
D: I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
C: GIRL IN WHITE
D: You're Alvy Singer, right? Didn't we meet at EST?
C: ALVY
D: EST? No, no, I was never to est.
E: Reacting
C: GIRL IN WHITE
D: Then how can you criticize it?
C: ALVY
D: Oh.
C: ROB
D: Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
C: ALVY
D: No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
E: Laughing
C: ROB
D: Hi. How do you do.
E: Shaking his head
C: GIRL IN WHITE
D: Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned?
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, he's crazy.
N: The girl in white laughs.
C: ALVY
D: Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
E: Looking at Rob and the girl
C: ROB
D: Yeah. Right.
C: ALVY
D: Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
C: ROB
D: We're gonna operate together.
N: Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie standing by the buffet table.
C: TONY
D: We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
C: ANNIE
D: I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
C: TONY
D: just ... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh.
C: TONY
D: There's a whole wing in this house.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
E: Laughing
C: TONY
D: You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
C: ANNIE
D: I don't know. I don't know.
E: Laughing
N: She picks up an hors doeuvre.
T: CUT TO:
N: The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people milling about.
C: 1ST MAN
D: Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
C: 2ND MAN
D: M'mm.
N: Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy and Annie to show them the rest of the house.
C: TONY
D: This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
C: ALVY
D: Trigger.
N: Annie and the girl in white laugh.
C: TONY
D: Charlie Chaplin.
C: ALVY
D: Hey.
C: TONY
D: Right before his un-American thing.
N: They stop in a den-like screening room. A man is slouched back on one of the comfortable sofas that fill the room. It is much quieter in here; a contrast to the noise and crowd downstairs.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, this place is great.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: TONY
D: Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, I love it there.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
E: Laughing
C: TONY
D: Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: ALVY
D: I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
C: ANNIE
D: Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
C: TONY
D: Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See ... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: TONY
D: It could be freezing, it could be raining.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah.
C: TONY
D: And here, you just-
C: GIRL IN WHITE
D: We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night.
C: ALVY AND ANNIE
D: Oh, yeah?
E: In unison
C: MAN ON THE SOFA
D: That's a great film if you're high. Hey, you.
E: Looking over his shoulder at the group The group laughs, looking down at the man on the sofa. He looks up at them, smiling, a joint in his hand, and offers them a cigarette
C: TONY
D: Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic lighting job. Okay?
E: Shaking his head no
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, good. Okay.
C: ALVY
D: I'm cool.
N: Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.
C: ANNIE
D: It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
E: Taking Alvy's arm
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
C: ANNIE
D: Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
N: They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.
C: MAN ON THE PHONE
D: Yeah, yeah. I forgot my mantra.
N: As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear. People are looser now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate corners, some couples are dancing. Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the huge Christmas tree. A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of the room dancing. The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:
T: CUT TO:
S: AIRPLANE. INT. AIRPLANE
N: Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads. Both are preoccupied, thinking their own thoughts.
C: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
D: That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
E: To herself
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
E: To himself
C: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
D: I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
E: As she sips coffee
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
E: An open magazine lies in his lap
C: ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER
D: If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
N: He looks over at Annie.
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
E: Looking back at Alvy
C: ALVY
D: Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.
E: He sighs Clearing his throat
S: INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY
N: A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out.
C: ALVY
D: Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
E: Holding up a book
C: ANNIE
D: Well, let's see now ... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
E: Walking into the room with an armload of books
C: ALVY
D: Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
E: Reacting
C: ANNIE
D: Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
E: Putting down the books and flipping back her hair
C: ALVY
D: There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
E: Riffling through the books
C: ANNIE
D: Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
E: Holding a framed picture and moving about
C: ALVY
D: This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
E: Looking down at a book
C: ANNIE
D: Oh-
C: ALVY
D: This is the first book that I got you.
N: Annie goes over to Alvy. They both look down at the book; the fireplace, burning nicely, is behind them.
C: ANNIE
D: -God.
C: ALVY
D: Remember that day?
C: ANNIE
D: Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
C: ALVY
D: Thanks, honey.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
E: Patting Alvy's shoulder
N: She walks away.
C: ALVY
D: There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you know?
N: He tosses the book into the carton.
C: ANNIE
D: Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
E: Off screen
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
E: Off screen
C: ANNIE
D: Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
E: Walking in with another armload of books
C: ALVY
D: Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
C: ANNIE
D: What?
C: ALVY
D: We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause ... Right.
E: Holding a small box of buttons
C: ANNIE
D: Exactly, but ... exactly. Ooooh!
E: Overlapping
C: ALVY
D: You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
C: ANNIE
D: Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
E: Taking a button from a box
C: ALVY
D: Yeah.
E: Interrupting
C: ANNIE
D: I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET-DAY

C: ALVY
D: I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.
E: Into the camera, to the audience
N: A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.
C: MAN ON THE STREET

N: The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by.
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Don't tell me you're jealous?
C: ALVY
D: Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, lady? What I have here ... I found this in the apartment. Black soap. She used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why.
E: He takes a small item from his pocket to show the woman
C: OLD WOMAN
D: Well, why don't you go out with other women?
C: ALVY
D: Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT.
N: People milling about as Alvy, in the outside phone-booth center, talks.
C: ALVY
D: Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do- where do you think I am? I'm-I'm out ... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport. I flew in ... Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ... Hey, listen, can we not debate this on-on the telephone because I'm, you know, I-I feel that I got a temperature and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good.
E: Sniffling Muttering
N: Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly toward an intersection.
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I don't care. I'll-I'll drive in. I rented a car I'm driving ... that ... Whatta you mean? What-why is that such a miracle? I'm driving myself --
S: EXT. OUTDOOR CAF - DAY
N: People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset Boulevard outdoor cafe. Street traffic goes by while they dine. There's a mild California breeze. The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his way around the tables looking about. He finally sits down at an empty table; nearby sits a woman with a younger man. A waitress brings Alvy a menu and waits for his order.
C: ALVY
D: I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.
E: To the waitress
N: Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view. Alvy, noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table. He rises and they shake hands.
C: ANNIE
D: Hi.
N: Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares. He smiles, the street traffic moving behind him. Annie smiles back.
C: ALVY
D: You look very pretty.
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice.
E: Alvy adjusts his glasses, not exactly knowing where to start; a bit uneasy
C: ALVY
D: You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
E: Nodding his head
C: ANNIE
D: Oh, Alvy, come on.
E: Adjusting her sunglasses
C: ALVY
D: Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
C: ANNIE
D: Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and-and we play tennis. I mean, that's ... that's a very big step for me, you know? I mean ... I'm able to enjoy people more.
E: Looking around Reacting, Alvy looks down at his hands, then up
C: ALVY
D: So whatta you ... You're not gonna come back to New York?
E: Sadly
C: ANNIE
D: What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
E: Smiling
C: ALVY
D: Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
C: ANNIE
D: That's right, that's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
E: Still smiling
C: ALVY
D: That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
E: Nodding his head and gesturing
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
C: ALVY
D: I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. So wanna get married or what?
E: Toying with his car keys Looking down at his hands, sadly
C: ANNIE
D: No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
E: Seriously
C: ALVY
D: Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I ... Can I ... Can I ...
E: In disbelief Louder, to the waitress
C: ANNIE
D: You're mad, aren't you?
E: Interrupting
C: ALVY
D: No. Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
E: Shaking his head Then nodding
C: ANNIE
D: Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know ... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
E: Laughing
C: ALVY
D: The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. I'm workin' on a play. Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
E: Shrugging his shoulders Sighing
N: He nods his head in disbelief.
C: ANNIE
D: No! Look, I gotta go.
E: Nodding Pauses
N: She starts to rise.
C: ALVY
D: You mean that ... I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
E: He gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables
C: ANNIE
D: I'm late.
C: ALVY
D: Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
N: They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.
C: ANNIE
D: If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
C: ALVY
D: The what?
C: ANNIE
D: The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
C: ALVY
D: You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
C: ANNIE
D: Oh!
C: ALVY
D: I thought just earplugs.
N: Annie gets into her car. Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.
C: ANNIE
D: Just forget it, Alvy, okay? Let's just forget the conversation.
N: She closes the door, starts the motor.
C: ALVY
D: Awards! They do nothing but give out awards! I can't believe it. Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!
E: Yelling after her
N: Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park. Alvy's father is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left. Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible, purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper- car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force. Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car. He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.
C: ALVY
D: Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with-with-with-
E: Getting out of the car
C: OFFICER
D: May I see your license, please?
E: Interrupting
C: ALVY
D: Sure. just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've ...
E: Searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket
N: He drops the license and it falls to the ground.
C: OFFICER
D: Don't give me your life story -just pick up the license.
E: Looking at the piece of paper on the ground
C: ALVY
D: Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
C: OFFICER
D: Just give me the license, please.
E: Interrupting
C: ALVY
D: Since you put it that way. It's hard for me to refuse. ... have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
E: He laughs He leans over, picks up the license, then proceeds to rip it up. He lets the pieces go; they float to the ground
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR.
N: A guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates. He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out.
C: ALVY
D: So long, fellas. Keep in touch.
N: He walks down the corridor off screen.
S: EXT. A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY
N: Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move out the door of the building, down the steps to the street.
C: ROB
D: Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
C: ALVY
D: Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
E: Carrying his jacket over his shoulder
N: They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.
C: ROB
D: Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
E: Starting the car
C: ALVY
D: You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
E: Reacting
C: ROB
D: Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
N: He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.
C: ALVY
D: Max, are we driving through plutonium?
E: Looking at Rob's helmet
C: ROB
D: Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER.
N: An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball. They face each other. The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.
C: ACTOR
D: You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
C: ACTRESS
D: What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
C: ACTOR
D: You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
C: ACTRESS
D: Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
N: The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up near the actors. A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the two actors, a script lying on the table between them. It is obvious now that they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.
C: ACTOR
D: It's an important issue.
E: In mirrored reflection
C: ACTRESS
D: Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
E: In mirrored reflection
N: The camera moves back to actual actor and actress.
C: ACTRESS
D: You're like New York. You're an island.
C: ACTOR
D: Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here ... in a health -food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
E: Rising with emotion
N: The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair.
C: ACTRESS
D: Wait! I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you. I love you.
E: The actor comes back. They embrace
N: The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera.
C: ALVY
D: Tsch, whatta you want? It was my first play. You know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life. Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
E: To the audience, gesturing
N: Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, shakes hands with Annie and her escort. The theater marquee reads "OPHULS PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."
C: ALVY'S VOICE
D: She had moved back to New York. She was living in SoHo with some guy. And when I met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the Pity." Which I counted as a personal triumph. Annie and I ... ... we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.
E: Over the theater scene and, Annie's singing Laughing Alvy's voice continues over the scene shot through a window of Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and Annie sitting at a table, laughing and enjoying themselves
N: A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to sing: Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich. Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove. Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline. Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car. Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts in the red light. The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider. And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment. Annie holding up her sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City skyline behind them. The music stops. Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows Annie and Alvy across street. They look about at the city traffic. Lunch is over; it's time. Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like. Annie crosses the street, Alvy watching her go. Then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen. His voice is heard over the scene:
C: ALVY'S VOICE-OVER
D: After that it got pretty late. And we both hadda go, but it was great seeing Annie again, right? I realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her and I-I thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy. He thinks he's a chicken." And, uh, the doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn him in?" And the guy says, "I would, but I need the eggs." Well, I guess that's pretty much how how I feet about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and ... but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.
