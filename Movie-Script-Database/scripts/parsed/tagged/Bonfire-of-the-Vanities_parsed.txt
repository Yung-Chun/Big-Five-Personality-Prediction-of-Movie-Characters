N: Cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of shining lights as we RACE UP the avenue, and the voice of Peter Fallow speaks to us...
C: PETER
D: Yes. We're getting closer. Can you feel it. Can you see it? The heat. The brilliance. Moving fast into the heart of it. Buzz. Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered prayers. thru thru

N: pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as... TWO AIDES try to lead Fallow into the building. Fallow is clutch- ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle. He leans heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his feet. )T( BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES - Rev. 5/25/90 2. *

D: MINI CART
N: approaches. The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto the cart. The cart carries him past the garbage con- tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor. FALLOW sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself -- he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent.
C: FEMALE AIDE
D: jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up. The male aide runs alongside the cart.
C: VARIOUS WAITERS
D: in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot through the tunnel. VARIOUS BUSBOYS
N: come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with dirty dishes and glasses. CART comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt. Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with soda water.
C: MALE AIDE
D: pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort Fallow through the area. A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS
N: pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture. The guards push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor. FOREIGN DIPLOMAT and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a book to autograph. Fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the breasts of the diplomat's daughter. The guards pull him into the elevator. )T( BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES - Rev. 5/25/90 3. * A11B CONTINUED: (2) A11B CART OF FOOD is in the elevator -- a tray of salmon mousse in the shape of a three-foot salmon.

C: SHERMAN
D: I am taking the dog for a walk.
C: JUDY
D: You are not taking the dog for a walk. You are taking 'Marshall' for a walk. Marshall has a name. He is one of our family. And, anyway, it's raining.
C: SHERMAN
D: I know that. The DOG GROWLS and snaps at Sherman.
C: JUDY
D: So does Marshall. I don't think he wants to go. Do you, Marshall? *
C: SHERMAN
D: Judy...
C: JUDY
D: Alright. Alright. Sherman gets the leash fastened. He stands up, pulls on a rubberized British riding mac. Judy flicks a tiny plastic bag out of a cleverly-concealed container and hands it to Sherman.
C: JUDY
D: Have a nice time.
N: 15A INT. McCOY APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - SHERMAN - NIGHT 15A pulls Marshall out of the elevator. MARSHALL SQUEALS and drags his nails across the lobby, trying desperately to avoid this walk.

C: POLLARD
D: Hello, Sherman.
C: SHERMAN
D: Good evening, Pollard.
C: POLLARD
D: You know it's raining, don't you?

C: SHERMAN
D: Pollard, you old phrase-maker.
C: POLLARD
D: I beg your pardon.
C: SHERMAN
D: I mean, is that the best you can do? Is that as witty as we get?
N: As Pollard enters the building and Sherman drags Marshall away...
C: POLLARD
D: I don't know what you're talking about. And furthermore, if you plan on being wet when you return, I suggest you take the service elevator.

C: SHERMAN
D: Well, you were right. I got soaking wet and Marshall didn't do anything.
N: He heads for the bathroom, grabs a towel.
C: JUDY
D: Sherman, if you want to talk to somebody named Maria, why do you call me instead? Sherman pokes his head into the room.
C: SHERMAN
D: If I what? Whatever do you mean?
C: JUDY
D: Please don't lie. It makes your * forehead crinkle. *

C: JUDY
D: Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle. *
C: SHERMAN
D: I'm not lying. I took Marshal for a walk, and I come back in here and wham -- I mean I hardly know what to say. You're asking me to prove a negative proposition.
C: JUDY
D: 'Negative proposition'?! Oh, God, Sherman. Listen to the way I sound. Listen to the stress. Can * you hear it? I don't want to be * this person. I don't. I am thin. I am beautiful. I don't deserve this. She gets off the bike, grabs a robe and heads for the door.
C: SHERMAN
D: Judy...
C: JUDY
D: There's the phone. Why don't you just call her from here? I don't care. I really don't care. You are cheap and rotten and a liar, * and you are dripping on the * Aubusson carpet. * She goes. Sherman collapses in a chair. He looks at the phone.

N: gets out of the car. He leaves the door open. Above him, the tremendous CLANGING noise of CARS POUNDING along the expressway. But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone- liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined. ANGLE - TIRE as Sherman approaches. He tries to pick it up without getting his suit messed up. Suddenly...

D: No thanks. Hi. No, I don't think so. No. Thank you very much. Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman. Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket. He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes up finally.
C: SHERMAN
D: Excuse me. I have to go.

C: ROLAND
D: Where you going with that tire?
C: SHERMAN

D: Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss... JUDGE WHITE * I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale.

C: BACON
D: You got what he told his mother.
C: KRAMER
D: That's hearsay. You may believe it and I may believe it, but it's not admissable in a court of law.
C: BACON
D: If this boy was born on Park Avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a Pontiac Firebird, then you'd have a case! Wouldn't you?!

D: I work Park Avenue and I work Bruckner Boulevard, Reverend. There's good and bad in both places. Now we'll do everything we can for this lady. But we don't have a hell of a lot to go on.

N: MRS. McCOY (delighted) Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it. MR. McCOY Yes. Your mother and I really want to hear this, Sherman.

D: No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter.

D: Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money.
C: CAMPBELL
D: That's what he said. Bonds.
C: JUDY
D: Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs.
C: SHERMAN
D: Crumbs? Really...
N: MR. McCOY (pointedly) And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs.
C: JUDY
D: Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That's what Daddy does.

D: No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher.

C: PETER
D: You look like shit. And you smell, too.
C: SHERMAN
D: I think, when I was in the jail, I pissed in my pants.

D: They call me by my first name. Like they know me. Like they own me. Newspapers, lawyers, police, people I don't even know. How did I get to be so important?
C: PETER
D: You're not important. You're just dinner. You know what I mean? And a week from now, a month -- nobody is even going to remember what they ate.
N: The car stops. Sherman steps onto the platform. Peter remains in the car. Sherman looks back at him.
C: SHERMAN
D: I should have called the police right away, when it happened. But I couldn't you see? It wasn't really my decision.

C: SHERMAN
D: Well, that's very kind of you.

D: No, really, anything I can do. With the apartment, is what I mean.
C: SHERMAN
D: The apartment?
C: SALLY
D: I find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon -- it's the celebrity appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn't come along every day. You have to ride the wave.

C: POLLARD
D: Sherman, we've known each other a long time. We went to Buckley together. My father knew your father. I speak as a friend. But also as president of the board. Is that a gun?
C: SHERMAN
D: I wonder if I can get both barrels into my mouth. That's what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe.
C: POLLARD
D: Yes. This can't be a comfortable situation for you.
C: SHERMAN
D: And where would I do it? Who would find me?

D: Well...

C: POLLARD
D: You are a shareholder in a cooperative. Look, we're not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature...
C: SHERMAN
D: Why don't you move out, Pollard? If you're so fucking terrified!
C: POLLARD
D: Sherman, please...
C: SHERMAN
D: And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now!
N: Sherman points the gun at Pollard.
C: POLLARD
D: I came here in good faith.
C: SHERMAN
D: Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room.
C: POLLARD
D: I will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations.
C: SHERMAN
D: Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up * your ass! Now march! * The guests applaud. Sherman turns to face them.

D: Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop! We're scared shitless. Panic. And we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened. And then it dawns on me. They think this is normal! He starts to laugh as he talks.
