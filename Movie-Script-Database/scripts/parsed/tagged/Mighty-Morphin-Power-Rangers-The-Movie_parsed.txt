WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer , etc., Construction Worker jackhammers solid rock. Drill makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!

S: 16 EXT. INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
N: Barricades and police tape surround the egg. A SECURITY GUARD passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature named MORDANT appear.
C: RITA
D: Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS! My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel. Why didn't I listen to her?!
N: Zedd grumbles to himself.
C: ZEDD
D: That's a good question.
N: The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.
C: FIRST SECURITY GUARD
D: Uh... Kurt... you might wanna take a look at this.
N: Kurt looks up groggily.
C: ZEDD
D: No need to wake him. In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself.
N: Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are knocked out. Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or Mordant's foot. Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.
C: MORDANT
D: Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!
N: Goldar is oblivious. Zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape.
C: ZEDD
D: After two thousand years of searching... I have finally found you.

C: MORDANT
D: Yo, earth to Bigfoot!
N: Goldar SWATS Mordant.

C: ZEDD
D: SILENCE!
N: RITA (to Goldar) Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?!
C: GOLDAR
D: Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side. He`s just visiting for the summer.
C: RITA
D: Well put a muzzle on him!
N: Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath. Meanwhile, Zedd aims is staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy. The egg opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air. webs of ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE. When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT OOZE. The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in o the sticky substance.
C: RITA
D: What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT!
N: As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS. Zedd and Rita are too busy arguing to notice this.
C: ZEDD
D: Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
C: RITA
D: Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
N: We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE. Mordant tugs at Zedd.
C: MORDANT
D: Boss.
C: ZEDD
D: For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot !
C: RITA
D: You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?!
C: MORDANT
D: Boss.
C: ZEDD
D: WHAT!
N: Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of GLISTENING SILVER. He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts his hands on his head, CRACKS it.
C: IVAN
D: Ahhhhhhhh.
N: Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically and gives his trademark stance.
C: IVAN
D: Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE is back!!
N: Rita blushes.
C: RITA
D: He's so cute.
N: Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.
C: ZEDD
D: I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent. It is a supreme honor to finally meet you.
N: Ivan gives a slight bow.
C: IVAN
D: How can I ever repay you?
C: ZEDD
D: Do you recall the name... Zordon of Eltare?
N: Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. Mordant turns to Goldar.
C: MORDANT
D: Seems to ring a bell.
C: ZEDD
D: I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil may once again reign SUPREME.
N: IVAN (hissing) I will not only destroy him, I will OBLITERATE his entire being. It will be like Zordon of Eltare never EXISTED!
C: RITA
D: Finally, a real man.
N: Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper.
C: GOLDAR
D: Here's his address.
N: IVAN (reading) "... left off Interstate 12?!" (puzzled) What's an "interstate"?
C: MORDANT
D: It's like a freeway. How long have you been locked up? !
C: ZEDD
D: We shall leave you to weave your wicked ways.
C: RITA
D: Now we go out on the town. First dinner, then dancing, then --

N: 17 OMITTED
S: 18 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
N: On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site. They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora of building supplies. Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's standing in.
C: BILLY
D: Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations.
N: They survey the construction site for a moment.
C: AISHA
D: Anybody see anything?
C: TOMMY
D: ... Let's take a look over there.
N: They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view. ROCKY (alarmed) It looks like it's been opened! The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with fascination. Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.
C: SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}
D: Hey!
N: They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard. He half smiles, shaking his head.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: You had me scared there.
C: AISHA
D: Makes two of us.
C: KIMBERLY
D: You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around?

D: Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years.
C: KIMBERLY

C: TOMMY
D: We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!
N: Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.
C: IVAN
D: Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?.
N: He looks them over reproachfully.
C: IVAN
D: Power Rangers, huh? So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work. And speaking of rats...
N: Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS. Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN SIZED RAT-BEASTS.
C: IVAN
D: From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST!
N: Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SKY.

S: 19 INT. COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
N: SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control panels VIBRATE.
C: ZORDON
D: Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late! Ivan is on his way here!
N: ALPHA 5 Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near the entrance. Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through the hairline cracks in the door. ALPHA 5 Well... ALMOST nobody. The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again IVAN RISES UP. He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.
C: IVAN
D: Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy. I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice.
N: Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES then LUNGES. ALPHA 5 HI , YAH ! Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge Alpha starts spinning. ALPHA 5 Welcome to Wiener World. May I take your order, please?
C: ZORDON
D: You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
N: Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns with him.
C: IVAN
D: Put a cork in it "Z" . Ten minutes out of the egg and I'm already listening to one of your lectures.
N: (he explodes furiously) You robbed me of my PRIME! I was the Supreme Ruler of the most foul Empire in the Universe. I was the King of Calamity. The Duke of Destruction. The big man on campus! (beat) And then you came along. You locked me into your stuffy little hyperlock-chamber and tossed me into the depths like yesterdays TRASH!
C: ZORDON
D: It worked for six thousand years.
C: IVAN
D: Don't remind me!
C: IVAN
D: Do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years? It's BORING! Not to mention I've had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance! But now the tables are turned. Now...
N: IVAN raises his hands - he is holding a flute and he PLAYS A FEW NOTES
C: IVAN
D: ... it's time to pay the PIPER!
N: He uses the flute like a lightning rod -- A BOLT OF LIGHTNING BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.
C: IVAN
D: Oh, the things that I have missed. The BLACK PLAGUE!
N: He blows up another PANEL. IVAN The SPANISH INQUISITION! (another bolt) The 70's! HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL. Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT, DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR.
C: IVAN
D: And now, finally, I have the strength to DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!!
C: ZORDON
D: YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!
C: IVAN
D: I've got a NEWS flash for you LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!
N: Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING THE COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE. Ivan laughs in the b.g. as Alpha continues to spin, moving his arms in and out. ALPHA 5 You put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about. You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around...
S: 20 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
N: Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH into each other. Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another rat. Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it ROLLS INTO A COUPLE OF RATS, BOWLING THEM OVER. One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to the ground. Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a face.

D: Not the brightest of beasts.
N: Rocky is now up in the scaffolding. He DROPS TEN FEET through the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD. There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR. Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.
C: SABA
D: Na na na na na!
N: The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked area. There's a large power cable running across it. Once all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS. The water SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.
C: SABA
D: Fried mice, anyone?
N: We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING. Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and they appear back in civilian clothes.
C: KIMBERLY
D: What's going on?!
N: Billy tries his wrist communicator.
C: BILLY
D: Alpha, come in!
N: There's no response.
C: TOMMY
D: We'd better get back.
N: They all hit their communicators and nothing happens. AISHA (worried) Something's wrong!
C: TOMMY
D: Come on, guys...
N: They hurry off.
S: EXT. COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
N: The Rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed. Up ahead, there's a PILLAR OF BLACK SMOKE rising from the Command Center.
S: INT. COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
N: The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged panels, exposed wires and mechanisms. The kids move through the wreckage in numb silence. TOMMY (barely audible) ... what happened here?... Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.
C: ADAM
D: Guys!
N: The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.
C: BILLY
D: Alpha, are you okay?!
N: ALPHA 5 I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!!
C: BILLY
D: He must've blown an anitromic demodulator!
N: KIMBERLY (stunned) Oh, no... Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them. Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon. He is still a SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty years. The kids stand over him, forlorn.
C: AISHA
D: ... What's happening to him?'
C: BILLY
D: Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
C: KIMBERLY
D: We have to help him!
N: Zordon opens his eyes.
C: ZORDON
D: ... Rangers... thank goodness you're safe.
N: The kids drop down beside him.
C: TOMMY
D: We have to get you back inside your time warp.
C: ZORDON
D: I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons... all of it. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more.
E: beat
N: The kids are stunned. Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to us all.-
C: ZORDON
D: ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once... and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through.
N: Zordon closes his eyes. Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's shoulder. The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent. Billy turns to Alpha.
C: BILLY
D: what're we going to do?
N: ALPHA 5 I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment. Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze. ALPHA 5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be. He SNIFFS. ALPHA 5 Thanks, Billy. Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.
C: ADAM
D: There has to be something we can do.
C: TOMMY
D: Come on, guys, think!
N: Aisha turns to Alpha.
C: AISHA
D: Alpha. Is there any way we can defeat this monster? Any way at all?
N: ALPHA 5 ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
C: ADAM
D: What?!
N: ALPHA 5 ... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension.
C: TOMMY
D: How can we get to it?
N: ALPHA 5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain.
C: ROCKY
D: We have to try, Alpha. It's our only hope.
N: Alpha shakes his head. ALPHA 5 It's far too dangerous. Zordon would never allow it.
C: AISHA
D: If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
C: ADAM
D: If Ivan Ooze isn't stopped, nobody will survive.
N: Alpha heaves a sigh. ALPHA 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi. (beat) The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
C: AISHA
D: How can we reach Phaedos?
N: Alpha heaves a SIGH. ALPHA 5 Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this! The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY. ALPHA 5 This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions. It should be enough to get -you there. He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile. ALPHA 5 There is one problem. I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos... I can't bring you back.
C: ADAM
D: So how do we get back?
N: Alpha gives them a grim look. ALPHA 5 ... You'll have to pray that the legends are true. Alpha keys in coordinates. ALPHA 5 You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks.
C: TOMMY
D: It's our only hope.
N: Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.
C: ALPHA
D: Safe journey, Rangers!
N: He pulls a lever. ALPHA 5 BE CAREFUL!! The kids TRANSFORM INTO SIX STREAKS OF COLOR AND BLAST 0FF THROUGH THE CEILING. Alpha shakes his head in despair. ALPHA 5 Ay, yi, yi, yi. They're DOOMED!! 23 thru 27 OMITTED

N: Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants. RITA (outraged) How could he let them slip through his hands?! He's no better than the rest of the hired help around here! Goldar looks up from the telescope.

N: He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE. Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling open. Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!! Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.
C: RITA
D: This is all your fault! If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened.
N: Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant.
C: IVAN
D: Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs.
N: Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.
C: GOLDAR
D: We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
C: MORDANT
D: Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to mention...
N: Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him. GOLDAR (apologetic) He's just visiting for the summer. (beat) Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one?

N: Ivan shakes his head.
C: IVAN
D: No need. I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove.
N: GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.
C: GOLDAR
D: No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
C: IVAN
D: Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry. I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

C: TOMMY
D: Hey.
N: Kimberly glances up.
C: TOMMY
D: You okay?
N: Kimberly takes a moment to answer.
C: KIMBERLY
D: I was just thinking about Zordon... everything we've been through together.

He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle. He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE OUTSIDE, a REVERSE HANDSWORD and so on.

We're talking B-U-I-L-T. Meet the Master warrior, DULCEA. The Rangers stand there with stunned expressions. Dulcea looks to Tommy.

DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner that reads: "FREE OOZE!" Some kids STRETCH the ooze, others MOLD it, others THROW it at each other. It's an ooze free-for-all.

N: Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger.
C: DULCEA
D: It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
C: BILLY
D: Where did it originate?
C: DULCEA
D: In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
E: ominous
N: Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.
C: AISHA
D: So how can we get to it?
C: DULCEA
D: The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
C: TOMMY
D: And how do we do that?

E: beat
C: ROCKY
D: Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live. And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack. We don't have TIME for this.
N: As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way over Kimberly's shoulder. She hasn't noticed it yet.
C: DULCEA
D: You don't understand. If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy you. To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle. We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow.
E: beat
N: The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she SCREAMS FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH. INCLUDE - A TERRIFIED SNOGGLE. This is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant. He jumps up and down, YAMMERING and GESTICULATING.

D: The crane maintains it's agility through the perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit.
N: She leaps into the air, does a ROUND-HOUSE KICK, lands perfectly on the narrow span.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Awesome!
N: Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands flawlessly on the ground. Kimberly heaves a sigh, climbs onto the bamboo and start walking across, balancing precariously on her hands. She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and falls into the shallow pond. Snoggle laughs, making a loud HONKING SOUND. Kimberly recovers, shoots him a look.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Let's see you do it .

N: Dulcea now SCRAMBLES UP THE POLE WITH THE NIMBLENESS OF A SPIDER. In less than ten seconds she reaches the top. Rocky shakes his head in disbelief.
C: ROCKY
D: Who is this lady?
N: Now she SLIDES DOWN like a firewoman, drops beside Rocky. He takes hold of the pole, focuses for a moment.
C: ROCKY

S: 54A EXT. DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY (OLD SC 53) 54A
N: Dulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning WHISTLING sticks. Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't.

N: Dulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING INSECTS.
C: DULCEA
D: The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye.
N: We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect dart around her. THWAP! The TRILLING SOUND is gone. Dulcea has literally caught the insect in the blink of an eye. Adam shakes his head in disbelief. He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a insect zip around him. He lashes out numerous times, missing the insect completely. THWUMP! With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his snout. CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH. Adam speaks under his breath.

N: Dulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of a dark lake.
C: DULCEA
D: The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it.
N: Now Dulcea does the impossible. She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding rock. Tommy is stunned. DULCEA (calling out) JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE! Tommy psyches himself up.

N: ALPHA 5 I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
C: ZORDON
D: ... We must try to communicate with them.
N: Alpha looks out over the decimated Command Center. ALPHA 5 Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes. Alpha watches over his mentor, shakes his head in anguish.

C: BILLY
D: I can hardly walk...
C: AISHA
D: I've never been this sore in my life.
N: They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING. They stare into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking disillusioned.
C: BILLY
D: Do you guys really think we can pull this off?
N: It takes a moment to get a response.
C: ADAM
D: Maybe if we had more time.
C: TOMMY
D: ... I wonder... We've been relying on our Morphin Powers for so long... maybe we've forgotten how to rely on ourselves.
N: There's a somber silence.

S: 55B EXT. INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT (OLD SC 47) 55B
N: A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site. Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from the vapors - We see Mr. Kelman amongst them. Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.
C: IVAN
D: Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says... STOP!
N: All the parents stop.
C: IVAN

S: 55C EXT. DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT 55C
N: The Rangers are fast asleep. A night wind WHISTLES through the trees, causing the branches to shiver. After a moment, there's movement in the bushes. Suddenly, amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE. He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy. He stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze. Billy stirs slightly. The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame. There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and lands on a rock directly above Tommy. The bird fixes on Tommy with its piercing eyes. We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS: Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from Adam. The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES. Aisha fidgets in her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER. Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT.

N: Mordant waves Ivan off.

C: IVAN
D: So they've been destroyed?
N: The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.

C: IVAN
D: Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
C: MORDANT
D: How'd you know?
C: IVAN
D: Dulcea! That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

N: To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.
C: IVAN
D: How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED!
N: One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.
C: MORDANT
D: What're you talking about?! It wasn't my fault! You're the featherbrains that let them get away!
N: Ivan looks up to the sky.
C: IVAN
D: I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold!
N: LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU, CAUSING THEM TO GLOW RADIANTLY.
C: IVAN
D: And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle!
N: He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU! She is a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED. Mordant shakes his head in wonder.
C: MORDANT
D: Where does he come up with this stuff?
N: The Queen spreads her wings and makes the most HORRENDOUS SCREECH imaginable.
C: IVAN
D: Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME DULCEA!
N: Once again, the Tengu take to the sky like GIANT BATS.

N: MONTAGE HARD DRIVING MUSIC KICKS IN. 1. We see Aisha standing on a rock, her whole body flowing in a martial art exercise. 2. Billy and Dulcea continue to fight with whistling sticks. Billy is starting to get the hang of it. He hits Dulcea a few times, then she CLOBBERS him. 3. Kimberly balances along the bamboo log again. She does a FLIP and lands it, however one foot slips off and she struggles to maintain her balance. 4. Tommy stands on the protruding rock again, spreads high like a falcon, SOARS THROUGH THE AIR. He gets about ten feet then DROPS INTO THE WATER. 5. Rocky climbs up the oriental pole -- this time he makes it up about FIFTEEN FEET before he slips. He only drops five feet. 6. Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog animal stance, his entire being focused on his actions. 7. Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling sticks. The weapons are now a BLURR in his hands. 8. Kimberly balances along the log, executes a FLIP, lands it perfectly, throws her arms up triumphantly. 9. Adam stands on the lakeshore, cncentrating on a buzzing insect. He strikes out at it, but just misses it. 10. Aisha also does something appropriate.

N: Dulcea reminisces.
C: DULCEA
D: We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan". Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today.

N: The kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing.
C: ROCKY
D: So... what happened?

C: DULCEA
D: He was always an inspiration...
N: Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity.
C: DULCEA
D: This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith. That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti. If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow.
E: beat
N: These words strike deep in the kids.
S: EXT. INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

C: DULCEA
D: I have taught you all that I know. Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own.
N: The kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say.

D: It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
C: BILLY

C: DULCEA
D: About twenty seconds in your time.
C: TOMMY

C: DULCEA
D: The legend goes that you release the power with the power.

S: 56 INT. CHEMICAL PLANT - DAY 66
N: The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and Scorpitron. We see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the skeletal feet -- the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze. Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical foot.
C: IVAN
D: Finally, after centuries of waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world!
N: Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.
C: IVAN
D: GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE!
N: Ivan SWATS Mordant and the camera FLIES up through the air and SMASHES against a wall.
C: MORDANT
D: Oh, man, that was a rental!
N: ANGLE ON - FRED watching from behind a generator, an alarmed look on his face. Ivan steps up onto a platform.
C: IVAN
D: Mordant... let the ooze flow!
N: Mordant pulls a lever and the OOZE SLITHERS THROUGH THE PIPES AND STARTS FILLING OUT THE GIANT EXOSKELETONS.
C: IVAN
D: Goldar... the roof!
N: Goldar presses a button and the roof of the plant ROLLS OPEN, REVEALING THE TUMULTUOUS SKIES ABOVE.
C: IVAN
D: Looks like a fine day for raising HELL!
N: Ivan holds his arms up to the heavens.
C: IVAN
D: HECALE MENNIPUS LIBRI MAGUS!

N: ELECTROMAGNETIC CHARGES TRAVEL THE LENGTH OF THE CABLES AND HIT HORNITOR AND SCORPITRON WITH SEARING BLASTS OF ENERGY.
C: IVAN
D: LIFE!! Give my creatures LIFE!
N: Mordant admires Ivan.
C: MORDANT
D: This guy is the King!
N: Now the most amazing thing of all happens... The SCINTILLATING BEHEMOTHS AWAKE FROM THE DEAD, THEIR EYES AND MOUTHS OPENING, THEIR ARMS REACHING UPWARD. The beasts ROAR OUT IN THUNDEROUS RAGE. Mordant's HAIR LITERALLY STANDS ON END -- he quickly retreats behind a drum. FRED looks on in horror.
C: IVAN
D: PARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE.
N: All of them turn their attention to Ivan.
C: IVAN
D: YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE. NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TO YOUR DEMISE!
N: The parents just stand there with blank expressions.
C: IVAN
D: What're you waiting for??...
N: Goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around.
C: IVAN
D: What!
C: GOLDAR
D: You forgot to say 'Simon says."
N: Ivan shakes his head dismally.
S: EXT. ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
N: The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly drops down - the others following suit. They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide. Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing. The ocean RAGES BELOW. On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith. It's a mind- boggling wonder from another time and place. Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on patrol.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Man, these are the last guys I wanted to see.
C: AISHA
D: Whadda we do now?
N: Kimberly surveys the area.
C: BILLY
D: That's the only way to the Monolith...
C: ROCKY
D: We can take these guys!
N: Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.
S: EXT. ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
N: The Tengu are on full alert. One of them hears something, snaps around, there's nothing there. Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg. He SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the creature by inches. We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon circling in the sky above. The Queen is perched on top of a 20 foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly. Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls. Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts. The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES before Tommy. Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back on to the rickety bridge. The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.
C: ROCKY
D: LOOK OUT!
N: Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt. Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.
C: ADAM
D: The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out...
N: Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR. We didn't even see Adam move.
C: ADAM
D: ... in the blink of an eye.
N: Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.
C: TOMMY
D: Yo, Tweety!
N: The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING- HEEL KICK. A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear stance.
C: AISHA
D: The bear is sturdy as a towering tree. Nothing can uproot it.
N: The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA. She holds fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.
C: AISHA
D: Bye, bye birdy.
N: Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe. She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE. In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge.
C: KIMBERLY
D: Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!
N: Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak -- the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!
C: BILLY
D: AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS!
N: Tommy reaches the top of a rack. He sees a Tengu making a KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY. TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER. They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.

The Rangers look to each other, horrified. Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle happens. We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS UP, REVEALING THE MOST GLORIOUS SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE.
