M: March 16, 1994
T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)
N: A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...
S: EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY
N: A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky. As we move towards them, we begin to hear their conversation...and we can see that the two men are SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.
C: CHEKOV
D: There he is -- there, to the South!
E: points to sky
C: SCOTTY
D: What are ye, blind? That's a bird.
E: peers upward
N: As they stare up at the sky...
S: EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)
N: The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it is tumbling directly toward the camera...
S: EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY
N: As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.
C: SCOTTY
D: Repelling the Crystalline Trench... rafting down lava flows... orbital skydiving. it's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy.
E: concerned
N: Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.
C: CHEKOV
D: That should be him now. I think he's just crossed the sound barrier.
E: re: sound
N: They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.
S: EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)
N: The bottle gets CLOSER...
S: EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY
N: A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller-coaster.
C: KIRK
D: Right on target! I jump out over the Arabian Peninsula... and I end up here, right on the dime.
N: Kirk gets to his feet.
C: CHEKOV
D: Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters... That way.
E: points
C: KIRK
D: Thanks for pointing that out.
N: Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back.
C: KIRK
D: Oh...
C: SCOTTY
D: I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
N: Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness.
S: 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 6A
N: The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...
S: 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6B
N: Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.
C: KIRK
D: Tomorrow I want to make a tri- elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry...
C: CHEKOV
D: Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
N: This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face.
C: KIRK
D: I'm not going. Scotty, help me with this chute.
E: beat
C: SCOTTY
D: What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
C: KIRK
D: When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
C: CHEKOV
D: Captain...
C: KIRK
D: I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
E: firm
S: EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)
N: The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its dock in orbit around Earth.
S: 7A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7A
N: FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW A large picture window overlooking the starship in its berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but we hear nothing).
S: 8A INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A
N: The people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out over the ship in its berth.
S: 8B EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B
N: The great ship sits in spacedock.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL - that the bright light is coming from a futuristic CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated with the camera, the others using PADDS to make notations. Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the Bridge.
C: JOURNALISTS
D: Captain Kirk, how does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge... Captain, can I have a Minute... Captain Scott, do you have any comment on... Commander Chekov... etc.
E: overlapping
N: CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Excuse me, excuse me...there will be plenty of time for questions later...
N: The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to get a good angle.
C: HARRIMAN
D: I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
E: continuing, to all
C: KIRK
D: It's our pleasure.
N: Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his first command and he takes it very seriously.
C: HARRIMAN
D: I just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage. I remember reading about your missions when I was in grade school.
E: beat
N: The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off.
C: KIRK
D: Well... may we have a look around?
C: HARRIMAN
D: Please... please.
N: Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her.
C: CHEKOV
D: Demora!
N: Chekov moves off.
C: JOURNALIST
D: So, Captain... this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about that?
E: breezy
N: The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
C: KIRK
D: Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way...
N: He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs him.
C: JOURNALIST
D: What have you been doing since you retired?
C: KIRK
D: I've been... keeping busy.
N: At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid- twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.
C: CHEKOV
D: Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you to meet the Helmsman of the Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu -- Captain James Kirk.
E: to Kirk
C: DEMORA
D: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some... interesting stories about you.
N: Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement.
C: KIRK
D: Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your father?
C: DEMORA
D: Yes, sir.
C: CHEKOV
D: You met her once before, but she was...
N: Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height.
C: KIRK
D: But that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than...
C: CHEKOV
D: Twelve years, sir.
C: KIRK
D: Yes... well... congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
C: DEMORA
D: Thank you, sir. Let me show you the new inertial guidance system.
E: to Chekov
N: Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat. The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... Something is clearly bothering him. Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.
C: SCOTTY
D: Damn fine ship if you ask me...
E: to Kirk
N: But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as she moves to the Helmsman's position.
C: KIRK
D: You know, Scotty... it amazes me.
C: SCOTTY
D: And what would that be, sir?
C: KIRK
D: Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
C: SCOTTY
D: It's like you always said -- if something's important enough, you make the time.
N: Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...
C: SCOTTY
D: So... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old. Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?
N: Kirk gives him a look.
C: KIRK
D: With that kind of tact, I'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist.
N: Harriman interrupts.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll take your seats.
C: KIRK
D: Oh... of course.
N: NEW ANGLE Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged to one side. Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping. Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
E: to all beat
C: KIRK
D: No... no. Thank you.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Please, I insist.
N: All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.
C: KIRK
D: Take us out.
E: to all
N: Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in
T: acute embarrassment and annoyance.
C: CHEKOV
D: Very good, sir.
E: sotto
C: SCOTTY
D: Brought a tear to my eye.
E: sotto
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Well... we've just cleared the asteroid belt. Our course will take us out beyond Pluto and then back to spacedock. Just a quick run around the block. If we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp --
E: beat
N: Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.
C: COM OFFICER
D: We're picking up a distress call, Captain.
E: to Harriman
N: This grabs everyone's attention.
C: HARRIMAN
D: On speakers.
N: We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent.
C: COM VOICE
D: This is the transport ship Lakul. We're caught in some kind of energy distortion. We can't break free... need immediate help... It' tearing us --
E: fritzed
N: The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE OFFICER checks something on his console. The Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and pans it around to capture the action.
C: SCIENCE OFFICER
D: The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.
N: Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this unexpected turn of events. Kirk watches him intently. Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Can you locate them?
C: DEMORA
D: The ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five. Distance: Three light years.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue... We don't even have a full crew aboard.
N: The NAVIGATOR checks his console.
C: NAVIGATOR
D: We're the only one in range, sir.
N: The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Well, then... I guess it's up to us. Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp.
E: to Demora
N: Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him a side-long glance.
C: SCOTTY
D: Is there something wrong with your chair, Captain?
N: Kirk gives him a look.
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: The ship snaps into warp.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.
C: DEMORA
D: We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
C: HARRIMAN
D: On screen.
N: INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY directly ahead of the Enterprise-B. Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.
C: CHEKOV
D: What the hell is that?
C: DEMORA
D: I've found the transport ships.
E: off console
N: 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15A The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.
C: DEMORA
D: Their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress -- they won't survive much longer.
E: cont'd
N: The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his console.
C: NAVIGATOR
D: We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon.
C: HARRIMAN
D: We'll have to keep our distance... we don't want to get pulled in too...
N: Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --
C: KIRK
D: Tractor beam...
N: Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up. Harriman glances at Kirk.
C: HARRIMAN
D: We don't have a tractor beam.
C: KIRK
D: You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
C: HARRIMAN
D: It won't be installed until Tuesday. Ensign Sulu... try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
E: beat
C: DEMORA
D: Aye, sir.
N: When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows that won't work.
C: DEMORA
D: There's too much quantum interference, Captain.
E: continuing; shakes her head
N: Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair -- but he restrains himself.
C: HARRIMAN
D: What about... venting plasma from the warp nacelles? That might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.
C: NAVIGATOR
D: Aye, sir.. releasing drive plasma...
N: A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action.
C: NAVIGATOR
D: It's not having any effect, sir. I think --
E: continuing
C: DEMORA
D: Sir! The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing --
N: 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15B Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.
C: CHEKOV
D: How many people were aboard that ship?
C: DEMORA
D: Two hundred sixty-five.
N: Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do next.
C: DEMORA
D: The Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir.
E: urgent
N: Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Captain Kirk... I would appreciate any... suggestions you might have.
N: Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. He moves down to stand next to Harriman.
C: KIRK
D: First -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the Enterprise.
E: sotto
N: Harriman looks at him with surprise.
C: HARRIMAN
D: What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart...
C: KIRK
D: Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
E: gently
N: Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Helm, close to within transporter range.
N: Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the light on them all.
C: KIRK
D: And second -- turn that damned thing off.
N: The cameraman turns OFF the light.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: As before.
C: DEMORA
D: We're within range, sir.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Beam them directly to Sickbay.
E: to lieutenant
C: CHEKOV
D: How big's your medical staff?
E: concerned
C: HARRIMAN
D: The medical staff... doesn't arrive until Tuesday.
E: embarrassed
N: Chekov turns to the two journalists.
C: CHEKOV
D: You and you. You've just become nurses. Let's go.
N: Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
C: DEMORA
D: Main Engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays.
C: SCOTTY
D: By-pass the relays and go to auxiliary systems.
N: The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.
C: LIEUTENANT
D: Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them. They appear to be... in some sort of... temporal flux.
N: Kirk turns to Scotty.
C: KIRK
D: Scotty?
N: Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter console.
C: SCOTTY
D: What the hell...
N: Kirk moves to him.
C: SCOTTY
D: Their life signs are... are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
C: KIRK
D: Phasing? To where?
N: Scotty begins to work.
C: NAVIGATOR
D: Sir! Their hull's collapsing!
S: EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I)
N: The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: All eyes on Scotty.
C: SCOTTY
D: I got forty-seven of them... ... out of one hundred fifty.
E: beat, grim
N: Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off. BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty quickly takes over the dead man's console.
C: KIRK
D: Report!
C: DEMORA
D: We're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon.
C: HARRIMAN
D: All engines, full reverse!
S: EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)
N: The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the ribbon, lashing against the ship.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY
N: The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN race -- humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. Chekov has a tricorder.
C: SURVIVORS
D: The colors are touching me... I'm caught in the glass... Help me... I can see the seconds... Over here... etc
E: incoherent, overlapping
C: CHEKOV
D: It will be all right. We're going to take care of you.
N: He looks at the tricorder.
C: CHEKOV
D: Only minor injuries so far... But it looks like they're all suffering from some kind of neural shock.
E: off tricorder beat
N: One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.) The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are suddenly wild, crazed.
C: SORAN
D: Why...why?
C: JOURNALIST
D: It's all right... you're safe... you're on the Enterprise.
C: SORAN
D: No... I have to go... I have to get back... You don't understand! Let me go!
N: Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.
C: JOURNALIST
D: What was he talking about?
N: Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her before she falls.
C: CHEKOV
D: Easy there...
N: The woman turns around and we see her face for the first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.
C: CHEKOV
D: It's going to be okay. Here, just lie down.
N: As he guides Guinan onto a table...
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I)
N: Energy ribbon on viewscreen.
C: DEMORA
D: Inertial dampers failing.
C: SCOTTY
D: Engines not responding!
N: Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one hand. His face pales.
C: HARRIMAN
D: I didn't expect to die my first day on the job.
E: quiet
N: Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.
C: KIRK
D: The first thing you learn as Captain is how to cheat death. Scotty?
E: sotto beat, then louder
C: SCOTTY
D: There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
E: outraged
C: DEMORA
D: Hull integrity failing.
N: Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.
C: SCOTTY
D: But I do have a theory...
E: continuing
C: KIRK
D: I thought you might.
C: SCOTTY
D: An anti-matter discharge directly ahead... it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
C: KIRK
D: A photon torpedo?
C: SCOTTY
D: Aye.
C: KIRK
D: Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
E: quickly, to Demora
N: Demora turns to him.
C: DEMORA
D: Captain... we don't have any torpedoes.
N: Kirk glances at Harriman.
C: KIRK
D: Don't tell me... Tuesday.
N: Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets worse.
C: SCOTTY
D: Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
C: KIRK
D: Where are the deflector relays?
E: onto the idea
C: DEMORA
D: Deck fifteen, section twenty-one alpha
C: HARRIMAN
D: I'll go. You have the Bridge.
E: to Kirk
N: Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.
C: KIRK
D: No... a Captain's place is on the Bridge of his ship. I'll take care of it.
E: beat
N: Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the turbolift.
C: KIRK
D: Keep her together until I get back.
E: on the move, to Scotty
C: SCOTTY
D: I always do.
E: matter of fact
N: Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR
N: Kirk running down the corridor, opens a door.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS)
N: A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: As before. The ship is SHAKING badly.
C: DEMORA
D: Forty-five seconds to structural collapse!
N: Scotty is working the consoles frantically.
C: SCOTTY
D: Bridge to Captain Kirk.
T: INTERCUT:
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM
N: Kirk working furiously.
C: KIRK
D: Kirk here.
C: SCOTTY
D: Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
N: Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.
C: KIRK
D: That's it. Go!
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: As before.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Activate main deflector.
E: to Demora
N: Demora works the console.
S: EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which roils and fluctuates in response.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: As before.
C: SCOTTY
D: We're breaking free.
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
N: The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off their feet. Gradually, the SHAKING STOPS. Demora scrambles back into position.
C: DEMORA
D: We're clear.
N: Everyone reacts with relief.
C: HARRIMAN
D: You did it, Kirk! Damage report, Ensign.
E: excited, to com to Demora
C: DEMORA
D: There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle... We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
E: off console reacts
C: SCOTTY
D: Where?
C: DEMORA
D: Sections twenty through twenty- eight on decks thirteen... fourteen... ... and fifteen.
E: looks at Scotty with meaning
N: Everyone turns around and looks at Scotty.
C: SCOTTY
D: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk, please respond.
E: to com beat
N: Still no response. Scotty's face falls.
C: SCOTTY
D: Have Chekov meet me on deck fifteen.
E: continuing, to Demora
N: Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty. They EXIT to the Turbolift.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR
N: Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round a bend... and then stop short. They react to something ahead of them... NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE can be seen beyond the twisted metal. A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of space at bay. Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind them. He stops and reacts.
C: CHEKOV
D: My God... Was anyone in there?
E: beat
N: A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.
C: SCOTTY
D: Aye.
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov, and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small Corridor, looking out into space...
S: INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE
N: A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.
C: DEMORA
D: I've checked the entire ship and the surrounding space. there's no sign of him.
N: A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this terrible truth.
C: SCOTTY
D: Just a quick... run around the block.
E: quiet
C: CHEKOV
D: I never thought it would end like this...
C: SCOTTY
D: All things must end, Mr. Chekov.
N: Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.
C: HARRIMAN
D: Let's go home.
N: Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes command of his ship. Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone very dear to them both...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
N: The crippled ship turns and heads away...
T: FADE TO BLACK.
N: SUPER: SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER... CLOSE ON A HALYARD as a FLAG is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast. The flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind -- the blue and white banner of the United Federation of Planets waves in the breeze. MOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION
S: EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY
N: A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters. ON THE MAIN DECK Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at attention... the wind whistles through the rigging... the timbers creak... Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally he nods to Riker.
C: RIKER
D: Bring out the prisoner!
N: A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL. ON A HATCH as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at him closely.
C: PICARD
D: Mister Worf... I always knew this day would come. Are you prepared to face the charges?
N: Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.
C: TROI
D: Answer him!
C: WORF
D: I am prepared.
N: Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes Worf's shackles.
C: RIKER
D: "We, the officers and crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound mind and judgment, hereby make the following charges against Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions. Two. That he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years. And Three. Most seriously... that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew."
N: Riker puts away the scroll
C: PICARD
D: There can be only one punishment for such crimes... I hereby promote you to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, with all the rights and privileges thereto. And may God have mercy on your soul.
E: beat
N: Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and shakes his hand.
C: PICARD
D: Congratulations, Commander.
E: cont'd
C: WORF
D: Thank you, sir.
E: smiles
N: Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then Riker steps in.
C: RIKER
D: Extend the plank!!
N: Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is being pushed out over the water.
C: CREWMEMBERS
D: Into the sea with him... feed him to the sharks... walk the plank... etc.
N: Picard gives Riker a questioning look.
C: PICARD
D: Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
C: RIKER
D: When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
N: Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of tea, but he'll go along with it. Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike until Worf is nearly at the end. Worf finally stops and turns around.
C: WORF
D: WAIT!!
E: a shout
N: Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over the side at the water below.
C: WORF
D: I can't swim.
E: a little embarrassed
C: LA FORGE
D: The Holodeck safety program is engaged... The computer won't let you drown.
E: calmly, to Worf
C: BEVERLY
D: But the sharks are quite convincing.
N: Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE SEA with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS. Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail, looking a little confused at the reaction.
C: DATA
D: Doctor, I must confess I am uncertain as to why pushing someone into freezing, shark- infested water is amusing.
E: to Beverly
C: BEVERLY
D: It's all done in good fun, Data. Get in the spirit of things.
C: DATA
D: Ah.
N: Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one hand and hold her over the rail.
C: BEVERLY
D: Data...Data -- !
N: Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a little surprised.
C: GEORDI
D: Data. that wasn't funny.
N: Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's more confused than ever. PICARD AND RIKER are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly comes up on deck.
C: PICARD
D: Well, now that we're all aboard... Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there.
E: beat, then smiles savoring the moment
C: RIKER
D: Aye, aye, sir. Take the wheel, Commander.
E: to Troi
N: Troi takes the ship's wheel.
C: RIKER
D: All hands make sail! Raise up tacks and stand by the braces!
E: shouts
N: The crew springs into action... rushing to their places aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines... starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail. THRU OMITTED THRU PICARD AND RIKER Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great satisfaction and contentment.
C: PICARD
D: Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines... no computers... just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
C: RIKER
D: Bad food, brutal discipline... No women.
E: beat
N: But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's thoroughly enjoying himself.
C: COM VOICE
D: Bridge to Captain Picard.
C: PICARD
D: Picard here.
C: COM VOICE
D: There is a personal message for you from Earth.
C: PICARD
D: Put it through down here. But the best thing about a life at sea was that they couldn't get to you.
E: annoyed to Riker
N: Picard walks toward the bow.
C: PICARD
D: Computer, arch.
E: to com
N: 46A ANGLE (VFX-P) 46A A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship. Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the monitors and waits for the transmission to appear. 46B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 46B A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something on the screen. ON TROI whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch. She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.
C: TROI
D: Here. Take the wheel.
E: to crewmember
N: Troi moves toward the bow. ON PICARD (VFX-P) whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has just read something on the screen which is very disturbing. He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi moves to him.
C: TROI
D: Captain, are you all right?
E: quiet
C: PICARD
D: Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me...
N: He turns OFF the screen.
C: PICARD
D: Computer, exit.
N: 48A ANGLE (VFX-P) 48A The Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi looks after him with concern. NEW ANGLE Favoring Riker. He takes a couple of steps toward Worf.
C: RIKER
D: Set the royals and the studding sails, Mister Worf.
N: Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.
C: WORF
D: The Royal... studs...?
C: RIKER
D: You see the top yardarm, now look to the --
E: smiles, points aloft
N: Suddenly a com voice interrupts.
C: COM VOICE
D: Bridge to Commander Riker.
C: RIKER
D: Riker here.
C: COM VOICE
D: We're picking up a distress call from the Amargosa observatory, sir. They say they're under attack.
C: RIKER
D: Red Alert! All hands to Battle stations! Captain Picard to the Bridge.
E: to all
N: Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general rush to the bow of the ship...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-D (VFX-I)
N: The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g. a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)
S: INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)
N: Picard in command. Riker, Troi, Worf and Data at their stations They didn't have time to change, so they are all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.
C: RIKER
D: It looks like we're too late...
C: WORF
D: There are no other ships in the system.
E: off console
C: DATA
D: Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
C: RIKER
D: The station complement was nineteen.
N: A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern of his.
C: PICARD
D: Secure from Red Alert. Number One, begin an investigation. I'll be in my Ready Room.
N: Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.
C: RIKER
D: Sir?
C: PICARD
D: Make it so.
E: hard
N: Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the Captain? But they have their orders. As Riker and Worf head for the EXIT...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P)
N: The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear view of the room.
C: WORF
D: These blast patterns are consistent with type-three disruptors.
C: RIKER
D: Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
N: Beverly follows her tricorder readings.
C: BEVERLY
D: I'm picking up life signs... about twenty meters ahead.
C: WORF
D: That rules out Klingons.
N: Riker gives him a look.
C: WORF
D: They would not have left anyone alive.
C: BEVERLY
D: Over here.
N: They pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of her medical kit and begins to treat him.
C: RIKER
D: Worf, you're with me. Paskall, you and Mendez search the upper deck.
N: The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a collapsed bulkhead.
C: WORF
D: Under here...
N: They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the man's hand.
C: WORF
D: It's all right... do not struggle.
N: Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a few times, seems a little dazed.
C: RIKER
D: I'm Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
C: SORAN
D: Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...
N: Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his bearings.
C: RIKER
D: Who attacked you, Doctor?
C: SORAN
D: I'm not sure... it happened so fast...
C: SECURITY OFFICER
D: Commander -- you'd better take a look at this.
E: calls out
N: Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to scan Soran... NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.
C: WORF
D: Romulan.
N: Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DATA'S QUARTERS
N: Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT. Geordi is standing next to him.
C: DATA
D: Is she still angry?
C: GEORDI
D: No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
C: DATA
D: I was attempting to... get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
N: Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN, revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP which is suspended in a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.
C: GEORDI
D: Data... you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
C: DATA
D: It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
C: GEORDI
D: Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
C: DATA
D: That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human" - to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
E: re: chip
N: Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip... and reluctantly has to agree.
C: GEORDI
D: All right...
N: Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.
C: GEORDI
D: But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. agreed?
C: DATA
D: Agreed.
N: Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking circuitry within.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. READY ROOM
N: Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker finishes his report.
C: RIKER
D: We found two dead Romulans aboard the station. We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from.
N: Picard nods absently.
C: PICARD
D: There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
C: RIKER
D: We think they were looking for something -- they practically tore the place apart.
C: PICARD
D: Hmm... Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
E: beat
C: RIKER
D: You want me to contact Starfleet?
C: PICARD
D: Is there a problem?
C: RIKER
D: No, sir.
C: PICARD
D: Thank you, Number One.
N: Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. Riker hesitates, awkward.
C: RIKER
D: There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists. a Doctor Soran... has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
E: beat
C: PICARD
D: Understood. That will be all.
C: RIKER
D: Sir... is there anything wrong?
C: PICARD
D: No. Thank you.
N: A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's unreadable face...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TEN FORWARD
N: The room is bustling with patrons and activity. Data ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body language subtly altered. He is looking at the world through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely, watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan comes over -- she has not aged at all since the Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid.
C: GUINAN
D: You two just volunteered to be my first victims. This is a new concoction I picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, you're going to love it.
E: re: liquid
N: She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him closely. Data frowns.
C: GEORDI
D: Well...?
C: DATA
D: I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
C: GEORDI
D: Really? What do you feel?
C: DATA
D: I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions... I am unable to articulate the sensation.
C: GUINAN
D: Emotions?
C: GEORDI
D: I'll explain later...
N: Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one of disgust.
C: GUINAN
D: I don't think he likes it.
E: to Geordi
C: DATA
D: Yes. That is it. I hate it.
E: excited
C: GEORDI
D: Data, I think the chip is working...
N: Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.
C: DATA
D: Yes. I hate this! It is revolting!
N: Beat.
C: GUINAN
D: Another round?
C: DATA
D: Please.
N: In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward. FOLLOW PICARD as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the table.
C: PICARD
D: Doctor Soran...?
C: SORAN
D: Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming.
N: The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work. Picard waves away a waiter.
C: PICARD
D: Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
E: brusque, to Soran
C: SORAN
D: Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
N: Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him.
C: PICARD
D: Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then --
C: SORAN
D: The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
C: PICARD
D: We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
N: Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks.
C: SORAN
D: They say time is the fire in which we burn... and right now, Captain, my time is running out. We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- I'm sure you can understand.
E: cryptically beat
N: For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard. He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.
C: PICARD
D: I'll see what I can do...
N: Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees... SORAN'S POV of Guinan, who is now back at the bar. RESUME SORAN A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS. ON GUINAN she begins to sense something, as though someone is watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ENGINEERING
N: A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is talking to Riker. Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram of sensor information.
C: WORF
D: One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
C: RIKER
D: Trilithium?
C: WORF
D: An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
C: RIKER
D: Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
N: Riker considers.
C: RIKER
D: Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team... tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
E: cont'd
C: WORF
D: Aye, sir.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OBSERVATORY OPS
N: The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are scanning the room with tricorders.
C: GEORDI
D: There's no sign of any trilithium in here.
E: off tricorder
N: Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him. Data giggles louder.
C: DATA
D: I get it. I get it.
E: laughing, to himself
C: GEORDI
D: You get what?
N: Data laughs again.
C: DATA
D: When you said to Commander Riker... "The clown can stay, but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go."
E: imitating Geordi's voice
N: Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.
C: GEORDI
D: What?
C: DATA
D: During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punch line.
C: GEORDI
D: The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
C: DATA
D: I know. I just got it. It was very funny.
E: laughs
C: GEORDI
D: Thanks.
N: Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that direction...
S: INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
N: A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what appears to be a standard bulkhead.
C: GEORDI
D: Wait a minute... there's a hidden doorway here. I can see the joint of the metal with my VISOR.
N: Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what appears to be a smooth bulkhead.
C: DATA
D: There appears to be a dampening field in operation. I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead.
E: off tricorder
N: Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door.
C: GEORDI
D: I don't see a control panel...or an access port.
C: DATA
D: It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
E: off tricorder
N: Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.
C: DATA
D: I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo.
N: Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist over the door panel.
C: DATA
D: "Open sesame."
E: joking
N: There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The door slides open.
C: DATA
D: You could say I have a... magnetic personality.
E: smiles
N: Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT to.
S: INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: A small room with several probes stacked in holding racks. Geordi and Data scan.
C: GEORDI
D: I'm still not picking up anything. Someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room.
N: They put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to the side.
C: GEORDI
D: Data, take a look at this. You ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration?
E: Data comes over
N: Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth.
C: DATA
D: No, Geordi. I have not. It is most unusual.
E: making tricorder "talk"
N: Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian.
C: GEORDI
D: Just help me get this panel open.
N: Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi looks inside.he reacts to something.
C: GEORDI
D: Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up something in the theta band...it could be a trilithium signature.
N: Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in irritation.
C: GEORDI
D: Data, this isn't the time...
C: DATA
D: I am sorry... but I cannot stop myself... I think something is wrong...
E: laughing
N: 64A ANGLE (VFX-P) 64A Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre "emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops and he FALLS to the ground.
C: GEORDI
D: Data!
N: Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.
C: GEORDI
D: Data, are you all right?
C: DATA
D: I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
C: GEORDI
D: We better get you back to the Ship. La Forge to Enterprise.
E: hits combadge
N: There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we hear Soran's voice.
C: SORAN
D: Is there a problem, gentlemen?
N: INCLUDE SORAN standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.
C: GEORDI
D: Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter of fact, there is. There's a damping field in here blocking our com signal. Will you give me a hand?
E: re: Data
N: Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. Soran looks back at Geordi.
C: SORAN
D: I'd be happy to.
N: Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at Data, who suddenly looks fearful.
C: DATA
D: Please don't hurt me.

S: INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS
N: Picard is standing at the replicator.
C: PICARD
D: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
N: The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the same moment, the door CHIMES.
C: PICARD
D: Come.
N: Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right now, but he is polite as always.
C: PICARD
D: Counselor. What can I do for you?
C: TROI
D: Actually... I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
C: PICARD
D: Well... I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
N: But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.
C: TROI
D: I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's Counselor, it's my duty to --
C: PICARD
D: As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed... but also when you're not.
C: TROI
D: You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
N: Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone hardens.
C: PICARD
D: Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
C: TROI
D: Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. "Admiral Lusby... regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly Irritable... remote... and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to --"
E: beat
C: PICARD
D: All right, all right. You've made your point.
N: Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops. He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.
C: PICARD
D: The message I received... My brother... and his son -- my nephew -- burned to death in a fire.
E: beat
N: Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.
C: TROI
D: Captain, I'm sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.

D: It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies... But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
E: sensing more
C: PICARD
D: In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
N: Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches over and flips through the pages for a moment. There are many photos inside... from many periods in time including one of Picard's brother standing next to his young son. This is the Picard family album.
C: TROI
D: Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
C: PICARD
D: Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar... the Picard's that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
E: nods
N: Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.
C: TROI
D: ... You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
C: PICARD
D: My brother had shouldered that burden... allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs...
E: nods
C: TROI
D: There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life... your own career.
N: Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the matter.
C: PICARD
D: You know, Counselor... I'm not getting any younger. For some time now, I've been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind... But I always took comfort in the fact that when I was gone, my family would continue. But now...
E: beat
N: Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the last page, an then flips through the remaining pages -- they are blank.
C: PICARD
D: I've had brushes with death... more than I care to contemplate. I always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform. But now... the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it.
E: beat
N: He looks at her.
C: PICARD
D: I'm the last Picard.
N: A quiet beat as Troi considers him.
C: TROI
D: Captain, perhaps we --
N: Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT from outside the windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to the window and shield their eyes against the glare.
C: RIKER'S COM VOICE
D: Red Alert! All hands to duty stations!
T: CUT TO:
N: THRU OMITTED THRU
S: INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)
N: Picard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen, getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris is being ejected into space.
C: PICARD
D: Report.
C: RIKER
D: A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
C: PICARD
D: How is that possible?
C: WORF
D: Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
C: RIKER
D: The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
N: Something beeps on Worf's console.
C: WORF
D: Sir, the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave.
C: TROI
D: Level twelve? That'll destroy everything in this system.
E: shocked
C: TRANSPORTER COM VOICE
D: Transporter room to Bridge. I can't locate Commander La Forge or Mister Data, sir.
C: RIKER
D: Did they return to the ship?
E: to Worf
C: WORF
D: No, sir. They are not aboard.
E: works
C: PICARD
D: How long until the shock wave hits the observatory?
C: WORF
D: Four minutes, forty seconds.
N: Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the turbolift.
C: RIKER
D: Mister Worf.
N: Riker and Worf EXIT.
S: EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I)
N: The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of energy.
S: INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P)
N: Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined earlier is now gone.)
C: RIKER
D: What the hell's he doing?
E: to Worf
N: Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.
C: PICARD'S COM VOICE
D: Enterprise to Commander Riker, you have two minutes left.
C: RIKER
D: Soran, did you hear that? There's a level twelve shock wave coming. We've got to get out of here!
E: yells to Soran
N: Soran's only answer is another phaser blast. 71A OMITTED 71A

N: Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker suddenly notices something off-camera. 74A RIKER'S POV 74A Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in fear. 74B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 74B The firefight continues.
C: RIKER
D: Data! See if you can get to Geordi!
N: Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.
C: DATA
D: I... cannot, sir. I believe I Am... afraid.
N: Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in his hand.) Riker, Data and Worf react.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE
N: On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and patched in several places, obviously not a first-line model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. male Klingons man the various stations. The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in awe.
C: B'ETOR
D: Toh-pak-cha...
E: Glorious...
C: LURSA
D: HoS qorDu...
E: A great power...
N: Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he strides up to the sisters.
C: B'ETOR
D: You've done it, Soran.
E: excited, to Soran
N: But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons... but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.
C: B'ETOR
D: Wait!
N: She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.
C: B'ETOR
D: I hope for your sake that you are initiating a mating ritual.
C: SORAN
D: You got careless. The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium.
C: B'ETOR
D: Impossible. We left no survivors on their outpost.
N: B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.
C: SORAN
D: They knew it was aboard the observatory. If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it.
C: LURSA
D: But they didn't find it... and now we have a weapon of unlimited power.
C: SORAN
D: I have the weapon, Lursa. And if you ever want me to give it to you, I advise you to be a little more careful in the future.
N: B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to his throat.
C: B'ETOR
D: Perhaps we are tired of waiting.
N: Soran is unfazed by this threat.
C: SORAN
D: Without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the Klingon Empire.
N: Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife away.
C: SORAN
D: Set course for the Veridian system. Maximum warp.
C: LURSA
D: Bosh-ta-JaH Veridian
E: to Helm Set course for Veridian
N: A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.
C: KLINGON GUARD
D: What shall I do with this?
N: Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
C: SORAN
D: Bring him with me. I need some answers from Mr. La Forge.
N: Soran EXITS.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CORRIDOR
N: Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.
C: WORF
D: I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
C: RIKER
D: Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi... and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades... Why? What the hell's going on?
E: surprised
N: They EXIT to...
S: INT. SICKBAY
N: Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed, scanning himself with a tricorder.
C: RIKER
D: How is he?
C: BEVERLY
D: It looks like a power surge fused the emotional chip into his neural net.
C: WORF
D: Will that be a danger to him?
C: BEVERLY
D: I don't think so. The chip still seems to be working. I'd feel better if I could take a closer look, but I can't remove it without completely dismantling his cerebral conduit.
C: RIKER
D: Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
E: to Data
C: DATA
D: I am quite... preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
C: RIKER
D: We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
C: DATA
D: I hope so, sir.
N: Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly pulls Riker aside.
C: BEVERLY
D: Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's background.
N: Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of Doctor Soran along with some biographical information appears.
C: BEVERLY
D: He's an El-Aurian... over three hundred years old. He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world. Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul. The ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon, but Soran and forty-six others were rescued by the Enterprise-B.
C: RIKER
D: That was the mission where James Kirk was killed.
E: reacts
C: BEVERLY
D: I checked the passenger manifest of the Lakul... guess who else was on board?
N: She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS
N: Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.
C: GUINAN
D: Soran? That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
N: MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and subdued. Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well.
C: PICARD
D: Do you remember him?
C: GUINAN
D: Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul... every face. even the ones who didn't make it...
N: Guinan stands and begins to move about the room... she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates, looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments. Picard moves to her.
C: PICARD
D: Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon... a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to --
C: GUINAN
D: Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
C: PICARD
D: What's the "Nexus"?
N: Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.
C: GUINAN
D: It's a place I've tried very hard to forget...
N: She makes the decision to plunge ahead.
C: GUINAN
D: That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space... it's a doorway. It leads to another place... the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our Universe... and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
C: PICARD
D: What happened to you?
C: GUINAN
D: I can't remember very much... what it looked like or how long I was there... but I do remember how it felt...
N: She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory.
C: GUINAN
D: It was like being inside... joy. As if joy was a real thing that I could wrap around myself. I've never been so content...
N: A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.
C: PICARD
D: But then you were beamed away...
N: Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.
C: GUINAN
D: I was pulled away. I didn't want to leave; none of us did. I felt like I'd left a part of myself behind. All I could think about was getting back... I didn't care what I had to do.
N: Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.
C: GUINAN
D: It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me... I knew things about people... about events...about time...
E: beat
C: PICARD
D: Your "sixth sense"... I've always wondered where it came from... And what about Soran?
E: beat
C: GUINAN
D: Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
C: PICARD
D: But why destroy a star...? Thank you, Guinan.
E: beat
N: He heads for the door.
C: GUINAN
D: Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.
N: Picard stops, looks at her.
C: GUINAN
D: Let them send another starship. Don't get near the ribbon. If you go into that Nexus, you're not going to care about Soran or the Enterprise or me. All you're going to care about is how it feels to be there. And you're never going to come back.
E: beat
N: Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P)
N: A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has been removed. He looks very tense.
C: SORAN
D: A remarkable piece of equipment... but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say? Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more... normal?
E: re: VISOR beat
C: GEORDI
D: What's normal?
C: SORAN
D: Normal is what everyone else is... and what you are not.
C: GEORDI
D: What do you want?
N: Soran takes a moment.
C: SORAN
D: As you may or may not be aware, I am an El-Aurian. Some people call us a race of "listeners". We listen. Right now, Mr. La Forge, you have my undivided attention. I want to listen to everything you know about trilithium. and me.
E: beat
N: Geordi thinks.
C: GEORDI
D: Trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the Romulans. I think it's a derivative of --
N: Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the protrusion is suddenly gone.
C: SORAN
D: I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium... why?
C: GEORDI
D: I was ordered to by the Captain.
N: On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves. A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle of his chest.
C: SORAN
D: Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information, and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
E: beat
C: GEORDI
D: No.
C: SORAN
D: What about... Guinan? What has she told you about me?
C: GEORDI
D: Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about...
N: On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.
C: SORAN
D: My instincts tell me you're lying. And I know that can't be easy for you... I can see you have a good heart.
E: off PADD
N: Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps and starts to breathe.
C: SORAN
D: Oh... I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
E: smiles
C: GEORDI
D: Yeah... they're full of great ideas.
E: gasping
C: SORAN
D: I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
C: GEORDI
D: No... I didn't know that...
C: SORAN
D: We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
E: beat
C: GEORDI
D: I told you everything... you might as well just kill me right now...
N: Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.
C: SORAN
D: I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. Let's try thirty seconds.
E: beat
N: Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and strains against an unimaginable pain. Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover... sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick away...

S: INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P)
N: A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and computers which handle the enormous task of tracking the ship's position in space. The monitors around the room display various diagrams of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the film). Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data seems distracted and preoccupied.
C: DATA
D: According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty-nine point one years
C: PICARD
D: When is it expected back?
N: Data doesn't answer right away.
C: PICARD
D: Data?
C: DATA
D: Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
N: Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... tired... but determined to find out what's going on.
C: PICARD
D: Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
C: DATA
D: The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
C: PICARD
D: Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed... no matter how insignificant...
C: DATA
D: It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
N: Data works the computer and then the computer begins to work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his hands. Picard finally has to say something.
C: PICARD
D: Data, are you all right?
C: DATA
D: No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate... I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of... remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
C: PICARD
D: What do you mean?
C: DATA
D: I wanted to save Geordi... I tried. but I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear.
E: beat
N: Picard regards him sympathetically.
C: PICARD
D: Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
C: DATA
D: But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward?
E: beat
C: PICARD
D: No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience... guilt.
C: DATA
D: Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
E: considers
N: 84A ANGLE (VFX-P) 84A The computer finishes its calculations and the console BEEPS. Data works the console. Information appears on screen.
C: DATA
D: According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by five percent... the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction... a research project on Gorik Four was halted due to increased neutrino particles... ambient magnetic fields have decreased by --
C: PICARD
D: Wait. The Bozeman... why did it change course?
C: DATA
D: The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
E: matter of fact
N: Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto something here. He moves to a large table in the center of the room.
C: PICARD
D: A minor course correction... Where is the ribbon now?
E: musing beat
N: 84B ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position of the ribbon.
C: DATA
D: This is its current position.
C: PICARD
D: Can you project its course?
N: Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.
C: PICARD
D: Data. I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through. But right now, I need your full attention on the task at hand. If you can't provide it... then I'll have to relieve you of duty until Doctor Crusher can remove this. emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, but you leave me no other choice.
E: firm
N: This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long moment, then looks determined.
C: DATA
D: I do not wish to remove the chip, sir. Although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with... I cannot imagine going back to a life without them. I have taken an important step toward becoming truly human. If I were to turn back now... I would like to continue in my duties, sir.
E: beat
N: Picard smiles at him.

C: PICARD
D: Enhance grid A-nine.
N: Data works and the display now ZOOMS into a single SECTOR. The RED LINE cuts through the sector.
C: PICARD
D: Where was the Amargosa star?
N: Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

C: DATA
D: I believe so.
E: thinks
N: 84D ANGLE (VFX-P) 84D Data works and holographic display CHANGES again. The red line representing the course of the ribbon now shifts to the right -- AWAY from the Amargosa star's position. Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.
C: PICARD
D: That's what Soran's doing... he's changing its course. But why? Why try to alter its path... why not simply fly into it with a ship?
E: beat
N: Data thinks for a moment.
C: DATA
D: Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.
N: Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of insight.
C: PICARD
D: He can't go to the ribbon... so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
E: beat
C: DATA
D: Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
E: works
N: 84E ANGLE (VFX-P) 84E The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly through the system -- it passes very close to the third planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.
C: PICARD
D: It's very close to Veridian Three... but not close enough...
N: Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly has a horrible realization.
C: PICARD
D: Data, what would happen to the ribbon's path if he destroyed the Veridian star itself?
N: 84F ANGLE (VFX-P) 84F Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both aware of just how serious this is.
C: PICARD
D: That's where he's going.
C: DATA
D: It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.

D: Mister Data, scan the planet for life forms.
N: Data smiles, delighted at the request.

D: Commander.
C: DATA
D: Sorry, sir. There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
E: works
N: Worf turns to Picard.
C: WORF
D: Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet's surface will take eleven seconds to reach the star. However, since we do not know the exact point of origin, it will take us between eight and fifteen seconds to lock our weapons onto it.
E: beat

D: The Doctor values his privacy. He would be quite... upset if an Away Team interrupted him.
C: PICARD
D: Very well... I'll beam to your ship and you can transport me to Soran...

D: Sir, you can't trust them. They'll kill you just like they Killed Geordi.

Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to a narrow ledge a dozen meters above. Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard. He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.
C: SORAN
D: You must think I'm quite the madman.
C: PICARD
D: The thought had crossed my mind...
C: SORAN
D: The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan. Good luck.

N: Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and conversational.
C: SORAN
D: You're right. And there was a time when I wouldn't have hurt anyone. Then the Borg came... and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe, it's death. Afterwards, I began to realize that none of it mattered. We're all going to die anyway. It's only a question of how and when. You will too, Captain. You might contract a fatal disease... you might die in battle...

N: Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher with a confident look... he moves closer to where Picard is standing.
C: SORAN
D: You looked surprised. But you shouldn't be. I've been to the Nexus, Captain. I know things about people. Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you? It's like a predator. It's stalking you. You can try to outrun it with doctors... medicines.new technologies... but in the end, time is going to hunt you down... and make the kill.

The root is poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins racing... he glances at Soran and then picks up a pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield. -- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see that the bottom border of the field follows the contour of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch. -- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

PICARD (VFX-I) gets to his feet and stares at the onrushing Ribbon, the wind whipping up on the plateau. He backs away at the sight, coming to a stop with his back against the scaffolding. There's no where to run... NEW ANGLE- THE PLATEAU (VFX-I) as the RIBBON OF ENERGY TEARS ACROSS THE SCENE IN A TERRIFYING TORRENT OF LIGHT AND SOUND. THE SCENE IS WASHED OUT BY A BLINDING FLOOD OF RED LIGHT... Then suddenly the Ribbon is GONE... and so are Picard and Soran. The plateau is strangely and utterly SILENT after the passage of the Ribbon... even the birds have stopped chirping in the trees.
S: EXT. SPACE- VERIDIAN III (VFX-I)
N: As the ENERGY RIBBON rushes past the camera, a HUGE SHOCKWAVE from the destroyed star HITS the planet and it EXPLODES in a blast of fiery debris.
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON PICARD being led through a darkened HALLWAY. He is wearing a blindfold. Off screen hands tug and pull at him, leading him forward down the hall. He's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's going on. He tries to resist, but can't... the hands keep pulling at him... He is finally brought out into a larger room, dark. The hands release him and he stands alone. He takes a beat and tries to take control of the situation.
C: PICARD
D: What's going on? Where am I?
N: Two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove the blindfold... PICARD'S POV The blindfold drops, revealing a blurry kaleidoscope of COLORS and SHAPES... ON PICARD as he blinks and tries to focus... PICARD'S POV As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE sparkling with hundreds of lights. REVEAL THE ROOM A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling faces, waiting for him to say something. Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties standing next to Picard.
C: WOMAN
D: Go on... say something. They're waiting.
N: Picard is stunned.
C: PICARD
D: I... don't know what to say...
N: One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.
C: GIRL
D: Say Merry Christmas, Papa!
C: PICARD
D: Merry... Christmas...
E: in a daze
N: The children break out into applause. The woman kisses him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the children starts handing out presents with much laughter and chatting.
C: CHILDREN
D: This one's for you... where's mine?... I hope this is the book I asked for... take this one to Papa...
N: As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to feel an immense sense of satisfaction and happiness. It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience. He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even want to understand at the moment, he is very, very happy.
C: GIRL
D: Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?
E: to Picard
N: Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
C: PICARD
D: Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly beautiful. All of it.
N: All of the children now crowd around the chair with a single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the younger boys speaks up.
C: YOUNG BOY
D: This is from all of us.
C: PICARD
D: Thank you... I can't imagine what it is.
N: Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and gleaming brass.
C: YOUNG BOY
D: It's a sack-tent!
E: excited
N: Picard eyes it with delight.
C: PICARD
D: You mean a sextant. And it's a handsome one at that... from about eighteen twenty, I'd say. Wherever did you find it?
C: GIRL
D: It's a secret.
C: PICARD
D: Oh, a secret... well, that makes it a doubly special gift. Thank you... thank you all...
E: smiles
N: The children react with pleasure. They cluster around him, showering him with hugs and kisses.
C: CHILDREN
D: Merry Christmas, Papa... I love You, Father... etc.
N: Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. The children pull back and return to their own presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played out.
C: WOMAN
D: I'll go get dinner ready. they'll be starving in a minute.
E: to Picard
N: Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content. The children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks over the ornaments and decorations... PICARD'S POV of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of color and light. PICARD His eye is caught by something in particular on the tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it. PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT... and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands outward into the glass sphere. It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many ornaments on the tree. PICARD reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something. PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away... he can't hide from it.
C: PICARD
D: No... this isn't right... this can't be real...
C: GUINAN'S VOICE
D: It's as real as you want it to be.
N: Picard turns to see GUINAN (VFX-P) standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. As they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and Guinan aren't there. Picard is stunned.
C: PICARD
D: Guinan... what's going on? Where am I?
C: GUINAN
D: You're in the Nexus.
N: Picard looks around.
C: PICARD
D: This... is the Nexus?
C: GUINAN
D: For you. This is where you wanted to be...
C: PICARD
D: But I never had a wife, children, a home like this...
C: GUINAN
D: Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...
N: Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan.
C: PICARD
D: Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
C: GUINAN
D: I am on the Enterprise...I am also here. Think of me as... an "echo" of the person you know... a part of her she left behind...
E: off his puzzled look
C: PICARD
D: Left behind...?
C: GUINAN
D: When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us... but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
C: PICARD
D: Soran...?
C: GUINAN
D: All of us.
C: PICARD
D: Where is he now?
C: GUINAN
D: Wherever he wanted to be...
N: Guinan smiles at him.
C: BOY'S VOICE
D: Papa, help me build my castle!
N: Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy...
C: PICARD
D: In a few minutes...
E: to boy
N: Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay here becoming more powerful.
C: PICARD
D: These are my children... my children...
E: continuing, awed, to Guinan
C: GUINAN
D: Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born... go forward and see your grandchildren... time has no meaning here.
E: smiles
C: WOMAN'S VOICE
D: Dinner's ready! Let's go!
N: There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and takes his hand.
C: BOY
D: Papa... are you coming?
N: Picard looks down into the face of his child. His heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment... torn between the two images. and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child...
C: PICARD
D: Go on... go on without me...
N: The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice.
C: PICARD
D: Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?
C: GUINAN
D: Why would you want to leave?
C: PICARD
D: Can I?
E: insistent
C: GUINAN
D: Yes... where would you go?
C: PICARD
D: I don't understand.
C: GUINAN
D: I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere... any time.
N: Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
C: PICARD
D: I know exactly where I want to go... and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian Three... before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
C: GUINAN
D: What makes you think things will be any different this time?
C: PICARD
D: You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could --
E: beat
C: GUINAN
D: I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
N: Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives him an enigmatic smile.
C: GUINAN
D: I know just the guy.
N: Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. Picard turns at the sound --
S: EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY
N: Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but Architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to look around the corner and sees - James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24 Century Starfleet officer.
C: PICARD
D: James Kirk.
N: Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's over-powered him.
C: KIRK
D: Beautiful day, isn't it?
C: PICARD
D: Yes... yes, it is.
N: Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.
C: KIRK
D: Do you mind?
N: It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.
C: PICARD
D: Oh.
N: Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe.
C: PICARD
D: Captain, do you realize what --
N: But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.
C: KIRK
D: Wait a second. I think something's burning.
N: Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows...
S: INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house. Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.
C: KIRK
D: Looks like someone was cooking eggs... Come on in, it's all right. This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago.
E: to Picard
N: Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on.
C: PICARD
D: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise.
N: Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.
C: KIRK
D: This clock... I gave this clock to Bones...
C: PICARD
D: I'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty-fourth century.
E: pressing on
N: Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets Kirk with enthusiasm.
C: KIRK
D: Jake! Jake, you miserable old Mutt... How can you be here? He's been dead seven years.
E: affectionately to Picard
N: Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see the shock on Kirk's face.
C: ANTONIA'S VOICE
D: Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen?
N: A beat.
C: KIRK
D: That's Antonia...
E: amazed
N: Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to realize something.
C: KIRK
D: Wait a minute...
N: Kirk glances at Picard.
C: KIRK
D: The future... what are you talking about? This is the past...
N: Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.
C: KIRK
D: This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet...
N: Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.
C: KIRK
D: These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite.I was cooking them to soften the blow... And I gave her this.
E: re: horseshoe
N: Picard steps in.
C: PICARD
D: I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't Really your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.
N: But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.
C: KIRK
D: Dill weed.
N: Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it.
C: KIRK
D: There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg.
N: Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to Kirk.
C: PICARD
D: How long have you been here?
N: Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.
C: KIRK
D: I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you?
N: Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway.
C: KIRK
D: The bulkhead in front of me Disappeared... then I was out there chopping wood. Thanks.
E: continuing back to stove
N: Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.
C: PICARD
D: History records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon eighty years ago...
N: But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray.
C: KIRK
D: So you're telling me this is the twenty-fourth century... and I'm dead?
E: amused
C: PICARD
D: Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of...
C: KIRK
D: Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. Something's missing...
E: frowns at tray
N: Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door.
C: PICARD
D: Captain, I need your help. I want you to leave the Nexus with me.
N: Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...
S: INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a staircase.
C: PICARD
D: We have to go back to a planet called Veridian III and stop a man from destroying a star. There are millions of lives at stake.
N: Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go away.
C: KIRK
D: You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
C: PICARD
D: You're a Starfleet Officer and you have a duty to --
C: KIRK
D: I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one I was like you once... so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
E: hard beat
N: Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the stairs.
C: KIRK
D: I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia that I want to marry her.
E: looking up the stairs
N: Kirk begins to climb the stairs.
C: KIRK
D: This time things are going to be different.
N: He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, then gets a determined look on his face and marches up the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it and steps through the door into
S: INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with a few horses visible. Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the tray of food.
C: PICARD
D: This doesn't look like your bedroom.
E: re: barn
N: Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to fall into place. He smiles with a growing realization...
C: KIRK
D: No... no, it's not. It's better.
C: PICARD
D: Better?
C: KIRK
D: This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...
N: He points to a horse with a saddle on it.
C: KIRK
D: I took that horse out for a ride seven years ago... on a spring day.
E: re: horse
N: Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring day.
C: KIRK
D: Just like this. If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.
N: He turns to Picard.
C: KIRK
D: This Nexus of yours is very clever. I can start all over again -- do things right from day one.
N: Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P)
N: Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside -- and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side. Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot... and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something about that jump is nagging at him... He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the ravine. Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the horse makes the LEAP across yet again. This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an immediate stop. We can see on his face that something is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face. In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings...
C: KIRK
D: I must have made this jump fifty times. and every time it scared the hell out of me. But not this time. Because... it's not real.
E: re: ravine beat
N: A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
C: PICARD
D: Antonia?
E: re: woman
C: KIRK
D: She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is... nothing here matters...
E: nods
N: All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of self-revelation. He glances around.
C: KIRK
D: It's kinda like... orbital skydiving. Exciting for a few minutes... but in the end, you haven't really done anything... you haven't made a difference...
N: Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, he's truly seeing him for the first time.
C: KIRK
D: Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
C: PICARD
D: That's right.
C: KIRK
D: Close to retirement?
C: PICARD
D: I hadn't planned on it.
N: There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't seen until now.
C: KIRK
D: Well, let me tell you something - don't. Don't let them promote you... don't let them transfer you... don't let anything take you off the Bridge of that ship... Because while you're there, you can make a difference.
E: beat
N: The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and determination.
C: PICARD
D: You don't need to be on the Bridge of a starship. Come with me. Help me stop Soran. Make a difference again.
E: beat
N: A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly, unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.
C: KIRK
D: How can I argue with the Captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that Planet... Veridian III?
E: a beat
C: PICARD
D: That's right.
C: KIRK
D: I take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim?
C: PICARD
D: You could say that.
C: KIRK
D: Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that...
E: musing
N: And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.
C: KIRK
D: Sounds like fun.
N: The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE SCREEN, as seen before.
T: FADE TO RED FADE IN:
S: EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P)
N: Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing Picard.
C: SORAN
D: Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with Eternity and I don't want to be late.
N: We realize we are watching the same events play out again. Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the field... 167A SORAN (VFX-P) 167A turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard. 167B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 167B is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily. -- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris. -- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling. 167C SORAN (VFX-I) 167C Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON, then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the head. REVEAL KIRK who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men begin to fight. NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher... The following happens very quickly: -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal. -- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues to race by. 169A THE SKY (VFX-I) 169A the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer... 169B THE MOUNTAINTOP 169B Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon... -- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting buttons...looking for other control panels, anything to affect the launcher. 169C ANGLE (VFX-P) 169C Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR. 169D PICARD (VFX-P) 169D begins working the control panel... desperate... he looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of the controls. -- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the movie.
C: PICARD
D: Kirk -- there's a control PADD in his right pocket!
E: desperate
N: 169E KIRK (VFX-P) 169E sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He begins working it... CLOSE ON SORAN His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach... THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P) Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls. 171A KIRK (VFX-P) 171A he smiles.
C: KIRK
D: The twenty-fourth century isn't so tough.
N: Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the weapon at Picard. MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun... 172A THE PROBE (VFX-I) 172A makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We hear a muffled explosion. 172B SORAN (VFX-I) 172B can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding. PICARD moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly wounded. SORAN (VFX-I) is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.
C: SORAN
D: No...
N: His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns to Picard.
C: SORAN
D: YOU!!
N: 174B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 174B He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES SORAN IN MID-AIR . Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. The pocket watch has been shattered. PICARD turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged breath.
C: KIRK
D: Nice shot.
N: Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.
C: PICARD
D: I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
C: KIRK
D: Did we do it? Did we make a Difference...?
C: PICARD
D: Yes. Thank you.
