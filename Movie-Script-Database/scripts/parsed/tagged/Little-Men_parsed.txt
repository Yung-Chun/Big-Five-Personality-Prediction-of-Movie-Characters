M: SHOOTING SCRIPT: July 27, 2015
S: INT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Loud conversation, laughter, singing, and even dancing: the teacher is missing in a 7th Grade classroom. This rare absence of authority is intensely enjoyed by the crowd. It looks like it's party time for these KIDS. They talk and laugh, show each other photos on their phones, draw spaceships and baboons on their notebooks, and fold pieces of paper into airplanes that fly around the room. In a corner, a GROUP OF GIRLS dance to the tune of a song they are listening to on headphones. On the other side of the room, TWO BOYS play like in a sword fight, without swords. Suddenly, someone turns out the lights. There's random shouting and laughter. An overhead projector is turned on, and a couple of the kids start to make puppet figures that are seen on the white screen. A door opens, and a voice is heard, grave and authoritative.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: What is going on here?!
E: O.S.
N: The kids scramble back to their seats as the lights go on. MR. PLUMMER, the teacher, has come in.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: What is this mess?? Didn't you promise me to be quiet? Can't I even leave you alone for five minutes?? Lionel, sit down. Sit down, I said! Melissa, put your phone away. Put it away right now! I asked you to be quiet, and... look at you. What a disappointment.
N: Mr. Plummer wanders around the classroom, inspecting everyone. Each kid has a different reaction. Some are frightened, others think it's funny. Some are respectful, and some others, defiant. The teacher stops by a desk that's covered by a VERY COLORFUL DRAWING, while the STUDENT rushes to put away his large collection of Caran d'Ache pencils neatly in the box.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Jacob, what is this? Shooting Script 07/27/15 2.
E: CONT'D
N: JACOB "JAKE" JARDINE is pale and slender, with straight black hair, a bit longer than the other kids, and deep brown eyes - pretty in a delicate way, and shy, different from the other tougher boys in the class.
C: JAKE
D: It's the sky, Mr. Plummer.
N: Mr. Plummer picks up his drawing and shows it to the class.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: A green sky with yellow stars??
C: JAKE
D: It's Camp Jupiter's sky.
E: barely audible
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Watch out, Jacob: Vincent van Gogh ended up cutting off his own ear.
N: Some of the boys have a ball with this. Girls cover their mouths not to laugh out loud. Jake blushes, his eyes fill up with quiet, angry tears; he wasn't even talking to anyone, he was just drawing, doing his thing. Life is so unfair.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Quiet!! I said quiet, everybody! This is not a playroom. It's not an art studio. Much less a disco, Ms. Neves. It's a classroom. It is my classroom, and I asked you to be quiet. A simple request, and you showed me you don't know how to behave yourselves. Was I talking to the walls? Amanda, please collect everybody's homework, and bring them to me.
N: AMANDA, the teacher's favorite, promptly goes around the class collecting homework. The individual students now listen intently to Mr. Plummer's speech. But there are exceptions; one or two still defy his authority, swallowing a laughter that cannot contain itself.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: If I had to leave the class, it is because I had something very important to do. I come back, and I see you screaming and dancing! There's a saying, it's an old saying, that says: "Silence is golden." Write this down, children. Shooting Script 07/27/15 3.
E: O.S. MORE
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Silence is golden but my eyes still see. Talking is cheap, people follow like sheep."
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Mr. Plummer writes this up on the board. Jake, instead of writing, furiously draws a wild dancing cobra on his notebook.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: What does this mean?
N: Amanda raises her hand, ready to give an answer.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Not now, Amanda. I want you all to write down your thoughts on this: "silence is golden."
N: He underlines "silence is golden" on the board.
C: MR. PLUMMER
D: Every child is to write an essay on its meaning. Two pages minimum. That's your homework for tomorrow. Don't even come to the class if you haven't done it! Now, let's open our books. Page 23. Lionel, start reading from the top. Stand up, please. Stand up so we can all hear you.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL - DAY
N: Large groups of KIDS are coming out through the main gate of the school. PILAR, a Filipino woman in her 50's, waits outside looking attentively at every kid who walks out. She sees the one she's looking for. In the middle of different groups and cliques, Jake comes walking alone.
C: PILAR
D: Jake! Jake! Hey, Jake! Here!
N: Jake sees her, then runs and gives her a big hug, longer than expected.
C: PILAR
D: Hey hey hey. Look at you.
N: She ruffles his hair lovingly. Shooting Script 07/27/15 4.
C: JAKE
D: What happened?
C: PILAR
D: Your parents are going to be coming home very late tonight. Come on. Let's go.
N: They begin to walk together away from the school.
C: JAKE
D: I'm thirsty.
C: PILAR
D: We can stop by Papaya King on the way home.
C: JAKE
D: Yes!
S: 2A EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET - DAY 2A
N: Jake and Pilar are walking. Jake now has a drink from Papaya King in his hand.
C: PILAR
D: Listen, Jake. It's your grandfather Max. There have been some... developments.
C: JAKE
D: Some what?
C: PILAR
D: I mean, he got sick, and had to go to the hospital.
C: JAKE
D: Sick with what?
C: PILAR
D: I'm sure your parents will talk to you when they get home. But I'm going to make dinner for you. What do you want?
N: He thinks for a moment. Shooting Script 07/27/15 5.
C: JAKE
D: I don't know. What happened to Grandpa Max?
E: pause
C: PILAR
D: When you're old, things happen, Jake. C'mon, let's make the light. We need to get to the grocery.
N: They cross the street and continue on.
S: 2B INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT/JAKE'S ROOM - DAY 2B
N: Jake is at his desk working on a drawing.
S: INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT/KITCHEN & LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: A comfortable, but cramped, NYC apartment. In the kitchen, Pilar is preparing a steaming pot of caldereta, Filipino beef stew. A phone starts ringing, and Jake storms out of his bedroom.
C: PILAR
D: Hey! Did you finish your homework?
N: Jake grabs the phone.
C: JAKE
D: Jardine residence, good evening.
N: We hear the voice on the other end of the line.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Good evening. And who am I talking to?
E: O.S. over the phone
C: JAKE
D: Who is this?
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: This is Stu Gershman, I'm an old friend of Max Jardine's. Is this Jacob?
E: O.S. over the phone
C: JAKE
D: Yes. Shooting Script 07/27/15 6.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Oh Jacob, last time I saw you, you were a little baby. I guess you're all grown up now.
E: O.S. over the phone
C: JAKE
D: Umm...
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Is your dad at home? Your mom?
E: O.S. over the phone
C: JAKE
D: No, they're not home yet.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Oh well. I'm calling because... I'm very sorry to hear about your grandfather, Jacob. Max and I knew each other for so long, we met when we were about your age. You must be - what, ten now?
E: O.S. over the phone
C: JAKE
D: Twelve.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: He was such a dear old friend of mine, your granddaddy was. Do you know when the service is going to be?
E: O.S.
C: JAKE
D: What service?
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: The funeral. I imagine there's going to be a service soon?
E: O.S. over the phone
N: Jake pauses to take this in - he has just learned that his grandfather has died.
C: JAKE
D: Hold on a second.
N: He goes to the kitchen and gives the phone to Pilar.
C: PILAR
D: Who is it? Shooting Script 07/27/15 7.
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
S: EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY
N: LEONOR CALVELLI rolls down the metal shutters of a Brooklyn storefront. A sign above reads "CASA DE MODA". It's the ground floor commercial space of a two-story row house on a commercial street in Brooklyn. She pushes down the last bit of the gate with her foot to lock it up. You can still go in and out through a door space that's open. She lights up a cigarette and leans on the gate, calmly surveying the street - a daily routine. Leonor is in her early 50's, dark hair and dark eyes, her beauty toughened up by a hard life. After a few puffs, she hears a car parking in front, doors open and close. Leonor recognizes someone, and throws her cigarette out. She opens the door, and calls inside the store.
C: LEONOR
D: Antonio! Antonio!
C: TONY
D: What?!
E: O.S.
C: LEONOR
D: Come! Come here!*
N: *- Throughout the film, italics will indicate when Leonor, Tony and others speak Spanish. She forces a smile, greeting the still unknown visitor, then she turns to inside and calls again, impatiently.
C: LEONOR
D: Antonio!!
S: EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY
N: Across the street from Leonor, Jake is helping his parents BRIAN and KATHY JARDINE get plates of food wrapped in cellophane and other catering goods from out of the car. The couple, dressed in formal dark clothes, have the youthful look of people who can afford to take a nice vacation once a year. Jake sees when ANTONIO "TONY" CALVELLI, a handsome 13 year old boy with dark hair and eyes, comes running out from inside the store, and stops next to Leonor. Shooting Script 07/27/15 8.
C: LEONOR
D: What were you doing?? If I say `come here', you have to come. Give them a hand. Go.
N: But Tony doesn't move, unsure of what to do. He looks at Jake, who is looking at him. Brian drops a plate in Jake's hands and goes towards Leonor, with an extended hand.
C: BRIAN
D: Hello Mrs. Calvelli. Brian Jardine, we've met.
C: LEONOR
D: Of course, Brian. I'm so sad for what has happened. I'm so sorry.
N: Jake sees when Leonor, suddenly overtaken by emotion, grabs his father's hand and pulls him closer for a hug, which makes Brian visibly uncomfortable. Leonor tries to hide her tears.
C: LEONOR
D: I'm sorry. Your father was a such a wonderful man.
C: BRIAN
D: Thank you.
C: LEONOR
D: He really was, you know.
C: BRIAN
D: I know.
C: LEONOR
D: This is my son Antonio.
N: Kathy approaches, carrying a plate of food.
C: BRIAN
D: I don't think you've met my wife Kathy.
C: LEONOR
D: Hi. Nice to meet you. Leonor.
N: Kathy smiles warmly, as Brian opens the door to the house.
C: KATHY
D: So nice to meet you too. Sorry, my hands are full. Shooting Script 07/27/15 9.
C: BRIAN
D: We're having a little reception upstairs. Just family and a few friends.
C: LEONOR
D: Of course.
N: Brian and Kathy go upstairs with their bags. Left alone by the car, Jake tries to grab a sketchbook from inside as he balances the big plate of food with his other hand and then, a bit clumsy, ends up dropping the bag. Tony is suddenly there to help him out. He kneels down to pick up pages with drawings, pencils and stuff spilling out of the bag, immediately recognizing the first drawing he sees - a girl with red wings flying through a thundercloud.
C: TONY
D: Ella the Harpy!
C: JAKE
D: Can you hand that to me?
C: TONY
D: She's a nerd, but I have a thing for redheads... Don't you?
C: JAKE
D: Here, pass me that. I can carry it.
N: In the distance, Leonor watches, while Tony helps by pulling another set of plates and bottles out of the car, organizing a crate to be carried off.
C: TONY
D: Tyson is such a douchebag.
C: JAKE
D: Not in the end, he's not. I just finished The Blood of Olympus.
C: TONY
D: I have the game, wanna play?
C: JAKE
D: Now? I'd like to, but... I can't. It's my grandfather's--
C: TONY
D: I know. I never know what to say in these situations. Shooting Script 07/27/15 10.
C: JAKE
D: I think you're supposed to say, "I'm sorry for your loss."
C: TONY
D: That's right! I'm sorry for your loss.
C: JAKE
D: Oh, that's okay.
N: Tony finds one last drawing that was left on the floor in the car.
C: TONY
D: Wait a minute: what's this one here?
C: JAKE
D: It's the sky.
C: TONY
D: Did you make this??
C: JAKE
D: Yeah, it's the sky above Camp Jupiter, the day of the battle.
C: TONY
D: You're a real artist!
C: JAKE
D: Not really.
C: TONY
D: Of course you are. This is awesome! You know you'll really like this neighborhood.
C: JAKE
D: We don't live here. It's just a reception.
C: TONY
D: It's become a very bohemian area. You know what bohemian means?
C: JAKE
D: Yeah...
C: TONY
D: Very artistic. Shooting Script 07/27/15 11.
C: BRIAN
D: Got it, son?
E: O.S.
N: Brian is back by the car to pick up the stuff.
C: BRIAN
D: You okay with that, Antonio?
C: TONY
D: You can call me Tony.
C: BRIAN
D: Well thank you, Tony. I appreciate the help.
N: The two boys follow Brian towards the house, the three of them carrying plates and bags.
S: INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY AREA - DUSK
N: The apartment is old and in desperate need of a paint job. It's a large space, crammed with the stuff of a long life. There are family photos, piles of National Geographic magazines next to faded velvety couches and solid furniture. A small, vintage color TV sits alone in the corner. There's a quiet reception going on, with most people wearing black, or dark colors, and talking softly to each other. Amongst the mostly older friends and relatives of the deceased are Brian's sister AUDREY and her husband JAMES, and their teenage son, LIAM, dressed in a suit. They are sitting on a couch next to Brian, leafing through a photo album.
C: BRIAN
D: Let me see. That was our first year in the house. Look; I still had braces.
C: AUDREY
D: Dad looks so young here.
C: BRIAN
D: He was a handsome guy.
C: AUDREY
D: Listen to you.
C: BRIAN
D: What?
C: AUDREY
D: You look just like him, and you know it. Can I have this? Please? Shooting Script 07/27/15 12.
C: BRIAN
D: Yes. I'll let you have the photo IF...
N: Brian picks up a book on the table.
C: BRIAN
D: ...you let me have the first edition of The Velveteen Rabbit.
C: AUDREY
D: Now, wait a minute.
S: 6A INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAY 6A
N: In the kitchen, KATHY is re-furbishing a tray of pastries with new ones from a box from an Italian bakery. Pilar is beside her, cutting fruit for a pitcher of punch.
S: 6B INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY AREA - DAY 6B
N: Jake is sipping some juice, like a cocktail, and looking at the art on the wall: a couple of oil paintings of Parisian streets in the wintertime of dubious quality doesn't arouse much interest, and he ends up in front of a vintage movie poster on the wall, with ahead of its time 60s graphics - probably the best piece of art in the apartment.
C: BRIAN
D: Jake, come here.
E: O.S.
N: Jake goes to see his father, who's standing next to STU GERSHMAN, a well dressed gentleman in his 70's.
C: BRIAN
D: Do you remember Grandpa's friend Stu Gershman?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Look at you, all grown up now. How's school?
C: JAKE
D: Okay.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: So, what kind of sports do you like to play? Shooting Script 07/27/15 13.
N: Jake doesn't play any sports, and it's probably a point of contention between father and son, given the sudden uncomfortable moment of silence.
C: BRIAN
D: He likes to draw and paint.
N: Jake blushes.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: So you'd like to be an illustrator when you grow up?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: Well, come here. Come here.
N: He pulls Jake in uncomfortably tight.
C: STU GERSHMAN
D: I want to tell you a few things about your grandfather, Jake: he liked to play ball but was a horrible pitcher; he hated summer but went nuts seeing the ladies walk by in mini-skirts; and he was the most loyal friend you could have. Loyalty was his greatest quality.
C: BRIAN
D: Aww... Thanks, Stu. Did you hear that, Jake?
N: Jake is saved from Stu by a knock on the door. He runs to open it, and there she is: Leonor holding a beautiful cake. Kathy, who also heard the knock, comes to see what's going on.
C: LEONOR
D: It's a dessert we make for special occasions in my country.
N: She hands the cake to Kathy.
C: LEONOR
D: I hope you like it.
N: Jake watches everything.
C: KATHY
D: Oh my God. You didn't have to. Shooting Script 07/27/15 14.
C: LEONOR
D: Max loved this cake, so I thought....
C: KATHY
D: Come in. You should come in.
C: LEONOR
D: It's okay.
C: KATHY
D: Please. I insist.
C: LEONOR
D: No, I just wanted to bring the cake.
C: KATHY
D: Sorry if we didn't say anything earlier. Brian and I... we're both very tired. It's all been so fast.
C: LEONOR
D: It's okay. I still have some paperwork to do at the store.
C: KATHY
D: Thank you so much for this. It's very kind of you. Thank you.
N: Leonor leaves, and Jake shuts the door. Kathy is left with the beautiful cake on her hands. She looks across the room and sees Brian, in the middle of a crowd, holding court, being a good actor.
S: INT. JARDINE HOUSE/STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: Brian walks down the interior stairs of the house, carrying a heavy bag full of trash. At the bottom of the stairs, he turns and walks down the dark corridor that leads to the backyard. He finds the large metal trash containers, and throws the bags in. Alone for the first time all day, Brian is overtaken by memories and allows himself a good cry.
S: INT. CASTING OFFICE - DAY
N: Brian is sitting at a table in a bare room, speaking in a strong Italian-American Brooklyn accent. Shooting Script 07/27/15 15.
C: BRIAN
D: I swear B, I'm surprised at you. I sit there waiting for you to wake up, but everything's great with you.
N: We see he is holding a script, next to SUZANNE, a famous actress, who's also with a script in her hands. They are reading from Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge. Brian is reading the role of "Eddie" as Suzanne plays his wife, "Beatrice". An OPERATOR tapes Brian's performance with a video camera on a tripod.
C: SUZANNE
D: No, everything ain't great with me.
C: BRIAN
D: No?
C: SUZANNE
D: No. But I got other worries.
C: BRIAN
D: Why? What other worries you got?
C: SUZANNE
D: When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?
C: BRIAN
D: I ain't been feeling good. They bother me since they came.
C: SUZANNE
D: It's almost three months you don't feel good. It's three months, Eddie.
C: BRIAN
D: I don't know, B. I don't want to talk about it.
C: SUZANNE
D: Nice! Okay.
N: Suzanne smiles at Brian, already out of character. But Brian really would love to keep going.
C: BRIAN
D: You go "you don't like me, heh?" Shooting Script 07/27/15 16.
N: Suzanne looks for help from the audience, gently cutting Brian off.
C: DEBORAH
D: That's good, Jardine.
E: O.S.
N: The casting director, DEBORAH, sits with scripts and lists under a reading light, and a male ASSISTANT next to her. A DIRECTOR a PRODUCER, and a PRODUCER'S ASSISTANT sit next to him.
C: SUZANNE
D: Yeah, I need a break.
E: to the director
C: DEBORAH
D: Take a break, Suzanne.
N: Suzanne smiles again at Brian, and comes close to kiss him goodbye.
C: SUZANNE
D: I'm starving. I've been here since ten.
C: BRIAN
D: Of course.
C: SUZANNE
D: How's Kathy?
C: BRIAN
D: She's good.
C: SUZANNE
D: And your son?
C: BRIAN
D: Jake. He's great. He's in seventh grade already.
C: SUZANNE
D: Oh my God, I remember him running around backstage at The Lortel, when we did...
C: BRIAN
D: Dark Rapture?
C: SUZANNE
D: Yes! How old was he?
C: BRIAN
D: Two. Three, maybe. Shooting Script 07/27/15 17.
C: SUZANNE
D: Time flies by.
C: BRIAN
D: It really does.
C: SUZANNE
D: Well, it was great to see you.
C: BRIAN
D: Great to see you also, Suzanne. Maybe we'll see each other again soon.
C: SUZANNE
D: I hope so. Jamie? Do you have lunch for me?
E: to the audience
S: EXT. CASTING OFFICE - DAY
N: ROGER, Brian's agent, is standing outside the theater, texting on his phone. Brian comes out, and they begin to walk.
C: BRIAN
D: She fucking hates me.
C: ROGER
D: She doesn't hate you.
C: BRIAN
D: Ever since B.U. She dropped out - I stayed and graduated. Every time we've seen each other since then, she always tries to prove that she's better than me.
C: ROGER
D: You're paranoid. You did okay there.
C: BRIAN
D: Did I?
C: ROGER
D: Yes. But it's true that she'll have a say in who's cast as her husband.
C: BRIAN
D: I'm telling you. She doesn't like me. I'm in a slump, Roger. You need to help me here. Shooting Script 07/27/15 18.
C: ROGER
D: Listen, maybe Broadway is not the right way to go for you right now.
C: BRIAN
D: I thought that was the strategy.
C: ROGER
D: Why don't we go have some coffee? You have options. There are a bunch of things that could pan out. Let me just finish this.
N: Roger goes back to his texting.
S: INT. JARDINE APARTMENT - DAY
N: The apartment has been completely redone. The old furniture is out, more modern - if used - furniture is in. There's less stuff, so it looks more spacious. There are new appliances in the kitchen, and some of the art from Brian and Kathy's old Manhattan apartment now hangs on the walls, which have been newly painted with fresh colors. Brian, Kathy and Jake have moved in, and it looks really nice. There are still piles of plates and pans to be put away, and a few boxes on the floor by the kitchen. Pilar is taking stuff out of one of them. Plates and trays and things wrapped individually in bubble wrap and newspaper. Kathy unwraps them and looks for places in the kitchen cabinets to put them away. While she's putting them away, Pilar unwraps a beautiful crystal serving plate.
C: PILAR
D: I don't remember this.
N: Kathy takes a looks at it, trying to remember where it came from.
C: KATHY
D: Oh my God. We took it home.
S: INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY
N: The store has women's clothes on display on simple racks, with a few chosen pieces shown on a large table. It's an old- fashioned store; the ambiance is simple and unsophisticated. BIANCA, a salesgirl, is showing a dress with floral patterns to a CUSTOMER as Kathy comes in, carrying the crystal plate. Shooting Script 07/27/15 19. She is going to say hello to the salesgirl, but doesn't want to interrupt and goes directly towards Leonor, who is in the back of the store behind a sewing machine, fixing the collar of a shirt.
C: KATHY
D: Leonor.
C: LEONOR
D: Hi Kathy. The boys are in my office, in the back.
C: KATHY
D: No, no. Look what I just found.
C: LEONOR
D: It's my plate.
C: KATHY
D: I think that night we just ended up taking everything back to our apartment. And then we put things away, and I forgot. I'm so sorry.
C: LEONOR
D: No worries! Please.
C: KATHY
D: It's a beautiful plate.
N: She takes it from Kathy's hand.
C: LEONOR
D: Are you not working today?
C: KATHY
D: I don't see patients on Monday. I need a day a week to organize my life, you know.
C: LEONOR
D: Good for you.
C: KATHY
D: The store looks cute.
C: LEONOR
D: Huh... we're not doing so well.
C: KATHY
D: I like that dress over there. The one with the floral patterns. Shooting Script 07/27/15 20.
C: LEONOR
D: I love that one. You should try it on.
C: KATHY
D: I have to go back-
C: LEONOR
D: Oh, c'mon. It'll take a minute.
S: INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY
N: Kathy pulls open the curtain wearing the floral dress, and shows it to Leonor, who's waiting outside.
C: LEONOR
D: Perfection.
N: Kathy walks towards the mirror wearing the floral dress.
C: KATHY
D: Are you sure? I don't know.
N: Leonor comes with expert hands and pulls a pinch on the shoulder strap.
C: LEONOR
D: It looks great. All you need is a little fixing up here, maybe a tiny bit tighter here on the waist. But the dress is beautiful.
C: KATHY
D: How much is it?
C: LEONOR
D: Whatever the price, I'll give you ten percent discount. Let me see.
N: Leonor looks for a tag around the cuffs.
C: KATHY
D: Did you make this?
C: LEONOR
D: No. Not this one. But everything here is handmade by the designers. This one is two hundred and fifty. It's made by a woman named Talita - she's from Colombia, and very talented. They probably do it in their kitchens, you know what I mean? They're not famous. Yet. Shooting Script 07/27/15 21.
S: INT. CASA DE MODA/OFFICE - DAY
N: There's a video game on the TV. Monsters and battles, and sound effects. And sitting in front of the TV set, taking it all in, are Jake and Tony. It's a small space in the back of the store that has been turned into an office - just a simple desk, a TV, a chair and a couch in the corner. Kathy comes in, dressed in the floral pattern dress. Leonor is right behind her.
C: KATHY
D: Guys, what do you think?
N: The boys don't move an inch, their attention 100% on the TV screen.
C: KATHY
D: Jake? Jake, what is our deal?
N: She turns to Leonor.
C: KATHY
D: They're like zombies when they start playing these games.
C: JAKE
D: Mom. I'm on vacation!
E: eyes still on the screen
C: KATHY
D: So?
C: JAKE
D: Dad said it was okay.
C: KATHY
D: We have this rule in the house; no games during the week. And no internet before five either.
C: LEONOR
D: But during vacation they have all this free time, and what are you going to do?
C: TONY

C: JAKE
D: So?
C: BRIAN
D: Listen. Let me tell you something. It's good to get rid of stuff. It's hard at first, but then it feels really good. You have to learn to let go.

C: JAKE
D: What's a dacha?
C: BRIAN
D: A dacha is like a big country estate in Russia. That's where the whole thing takes place, and that's why the funny names. There's also Nina. She's the neighbors's daughter, who wants to be an actress. At first she seems to be in love with Konstantin but ends up having an affair with my character, Trigorin.
C: JAKE
D: Sounds complicated.

N: Kathy joins them and helps herself to a big plate.
C: BRIAN
D: It's not that simple.

S: EXT. HERBERT VON KING PARK - DAY
N: A tree-filled park in the middle of a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. On a grassy lawn, a GROUP OF BOYS, 12 to 15 years old, are kicking a soccer ball into a goal. Two captains, UMAR and JOEY, are choosing one by one to form two teams. Tony rushes by on his scooter, fast. He avoids bumps - he knows the area by heart.

C: UMAR
D: Tony! Hey! Come play! We need one more here! Shooting Script 07/27/15 27.

S: INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: An old apartment, functional and in need of paint job. Modest furniture dominates the space, but there are a couple of eye catching art pieces; a large modernist painting and a striking sculpture. In a corner, there's a large bookshelf filled with books, but one corner has been turned into a bar with a few different types of glasses, and various liquor bottles. Leonor is in the living room preparing a drink next to HERNÀN ALONSO, Latin, early 60's, dressed in a suit and tie. He stands close to Leonor, and leans over to help her with the drink. At this very moment, Jake and Tony burst in through the door.
C: TONY
D: Eight minutes and twenty three seconds!
E: out of breath
N: He throws his scooter on the floor and runs to the kitchen. Jake stays by the door, polite, waiting to greet the elders, roller blades in hand.

C: HERNÀN
D: Hello there, Jake.
C: TONY
D: He used to live in Manhattan, but now he lives above Mami's store. Jake, this is Hernàn.
N: He finishes his glass of water, and runs to his room. Jake stays alone with the adults.
C: HERNÀN

C: LEONOR
D: Yes. Max was his grandfather. His father is Brian Jardine, the one that I told you about.
E: cuts him off
C: JAKE
D: My father's an actor. And my mom is a psychotherapist.
C: HERNÀN
D: I see. So how do you like Brooklyn so far? Shooting Script 07/27/15 29.
C: JAKE
D: I like it a lot. It's more peaceful than Manhattan, and we have much more space. It's great.
C: HERNÀN
D: So Jake, are you going to be an actor, like your father?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
C: HERNÀN
D: But you look like an artist yourself. With that long hair and everything.
C: JAKE
D: Maybe.
N: This conversation is getting too deep for Jake. Leonor sees that he's uncomfortable, and helps him out.
C: LEONOR
D: He'll tell us more later, right Jake? Go ahead.
N: Jake runs inside Tony's room.
S: INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT/TONY'S ROOM - DAY
N: Tony's room is typical teenager with a small bed, a desk with computer and posters of music and movies. Tony's on the bed, lost in thought. He's clearly been listening in on the conversation in the other room.
C: TONY
D: Is your father any good at acting?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know. Maybe.
C: TONY
D: I thought if he was, I might have a conversation with him, cause I'm going to be an actor when I grow up. Maybe he can give me some pointers.
C: JAKE
D: Sure, yeah. I guess. He's not that successful or anything. Shooting Script 07/27/15 30.
N: Tony jumps off his bed and pulls open the drawers of his desk.
C: TONY
D: My dream is to go to the LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts? You know that school? Nicki Minaj went there. And Al Pacino, but heflunked out.
C: JAKE
D: I think my dad applied there.
C: TONY
D: Really? It's my dream school. I'm looking around at some theater classes, and practicing on my own, so I can audition next year for ninth grade.
N: He pulls out a stack of plays from his drawer.
C: TONY
D: These are some of the scripts I'm working on. I'm going to need to practice a lot, and sometimes I might need a partner, okay?
E: CONT'D
C: JAKE
D: But I'm not an actor.
C: TONY
D: That's okay. You can read, can't you? Here look at this. This is a scene from Pariah, or the Outcast, by August Strindberg. It's perfect for us to work on, cause it's just two guys.
N: Jake takes the book tentatively, and flips through it.
C: TONY
D: And you know what, if you practice your drawing more, and get better, maybe we could both go to LaGuardia. It's for all kinds of artists. It's very Bohemian.
N: Jake puts the script down, uncommitted.
C: JAKE
D: I guess I can try. Shooting Script 07/27/15 31.
C: TONY
D: That's the spirit.
C: JAKE
D: Is Hernàn your mom's boyfriend?
C: TONY
D: Hernàn? Eww, gross. No. He's just a friend of her's from Chile. My mom is still married to my dad. They just don't live together much.
C: JAKE
D: I don't understand.
C: TONY
D: Me either! My dad travels a lot, so they are never together. He's a nurse, and he works for Doctors Without Borders, which is from what I can tell a job you get if you want free plane flights.
C: JAKE
D: Where is he now?
C: TONY
D: He's in Angola. That's in Africa. Until he was 20 he never left this neighborhood, and then once he left he barely ever came back. If I wasn't here I don't think he'd ever come back to Brooklyn.
N: Tony jumps up and goes to his desk.
C: TONY
D: Look what he sent me.
N: He pulls a box from a shelf, full of books and CDs and stuff.
C: JAKE
D: Do you miss having him around more?
C: TONY
D: At first I did. But it's been a few years now, so I got used to it.
C: JAKE
D: Sometimes my dad goes away, if he's shooting a movie. But it hasn't really happened in a while. Shooting Script 07/27/15 32.
C: TONY
D: Maybe he's not the guy I should talk to.
C: JAKE
D: I don't know. He's been in a bunch of plays and stuff.
N: Tony is still looking... and he finally finds it.
C: TONY
D: Found it!
N: He picks up a big book and drops it in Tony's lap.
C: TONY
D: My dad and I are going to go on a safari, and these are just like some of the animals we are going to see.
N: Jake looks through pictures of African savannahs and animals.
C: JAKE
D: Do you wish they still lived together?
C: TONY
D: Sometimes. When my dad comes to visit, he'll cook Porcheta. It's like roast pork butt.
C: JAKE
D: Ewww.
C: TONY
D: It's good. We sit at the table just the three of us, and he tells stories about his work and the places he's been, and stories about the different people he's met in Africa. Then it seems like normal. But then, pretty soon they start fighting about something stupid. And I realize it's better when he's not around.
E: matter of fact pause
C: JAKE
D: Imagine if your mom goes with you on your safari, and they end up falling in love again. Shooting Script 07/27/15 33.
C: TONY
D: I think there's very little chance of that happening.
C: JAKE
D: But just imagine: you get an envelope one day. You open it and it's two tickets to a safari. One for you, and one for your mom. And she decides to go, because she feels like she needs a vacation. So when you get to Africa, your dad picks you both up at the airport, and takes you to this incredible place. Like this photo here. You see lions and elephants, giraffes. And then, it's the end of a beautiful day in the African savannah. Your dad wants to take you up this big hill to see the sunset, but you're too tired, so you tell your parents you're going to rest in your hotel room.
C: TONY
D: So they go the two of them alone. And when they get there, the colors of the sky are like nothing they've ever seen before...
C: JAKE
D: A green sky with yellow stars...
N: The door opens, with Leonor in an apron and a wooden spoon in hand.
C: LEONOR
D: Who wants pasta primavera?

D: Yes!
N: Jake jumps up and goes out running. Tony stays in for a moment, imagining...

N: Leonor doesn't respond.
C: BRIAN
D: You've got a great kid, but I guess you know that.

E: MORE
C: ACTING TEACHER
D: Not to act. The genesis of acting is seeing. Yes? That's the first thing. The raw material of all acting is seeing, observing, understanding what makes behavior. I would say pay attention! So when we start doing the repetition exercise, that person does it to you; you just react. Whereas a lot of actors make it happen. Yes? But that's not acting. That's pushing, whereas you should just be relaxed.

D: Thanks. I did a lot of work here.
C: BRIAN
D: The reason why I'm here, Leonor...
C: LEONOR
D: I know.
C: BRIAN
D: Your lease has been expired for more than six months now. I guess you guys were about to renew it when my father passed?
C: LEONOR
D: Brian, why don't you sit down.
N: They go towards the back of the store. Leonor sits behind her desk/sewing machine, Brian in front of her. He opens his messenger bag, and takes out a brown envelope.
C: BRIAN
D: My sister and I are working on the transfer of ownership for the house. It's almost done; Dad left everything in order, all the taxes paid and all that. The only thing still pending is the store, which needs to have a new lease. Shooting Script 07/27/15 56.
C: LEONOR
D: You know, your father never thought much about contracts. He was very happy to have me here. Max thought my store gave "glamour" to the neighborhood, and he was proud to be associated.
C: BRIAN
D: The situation has changed, and now we have two families owning the house; mine and Audrey's. It's better for us, and for you, to have things done the right way, wouldn't you agree?
C: LEONOR
D: It depends on what the right way is for you.
C: BRIAN
D: Leonor, this neighborhood is changing very fast. The rents have gone up quite a lot in the past few years. I'm sure you've noticed.
C: LEONOR
D: Yes, I noticed and so did Max. But it was his desire that I stay here.
C: BRIAN
D: We don't want you to go away. My sister Audrey has prepared a new lease for you, and we think it's very fair. We aren't trying to get market rate here, we know that's not possible, but still, you can't expect to pay the same rent you paid when you first moved in.
N: Brian pulls some papers out of his bag.
C: BRIAN
D: Here, why don't you take a look.

N: Leonor opens a drawer, and takes out a small pile of photographs. She hands them to Brian. Shooting Script 07/27/15 57.
C: LEONOR
D: I am probably the last person to have photos printed, the old fashioned way. It's completely different than seeing them on a cellphone, don't you agree?
N: Brian looks through the photos. Leonor looks over his shoulder.
C: LEONOR
D: That's me in the backyard, on July 4th. That's me and Tony and your father at the Fair of St. Anthony's. That's us with my family, when they were visiting. Your father and I were very good friends. We spent a lot of time together. What you and your sister don't understand is that Max wanted me to stay here. He thought of me as part of this house, this neighborhood.
N: He returns the photos to Leonor.
C: LEONOR
D: I was more his family, if you want to know, than you were.
C: BRIAN
D: That's a ridiculous thing to say.
C: LEONOR
D: You hardly talked to each other. You never came to visit. I was the one here. I saw him everyday.
C: BRIAN
D: This is not what I came here for. Why don't we go back to the lease. Take a look, please. It's fair.
C: LEONOR
D: No, I don't need to. I have an idea what you and your sister have in mind. I'll just give this to my lawyer because, to be honest with you, Brian, I'm not sure I owe you anything. Maybe it's the other way around.
N: Brian is speechless, sideswiped by Leonor's intensity and conviction. Shooting Script 07/27/15 58.
C: BRIAN
D: Well, I guess there's not that much more to be said then.
C: LEONOR

D: I made it. The fabric is vintage.
C: KATHY
D: Yes. I really like it, but I can't wear anything too tight on the waist these days. I need to lose a few pounds first.
N: Leonor keeps sewing. Kathy looks around the store. She clearly wants to say something, but Leonor avoids any eye contact.
C: KATHY
D: Leonor, do you have a minute?
C: LEONOR
D: I have to finish this for a client tonight.
C: KATHY
D: Tony is still not talking?
C: LEONOR
D: No. Not a word to me yesterday.
C: KATHY
D: Same with Jake.
C: LEONOR
D: It's very annoying.
C: KATHY
D: The one good thing, I have to say, is that Jake has been drawing and painting more than ever.
C: LEONOR
D: Is that good? Shooting Script 07/27/15 69.
C: KATHY
D: Yes! If he really wants to apply to LaGuardia, he needs to prepare a portfolio. Is Tony still planning on applying also?
C: LEONOR
D: How would I know? It's been four days and he hasn't said a word to me.
C: KATHY
D: Listen, Leonor, you know that I'm trained in conflict resolution, so I'm hoping I can help here, help settle this problem between you and our family.
C: LEONOR
D: Oh really? Has your husband asked you to do that?
C: KATHY
D: No. And by the way, he's been working really hard. I'm not sure you know that, but he's rehearsing for a new play.
C: LEONOR
D: No. I haven't seen your husband.
C: KATHY
D: I know he's been waiting to hear from you.
N: Leonor doesn't respond.
C: KATHY
D: Leonor?
N: Leonor continues to sew, until Kathy loses her patience, and slaps her hand on top of the piece of clothing Leonor is trying to sew.
C: KATHY
D: Can't we talk about what is really going on here?
N: Leonor is startled: a completely unexpected reaction from Kathy. She looks over to Bianca, to make sure she's not listening.
C: LEONOR
D: Shh. Not here. Shooting Script 07/27/15 70.
S: EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
N: Leonor smokes a cigarette in the backyard. Kathy is next to her.
C: KATHY
D: I know you think we're the rich people coming into this neighborhood, but the truth is Brian hasn't made any money in years. I've been supporting this family with my hard work.
C: LEONOR
D: That's not my problem.
C: KATHY
D: I know it's not. I'm just trying to talk about it.
C: LEONOR
D: You think talking is going to solve all your problems, don't you? You think you can use some of your psychology class tricks and just wash away the dirt here? That dirt is my sweat, sweetie. It's my life. It's not going to be that easy.
C: KATHY
D: I know that. What I want to tell you is we will give you time, but we need this money. We need the shop to cover its rent. That's not an unfair thing to ask of a tenant.
C: LEONOR
D: But I'm not a tenant. To Max I was more than a tenant. I was family. I belong here. And before you go any further; let me ask you: do you know how much work I've done here? The tile floors? The marble bathroom? That office in the back? I paid for all that.
N: Leonor throws her cigarette out. She turns and goes back into the store, leaving KATHY alone in the yard.

N: Julia is putting on her roller blades. Tony stands beside her, trying to make conversation. Shooting Script 07/27/15 71.
C: TONY
D: You look like you've been doing this acting thing forever.
C: JULIA
D: Really?
C: TONY
D: Like when you did the Emotional Recall exercise, it just seems so natural, I can't explain.
C: JULIA
D: You know, my father was a stunt man when I was a kid. So I spent a lot of time on sets and stuff.
C: TONY
D: So you have been doing this forever.
C: JULIA
D: No, because when I was eight years old he died.
C: TONY
D: Did he die doing a stunt?
C: JULIA
D: No! He had throat cancer.
C: TONY
D: Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.

C: JAKE
D: They're all very nice.
C: TONY

C: JAKE
D: Tell you what?
C: TONY
D: If you like someone.
N: Jake keeps sketching in his book.
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
C: TONY
D: That's what you always say.
C: JAKE
D: Well I do have an idea you might like.
C: TONY
D: What?

D: Eva talked about going dancing. There's a matinee club, like after hours, for kids.
C: TONY
D: When is it?
C: JAKE
D: Sunday afternoon, in the City. Shooting Script 07/27/15 73.
C: TONY
D: Let's go!
C: JAKE
D: It would be fun, right?
C: TONY
D: That would be perfect. If I can just dance with her...
N: Tony comes closer, to check out Jake's drawing.
C: TONY
D: Wow, that's getting good, Jake. I'm impressed.
S: INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT/TONY'S ROOM - NIGHT

C: NICK
D: Wait, wait. Let me do this for you. Don't worry. This is good luck. There you go. So tell me; what's going on? How's school? You still hoping for LaGuardia?
N: Leonor brings a cup with ice to the table.
C: LEONOR
D: C'mon, Antonio. You're not going to talk to your father?
N: Tony shakes his head no, and gives his father another hug. Shooting Script 07/27/15 74.
C: NICK
D: Did the cat get your tongue?
C: LEONOR
D: You forget he's too old for this kind of joke.
C: NICK
D: What happened?
C: LEONOR
D: He's mad at his mother.
C: NICK
D: What about?
C: LEONOR
D: Ask him.
N: Tony looks at them both; he's not budging.
C: NICK
D: Tony, now that I'm here you're not going to say anything to me?
N: Tony shrugs his shoulders. Nick looks at Leonor, questioning. She shrugs her shoulders too.
C: LEONOR
D: Go finish your homework, Antonio. We're having dinner soon.
S: INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Dinner is served. Leonor sits down and they start helping themselves to food. Tony, ever silent, pays attention closely to the conversation.
C: NICK
D: So what are you going to do, Leonor?
C: LEONOR
D: I don't know yet, but Hernàn is helping me out.
C: NICK
D: Hernàn? Isn't he a bankruptcy lawyer?
C: LEONOR
D: Yes. Shooting Script 07/27/15 75.
C: NICK
D: Is he the best person for this?
C: LEONOR
D: He's my friend. He knows strategy.
C: NICK
D: Are we talking about an exit strategy?
C: LEONOR
D: No. A fighting strategy.
C: NICK
D: But you should have an exit plan.
C: LEONOR
D: I intend to fight. They can't do this to me.
N: Tony eats, but his ears are clearly on the conversation. He is very curious about all this.
C: NICK
D: What if they can?
C: LEONOR
D: What do you want me to say, Nick? That I'm going to open a drug store? Start making furniture?
C: NICK
D: Or look for a job?
N: Leonor stops eating for a moment. She can't believe her ears.
C: LEONOR
D: You can't be serious.
C: NICK
D: Don't take everything so personally, Leonor. The world isn't always stacked up against you.
C: LEONOR
D: What does this have to do with anything?
C: NICK
D: Rent goes up. That's life in this city. These people are not doing this to you. Shooting Script 07/27/15 76.
C: LEONOR
D: Why do you always have to disagree with me?
C: NICK
D: I'm not disagreeing with you.
C: LEONOR
D: Can't you be on my side for once in your life?
C: NICK
D: I'm just being realistic. Life here is expensive. I think you should have a plan.
C: LEONOR
D: What do you think I'm doing? Do you think this is easy for me?
C: NICK
D: I know it's not.
C: LEONOR
D: That store is how I have raised our son. With not much help from you, thank you very much.
C: NICK
D: That's not true.
C: LEONOR
D: Really? Do you think that sending him a little gift at the end of the year is enough to keep him fed? To buy him clothes? To take him to a movie every so often?
C: NICK
D: Can we not talk about money now? Damn, Leonor. You spoil everything. I can't even eat.
N: At this, Tony bangs his fork and knife on the table, loudly.
S: INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT/TONY'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Tony and Nick are playing a video game on Tony's bed. They are both concentrated, playing and actually having fun. Shooting Script 07/27/15 77.
C: NICK
D: Can you keep a secret? Swear? I was invited to head the mission in Kinshasa. It's a nice big city for Africa. Oh no. No! No!! Shit.
E: playing the game
N: Tony smiles. He's winning. Nick jerks his body, tries hard, but it's too late. He's lost.
C: NICK
D: Not far from Angola. I'm finally going to have my own apartment. Why don't you come and stay with me for a while? We could go on a safari. The rainforest is incredible. They're famous for these big gorillas, hippopotamus, all kinds of animals.
N: Tony smiles, and gives his father a big hug.
C: NICK
D: This acting school thing. Is it serious?
N: Tony shakes his head yes.
C: NICK
D: How serious?
N: Tony shakes his head again. It's very serious.
C: NICK
D: That's good. There's a lot more in this world than Brooklyn.
N: Tony goes to hug his father.
C: NICK
D: Listen, Tony. I know your mom can be a little rough, but she's just worried about you. You're not a kid anymore, and she needs you to look out for her. I need you to look out for her.

S: EXT. MIDTOWN PLAZA - DAY
N: Audrey and Brian sit on a bench in a concrete garden in Midtown, the plaza of a great building, drinking to-go coffees.
C: AUDREY
D: Well, Dad must have really liked her. That part I think she's probably right about. He never raised the rent on the store. Not even once in more than eight years. And now Leonor's lawyer is charging us for improvements she made in the store.
C: BRIAN
D: What does that mean?
C: AUDREY
D: She wants to fight. The woman is trouble, Brian. Once again, our warm, lovable, unwise father left us with a big mess, and no instructions.
N: They both take that in.
C: AUDREY
D: Is it terrible, Brian, that I don't really miss him?
C: BRIAN
D: No, it's not terrible. It's sad, but I don't blame you.
C: AUDREY
D: Do you miss him?
C: BRIAN
D: Sometimes. But I live in his house, so I probably think about him more than you do.
C: AUDREY
D: She's claiming she has the right to stay paying almost nothing. I think we should start the eviction process as soon as possible.
C: BRIAN
D: I don't want to have to do that. Shooting Script 07/27/15 79.
C: AUDREY
D: It takes a while, you know.
C: BRIAN
D: I just don't want this to get ugly. The boys are best friends now.
C: AUDREY
D: Remember that Dad worked very hard to leave us something. Now you have a nice big apartment, and I'm getting nothing.
C: BRIAN
D: Just give me a little more time.
C: AUDREY
D: I can't do this without you, you know.
S: INT. KID'S DISCO - DAY
N: It's Studio 54 for KIDS and young TEENAGERS. Jake emerges from the bathroom and discovers a dance floor packed with boys and girls dancing in groups or doing solo numbers. Some come up with elaborate choreographies, while others just shake their bodies best they can. Many of them are in costumes, some with lights blinking, laser flash lights and other Disco toys. In the middle of the dance floor, Julia and Tony dance with each other - no choreography here, just plain dancing and having fun. He gives it all he's got, admiring her, while she closes her eyes, and lets the music take her away. She opens her eyes, and sees Tony looking at her. Julia smiles at him and they have a little moment dancing. Tony feels confident.
C: TONY
D: Hey, do you want to come with me to the beach?
N: Julia has a hard time hearing him.
C: TONY
D: The beach! This summer! You want to come with me?
N: She just keeps on dancing. Shooting Script 07/27/15 80.
C: TONY
D: Yes? No?
C: JULIA
D: No, Tony. You're really nice and everything..., but I'm into older guys.
N: Tony's legs slow down, he loses his rhythm.
C: TONY
D: Oh, okay. Thank you for being honest.
N: He's moved a little farther away and she has a harder time hearing him.
C: JULIA
D: What?
C: TONY
D: Thank you for being honest.
E: shouting
N: A couple of GIRLS begin to dance with Julia, and Tony gradually moves away from her. For a moment, he seems lost on the dance floor. He looks around, and only see strangers. By the bar, Jake watches Tony on the dance floor.
S: INT/EXT. SUBWAY - DUSK
N: SHOTS of the city passing by at night from inside a subway train. There's only a few people inside the subway. Tony and Jake are on a bench together, not talking. It's the end of a long day.

N: Brian walks down the street, coming home late from rehearsal. As he approaches his house, he sees something that catches his attention. He moves closer, and takes out his phone to light a sign posted on the window of the store. On the window, a sign: HELP WANTED - experience in retail required. Shooting Script 07/27/15 81.
S: INT. JARDINE APARTMENT - NIGHT

C: KATHY
D: Sure.
N: He sits next to her, and pours some wine in both glasses.
C: KATHY
D: How'd it go?
C: BRIAN
D: I think it's going to be great. I love my part, I love the actors, the play is fantastic.
C: KATHY
D: I'll toast to that.
N: They make a toast, but Brian seems tense.
C: KATHY
D: What's going on?
C: BRIAN
D: Did you see the sign Leonor has posted in the window?
C: KATHY
D: No, I didn't see anything.
C: BRIAN
D: She doesn't acknowledge the new lease, she doesn't try to negotiate and she has no plans of leaving. And now she's actually hiring new people, can you believe it?
C: KATHY
D: I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
C: BRIAN
D: Audrey wants to start an eviction process. She has a lawyer ready to go already. Shooting Script 07/27/15 82.
C: KATHY
D: Good. Then it's decided.
C: BRIAN
D: Is it?
N: Kathy takes a sip.
C: KATHY
D: Who's going to tell Jake?
C: BRIAN
D: I will. It's my problem.
C: KATHY
D: Well then tell him soon. Please.
C: BRIAN
D: He's just being so childish lately.
S: 59A INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/JAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 59A

N: The stage is set; a lawn by a lake, a dead seagull and the wall of a house in the background. Brian and the actress playing NINA are in costume and in character. It's opening night.
C: NINA
D: What are you writing?
C: BRIAN/TRIGORIN
D: An idea for a short story. A young girl grows up on the shores of a lake, as you have.
N: Brian/Trigorin looks intently into Nina's eyes.
C: BRIAN/TRIGORIN
D: She loves the lake as the gulls do, and is as happy and free as they are. But a man sees her who happens to come that way, and he destroys her out of idleness, and this seagull here has been destroyed. Shooting Script 07/27/15 83.

D: We are not going away, after all.
N: Nina stands by herself at the front of the stage.
C: NINA
D: It is a dream!
N: The lights go out, and the audience begins to clap vigorously. Kathy sits next to Tony, who is next to Jake. Jake is clapping most vigorously of all.
S: INT. JARDINE CAR - NIGHT
N: Brian is driving his car through the city. Kathy is sitting in the passenger seat next to him, holding a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. And in the back, Jake and Tony are there, sitting next to Roger, Brian's agent.
C: ROGER
D: It's in your delivery. It's very natural. You really manage to make Trigorin feel contemporary.
C: BRIAN
D: Well, thank you, Roger.
C: ROGER
D: He's like one of those famous artists we meet at a party, you know? You're excited at first, but the minute you start a conversation, you're begging not to be left alone with the guy. Shooting Script 07/27/15 84.
C: BRIAN
D: Is that a good thing?
C: ROGER
D: Yes!
C: KATHY
D: He's such a tormented artist. It's wonderful.
N: Brian stops the car in front of Roger's apartment building.
C: ROGER
D: And there were some really funny parts too.

D: Isn't it! Chekhov called it a comedy in four acts.
C: ROGER

C: BRIAN
D: It is.
E: laughing
N: Roger squeezes Brian's shoulder, and leans over the seat to give Kathy a kiss.

C: ROGER
D: Bye fellas. You should be very proud of this man here!

C: BRIAN
D: So?
N: Jake and Tony smile. Shooting Script 07/27/15 85.
C: KATHY
D: Jake? It's your dad's opening night.
C: BRIAN
D: Did you understand why Nina says she's the seagull?
N: Jake shakes his head yes, Tony shakes his no.
C: KATHY
D: Brian. They're kids. To be honest, I'm not even sure I get that part.
N: The boys look at each other and start laughing.
C: KATHY
D: But that doesn't take anything away from the pleasure of the story.
N: Brian drives on, silent. Suddenly, he pulls the car over, and shifts the gear to park, then turns around, and faces the boys. He's upset.
C: BRIAN
D: Do either of you care about anyone other than yourselves?
N: Jake is startled, trying to figure out who to answer to, his father or his friend.
C: BRIAN
D: Jake? Say something.
N: Jake looks at Tony, who is shaking his head vigorously.
C: BRIAN
D: Say something!
N: Jake is frozen.
C: BRIAN
D: One of the hardest things to realize as a child is that your parents are people too. Can you understand that? That they care about things. That they make mistakes. That they try to do what they think is right. Does any of what I'm saying make any sense to you?
N: Jake shakes his head yes. Tony laughs. Shooting Script 07/27/15 86.
C: BRIAN
D: What's so funny, Tony? Why don't you tell me, what's funny?? You think being an actor is easy? You think you have it in you for one rejection after another? Let's see how you react when you don't get into LaGuardia. Let's just see then.
C: KATHY
D: Brian...
C: BRIAN
D: God damn it!!
N: He turns around, and puts the gear in drive, lurching back into the street. The boys look at each other. They are a little frightened, and a little victorious.
S: INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY
N: Leonor picks up a dress from a pile on the main table, and shows it to the new salesgirl, VALENTINA.
C: LEONOR
D: Dresses go over there, on that rack on the left. Before you hang them, make sure they have a price tag. Also, try to arrange them by color, or tone. I usually like to start with lighter colors in the front, and end with darker ones. Black goes in the back. The women here like black a lot, so if they're looking for a little black dress, they might see a lot of other stuff before they get there.
C: VALENTINA
D: I see. So if they don't know what they want, I try to keep them here in the front first, and then show them the ones in the back.
C: LEONOR
D: Unless they ask specifically for black.
N: They hear a bell RINGING, and look towards the door. Brian comes in. Shooting Script 07/27/15 87.
C: VALENTINA
D: Hello. Can I help you?
C: LEONOR
D: It's okay, Valentina. It's for me. This is Brian Jardine, our neighbor. He's a great actor.
C: VALENTINA
D: Oh really? Have I seen you in anything?
C: BRIAN
D: I doubt it.
C: LEONOR
D: He's in a new play. What is it called?
C: BRIAN
D: The Seagull.
C: LEONOR
D: Oh. That must be very popular.
C: BRIAN
D: Can you give me five minutes alone? Please?
S: EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
N: Leonor and Brian are standing outside. Leonor lights a cigarette.
C: LEONOR
D: The day your father died, he came by in the morning. I asked him to buy me a pack of cigarettes, and then I never saw him again.
N: Leonor gets emotional, and a tear rolls down her face.
C: LEONOR
D: Your father cared about me, Brian. Do you believe that? Every day we would talk, and we would share things with each other. Have you ever had a friend like that? Someone you could tell anything? Shooting Script 07/27/15 88.
C: BRIAN
D: Only my wife. I'm a lot like Jake. I've never been good at having close friends.
N: Leonor takes another drag.
C: BRIAN
D: I hope you can understand that what's happening is nothing personal.
C: LEONOR
D: I can't afford to pay three times the rent I paid your father. It's not possible. I can't survive.
N: Brian doesn't respond.
C: LEONOR
D: I thought you were in a new big play.
C: BRIAN
D: I am in a new play. But it's not big, and it's not a lot of money. It's just the way it is, Leonor. I'm fortunate enough to have had a father who left me a house in Brooklyn.
C: LEONOR
D: He wanted me to stay here. He told me so.
C: BRIAN
D: Leonor. I also have a sister, and she has her own family, and we all have to decide together what to do. It's not just up to me.
N: Leonor takes a moment, and then proceeds in a new direction.
C: LEONOR
D: You know your father thought your sister was the one who inherited his brains.
N: Brian doesn't know how to respond. Shooting Script 07/27/15 89.
C: BRIAN
D: They were very much alike. I'm sure he would agree with Audrey that, above everything, it's important to take care of business.
C: LEONOR
D: No. He wouldn't have agreed. I can promise you that.
C: BRIAN
D: Leonor, what do you want me to say? I have a family. We have bills too.
C: LEONOR
D: Do you know why your father didn't go to your son's birthday party, the last one?
C: BRIAN
D: He had the flu.
C: LEONOR
D: No. That's maybe what he told you. The truth is, he was embarrassed, Brian. He was embarrassed that everything in your house was paid for by your wife. He thought you should be more of a man. He hated being around you.
N: Brian tries to swallow some coffee, but the cup is empty.
C: BRIAN
D: Well, he's not around anymore, is he.
C: LEONOR
D: He certainly isn't.
S: INT. CASA DE MODA/OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Leonor is on the couch in the office, while Hernàn, her lawyer, sits on the edge of the desk holding official court room papers. He's very serious, and she's clearly very upset.

N: He hands her a piece of paper, which she reads. Shooting Script 07/27/15 90.
C: LEONOR
D: What am I going to do? I can't afford this.
N: Hernàn comes closer and puts his hand on her shoulder. The door opens all of a sudden, and Tony storms in, frightening Leonor.
C: LEONOR
D: Jesus! I told you to knock before you come in. What do you want?
N: Tony laughs at the fright he's given Leonor.
C: LEONOR
D: I am so tired of you playing this silly game!
N: Tony realizes by the tone of her voice that this is serious.
C: HERNÀN
D: I'm sorry, Leonor.
N: He takes the paper from Leonor's hands.
C: LEONOR
D: Where do they even get this number?
N: Her eyes fill up with angry tears.
C: HERNÀN
D: The penalty for overstaying may seem like a high number, and it is. That's why it's in the contract; to prevent that the tenant overstays paying below the market rent indefinitely.
C: LEONOR
D: Isn't there anything else we can do?
C: HERNÀN
D: Leonor, I've done everything I can. It's over now. You have a week to leave the premises.

S: EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/STAIRWELL - NIGHT
N: The empty stairwell. The doorbell rings. Brian comes down the stairwell to the front door of the house. The bell RINGS again, just as he OPENS the door. Tony is there, with his mom behind him.
C: TONY
D: Hello, Mr. J. Is Jake home?
N: Brian takes in that Tony is talking to him for the first time in weeks.
C: BRIAN
D: Yes, he's doing his homework.
C: TONY
D: I'd like to talk to him if I could.
C: BRIAN
D: Of course, Tony. Come in.
N: Leonor catches his eye.
C: BRIAN
D: Why don't you both come in. Leonor. Please.
N: They walk up the stairs to the apartment.
S: INT. JARDINE APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: The door to Jake's room is closed. Brian and Leonor sit together just outside at the dining room table. Kathy is standing a few feet away, at the kitchen door. Shooting Script 07/27/15 92. They have been waiting for awhile, waiting for the boys to emerge. It's clearly an awkward situation for everyone.
C: KATHY
D: You sure I can't get you something, Leonor.
C: LEONOR
D: Yes, I'm fine.
N: Another moment of awkward silence... Until suddenly the door opens and Jake comes running out.
C: JAKE
D: Mom! Dad! Mom!!
C: BRIAN
D: He talks! Jacob talks!
C: JAKE
D: Mom!!!
C: KATHY
D: What's going on?!
C: JAKE
D: Mom, Tony told me Leonor is being evacuated from the store!
C: KATHY
D: It's not an evacuation. It's an eviction.
C: JAKE
D: That's worse!
C: JAKE
D: How could you do that? How could you do that to them? Dad??
C: BRIAN
D: It's a terrible situation.
C: JAKE
D: The rent is too expensive! She can't afford it, Mom. So Dad needs to give her a discount so she can!
C: BRIAN
D: Your mother and I wanted to talk to you, Jake, but this not talking didn't help! Shooting Script 07/27/15 93.
C: KATHY
D: Don't blame this on him.
C: JAKE
D: It's okay, I'm talking now! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do that again. I promise. Dad, I promise.
C: BRIAN
D: Jake, calm down.
C: JAKE
D: I have a great idea.
C: BRIAN
D: Let me explain to you, Jake. Grandpa Max left this house not just for the three of us here.
C: JAKE
D: I know. He loved Leonor too. Tony told me!
C: BRIAN
D: He liked Leonor, of course, but he left the house for us, and also for Aunt Audrey.
C: JAKE
D: But I have an idea! I know how we can make it work! We go back to our old apartment, and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey. Tony and I are both going to be at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I won't need to take the subway or anything to school. I can walk. And you'll be closer to the theater. I loved the show, Dad. I loved it. Tony did too. We both talked about it a lot afterwards. You were so good! And I thought it was really complex and everything. I'm sorry I didn't tell you then. I'm sorry. But I loved it. I really did!
N: Leonor, Tony, Kathy, and Brian all look in silence as Jake goes on, trying to make this adult mess make sense again. Shooting Script 07/27/15 94.

C: BRIAN

D: There was a bump on the path...
C: PARK RANGER
D: We got a call from a woman who saw Jake here flying through the air and landing on the asphalt. When we found him, he couldn't move.
C: JAKE
D: I'm better now.

C: JAKE
D: There was a bump, I didn't see.

C: JAKE
D: Yeah. Go slow.
C: KATHY
D: And how's your arm? Can you move it okay?
C: JAKE
D: It hurts when I go like this.
N: He moves it up and down a hair. Brian is standing behind them, in the dark.
C: BRIAN
D: Dad had a heating pad that he used to use. I can't find it. You know where it is?
E: to Kathy
C: KATHY

C: JAKE
D: I just need to finish one painting, and then I'm done.
C: BRIAN
D: That's what you said last week. You just had to finish one painting.
C: JAKE
D: I want them to be good.
C: BRIAN
D: Jake, do you by any chance remember that story I told you, about my friend Tina?
C: JAKE
D: The one who sold her hair in India for a train ticket?
C: BRIAN
D: No, that was Martine. Tina was a girl I knew in high school who was a dancer. Her mother was a dancer. She was literally born to be a dancer. She had a perfect ballet dancer's body, and all of us were certain she was going to be a big success.
C: JAKE
D: Have I seen her dance?
C: BRIAN
D: No. During high school, she got into a really good conservatory, and I ran into her a couple of times after that, and she was always about to get this, or about to get that. But each time, her arm would be in a sling, or she would be on crutches. She would have a pulled ligament. Or a stress fracture in her back. The last time I saw her, I ran into her on the subway, it was clear she hadn't danced for years. She was fat. You would have never imagined that she was the same girl.
C: JAKE
D: Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very encouraging story. Shooting Script 07/27/15 98.
C: BRIAN
D: Why do you think Tina didn't go very far?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know.
C: BRIAN
D: She trained too hard. She practiced too much. She didn't trust her own natural abilities.
N: He continues to wrap the bandage.
C: BRIAN
D: Jake, you're going to meet a lot of really talented people in your life. But they won't all be suited to be artists, they won't all have the brains to know when to insist, and when to stop. When to push yourself, and when to relax. Most of them won't have that balance.
C: JAKE
D: And how do I know if I have the balance?
C: BRIAN
D: That's why I'm telling you this, because you'll turn in your portfolio soon, and they're going to love it. They're going to love you. I know they will. You'll go to LaGuardia, and you'll have fun, but also plenty of challenges. Soon enough you'll find out if you have the balance.
N: The bandage is done.
C: BRIAN
D: There you go. Do you know if Tony got in?
C: JAKE
D: I don't know. I don't know what he's doing.
N: Brian looks at Jake.
C: BRIAN
D: Son. I wish I'd done things differently. Shooting Script 07/27/15 99.
C: JAKE
D: What do you mean?
C: BRIAN
D: With Tony, and his mother. I wish I had told you earlier what was going on.
C: JAKE
D: Would it have changed anything?
C: BRIAN
D: No, probably not. But still.
C: JAKE
D: Dad, would you mind if I give you some advice? Would that be okay.
C: BRIAN
D: Please.
C: JAKE
D: Don't worry so much.
N: Brian waits for more.
C: JAKE
D: That's all.
C: BRIAN
D: That's a lot.
N: Brian gives Jake a kiss on the forehead, and stands up.
C: JAKE
D: Dad, would you mind if I play one of my video games? I know it's Tuesday, and I know I should do something more productive with my time, but I'm kind of tired.
C: BRIAN
D: Of course, Son.
N: Brian finds the game controller, and hands it Jake.
C: JAKE
D: Will Mom be mad?
C: BRIAN
D: I don't think so. Shooting Script 07/27/15 100.

N: Jake and his friends enter the formal and elegant Beaux Arts Court. Across the way, between arches, Jake sees a group of kids in khaki's and red shirts -- Tony's Catholic school uniform -- walking in the opposite direction.
