S: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING
N: MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again.
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING Mark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school. He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: Mark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. A portrait of President Reagan hangs on the painted cinder block wall. A clock ticks.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Mark's on stage. An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders.
C: MARK
D: Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it?
N: The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time.
C: MARK
D: In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it.
C: MARK
D: Does anyone know what this is?
E: CONT'D
N: As a couple of kids start to raise their hands --
C: MARK
D: Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again?
E: CONT'D THEN
N: Silence. A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. The rest are completely frozen.
C: MARK
D: Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
N: A SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase.
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: Twenty... and... no one-hundreds...
N: She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold.
C: MARK
D: And this is for the trophy case.
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: I'm sorry?... For what?
C: MARK
D: For the trophy case. With the trophies.
E: BEAT
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: It's an elementary school.
N: As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR:
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: Can I take your order?
E: V.O.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ARBY'S - DAY
N: A long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a mustache takes Mark's order. Mark looks up at the menu sign.
C: MARK
D: I'll have a # 4.
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: # 4. Anything to drink?
C: MARK
D: No. Can I get extra meat on that?
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: 65 cents.
C: MARK
D: What are you talking about?
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: Extra meat costs extra.
C: MARK
D: Where's it say that?
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: I don't know. I just know I'm supposed to charge extra for extra meat.
C: MARK
D: I always get extra meat. Every time I come here.
C: FAST FOOD KID
D: It's extra for extra meat. They told me. 65 cents.

N: I/E. MARK'S FORD STATION WAGON/ ARBY'S PARKING LOT - DAY Mark sits in his car, eating his sandwich - no enjoyment, just fueling himself. His RADIO plays a commercial.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - AFTERNOON
N: DAVE SCHULTZ (31, bearded, intelligent, 163 lbs., strong, fierce, but calm), Head Coach of U of W wrestling, stands on the wrestling mat speaking VERY QUIETLY with 3 or 4 select WRESTLERS from the team. We can't quite hear what Dave is saying to them, but we can sense immediately the reverence and deep respect they have for Dave - one of the country's top wrestlers and great coaches. The scene gives off the feeling one might have watching a horse whisperer with a small group of stallions. Whatever he's saying, they are calmed by him, pay absolute attention, will do whatever he asks.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING
N: A cheaply built 70s-era structure, where Mark inhabits two small rooms with a cheap kitchenette built into the wall of one of them. A particle-board BOOKCASE houses a little SHRINE of Mark's medals - and PHOTOS of him and Dave. Mark retrieves his briefcase from inside the garbage bag and extracts his GOLD MEDAL. He replaces it in the PLASTIC DISPLAY CASE on the top shelf, next to the photo of him and Dave smiling with their gold medals around their necks.

S: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Mark dumps a package of TOP RAMEN NOODLES into boiling water. And another package. And another.

N: Mark sits on his one metal FOLDING CHAIR, at his table, eating his bowl of noodles. Moths tap against the window.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER/NIGHT
N: Mark, in just boxer shorts, crosses off another day on his wall calendar. 427 days to Seoul. He looks around, then drops to the floor and starts a monstrous number of push-ups.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - EARLY MORNING
N: Mark runs hard past warehouses and auto repair outlets.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FIELD AND HILL NEXT TO CAR DEMOLITION YARD - MORNING
N: Mark runs through knee-high weeds dragging a CAR TIRE attached to a rope behind him. He reaches a hill and heads straight up, dragging the tire all the way -

N: An ink-stained directory of Wisconsin Public Schools lies open on the kitchen table.
C: MARK
D: I won a freestyle wrestling gold medal at the `84 Olympics.
E: ON PHONE
N: Mark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK TAPE into a cheap VCR. He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a second VCR, wired to the first. We can read the label: "THE MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC." He starts making a copy.
C: MARK
D: I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join...
E: ON PHONE CONT'D

N: Mark throws Karabajak to the mat. Pins him. Walks away, arms raised. Crowd cheers. Karabajak's on the mat, hurt.

S: EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING
N: Mark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7- 11, an Auto-Zone. He eats a hard-boiled egg. He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. Dave gets out, looks up.
C: DAVE
D: Where were you today?
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the faucet.
C: DAVE
D: How far'd you run? Ten?
N: Mark's on the tattered couch. He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him.
C: DAVE
D: More than ten? Dragging weight the whole way? You're a sick fuck, you know that?
E: CONT'D Dave turns off the water
N: Dave turns to look at Mark, sitting in the bare living room.
C: DAVE
D: Place is looking good, by the way. I like what you've done with it.
E: CONT'D
N: Dave notices the Public Schools Directory on the table.
C: DAVE
D: You setting up clinics?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Talked to some coaches.
N: Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him.
C: DAVE
D: I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday.
C: MARK
D: Why?
C: DAVE
D: I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You free?
C: MARK
D: I'll check.
N: He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.
C: MARK
D: You said Saturday or Sunday?
E: CONT'D
C: DAVE
D: Saturday.
C: MARK
D: Saturday could work.
N: He comes back in.
C: DAVE
D: Good. Thank you.
N: Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS labels and a pen and writes the information.
C: DAVE
D: Coach Vinson, Radnor High. I'll let him know you'll call tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
N: He peels off the label and slaps it on Mark's leg.
C: DAVE
D: And Mark. Please come back to the gym. You don't have to do anything with the team. Just train with me.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark's just looking at his older brother.
C: DAVE
D: I need you there. Stay focused on what's important. For both of us. Seoul's the goal.
E: CONT'D
N: Beat. Beat. Then, Mark nods at his brother.
C: MARK
D: Seoul's the goal.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
N: Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in wrestling gear, sit on the mat in front of Mark. He seems manic, evangelical, not tuned into his audience.
C: MARK
D: The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. You can't hide. You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. I can take the pain. My brother Dave can take the pain. Can you take the pain?
N: Blank looks from the teenage wrestlers. Mark gestures to a table set up near the door, on which is his OPEN BRIEFCASE, with a stack of TAPES.
C: MARK
D: I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - DAY
N: Mark exits the locker room in his wrestling gear, heading for the MATS. Dave's in his wrestling gear, on the far side of the gym, talking with TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN in blazers with USA WRESTLING INSIGNIA. Mark walks onto the mat, waits for him. Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists, hands, neck. Dave walks over to him.
C: DAVE
D: You remember Fred Cole from USA Wrestling.
N: The men walk up behind Dave.
C: FRED COLE
D: Hey there, Mark, how you been?
N: Mark sort of nods, but doesn't really respond.
C: FRED COLE
D: All right, Dave. Let us know if we can count on you. We'll talk soon.
E: CONT'D beat, then turns to Dave
N: Dave nods. They walk away. Then Dave turns back to Mark.
C: MARK
D: You been calling me and hanging up?
C: DAVE
D: No. What do you mean?
E: adjusting his knee brace
N: Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. For several seconds, they look at each other. Then, slowly at first: They start to circle each other. We sense immediately their differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique belies his quickness and enormous strength. Mark's defining characteristic is brute force. A weight class heavier than Dave, he can NEVER SEEM TO BEAT HIS OLDER BROTHER. The wrestling becomes intense and violent - Mark's head slams into Dave's nose, drawing BLOOD. This only energizes Dave, who slams Mark to the mat - dripping blood onto him. VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with: Dave rides Mark, who's on his stomach, flattened and splayed - grappling for a hold. Mark glances up to SEE: The USA Wrestling men WATCHING from near the door. Mark looks away, gritting his teeth, but Dave's gotten his hold. As Dave TURNS and slams the bigger Mark -

N: Mark looks out the window. Silence. They sit there, both bruised and bloodied.
C: MARK
D: Sorry about your nose.
C: DAVE
D: No, you're not. Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids.
E: BEAT
N: Mark's still looking out the window. He speaks quietly -
C: MARK
D: You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect.
N: He reaches for the door handle.
C: DAVE
D: Hey. Gimme a hug.
N: Dave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck.
C: DAVE
D: Same time tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark nods, gets out of the car and walks away.

S: INT. HELICOPTER (AIRBORNE) - DAY
N: Mark watches out the clear Plexi as the Pennsylvania countryside spreads out below him. He and Brandon and the pilot (LARRY - 50s, aviator glasses, Air Cavalry patch on his jacket) all wear RADIO MIC HEADSETS.
C: BRANDON
D: Mr. du Pont would have flown you himself, but he was asked at the last minute for tactical assistance by the Newtown Square Police Department.
E: ON RADIO MIC
N: Mark has no idea what that means, but nods his head. BRANDON (ON RADIO MIC) (CONT'D) He should be back at the estate by the time we get there. Larry BANKS the plane steeply on Mark's side so Mark has an unobstructed view of the ground.
C: LARRY
D: Valley Forge below you.
E: ON RADIO MIC
N: They speed over the historic site - wide fields, the memorial arch, wood fences, the old stone house.

N: They enter. It's at once grandly elegant and musty.
C: BRANDON
D: Feel free to look around the library. Mr. du Pont will be up shortly.
N: Shuts the door behind him. Mark's never been in a room like this - oil paintings of du Pont ancestors; foxhounds, horses, hunts. Leather-bound books share space with framed OLD STAMPS and antique (and not so antique) PISTOLS. Framed PHOTOS of the same man (JOHN DU PONT - 50, thin, beak-nosed, blond-grey hair) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan... Henry Kissinger. Mark's standing, gazing at the photos, when the door opens, revealing JOHN DU PONT, a police-issue HOLSTER dangling from one hand. He stops and breathlessly regards Mark.
C: DU PONT
D: You're actually here.
C: MARK
D: Oh. Yes, sir.
C: DU PONT
D: In my study.
C: MARK
D: They said it was the library.
E: no idea what to say
C: DU PONT
D: It is.
N: Du Pont puts the holster onto a chair. Holds out his hand.

D: John du Pont.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Mark Sch --
C: DU PONT
D: - I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home -
N: (You quickly realize that du Pont can be voluble and charming, but the more time you spend with him, the more you see what an effort this is for him - how essentially uncomfortable he is in his own skin.... Also, he just might have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in.) Mark sits. Du Pont settles in, sits facing him - focused entirely on Mark. He speaks intimately, sincerely
C: DU PONT
D: I watched the video of your Olympic run again last night. After you broke the arm of the Turk - after they disqualified you, handed you a loss - after they put an extra official on you to watch your holds - all of which were legal - after all that you rack up seven straight wins to take the medal. For your country. Thrilling. Thrilling. Inspiring. Take the gold medal.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark can't recall when he's received this kind of attention.
C: MARK
D: Thank you, sir. I'm proud of that day.
C: DU PONT
D: You should be. I'm proud of that day. I'm proud of you on that day. Your parents must be enormously proud.
C: MARK
D: To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk.
E: after a moment
N: Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. When he doesn't -
C: DU PONT
D: I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. I know it cuts into your training. I imagine that's every day for you?
C: MARK
D: Yes sir, it is.
C: DU PONT
D: Strength training in the morning? Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. In the morning?
C: MARK
D: Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ?
C: DU PONT
D: Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him.
C: MARK
D: - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice.
C: DU PONT
D: University of Wisconsin.
C: MARK
D: Yes sir.
C: DU PONT
D: Where you both coach.
N: Mark NODS vaguely.
C: DU PONT
D: And they provide you with everything you need?
E: CONT'D
N: Beat.
C: MARK
D: Pretty much.
N: A moment as du Pont watches Mark.
C: DU PONT
D: I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament -
C: MARK
D: - Thank you -
C: DU PONT
D: - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes?
C: MARK
D: It's the world championship.
N: Du Pont nods.
C: DU PONT
D: Why do you do it, Mark?
N: Mark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked.
C: DU PONT
D: Why?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: I want to be the best in the world.
E: simply no other reason
C: DU PONT
D: I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world. May I speak frankly?
E: THEN
N: Mark nods... of course.
C: DU PONT
D: I'm concerned. I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. Fails to honor it and fails to support it.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark's staring at du Pont intently.
C: DU PONT
D: When did you win your first match?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: I started kind of late - high school sophomore.
N: Du Pont waits, listening...
C: MARK
D: I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand...
E: CONT'D MORE
C: MARK
D: there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up --
E: CONT'D
N: Mark stops - face flushed - tries to stop himself from getting CHOKED UP. After a few moments, he speaks quietly:
C: MARK
D: It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it.
E: CONT'D

N: Silence as they look out over the national park.

E: CONT'D
N: Then du Pont speaks, as much to Mark as to himself -

N: Lots of U of W wrestlers, coaches, wives, girlfriends, kids. Dave's at the BBQ, carving a huge roast on a spit with a long CARVING KNIFE. Mark's talking to him -
C: MARK
D: 25 thousand a year. He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with -
C: DAVE
D: Who you gonna train with?
C: MARK
D: No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. Together.
C: DAVE
D: What does du Pont get out of it?
C: MARK
D: As soon as you meet him you'll understand. He sees what we're after. He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. He wants to help us win, help restore our pride.
C: DAVE
D: My pride is fine.

D: No, not.... This country's pride.

D: Dave - this is it. This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else...
E: CONT'D
N: Nancy has wandered over, Danielle on her hip.
C: NANCY
D: - What're you guys talking about?
C: MARK
D: I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you?
N: Nancy and Dave share a glance. Then Nancy turns to walk away.
C: NANCY
D: Always good to see you, Mark. Please, eat our food, shit on our lawn. Enjoy yourself...
E: as she walks away
N: The brothers are silent for a long moment until she's gone.
C: MARK
D: Why does she...
N: He trails off. Then, a bit desperate -
C: MARK
D: The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing...
E: CONT'D
N: Dave speaks gently.
C: DAVE
D: I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school...
N: The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. He's shell-shocked.
C: MARK
D: The Worlds are sixty days away.
C: DAVE
D: Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with?
C: MARK
D: Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. I don't know how to do this without you.
E: LOST beat, then, very quietly
C: DAVE
D: Do what?
N: The answer is "everything" -- but Mark just shakes his head.
C: DAVE
D: It sounds like an opportunity.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Does it?
C: DAVE
D: I think you could make something of it.
C: MARK
D: Do you? A spot's always open for you if you decide to come.
E: DAVE NODS
C: DAVE
D: Thank you.
N: Dave steps forward and holds out his arms -
C: DAVE
D: Congrats, little brother.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. Nancy looks over.
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING Mark packs his apartment - trashing just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing the few essentials in his AMC GREMLIN.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DRIVING - DAY
N: Mark drives across Ohio.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY
N: Mark pulls onto the estate grounds.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY
N: Mark rings the doorbell. No answer. He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID.
C: MARK
D: Hi. I'm Mark Schultz.
N: Silence. That means nothing to her.
C: MARK
D: I'm here to see John du Pont?
E: CONT'D
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?
C: MARK
D: Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime.
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: Just a moment, please.
C: MARK
D: In the meantime can I use the -
N: She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener.
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: Please.
E: opening the door
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS
N: They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door.
C: MARK
D: Is he? He's in there?
E: CONFUSED
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: The washroom.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Floral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet. Mark pisses - mouth open, eyes half shut. He flushes. He looks at a dish holding little pastel horseshoes. Soap? He picks one up, smells it. Washes his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap. He wipes his hands on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes. He opens the door.
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: Mr. Beck will see you now.
N: Mark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STAN BECK'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
N: Mark is let into a large third floor office with a big desk, wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves. STAN BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from behind the desk as Mark enters.
C: STAN BECK
D: Come in, sit down.
C: MARK
D: Thanks.
C: STAN BECK
D: Thank you, Rosie.
C: UNIFORMED MAID
D: You're welcome, Mr. Beck.
N: She exits, closing the door behind her.
C: STAN BECK
D: Okay. Okay. So. Mark Schultz, correct?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: STAN BECK
D: S-C-H-U-L-T-Z?
E: opens a folder, writing
C: MARK
D: That's right.
C: STAN BECK
D: ... M-A-R-K?
N: Mark just looks at him. Beat. Then he nods.
C: STAN BECK
D: All right. Mark. I manage affairs for Mr. du Pont. Look after his interests. If you have a problem, you come to me. If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, I'll come to you. Okay?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Sounds okay.
C: STAN BECK
D: Let's talk about what you're doing here. I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. Does that sound like a good policy to you?
C: MARK
D: That could be a good policy.
C: STAN BECK
D: Good. I think so, too. First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. It's not a free ride. In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. Understood?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: STAN BECK
D: I'm sure you can appreciate that.
C: MARK
D: Of course.
C: STAN BECK
D: That goes for every wrestler.
C: MARK
D: I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster.
N: He pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket.
C: STAN BECK
D: What about the other half?
C: MARK
D: I've been making phone calls.
E: BEAT
C: STAN BECK
D: I'll take a look at that when you've finished. All right. Now.
N: Stan takes out a form, writes on it as Mark puts away list.
C: STAN BECK
D: Your age?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Twenty-seven.
C: STAN BECK
D: Education?
C: MARK
D: Oklahoma University.
C: STAN BECK
D: Undergraduate?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: STAN BECK
D: You graduated?
C: MARK
D: Yes.
C: STAN BECK
D: Do you own any property?
C: MARK
D: No.
C: STAN BECK
D: Are your parents still married?
C: MARK
D: No.
E: BEAT
C: STAN BECK
D: How old were you when they separated?
C: MARK
D: Two.
C: STAN BECK
D: Have you ever been accused of a crime?
C: MARK
D: No.
N: The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally --
C: MARK
D: Mr. du Pont.
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont seems surprised to see Mark. He stays in the doorway, waves slightly.
C: DU PONT
D: Ah. Hello. You've arrived.
C: MARK
D: Yes sir, I drove straight down.
N: It's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. He looks at Stan. Stan hands him a sheet of paper.
C: STAN
D: Tonight's speech. All set.
N: John takes the paper and glances at it. Then -
C: DU PONT
D: They're setting him up in the chalet?
C: STAN BECK
D: Yes, sir.
C: DU PONT
D: Excellent bed. Firm mattress. Good for the lower back.
E: SILENCE
C: MARK
D: Great.
C: DU PONT
D: All right.
C: MARK
D: All right. Thank you, sir.
N: And du Pont's gone, closing the door behind him. Beat.
C: STAN BECK
D: Shall we finish this?
N: Mark sits.
C: STAN BECK
D: Have you ever been sued?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: No.
C: STAN BECK
D: Have you ever initiated a lawsuit?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - AFTERNOON
N: Brandon walks with Mark. They've come far, across the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them. Mark can see HORSE STABLES that let out onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield. Stable hands are putting several thoroughbred horses through their paces.
C: BRANDON
D: They're Mrs. du Pont's. We all just keep our distance.
E: re the horses
N: They enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home.
C: MARK
D: I didn't realize he was married.
C: BRANDON
D: Mr. du Pont? He's not. Mrs. du Pont's his mother.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON
N: Brandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom. It's decorated like a ski chalet. Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark-
C: BRANDON
D: Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner.
N: Mark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys.
C: BRANDON
D: Someone will bring your car around. Anything else you need?
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Has he always lived with his mother?
C: BRANDON
D: Mr. du Pont? I think so.
N: Brandon leaves. Mark stands still for a long time, gazing at his new home - including some of the oddities, like the POLAR BEAR SKIN RUG (with HEAD ON) which is draped over the sofa.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CHALET - LATE THAT NIGHT
N: Mark (in tank-top undershirt) tapes up PHOTOS of himself and Dave. The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. A KNOCK on the living room window. It's John du Pont, who points toward the front door.
S: EXT. PORCH/THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS/LATE NIGHT
N: Mark opens the door. John's standing on the little porch, wearing a tux, holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX.
C: MARK
D: Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR -
N: Du Pont holds up a finger. Mark STOPS. Du Pont whispers -
C: DU PONT
D: You hear that?
N: Mark listens, shakes his head. Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods.
C: DU PONT
D: Barred owl -
E: CONT'D
N: He hands Mark the small box he's holding. Inside is a very small set of BINOCULARS.
C: DU PONT
D: When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath.
E: CONT'D
N: He hands Mark the BOOK: "South Pacific Birds" by John Eleuthere du Pont.
C: DU PONT
D: It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: You wrote this?
C: DU PONT
D: I did.
N: Mark seems genuinely touched and impressed.
C: MARK
D: Thank you. Do you want to come in?
C: DU PONT
D: No no -
C: MARK
D: - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there-
C: DU PONT
D: - No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early.
N: Du Pont hold up his own set of binoculars.
C: DU PONT
D: - I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species. Right here on the farm. What do we have - two months to the Worlds?
E: CONT'D THEN
C: MARK
D: Not even. 54 days.
C: DU PONT
D: 54 days. We'll get it done.
E: BEAT
N: On the two men standing in the porch light. PRELAP the sound of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder -
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER/DAY
N: CLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym mat. There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle. Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together.
C: MARK
D: Drop!
N: All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka "GECKO" (21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); JIM ZEREGA - "JIMMY Z" (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark.) The wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast.
C: MARK
D: DROP -
E: CONT'D
T: JUMP CUT TO:
N: Garcia and Zerega sprint to the end of the mats and back. Relay shuttles, each pair races, then the next pair. Popper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth time) - they're BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall. Du Pont WALKS IN. He wears a sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck. He hovers a slight distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed. Mark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia beats Zerega - Du Pont stares at Garcia. As Dan and Mark race back, Dan notices du Pont -
C: DAN
D: Hey, Coach.
N: Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team.
C: DU PONT
D: Dan Bane. How's that hamstring?
C: DAN
D: Coming back. It's coming back.
C: DU PONT
D: Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back.
C: MARK
D: Sir, you need me for something?
E: walking up to him
C: DU PONT
D: No no. Later. Please. Continue.
C: MARK
D: Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go.
E: nods, turns back
N: Springer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out.
C: GARCIA
D: Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice.
C: SPRINGER
D: Suck me, Gecko. And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead.
E: EXHAUSTED as he comes onto the mat
N: The six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - each pair in the up-down position.
C: MARK
D: Go!
N: They all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.... He CLAPS, like a coach would....
C: DU PONT
D: Good. Good.
E: awkward, not loud enough CLAPS AGAIN
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Du Pont's pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in wall bar. Mark's in the SITTING AREA of this large office, which gives the unmistakable impression of having been inspired by the Oval Office. (We should sense that this is not the first of these meetings.)
C: DU PONT
D: I can't get you anything at all?
C: MARK
D: No, thank you. I'm good.
C: DU PONT
D: In training. Excellent.
N: He comes over and sits. He's immediately hushed and serious.
C: DU PONT
D: Talk to me about Roberto Garcia.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Gecko? Great wrestler. What do you want to know?
N: Du Pont sits there nodding. He's mulling something.
C: DU PONT
D: Just a sense. Keep your eye on him. Let me know of anything suspicious. Subversive. Anti.
C: MARK
D: Anti-what?
C: DU PONT
D: Anything at all. Phone calls. Anything.
C: MARK
D: I will.
E: no idea what that means
N: Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top of one of the desk.
C: DU PONT
D: You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? You see the face hidden among the feathers? Right here.
E: MARK LOOKS
N: Mark looks. He doesn't see it. But he NODS anyway.
C: DU PONT
D: We need to exert the same care in crafting a world-class wrestling experience here at Foxcatcher. How're we doing with Dave Schultz?
E: CONT'D MARK NODS
C: MARK
D: How do you mean?
C: DU PONT
D: You were going to speak to him again. When's he coming?
C: MARK
D: Right. Look. Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. He's... he doesn't want to uproot. The family. Just at the moment. At the present time.
E: BEAT
C: DU PONT
D: He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. We are building a world class team. He belongs here. Tell me what I have to offer him.
C: MARK
D: Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave.
N: Silence. Du Pont's clearly not happy with this answer.
C: MARK
D: I wasn't... I didn't realize you wanted him to coach.
E: CONT'D
C: DU PONT
D: Wrestle and coach. We all coach each other. Support each other.
N: His tone suddenly turns bright and positive -
C: DU PONT
D: Let me ask your opinion -
E: CONT'D
N: He goes to the desk, where there are several large DRAWINGS of a proposed Foxcatcher logo: a RED FOX running. In some, the fox runs one way, in some the other. Mark approaches.
C: DU PONT
D: What do you think? Right to left, or left to right?
E: CONT'D
N: Silence as Mark examines the designs intently. Then, finally -
C: MARK
D: Right to left.
N: Du Pont looks at him, then back at the drawings. On the two of them - studying, contemplating...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODS/FOXCATCHER - EARLY MORNING
N: Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping fallen branches, sprinting up hills. He reaches the edge of the woods and stops, bent over, breathing heavily. Across the field, PRIZE HORSES are led out of the stables onto the grounds of the estate. Mark WATCHES. A few wrestlers (Zerega, Popper and Dan Bane) emerge from the woods behind Mark, running. Dan Bane leaves the other two.
C: DAN
D: I'll catch up with you all later.
N: Zerega and Popper jog off. Dan comes to stand next to Mark, who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket of his sweats and is looking through them. After a moment, he hands Dan the binoculars. Dan looks through them.
C: MARK
D: I'm pretty sure that's John's mother.
N: BINOCULARS POV: A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her wheelchair, with the help of an attendant. When the horses reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their faces, feeding them treats from her hands. She's completely at home with these animals, as they are with her.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND, FRANCE - DAY
N: Dave Schultz SLAMS his opponent to the mat. He's in TEAM USA uniform, and he's dominating. Du Pont watches from the stands, transfixed. Then he glances over at: Mark. Off to the side, watching his brother wrestle. Whether he's fascinated, jealous, rooting - we can't tell.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER/DAY
N: Mark wrestles like an animal - aggressive, forceful and fast. Dave's in Mark's corner, coaching - focused, intense, and very tough on Mark - shouting instruction. On du Pont, watching from the stands...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING
N: Loud. The TV is on. A few Team USA WRESTLERS watch the French Sports TV wrap-up of the day's matches. Danielle JUMPS on the bed near the window, with Nancy watching her.
C: DANIELLE
D: One... twois... quatro!
N: Nancy laughs. Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Du Pont and Mark are outside the door. Mark holds a VIDEOTAPE. He KNOCKS. No answer.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Dave wrestling with Alex on the bed.
C: DAVE
D: ...Fireman's carry... to a half- nelson... to a chicken wing... Wait! A chicken wing?
N: He starts to gobble up Alex's arm, who SHRIEKS in delight.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Mark knocks again. We HEAR Nancy's voice yell from inside: "It's open!" Mark opens the door.
S: INT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Noisy, chaotic. The wrestlers glance over "Hey, Mark" "What's up".... Mark's focused on Dave, who wrestles with Alex -
C: MARK
D: Dave.
C: DAVE
D: - a scrambled-egg!... a feather- pluck!...
N: Dave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up.
C: MARK
D: Dave.
C: DAVE
D: Hey, Mark --
C: MARK
D: Come meet Mr. du Pont.
N: Dave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, carrying him to the door. He SHAKES du Pont's HAND.
C: DAVE
D: Hi. Dave Schultz.
C: DU PONT
D: John du Pont. It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally.
C: MARK
D: I told him how excited you were to meet him.
E: TO DAVE
C: DAVE
D: This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle. Hey, Nance. John du Pont.
E: TO NANCY
N: Nancy waves from over near the window -
C: NANCY
D: Hey.
C: DU PONT
D: Hello.
C: DAVE
D: Come on in. Can I get you a drink -
C: DU PONT
D: No no.
C: DAVE
D: You sure - ?
C: DU PONT
D: Thank you. No. I need to be getting back. But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. Until tomorrow.
E: he laughs awkwardly
N: And he's GONE. Beat. Dave shrugs.
C: DAVE
D: Well, I know what I need.
C: MARK
D: What?
C: DAVE
D: Turkey drumstick!
N: He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him. Alex SQUEALS. Mark heads for the TV across the room. Pops in his video.
C: MARK
D: Dave, check out the tape I have on NANEV -
C: DAVE
D: YEAH -
E: STILL WRESTLING
C: MARK
D: I want to show you this downblock -
C: DAVE
D: Cue it up.
N: As the tape cues up, Mark glances at Nancy.
C: MARK
D: Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont?
C: NANCY
D: I said hello. I'm watching my kid.
E: lights a CIGARETTE
C: MARK
D: It's John du Pont. One of the most generous men in America. He's gonna save USA Wrestling. Can you not do that in here?
E: re. cigarette
C: NANCY
D: Do what?
C: MARK
D: Smoking.
C: NANCY
D: Smoke?
C: MARK
D: I wrestle tomorrow.
C: NANCY
D: It's my room, Mark. You don't have to be here.
C: MARK
D: I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals -
C: NANCY
D: Go get ready -
C: MARK
D: You start smoking - ?
C: NANCY
D: You can leave. Go to your own room -
C: MARK
D: - Your kids are in here -
N: She BLOWS SMOKE at him.
C: MARK
D: What the hell is that?
E: CONT'D
C: DAVE
D: Mark. Calm down.
C: MARK
D: I'm not the one frigging smoking.
C: DAVE
D: The window's open. Relax. Show me what you want me to look at.
N: Mark looks around the room. At Alexander giggling on the bed, at Danielle bouncing, Nancy BLOWING SMOKE RINGS. It's all too much. He pulls out the videotape and WALKS OUT the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - DAY
N: VARIOUS SHOTS: Final matches in progress, intense and brutal.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Mark sits, alone, head in his hands.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - SAME TIME
N: Faces in the crowd watching; strained faces of the wrestlers. Mark Schultz and Alexander Nanev's names are put up on the board. FINALS à 82 KILOS...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
N: Du Pont enters. Mark's alone on a corner bench, frozen, head in his hands. Silence. Du Pont is stiff, but gentle.
C: DU PONT
D: I think you're up.
N: Silence. Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder.
C: DU PONT
D: Mark. Dave just won. It's your turn.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark's body starts to shake. Then, very quietly:
C: MARK
D: I don't want to let you down.
N: This is the first time anyone has said anything like this to du Pont. He has no idea how to respond. He woodenly pats Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back.
C: DU PONT
D: I can't.... I've watched you these past months... I can't imagine being let down by you.
E: long beat, then quietly
N: Mark stops shaking. Du Pont stands patiently beside him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER
N: CAMERA'S TIGHT ON Mark as he enters the arena. Mark walks directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them. WHISTLE. The match begins. Intense and rough. Neither able to gain an edge. Dave coaches from Mark's corner.
T: CUT TO:
N: In between periods. Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, shouting instruction. Mark glances behind him: du Pont watches from the stands.
T: CUT TO:
N: Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a point. Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any advantage. The whistle blows. The ref takes each of their hands. He RAISES Mark's. He turns them around, raises Mark's hand again. Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach, shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him. Mark hugs his brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands. He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the platform. Mark walks toward him. The enormity of what he's just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. His face is red. He reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS around him, clings to him. Mark starts to SOB. Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, where Dave watches. PRELAP SOUND: The beginning "AAAAAH's" of David Bowie's "LET'S DANCE".
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
N: "LET'S DANCE" blasts from the stereo. Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a circle in the Trophy Room - shouting the "AAAAAAAH's" along with the thin white duke. Each holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, shaking it up as they sing. When the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS - SPRAYING champagne on each other, shouting wildly. Then they all CHUG the rest of their bottles. Du Pont is dancing around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it's not his first). The wrestlers DANCE. When du Pont finishes his bottle -
C: DU PONT
D: Let's clear it out!
N: He gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. A few of the others open more liquor...
C: DU PONT
D: Oh, yes!
E: CONT'D
C: SPRINGER
D: You sure about this?
C: DU PONT
D: Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh -
N: The center case is cleared out.
C: DU PONT
D: Put `em up, boys!
E: CONT'D
N: They hang their wrestling medals, place in trophies and other awards - leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY.
C: WRESTLERS
D: Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!...
E: CHANTING TOGETHER
N: Mark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks.
C: WRESTLERS
D: U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!...
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont raises his bottle to Mark -
C: DU PONT
D: You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher.
N: He starts to walk toward him.
C: DU PONT
D: You've brought honor to -
E: CONT'D
N: He SLIPS on the wet floor and his feet fly up in front of him, landing him FLAT ON HIS BACK. SILENCE. Du Pont's lying there, shaking - is he crying? No one knows what exactly to do. Dan Bane approaches him.
C: DAN
D: You all right, Coach?
N: Du Pont starts LAUGHING out loud. Hugely relieved, Dan holds his hand out to him to help him up. Du Pont takes Dan's hand and promptly pulls him to the ground... and... JUMPS on his back - WRESTLING with him. The wrestlers, including Mark, go crazy, CHEERING him on. Dan lets du Pont get the best of him... lets du Pont PIN him. The wrestlers are cheering madly as du Pont stands with his arms raised. He makes as if he's about to do a back flip (like Mark), then sits and does a clumsy backwards somersault. Wild cheers.
C: DU PONT
D: More drinks!
N: He's on his knees, fists in the air, head thrown back - TOTALLY EXULTANT... PRELAP sound of a GUNSHOT -
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING
N: VARIOUS SHOTS: The AMERICAN FLAG being raised; a hawk soars above the trees; Jean du Pont BRUSHES the horses in the barn. CAMERA picks up wrestlers running off their hangovers - Zerega, Popper, Springer, Mark. They pick up speed as the camera stays with them. WE HEAR more gunshots as they run through the grounds - the SHOTS get louder and louder. The wrestlers run somewhat near the FIRING RANGE, where several members of the NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, in uniform, are SHOOTING target practice with DU PONT. Du Pont wears a "Team Foxcatcher" zip SWEATJACKET - with his honorary POLICE BADGE pinned to one breast. On the other breast are sewn the words: "Head Coach", and JOHN "EAGLE" DU PONT. He's about to SHOOT when the wrestlers pass by -
C: WRESTLERS
D: Johnny D! Bossman!...
E: EXCEPT MARK
N: Du Pont, still holding his pistol, turns to watch them run past. His expression seems oddly, entirely blank.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM/WEIGHT ROOM - DAY
N: A few wrestlers lift weights - the others are hanging out, resting, talking. Du Pont wanders in, his target practice PISTOL dangling from the crook of his arm. A few guys notice him, greet him CASUALLY, go back to what they were doing. Du Pont FIRES a bullet through the roof. SILENCE.
C: DU PONT
D: days to Seoul, gentlemen. days. Let's get to work.
N: He gestures for Mark to join him.
C: DU PONT
D: Come talk to me.

N: CLOSE ON: a CHECK for $10,000.00 made out to Mark Schultz.
C: MARK
D: You don't have to do this.
E: O.S.
N: John sits at his desk, pistol stuck in his waistband. Mark, sweaty, stands across the desk from him, holding the check.
C: DU PONT
D: America doesn't respect you. Doesn't place any value on you at all. I reward accomplishment.
C: MARK
D: Thank you, Coach.
C: DU PONT
D: Please. Call me John. Or Coach. Whichever you prefer. Maybe Eagle. Or Coach. Eagle is good. How're we doing with Dave?
E: THEN
N: Mark carefully folds the check, avoiding du Pont's gaze.
C: DU PONT
D: You spoke to him again at the Worlds.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Yes. Yes, I did. I... It's not gonna happen. He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen.
E: BEAT
N: John is clearly unhappy with this answer. He removes the gun from his waistband, places it on the desk.
C: DU PONT
D: Do you believe in this team?
C: MARK
D: Of course I -
C: DU PONT
D: - Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent?
C: MARK
D: I do -
C: DU PONT
D: - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. That's part of your job.
N: Silence. Mark looks shamed by this.
C: DU PONT
D: It's probably best. Dave intimidates you. You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. Glass ceiling. Impossible for you to break through.
E: CONT'D
N: It looks like perhaps Mark believes this as well.
C: MARK
D: Do you think that's true? Because... all these years -
E: TENTATIVE
N: Du Pont stands suddenly -
C: DU PONT
D: - Well. You're the public face of Foxcatcher.
C: MARK
D: If that's what -
C: DU PONT
D: - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments?
C: MARK
D: Uh - well - not all that much -
C: DU PONT
D: - Because I'm thinking of entering one.
N: Beat. Mark nods -
C: MARK
D: Okay...
T: CUT TO:
N: CLOSE ON: VIDEOTAPE image of Mark at the 1984 Olympics, his hand being raised by the ref... Mark raises both hands in the air, glances slightly down, then out at the crowd... The image FREEZES, is rewound, plays again. At the moment Mark raises his arms and GLANCES DOWN, the image FREEZES.

S: INT. DINING ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/DAY
N: The furniture has been pushed to the walls in the huge formal dining room, and a large WHITE SCRIM has been erected at one end. A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER who could double as a member of Devo, stands at a video monitor with du Pont.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: He wears the singlet -
C: DU PONT
D: - and the gold medal -
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: - and, of course, the gold medal. And a lot of oil.
N: Mark's in a dressing area wearing his FOXCATCHER SINGLET and Olympic gold. Two assistants stuff his crotch with a bit of padding.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: A lot of oil. Please. More oil. It defines the musculature.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. The two assistants slather baby oil on his arms and chest and legs as the photographer SHOWS him the pose on the monitor.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: You're winning the gold medal. You're raising your arms in triumph. You're also feeling humility.
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont is hanging back, but staring intensely at Mark. Mark looks over to him.
C: MARK
D: You good with this?
C: DU PONT
D: It's wonderful. It's exactly what I needed from you.
N: The photographer takes his place behind the camera as the assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Good! Now. Mark. You're winning the gold medal! And you are humbled!
N: Mark raises his arms and glances down. FLASH. FLASH.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: Good! And again!
E: CONT'D
N: JUMP TO: Du Pont, in his Foxcatcher sweatsuit, is now in front of the scrim with Mark (still in his singlet.) Mark starts to hug du Pont for a photo -
C: DU PONT
D: I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds.
C: PHOTOGRAPHER
D: It's true.
C: DU PONT
D: Maybe if you kneeled.
C: MARK
D: Kneeled now? On the floor. Really? It won't look...
E: UNSURE
C: DU PONT
D: No. No. You should kneel.

N: Mark and John are flown southwest toward Washington DC by Larry the pilot. John takes a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket, hands it to Mark.
C: DU PONT
D: Brandon and I prepared some remarks.
N: Mark takes the paper and reads it over. He looks worried.
C: DU PONT
D: Don't be nervous. You'll do great.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark's not so sure. Then he HEARS a SNIFF. He looks over at du Pont: he's got a COCAINE BULLET in one nostril. Du Pont inhales, then OFFERS the bullet to Mark. Mark's frozen -
C: DU PONT
D: What? You've never done this? It helps put everything in perspective. Trust me.... Mark. It's just cocaine. Trust me.
E: CONT'D Mark shakes his head
N: Mark takes the coke bullet, examines it for several moments, then holds it to one nostril. He INHALES.
C: DU PONT

C: STEVE
D: In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one.
N: Graham calls over to the 3-star GENERAL in full dress uniform who's chewing on a cigar and drinking gin with a Senator.
C: STEVE
D: General, any of these models available?
E: CONT'D
C: GENERAL
D: Which? We might have a couple of those left on the lot. You gonna need financing?
E: to du Pont
N: Everyone laughs. Du Pont smiles.
C: DU PONT
D: What I need is the gun turret. Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top.
C: GENERAL
D: Uh... I don't know there, son. Civilians don't usually get 40mm blowback grenade launchers.
C: STEVE
D: General, John du Pont is hardly your usual civilian.

D: Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March.
E: CONT'D
N: Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. Du Pont watches from the wings. Mark reads.
C: MARK
D: I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father...
E: CONT'D MORE

D: and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont.

C: DU PONT
D: Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in
C: AUDIENCE)
D: Hello, Mother. The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe...

N: Mark kneels on the mat with du Pont, holding him in the starting position. Mark is talking du Pont through the moves for an escape. We get the sense that this is not the first of these lessons.
C: MARK
D: Ready? Go.
N: Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape. Mark is incredibly gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves.

D: Okay. Let's try it again.

E: ON PHONE
C: DAVE
D: All right. How close?
E: ON PHONE
N: There a KNOCK on Mark's window. Mark looks over and sees du Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face. He beckons to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair.

N: Bowie's "China Girl" PLAYS through outdoor speakers. Mark crops du Pont's hair with an ELECTRIC CLIPPER. It's unseasonably warm out - Mark's in shorts and flip flops. Both men are drinking from bottles of champagne. Du Pont's drunk enough that his defenses are down. A vanity table is on the veranda with a mirror and a bowl of COCAINE.
C: MARK
D: Looking good. Looking tough.
E: NO REPLY
N: Mark finishes buzzing -- looks at du Pont's crew cut in the mirror. Du Pont seems melancholy.
C: MARK
D: I think you're ready. We just need some more talc.
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: They both reach over to the bowl of "talc", rub some on their gums -- then they each snort a line.
C: MARK
D: Yah! I think you're ready.
E: CONT'D
C: DU PONT
D: I appreciate this...
C: MARK
D: You've done the training, you learned the moves. You're ready to rumble, boss.
C: DU PONT
D: No. Mark. I appreciate this.
C: MARK
D: It's nothing.
E: after a moment
C: DU PONT
D: When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me.
N: Mark is moved, but doesn't know what to say.
C: MARK
D: We all have demons.
C: DU PONT
D: It's good to know you and I have come to this... friendship without any of that nonsense. Financial nonsense.
E: TOTALLY SINCERE
N: Neither mentions that du Pont is actually paying Mark. Silence. Mark struggles whether to admit something. Then -
C: MARK
D: When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. It looked like he wasn't gonna live. I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. Dave won't be distracted. We can get back to training together. Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. That's just the truth. You gotta conquer your demons.
E: BEAT THEN
N: Du Pont stands up. Expressionless, he disappears through the sliding glass doors into the house. Mark LOOKS OUT over the dark grounds of Foxcatcher. Quiet. Then Mark jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN FIRES several rounds behind him. When he turns around, there's du Pont, a determined look on his face, pointing a semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the rolling landscape.
C: DU PONT
D: Conquer demons.
N: He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. Du Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark...
C: MARK
D: Yeahhhhh!!!!
E: over the gunfire
N: Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. He begins lowering the gun when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice.
C: DU PONT
D: They're dead.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LEAR JET - DAY
N: SILENCE, save for the steady HUM of flight inside the cabin. Du Pont's gazing out the window of this private jet; he's trying to be brave, but he's clearly terrified of the upcoming match. Mark sits next to du Pont, on the aisle.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PHOENIX ARENA - DAY
N: Between periods at the "Du Pont Masters Open and Collegiate Invitational". Very few people in the Masters gym bleachers. Large posters of the oiled-up Mark on the walls. Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. FRED COLE and another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym. They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE: An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole. Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John.
C: MARK
D: When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss.
N: Du Pont nods wearily. He can barely move.
T: CUT TO:
N: The final minute of the match. It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best of him. Mark watches. The REF blows the end of match whistle. The wrestlers stand, du Pont struggling to his feet. The ref takes each of their hands, and raises... du Pont's. He's "won". Du Pont limps off the mat. He approaches Mark, THROWS his arms around him the way Mark hugged du Pont at the Worlds. Mark glances toward the open doors to the other gym.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOCKER ROOM/PHOENIX ARENA - MINUTES LATER

N: Silence. Jean just looks at her son, not reacting.
C: DU PONT
D: Including this, Mother. Ha. Which I've actually just won.
E: CONT'D
N: He takes his WINNER'S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old. He holds it out for her. She doesn't take it, but leans forward slightly to read what's inscribed on it: "FIRST PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER'S INVITATIONAL: JOHN `EAGLE' DU PONT." She sits back.
C: JEAN
D: Which ribbons?
C: DU PONT

N: Mark and the team are watching a VIDEOTAPE Garcia has gotten of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH. It's an American street fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert. The match is brutal and bloody and the wrestlers watching are CLEARLY INTO IT. Mark is lying on the couch - attentive, but quiet. There's KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don't notice it. Much LOUDER KNOCKING. Garcia opens the door. It's du Pont. Mark RISES to greet him as Dan MUTES the video.
C: MARK
D: Hi, Boss. How you doing? Any soreness from the match?
E: COMPLETELY GENUINE
C: DU PONT
D: I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. There is no one in there. In the gym.

E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen.
N: Du Pont SLAPS Mark. HARD. Across the face. SILENCE. Mark could destroy du Pont. He doesn't seem to even consider it. He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. Du Pont WALKS OUT past the muted UFC on TV - Once he's gone, no one speaks. Then:
C: GARCIA
D: You got bitch-slapped.

E: more and more upset

N: Mark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat. Du Pont on top. He's both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he's pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual. Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end.
T: FADE OUT.

N: WIDE SHOT of the Foxcatcher estate. In the distance, a HELICOPTER approaches, the rotors getting louder and louder.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY
N: The helicopter has LANDED, the rotors still WHIRRING LOUDLY. (We won't hear dialogue in the following sequence.) DAVE and NANCY and the kids descend from the helicopter, GREETED warmly by the wrestling team. MARK IS ABSENT. Du Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon. WE SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the team. He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family. CLOSE ON: Mark, who's at the very far end of the lawn, just inside the ring of trees, WATCHING. His HEAD is COMPLETELY SHAVED. MARK'S POV: Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their new home. Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps together. Du Pont puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. Far away, the Big House front door CLOSES.

D: Hey.
C: MARK
D: Hey, Dave.
C: DAVE
D: How you doing?
C: MARK
D: Good. I'm good.
C: DAVE
D: I hadn't seen you yet. I just want to make sure everything's okay.
C: MARK
D: Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days.
N: Silence.
C: DAVE
D: You know, Nancy and the kids are here.
C: MARK
D: How they doing?
C: DAVE
D: Good. You should stop in, say hi.
C: MARK
D: I will. I will.
E: BEAT
N: As the brothers stand in the doorway looking at each other, PRELAP: the sound of a GUNSHOT.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER WOODS - DAY
N: A deer STAGGERS. It's been hit by a rifle shot. It stumbles, starts to move away. REVERSE onto Dave, holding his RIFLE. He's hunting with Dan Bane and TWO WRESTLERS we don't recognize (recruited by him in the few weeks he's been there.) Dave FIRES again. HEAR: opening of THE DOOBIE BROTHERS' "Listen to the Music"
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - DAY
N: A BOOMBOX plays The Doobie Brothers. The deer CARCASS hangs from a large tree. Dave SKINS it with a long knife. Dave's son, Alex, sits on the picnic table, watching. Danielle runs around the yard with some of the other wrestlers' kids.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BACKYARD/DAVE AND NANCY'S HOUSE - EVENING
N: MUSIC in the background. The (now dozen or so) wrestlers and their families are gathered around the picnic table, the keg, the roasting deer on the SPIT over the fire. Du Pont is at the table. Mark stays very much ON THE PERIPHERY of the group. Dave's holding court at the table - in front of a huge platter of venison steaks -
C: DAVE
D: There's this big match between an American and a Russian. The Russian is a monster, never lost, kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel. So the American coach tells his wrestler, "Listen, whatever you do don't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you're dead." Sure enough, match starts, the Russian gets him in The Pretzel.
N: There are smiles around the table.
C: DAVE
D: The coach buries his head in his hands because he know's it's all over. Suddenly, he hears the crowd roar. When he looks up the Russian is flying through the air - he lands on his back, the American jumps him. Pins him. Boom. The match is over.
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he has on people - the attention he gets.
C: DAVE
D: "Nobody's ever gotten out of The Pretzel," the coach says afterward, "How'd you do it?" "Well, Coach, I was just about to give up when I opened my eyes and there was this big hairy pair of balls right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I craned my neck and bit those babies as hard as I could." The coach says, "And that did the trick?"
E: CONT'D SOME LAUGHS LOW MORE
C: DAVE
D: "Coach, you'd be surprised how motivated you get when you bite your own balls."
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone CRACKS UP. Du Pont WATCHES, trying to discern what makes this man so effortlessly magnetic. Then du Pont laughs loudest of all.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - DAY
N: The dozen wrestlers are spread out on the mats, in pairs, wrestling. Dave walks among them. He moves close to Springer, giving instruction. Du Pont, in sweats and a whistle, lurks nearby. Mark's off against the wall, putting on weightlifting gloves.
C: DAVE
D: He gives you opportunity, jump on it. Hard. Drive him down.
C: DU PONT
D: No mercy!
N: Dave looks at du Pont, surprised by the comment - that John's actually behaving as if he's coaching. Dave looks at some of the wrestlers, realizes this is the norm. He laughs, pats du Pont on the back.
C: DAVE
D: Okay. Okay. You heard the Head Coach. No mercy.
E: to the wrestlers
N: Mark walks out of the wrestling room to the weight room. Du Pont is thrilled to be validated for a moment. Then -
C: DAVE
D: Would you give us a little room? Just stand over there for a sec... SPRINGER -
E: CONT'D to du Pont turns to Springer
N: Du Pont obeys, SHUFFLES off to the side. Fluidly, expertly, Dave talks and wrestles through a series of moves with Springer. (MORE)
C: DAVE
D: - when he grabs for your elbow, goes for head position - your hand on his wrist needs to come up immediately, suck his arm to your chest, right hook over the top for the headlock, take him down, drive him down -
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont watches the master work for several moments.
C: DAVE
D: - you see him commit you make him PAY -
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont clearly has nothing to contribute. He claps.
C: DU PONT
D: Keep it up, gentlemen.
N: Largely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS
N: Mark sits on the LEG-PRESS, pressing an enormous amount of weight - repeatedly - straining, pushing himself. Du Pont enters. Mark tries to ignore him, continues to press the huge stack of weights.
C: DU PONT
D: Your brother's taking the reins. Leading.
N: Mark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his breath.
C: DU PONT
D: You've got more in you than that.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark turns his gaze to du Pont. SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders.
C: DU PONT
D: You've got to dig deep. Find out what's inside. Discover what you're made of.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: Please don't do that.
E: QUIET
N: Du Pont keeps massaging. Mark glances towards the wrestling room.
C: DU PONT
D: Conquer your demons, Mark. CONQUER -
C: MARK
D: - Please. I'm asking you to not...
E: QUIET
N: Dave is coming in the direction of the weight room. Mark STANDS and walks out of the gym. Du Pont turns and sees Dave come through the doorway.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CHALET - LATER
N: CU on TV screen: Mark being taken down by a wrestler. The image pauses, plays again. And again. Mark sits in front of the screen, watching this sequence, over and over. Dave walks in through the open door. Mark doesn't acknowledge him.
C: DAVE
D: Why'd you take off so suddenly?
C: MARK
D: Need to study up. Fix some weakness.
E: STILL WATCHING
C: DAVE
D: You been doing this since you left?
C: MARK
D: Pretty much.
N: Beat. Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching.
C: DAVE
D: What's going on with you and John?
C: MARK
D: Nothing's going on. What does that mean?
E: STILL WATCHING BEAT
C: DAVE
D: You seemed kind of upset in the gym.
C: MARK
D: The fuck you talking about?
E: STILL WATCHING
C: DU PONT
D: He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. What was he saying to you?
E: THEN
C: MARK
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
N: Beat.
C: DAVE
D: Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me.
N: Dave walks out. Mark keeps watching his videotape.
T: CUT TO:
S: I/E. DU PONT'S CAR/FOXCATCHER - NEXT MORNING
N: Du Pont drives his black Mercury. He's wearing what looks like an antique Revolutionary War General's battle COAT over a Foxcatcher t-shirt. There are a couple of MUSKETS in the back seat, another COAT.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - SAME TIME
N: Dave's got the hood of his car up. He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. Danielle picks flowers in the yard and brings them to Nancy on the steps. Du Pont pulls up in his car, gets out with the car running.
C: DU PONT
D: David Schultz. Dave.
N: Dave looks around the open hood.
C: DAVE
D: Hey, Coach.
C: DU PONT
D: I'd like to show you something. Why don't you hop in?
N: It's more than a little odd that du Pont hasn't acknowledged anyone else.
C: DAVE
D: WELL -
C: DU PONT
D: - Need to show you something. At the battlefield. Come. Sit. Come.
C: DAVE
D: You know what, Coach? It's Sunday. Family time.
N: Du Pont stands there as if he hasn't quite registered what Dave said. Beat. Beat. Nancy calls out from the steps.
C: NANCY
D: Good morning, John.
N: Du Pont looks over at her as if he's just noticed her presence.
C: DU PONT
D: Family time. Ah. Very good.
N: He turns, gets back in his car.

N: Mark RUNS - alone, pushing himself, sprinting - through the woods, jumping rocks and fallen tree trunks.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME
N: The wrestlers train on the mats. Du Pont patrols the perimeter, REPEATEDLY LOOKING TOWARD the doorway. Du Pont SEES someone entering and immediately begins acting coach-like, SHOUTING instruction, CLAPPING encouragement. WE NOW SEE who has entered: Mrs. Jean du Pont. She's WHEELED in by an attendant; another wheels the oxygen tank she's attached to. They park themselves by the wall. INTERCUT: Mark SPRINTS through the woods, breathing hard. BACK IN THE GYM: The wrestlers notice Jean, begin to stop what they're doing. Du Pont BLOWS HIS WHISTLE too loudly-
C: DU PONT
D: And.... break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. Team. Listen up.
N: Several wrestlers GLANCE toward Dave to check his reaction to this. Dave NODS his head in du Pont's direction.
C: DU PONT
D: A number of you will be travelling with me to the Olympic Trials in Pensacola next week. From the moment you leave these hallowed training grounds, you will be in competition. There's no lying in a fight. Who you think you are in the moments leading up to a fight, and who you are when the fight begins - the truth will become abundantly clear.
E: CONT'D
N: Jean du Pont watches her son.
C: DU PONT
D: Raul Garcia, come up here for a moment.
E: CONT'D
N: No one moves. He gestures at Garcia.
C: DU PONT
D: Raul. Gecko. Come.
E: CONT'D
C: GARCIA
D: My fucking name's Roberto, dickweed.
E: mutters under his breath
N: Springer smiles. Garcia stands. He's clearly the SMALLEST WRESTLER in the room. He approaches du Pont. INTERCUT: Mark sprinting through the woods. BACK IN THE GYM:
C: DU PONT
D: Muchas gracias, compadre. Por favor.
E: gestures to the mat
N: Garcia gets in the down position. Du Pont kneels next to him, his arms hovering over him, not yet grabbing on.
C: DU PONT
D: The period begins before the whistle blows, when the other wrestler feels you above him, feels your purpose.
E: CONT'D
N: Jean watches her son, not betraying any emotion.
C: DU PONT
D: Then... the whistle blows!
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont grabs onto Garcia. Tries to flip him. He can't move him at all. TOTAL SILENCE, except for Du Pont grunting. Mrs. Du Pont, stoic - watches her son. Then she signals to her attendant to take her away. She's wheeled out. Du Pont sees her go.
T: FADE OUT.
S: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY
N: Dave wrestles. He's having trouble with a younger wrestler. Mark stretches by the wall, alone, trying to concentrate on his upcoming match. He keeps glancing over at his struggling brother, and at du Pont in Dave's corner.
T: CUT TO:
N: Du Pont FANS Dave with a towel in between periods, "coaching him", giving "advice". He's BEING FILMED BY A CAMERA CREW.
T: CUT TO:

C: ANNOUNCER
D: That's the second - and final - loss for David Schultz.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - LATER/DAY
N: Mark's on the mat, battling a college wrestler, Rico Chipparelli. Mark's struggling. We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. Dave shouts from the corner.
C: DAVE
D: Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!...
N: Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction -
C: DU PONT
D: Need to get after him, there. Low low low.
T: CUT TO:
N: In between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner while Dave gets in his face, coaching. But all Mark can pay attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel.
C: DAVE
D: He's open to the left. He leaves his entire left side open. You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. Now or never...
T: CUT TO:
N: Mark's back out on the mat. It's not working. Mark gets PINNED. The wrestlers stand. The ref holds both of their hands, RAISES Chipparelli's arm. He turns them around, raises Chipparelli's arm again. Mark walks off the mat. Dave tries to console him.
C: DAVE
D: Double elimination, buddy. You'll get it back.
E: CONT'D
C: DU PONT
D: Next time, Mark. A good effort.
N: Mark walks right past them, off the mats. We TRAIL him, staying with him as he walks straight out the arena door.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS
N: Mark walks out the door and along the side of the building. He turns down a side entrance ramp for delivery trucks leading down to an underground garage. I/E. DELIVERY TUNNEL/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS Mark's alone here. He BANGS his head against the cement wall, smashing it repeatedly. He screams at himself. He punches himself. Punishment for losing.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
N: Mark's on his knees at the room MINI-BAR, having discovered the Kit-Kat's, M&Ms. TV's on, place is a wreck. A KNOCK at the door. LOUDER. Mark looks through the peephole. His POV:
C: DAVE
D: Open up - I know you're in there.
N: Mark walks away from the door.
C: DAVE
D: Mark. I'm gonna kick it in if you don't open it.
E: CONT'D
N: Dave POUNDS hard, seriously rattling the doorframe.
C: DAVE
D: Mark!
E: CONT'D
N: Mark doesn't move. Dave starts to KICK IN the door - once, twice - it might break. Mark goes to the door and opens it. SILENCE as the brothers stand there looking at each other.
C: DAVE
D: What's going on with you? You got a match in four hours. What happened to your face?
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: Mark walks away, sits on the bed. Dave comes in, surveys the room - dishes on the room-service cart, open mini-bar.
C: DAVE
D: Jesus Christ, tell me you didn't eat all this. You got to weigh in before every match.
E: CONT'D NO ANSWER
C: MARK
D: I'm done.
C: DAVE
D: What does that mean?
C: MARK
D: It's over. I'm done. You lost. I lost. It's over.
N: Dave walks over to Mark, and CUFFS him, hard, on the side of the head. He hits him again. Hard.
C: DAVE
D: Look at me. Look at me. You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. Not one. If you think I'm gonna let you throw away a chance to win back-to-back Olympic golds you're fucking crazy.
N: Dave CUFFS him again, harder.
C: DAVE
D: Do you know what I'd give to have the extra years you've got? To have one more shot? To not have to start coaching full time? Do you?! I'm done, Mark. I've lost a step. You haven't. I will kick the shit out of you. I will lift you up and personally throw you out on that mat to take what's yours - what we've been training for since high school. And I will be on your ass every day from here to South Korea.
E: CONT'D hits him again
N: Mark is silent, his face reddening. Staring straight ahead.
C: DAVE
D: I'm with you, Mark. You're not in this alone.
E: CONT'D QUIET NOW
N: Silence. Then, Mark stands and the CAMERA follows him into the bathroom. As he sticks his fingers down his throat and leans over the toilet bowl to throw up,

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WORK-OUT ROOM - DAY
N: Mark PEDALS furiously on a STATIONARY BIKE, wearing five layers of sweats and fleeces with PLASTICS on top. We can see how much Mark is perspiring by the POOLS OF SWEAT which are collecting up his arms. Dave eggs him on as he shoves TINY PIECES of ICE up Mark's nose to keep him from overheating. Du Pont walks in the far side, clapping, calling out -
C: DU PONT
D: Here you are. I've been looking all over for you --
N: Dave immediately trots over to du Pont, heading him off. We SEE their conversation from Mark's POV (we'll hear only pieces of it): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone. Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. He tells du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now. Finally, du Pont turns and WALKS OUT. Dave turns back toward Mark. Mark puts his head down and PEDALS even harder.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. WEIGH IN ROOM - DAY
N: C/U on the CLOCK: 3:29. The weigh-in official CLOSES his log book. Dave and Mark BURST into the room.
C: DAVE
D: Wait! Wait! We're here... Get 'em off.
E: TO MARK
N: The official looks at them, OPENS his log book. Dave helps Mark peel off his sweats. Soaked, they hit the floor with a smack. Mark, in his singlet, gets on the scale. He's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). He steps off, and Dave helps PEEL his singlet off. He gets back on the scale naked. The official slides the weight bar... 3 GRAMS OVER. Dave grabs Mark.
C: DAVE
D: Come here.
E: CONT'D
N: He grabs his wallet from his sweats pocket and pulls out a CREDIT CARD, dropping the wallet on the floor. Dave SQUEEGEES sweat off Mark's naked body with the card. Scraping him down. He helps Mark back on the scale. The pointer bobs, finally reaches equilibrium.
C: OFFICIAL
D: 82 kilos.
N: Mark practically COLLAPSES. Dave helps him off the scale, walks him over to a bench, sits him down. He grabs a GATORADE from nearby table and hold it out to Mark, who looks like he might pass out.

D: YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
N: Dave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. As Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. Empty seat.

D: Dave. What can I do for you?
C: DAVE
D: I'm having some trouble finding John. He's not in his room -
C: STAN BECK
D: - Right.
C: DAVE
D: - I wanted to check in with him. I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. And that he's happy with the result. With how things turned out.
C: STAN BECK

E: TO GUARD
N: No response. The Guard takes the ID's into the guardhouse. Mark looks out his window: patrolling the roof of the main house, we can see PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARDS. One of them speaks into a microphone in his cuff. The Guard returns. Hands back their ID's. And hands Dave an ENVELOPE.

N: Wrestlers warm up, work out, lift weights. Dave and Mark train intensively together, doing TAKE-DOWN DRILLS. Mark executes, Dave murmurs instruction to Mark, they do the drill again. Du Pont WALKS IN THE GYM, trailed by the his Plainclothes Security Guard and Stan. Du Pont looks like he hasn't showered in a few days. Dave moves toward John, offering greetings and condolences -- "How you doing there, Coach," "Sorry to hear about your mother, sir," etc. Du Pont brushes off the offers of sympathy -
C: DU PONT
D: No no. All's fine. There's work to be done. Back to work, gentlemen.
E: CLAPS
N: As they go back to their drills, John stays on the perimeter, watching Mark, STARING at them. It's disconcerting. Dave moves back to work with Mark.

E: Mark looks at him MARK NODS MARK NODS

N: Du Pont walks over. Mark can barely look at him. Du Pont stops close to Mark. Mark looks to Dave to save him from this. Dave's clearly caught in the middle. Mark looks down, closes his eyes as if in pain. Du Pont moves close to Dave, speaking to him so Mark can hear -
C: DU PONT
D: If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together.
N: After a long moment, du Pont moves off the mat. He starts to stretch nearby. As Dave tries to get Mark back to work, du Pont starts to JOG around the perimeter of the gym. Mark's trying to keep it together, but it's clearly driving him insane. As du Pont jogs and jogs - PRELAP:

N: A SECURITY TEAM taps on the outside of the main house, listen to the walls with what look like giant STETHOSCOPES. THE CHALET: A HORSE, its mane unkempt and knotted, eats grass in the side yard. Lifting its head, it noses the side window.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIG HOUSE/DU PONT'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: FRED COLE, with TWO OTHER OFFICIALS from USA WRESTLING, sits across from du Pont's desk. Dave's there, as is Stan Beck. John sits at his desk, CLEANING and OILING his pistol. A glass of SCOTCH next to it.
C: FRED COLE
D: We're so very sorry about your mother's passing.
N: Du Pont doesn't look up, just meticulously cleans each part of the gun. Almost mumbling:
C: DU PONT
D: Yes. Very sad. Very sad days here. Here at the farm.
N: He keeps his focus on the disassembled gun, wiping clean each piece. Silence, then -
C: FRED COLE
D: Well, whatever we can do.
N: Silence.
C: STAN BECK
D: What we wanted to discuss... Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. Now - in addition - he'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling. This money would come with conditions.
E: THEN MORE
C: STAN BECK
D: First: that you will start to offer Foxcatcher Farms - with the Golden Eagle as Head Coach, and Dave Schultz as Coach - as an alternative to Colorado Springs for wrestlers to train.
E: CONT'D
C: FRED COLE
D: May I ask what sort of a donation we're discussing?
C: STAN BECK
D: Four hundred thousand dollars.
N: Fred chokes on his glass of water.
C: STAN BECK
D: Second: that the du Pont family name be on all Olympic wrestling singlets and sweatsuits.
E: CONT'D
C: DU PONT
D: And gym bags.
E: under his breath
C: STAN BECK
D: And gym bags.
N: Beat. Fred glances at his fellow officials.

S: EXT. FOXCATCHER/WOODS - SAME TIME
N: Mark sprints through the woods, breathing hard. He emerges from the ring of trees onto the lawn near the Big House. He's immediately brought up short as SEVERAL SECURITY GUARDS come towards him, hands up --
C: PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
D: Sir! Please turn around and go back the way you came.
C: MARK
D: What's going on?
E: GASPING
C: PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
D: Security. Please turn around and go back the way you came.
N: Behind the guard, Mark can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out around the perimeter of the Big House.
C: MARK
D: What -?
C: PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD
D: - We'll let you know when this area is open. Please turn around and go back the way you came.
N: Mark's confused, still breathing hard. After a moment, he turns and walks off into the woods.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BIG HOUSE/DU PONT'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
C: STAN BECK
D: We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul. Which means he would be in Mark Schultz's corner throughout the games.
N: Fred looks over at Dave.
C: FRED COLE
D: We'll all, of course, just need to get him to sign off on this.
C: STAN BECK
D: You can take care of that?
C: DAVE
D: I can try.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING
N: Dave and the other wrestlers warm up, stretch, run drills. Mark walks into the gym in streetclothes, stays near the entrance. Dave senses that something's going on with his brother, walks over to him.
C: DAVE
D: You're late.
C: MARK
D: Were you in the Big House yesterday?
C: DAVE
D: For a little while.
C: MARK
D: In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. What were you doing there?
E: THEN
C: DAVE
D: I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John.
C: MARK
D: About what?
C: DAVE
D: Mark. Get dressed.
C: MARK
D: He's weakening me.
C: DAVE
D: What are you talking about?
C: MARK
D: I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall -
C: DAVE
D: - Mark -
C: MARK
D: - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend -
C: DAVE
D: - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not -
C: MARK
D: - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning -
C: DAVE
D: - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for.
C: MARK
D: - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it -
C: DAVE
D: - It's not the time, Mark -
C: MARK
D: - John's killing me here -
C: DAVE
D: - He's not killing you -
C: MARK
D: - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after -
C: DAVE
D: - Stop. Stop it!
N: Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. As gently as he can:
C: DAVE
D: I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of.
E: CONT'D
N: Mark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time.
C: MARK
D: You're not thinking of staying here...?
C: DAVE
D: I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in...
N: Mark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again.
C: DAVE
D: If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. You live your own life however you want. Focus on that.
E: CONT'D
C: MARK
D: My own life.
E: QUIETLY
C: DAVE
D: That's right.
C: MARK
D: And you'll be here.
C: DAVE
D: I'll be here. Whenever you need me.
N: Mark seems lost. Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. Mark watches him walk away, then -
C: MARK
D: What's on your forehead?
C: DAVE
D: What?
C: MARK
D: It says kids.
C: DAVE
D: To remind me to pick up the kids from school.
C: MARK
D: What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead?
C: DAVE
D: I don't have to. You just told me.
N: On Mark, PRELAP:

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - MORNING
N: An M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is off-loaded from the back of a wide-load army trailer. A DELIVERY CORPORAL directs the operation. Du Pont watches.
C: CORPORAL
D: That's one beautiful vehicle.
N: The CORPORAL watches du Pont climb atop the APC.
C: DU PONT
D: Where's the grenade launcher?
C: CORPORAL
D: I'm sorry?
C: DU PONT
D: The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here.
N: The Corporal pages through the sheets of his delivery order.
C: CORPORAL
D: I don't know, sir. I don't... I don't see anything in the order -
C: DU PONT
D: - It goes right here. Right here.
C: CORPORAL
D: Yes, it does. It does mount right there on the top.

D: So where is it?

N: Drizzling. Du Pont sits in the M-113 APC, his torso sticks out the top. He TURNS IT ON, the engine roaring to life.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME
N: Dave is being interviewed for the documentary. He stands in his workout clothes, in front of the camera crew. Some of the wrestlers work out behind him. Dave's reading much of what he says from CUE CARDS held near the camera.
C: DAVE
D: My name's Dave Schultz. I'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher, under Head Coach John "Eagle" du Pont -
T: CUT TO:

N: Dave's voice continues -
C: DAVE
D: - Coach du Pont, uh, understands excellence, he represents... excellence, he expects it from his ATHLETES -
E: V.O.
N: Du Pont drives the APC over a little ridge and starts down a long slope toward the POND.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SAME TIME
C: DAVE
D: - His... commitment to this sport is complete. He's made himself um, an... an expert in the sport of wrestling...
E: halting; trying so hard
N: Dave, who's been so good at playing along, takes it too far even for himself. As he says the next bit, he stumbles over his words -
C: DAVE
D: Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... to - what we're trying to accomplish here. (looks down,
E: CONT'D
C: UNCOMFORTABLE)
D: We... consider John... one of us.
E: QUIETLY MORE
C: DAVE
D: One of us.
E: CONT'D SO QUIETLY
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - SAME TIME
N: Du Pont drives the APC down the slope, into the POND. He continues driving as the tank goes lower and lower in the water -- the water covers the vehicle, then his torso, his neck, his head. And he's gone. Completely submerged. Beat. Beat. The surface of the water is still. Beat. Du Pont BREAKS the surface. He looks around, then swims slowly to shore. The tank remains on the bottom of the pond.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Dave and Mark sit on the couch across from Stan Beck and du Pont. Dave is firm and clear, but entirely diplomatic. Du Pont looks dishevelled, he won't meet anyone's gaze. We can see the POSTER of Mark hanging on the wall.
C: DAVE
D: I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of.
C: STAN BECK
D: Taken care of how?
C: DAVE
D: So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid.
C: STAN BECK
D: Paid what?
C: DAVE
D: His full salary.
C: STAN BECK
D: You want him paid even if he leaves? What if he quits?
C: DAVE
D: Whether or not he chooses to stay. That's right.
N: Stan's incredulous. He glances over at du Pont, but his boss doesn't make eye contact. Stan turns back to Dave.
C: STAN BECK
D: You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here.
C: DAVE
D: You're welcome to test the theory.
C: STAN BECK
D: What does that mean?
C: DAVE
D: We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go. I hope it doesn't come to that. I'd also ask John to understand the delicate nature of the lead-up to Seoul, and please allow Mark some space. Let him train just with me.
E: BEAT BEAT
N: Du Pont winces at this, but keeps quiet.
C: STAN BECK
D: You're that determined to leave?
E: TO MARK
N: Mark doesn't respond.
C: DAVE
D: He'd like the option.
N: Stan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear. It goes on for several seconds. Finally, du Pont NODS very slightly.
C: STAN BECK
D: First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever -
C: DAVE
D: - That's not exactly how it's -
C: STAN BECK
D: - Just a minute - you've had your say.
C: DAVE
D: Sorry.
C: STAN BECK
D: - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss. Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms, but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago.
E: THEN
C: DAVE
D: What's that?
C: STAN BECK
D: That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games.
N: Mark looks at Dave. Quiet, betrayed --
C: MARK
D: You've talked about this?
C: DAVE
D: I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind.
N: A long beat. Then Mark shrugs, and looks away from his brother. He's given up fighting this fight.
C: STAN BECK
D: All right, then. I guess we're done.
N: Silence as they all just sit there.

N: C/U on Mark, in his wrestling gear, looking disoriented, unfocused. He's in the hall right outside the locker room, just steps away from the WRESTLING ARENA. Dave's in his face - talking to him INTENSELY over the sounds of the crowd inside -
C: DAVE
D: This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John -
N: Du Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his CAMERA CREW. Mark's eyes keep glancing over at him.
C: DAVE
D: - nothing to do with anyone but you. This is you, Mark. This is you. Focus and take what's yours!

N: Mark walks onto the mat. CHANTS of "U.S.A... U.S.A..." from the Americans in the stands... waving flags and shouting. Mark faces his Bulgarian opponent in the center of the mat as each are checked by the REFEREE. As Mark is patted down, he glances over at his corner: du Pont is talking in Dave's ear, and Dave HAS HIS ARM AROUND du Pont's shoulders, listening. The camera crew films them.
C: REFEREE
D: Wrestle!
N: Mark's immediately taken down, for a moment ONTO HIS BACK.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - MINUTES LATER
N: Mark is GASPING for air, sitting in his chair in the corner. Dave rubs his muscles while yelling at him, in his face -- But Mark can only focus on du Pont, clumsily fanning him with the white towel, accidentally hitting him with it.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - MINUTES LATER
N: Mark wrestles, struggling - eyes lost, mouth open, gasping. The drive, the poetry, it's all gone. REFEREE blows the whistle. The match is over. The wrestlers stand. Referee RAISES THE BULGARIAN'S hand. Mark looks lost. Du Pont is STARING at him. Dave hangs his head. Ref turns the wrestlers around and raises the Bulgarian's hand again. Du Pont watches the small Bulgarian contingent in the crowd - cheering, dancing, waving the Bulgarian flag.

T: CUT TO:

D: ... He's coached national and world champions with his unique blend of passion and inspiration...
E: V.O.
N: C/U of a TV SCREEN: a SERIES OF IMAGES: Mark Schultz winning matches (one of the images is the one that became the Foxcatcher poster); Dave winning; Dan Bane winning..... THEN, on screen, is the scene of du Pont "teaching" Mark a WRESTLING MOVE:
C: DU PONT
D: From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat.
N: Mark lets du Pont take him down, though it's abundantly apparent how much Mark is gritting his teeth through this.
S: INT. LARGE EMPTY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: WE SEE where we are: a huge empty room - once used for grand dances. In a corner: du Pont and the Documentary Director sit on two chairs in front of a TV hooked up to a VCR. The Director is screening "The John du Pont Story" for his boss. Du Pont has a PISTOL tucked in his waistband. ON THE VIDEO: A SHOT OF: Mark finding du Pont in the stands at the Worlds and hugging him tightly. A SHOT OF: Mark winning the Olympic Trials and Dave HUGGING and LIFTING his brother into the air. A SHOT OF: du Pont watching this from the stands and raising his fist in the air. A SHOT OF: Dave talking to the camera in the Foxcatcher gym:
C: DAVE

E: CONT'D QUIETLY
N: A SHOT OF: du Pont talking to the camera, haltingly - trying so hard to be authoritative, inspirational:

N: A SHOT of du Pont climbing into the pilot seat of his helicopter. He puts on his headset.
C: VIDEO ANNOUNCER
D: John du Pont is that Golden Eagle.
E: V.O.
N: Du Pont takes off in the helicopter and flies away. Over this shot, the end title comes up: "THE GOLDEN EAGLE OF AMERICA - THE JOHN DU PONT STORY." THE TAPE ENDS. The TV screen goes to static snow. SILENCE. Du Pont sits there, Director next to him. Finally, du Pont stands and starts for the door. Director follows.
C: DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
D: We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI -
C: DU PONT
D: Good.
E: STILL MOVING
C: DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
D: - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after "The Edge of Night." That should be a good one -
N: Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not even turning to face him.
C: DU PONT
D: Excellent.
N: The Director stops at the door. He calls out to du Pont --
C: DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
D: - I'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BIG HOUSE - DAY
N: Du Pont walks out a SIDE DOOR of the Big House, followed by the LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD. He continues toward his car - the BLACK MERCURY - goes to the driver's side. Then, something catches his eye in a nearby tree - he points it out the Security Guard:
C: DU PONT
D: Northern Cardinal. Look at that.
C: LARGE SECURITY GUARD
D: Yes, sir.
C: DU PONT
D: They never leave home, no matter how cold it gets.
C: LARGE SECURITY GUARD
D: Yes, sir.
N: They get in the car and du Pont turns on the ignition. Before he shifts into gear, he removes the PISTOL from his waistband and places it on the middle seat. He pulls out.
T: CUT TO:
N: I/E. DU PONT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS Du Pont drives the dirt road that edges the woods ringing the enormous front lawn. The trees are bare, a bit snowy. Peaceful and pretty. The car approaches Dave's house.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Du Pont's car pulls up. Dave's Subaru is parked in the yard out front, and Dave lies half-in-half-out the driver's side door, working on the FUSE BOX under the steering column. Dave rises out of the car to see who's pulled up.
C: DAVE
D: Hey, Coach.
N: Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at him through his open driver's window.
C: DAVE
D: What's up, John?
E: CONT'D
N: Du Pont picks up his PISTOL from the seat.
C: LARGE SECURITY GUARD
D: Oh. Hold on there -
N: Du Pont POINTS the pistol at Dave.
C: DU PONT
D: You got a problem with me?
C: DAVE
D: JOHN -
N: Dave holds out his hand - on his palm is the word "KIDS" - Du Pont SHOOTS Dave. The bullet goes through Dave's hand, smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground. The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks behind the passenger side fender. Dave tries to crawl away.
C: NANCY
D: Dave!.... David!...
N: Nancy runs onto the porch and is screaming for her husband. Du Pont POINTS the pistol at her. She RUNS inside. Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the back of the head. After a few moments, he drives away. Nancy runs outside. She cradles her husband as he bleeds out in the snow.
T: FADE OUT.
S: INT. MAKESHIFT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mark, his HEAD SHAVED, sits in a chair too small for him. He's in front of a painted cinder block wall. He wears only shorts, no shirt. A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him. After several moments, we START TO HEAR crowd-pumping MUSIC in the background. LOUDER. LOUDER.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP ARENA - NIGHT
N: Mark walks out of the tunnel into the ARENA. HUGE SOUND - loud, crowd-pumping music. Strobe lights. Mark's bare- chested, no shoes. He looks straight ahead as he walks. There's something missing behind his eyes.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE CAGE/UFC ARENA - NIGHT
N: Mark fights a Japanese martial artist. Mark's destroying him in a brutal, uninhibited display of aggression. He's got his opponent on his back and he pounds his bloody face repeatedly. The REF stops the fight. Mark stands. He's completely still, except for his heavy breathing. The other man's blood is on him. The crowd is wild, CHANTING, SCREAMING -- "U.S.A.... U.S.A.... U.S.A.... U.S.A...." SCREEN GOES BLACK.
