S: INT. KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY
N: ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control, walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.
C: ABBY
D: Morning, Freddy.
C: SECURITY GUARD
D: Morning, Abby. Another peaceful day?
C: ABBY
D: If you say so...
S: INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
N: JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.
C: JOY
D: We've got problems.
E: panicked
C: ABBY
D: There are no problems, Joy. Only solutions.
C: JOY
D: The sky-cam on the traffic copter has a cracked lens and they can't fix it.
C: ABBY
D: Okay, that's a problem. Call Matt Hardwick down at Media Services. He's got a few Sky Cams and he owes me. Now, where are my weathermen?
E: thinking, then...
N: Joy opens a door to a waiting area.
S: INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
N: Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.
C: LATINO MEN
D: Hey there!
C: ABBY
D: Hi, guys!
N: Abby waves back and closes the door. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: What's with the pot bellies?
C: JOY
D: Research shows people like fat weathermen. It makes them feel safe.
C: ABBY
D: I like the one in the green and the one in the brown, but I want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more, then I'll make my decision.
C: LARRY
D: Abby!
E: O.S.
N: LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to them. He wears a makeup bib.
C: ABBY
D: Morning, Larry.
C: LARRY
D: I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore. It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home. I can't do it on air, too. A man can only take so much.
N: Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done this before.
C: ABBY
D: You're not a man, Larry... You're a newsman. A newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. But you can. You've got balls the size of Volkswagens. Don't think I haven't noticed.
E: off his look
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: LARRY
D: I've only thought of them as blue as of late, but you're right. They are quite sizeable. But not disproportionately so. I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing --
E: re his balls with pride
N: Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to.
C: ABBY
D: I think I've made my point.
N: Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...
S: INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
N: ...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.
C: DORI
D: Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a * crap about trees in Alaska! It's not newsworthy.
C: JOSH
D: Oh, but full coverage on David Beckham's new tattoo is vital?!
N: Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF.
C: GEORGIA
D: He's trying to kill me! He knows I can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it! Does anyone see this? Is this a hive?
E: to the room
C: JOSH
D: It looks like syphilis to me.
C: DORI
D: See that? You wouldn't even know what syphilis looks like if it weren't for my story on Paris Hilton.
E: to Josh
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: GUEST CHEF
D: She doesn't eat crab or beef or fish. She doesn't eat anything but chicken. You don't need a chef on this show. You need a box of McNuggets.
E: to Abby
N: Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.
S: 5 INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - MORNING 5*
N: Cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set. Georgia and Larry taste samples of what he's prepared.
C: GEORGIA
D: I have to tell you, Bruce. This is the best Chicken Kiev I've ever tasted.
C: GUEST CHEF
D: Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes an excellent alternative for chicken, Georgia.
N: JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.
C: JAVIER
D: Can I take home the leftovers?
N: They all laugh.
C: LARRY
D: When we return, our live Skycam traffic update and more on David Beckham's hundred thousand dollar tattoo.
C: GEORGIA
D: And what you can do to help preserve the ancient forests of Alaska -- and how it might help your Albuquerque electric bill.
S: 6 INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - MORNING 6*
N: Abby and Joy stand next to CLIFF, the show's director.
C: CLIFF
D: Go to commercial. I don't know how you do it.
E: to Abby
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: It's just a matter of staring the chaos in the eye and showing it who's boss. Nice work, guys.
N: She pats him on the back and heads out of the control room.
C: JOY
D: Stuart wants to see you. He's freaking out.
E: to Abby
C: ABBY
D: That means he got the numbers.
E: worried
S: INT. KPHX - STUART'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager.
C: STUART
D: Have you seen the ratings for yesterday? We got beat by all the network shows, plus a rerun of "Who's the Boss". The one where the vacuum breaks.
C: ABBY
D: It's a temporary setback. This week we'll do better.
C: STUART
D: The guy with the cable access show on Channel 83 does better. If we programed Jerry Springer re-runs, we'd do a nine share at a quarter the price.
N: Abby looks worried.
C: ABBY
D: Please tell me you're not thinking of killing the show.
C: STUART
D: I'm not, but I can guarantee you that's what the new management's thinking.
C: ABBY
D: Stuart, "Sacramento AM" is an award- * winning news program.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: STUART
D: Management doesn't listen to awards. It listens to numbers. We're not a family-run station anymore, Abby. You're good at what you do, but you've got to get me some numbers. I've got two daughters in college and a son in beauty school. I don't know how much you know about Vidal Sassoon but that shit ain't cheap.
N: Abby nods.
C: ABBY
D: You can count on me, Stuart.
S: 8 INT. KPHX - WOMEN'S BATHROOM - DAY 8*
N: Abby and Joy stand at the sinks. Abby compulsively flosses * in front of the mirror. *
C: ABBY
D: I can't be letting corporate management dictate the content of this show. This is my show. I control it.
N: She rips out an extra two feet of floss. * ABBY (cont'd) * I should cancel my date tonight and * make a list of ideas for sweeps.
C: JOY
D: Absolutely not. You should be out, observing humanity. Humanity's who watches our show.
C: ABBY
D: Yeah, all 2.47% of them.
C: JOY
D: You've already rescheduled on this guy three times. You cancel tonight and he's gone. He's read more than a dozen books, he has a 401K and he's cute.
N: She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony PROFILE and PHOTO. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 JOY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Look at this bone structure. This could be the bone structure of your future children. Don't you want them to be symmetrical? Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy. *
C: ABBY
D: You printed his profile?
C: JOY
D: What? I'm married. I live vicariously through your dating life. And I really think that this could be our next boyfriend. C'mon, he had nine out of ten items on your checklist.
C: ABBY
D: Well, technically eight and a half. He said he could cook, but when I pressed him, he was completely unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you think that's a little suspicious?
N: Off Joy's look, we CUT TO...
S: EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Sacramento's nicest restaurant. Diners enter and exit. *
S: INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - FOYER - NIGHT
N: Abby approaches the FEMALE HOSTESS, at her podium.
C: ABBY
D: Hi. I'm looking for a guy with sandy brown hair, athletic build, and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which -- I know what you're thinking -- it's a little short, but he's read The Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just live with it, okay?
C: JIM
D: Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.
E: O.S.
N: She turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking. Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo. Abby gulps. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 JIM (cont'd) But I'll read Gatsby again if that makes it any better.
C: ABBY
D: Jim -- hey. Hi. Hey.
C: HOSTESS
D: Shall I show you to your table?
N: Abby and a mildly perturbed Jim follow, clearly not off to a banner start.
S: INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT
N: Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.
C: ABBY
D: You know what? This is not the best angle. We should get the table over there. Then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station.
C: JIM
D: I'm fine here.
C: ABBY
D: No, trust me. It'll be better over there.
N: He looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move. ANTOHER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER The waiter is now taking their drink order.
C: WAITER
D: Can I get you some water for the table?
C: JIM
D: Bottle of flat, please.
C: ABBY
D: You know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. And they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. So, technically it's not tap water.
E: MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 ABBY (cont'd) It's filtered water, which is exactly what bottled water is, except you don't have to pay $7 for it.
C: JIM
D: Yeah, I still like the way it tastes better.
C: WAITER
D: Can I get you any cocktails?
C: JIM
D: Scotch on the rocks.
C: ABBY
D: In your profile, you said you liked red wine.
C: JIM
D: I do, I just feel like having a scotch right now.
N: She looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.
C: ABBY
D: Was there anything else you changed your mind about? I mean, just so I can figure it into the overall picture.
E: re the paper
C: JIM
D: You printed out my profile?
C: ABBY
D: Actually, my associate producer did. She likes me to be prepared. Not that I'm ever not prepared. Kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way.
C: JIM
D: That wasn't in my profile.
C: ABBY
D: No, but it was in your background check. So...tell me about yourself.
E: off his look; changing the subject
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: JIM
D: Well, what's left that you don't know?
C: ABBY
D: Good point.
N: There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him.
C: ABBY
D: I printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened.
C: JIM
D: I take it it's happened before?
C: ABBY
D: No, but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist, I just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible.
N: As Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.
C: JIM
D: Thank you.
N: He takes a huge sip, relieved. Abby looks at him.
C: ABBY
D: You realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water, don't you?
N: He looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare.
S: EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT- NIGHT
N: Jim and Abby walk to their cars. Jim is walking faster than she is, trying to get away. She trots along, trying to keep up.
C: ABBY
D: Next time we could go bowling. I noticed online that you're the mid- ranked amateur in the state. I mean, if there is a next time. I'm not trying to be presumptuous, but I am getting a pretty good vibe here...
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 Jim doesn't even consider refuting this. He just wants to leave. Abby reaches into her purse and pulls out -- * ABBY (CONT'D) * Floss? *
C: JIM
D: Uh, no thanks. It's late. I * should go.
N: He gets into his car as she hands him his doggy bag.
C: ABBY
D: FYI, be sure to eat this by tomorrow. With curry, you can't smell if it's gone bad, so after three days, you should just toss it. Really, don't even give it to a pet or anything.
C: JIM
D: Three days. Got it.
N: Abby has officially lost control to the producer part of herself...she knows what she's doing, but can't stop herself.
C: ABBY
D: Here, just to be sure, I'll write today's date on it for you.
N: Abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag.
C: JIM
D: It's fine, really...
E: annoyed
N: The bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy leftovers SPILLS all over Jim's lap.
C: ABBY
D: I told them to double bag this!
E: horrified
C: JIM
D: I'm just gonna -- go.
C: ABBY
D: I'm so sor --
N: Jim closes the door, catching the hem of Abby's wrap skirt. ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Wait, my -- 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 The car speeds off -- RIPPING Abby's skirt right off her as it races away. Abby is left standing in her underwear.
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Abby, still in her undies, trudges up the steps. She opens her front door. Her calico cat D'ARTAGNAN, 9, skeptical and easily annoyed, stares up at her.
C: ABBY
D: Don't ask.
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Abby, now in pajamas, flosses her teeth. She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish.
C: ABBY
D: D'Artagnan! Stop that!
N: Abby picks up the cat.
C: ABBY
D: How many times do I have to tell you? Leave Juliet alone. Wasn't Romeo enough for you?
E: CONT'D
N: Abby picks up the remote, snaps the TV on to "Nightline" with Brian Williams.
C: ABBY
D: Now there's a man. Not some five foot nine scotch drinker who lies about cumin.
E: CONT'D
N: She heads into the bathroom.
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: As Abby flosses in front of the mirror...
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT
N: ...D'Artagnan hisses at the TV and steps on the remote control. ON TV - the channel jumps to a cable access show. MIKE ALEXANDER, 30's, handsome but not pretty, proudly dressed in an outfit that costs less than fifty dollars, addresses the camera. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: You want the truth! But you can't handle the truth. `Cause it's --
C: MOTLEY GROUP
D: Ugly!
N: THE THEME SONG for "The Ugly Truth" kicks in over a series of past scenes: Mike judo-kicking an giant Oprah doll. Several posters spelling the word "LOVE" are destroyed by Mike with a variety of weapons. The theme sequence ends and CUTS TO --
S: INT. CHANNEL 83 - STAGE - NIGHT
N: "The Ugly Truth", live on air. The look of the show's set is low-rent cable TV.
C: MIKE
D: I'm Mike Alexander and we're back with the "The Ugly Truth." Tonight, as always, we're going to talk about what it is men and women really want in relationships. I've been looking through some books...
N: He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles.
C: MIKE
D: "Smart Women Foolish Choices", "Women Who Love Men Who Hate Them", "Hating Men Who Love Women But Hate Loving Men"...
E: CONT'D
N: He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books.
C: MIKE
D: Billions and billions of dollars wasted on self-help psycho­babble.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them ablaze. Then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a marshmallow. Begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.
C: MIKE
D: Now listen up, ladies, cause I'm only gonna say this once tonight and it's just three little words. No, they're not "I love you." Here goes... MEN. ARE. SIMPLE. We can not be trained. All this "Men Are From Venus" bullshit is a waste of your time and money.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: You want to be a lonely hag, then keep reading these stupid books. You want a relationship, here's how you get one: it's called a Stairmaster. Get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks. No one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass. And they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them. You want to win a man over? You don't need ten steps. You need one. And it's called a blow- job.
E: CONT'D
N: Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.
C: MIKE
D: And don't forget to --
E: CONT'D
N: He mimes swallowing.
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: WE PAN off the television to the bed, where Abby now watches, appalled.
C: ABBY
D: Oh my God. It's that cable access jackass Stuart was talking about.
S: INT. CHANNEL 83 - STAGE - NIGHT
N: Mike takes a call.
C: FEMALE CALLER
D: How dare you burn those books? They've helped my personal life more than --
E: O.S.
C: MIKE
D: What's your boyfriend's name, princess?
C: FEMALE CALLER
D: I'm not seeing anyone right now but --
E: O.S.
N: Mike hangs up the phone. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: My point exactly, Shrek. Next caller.
S: INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
N: Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing. WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike continues his rant.
C: MIKE
D: Men don't fall in love. Men fall in "want." We want things. We're hunters and gatherers. We're the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasn't done squat. Trust me, there was a Pamela Anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her.
N: Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it. He crosses it out and writes "LUST." MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Now girls, if you want to think lust is the same as love, that's fine, but you're delusional. Let's take some more calls. (picks up the phone) You're on the air. Abby is now on the phone.
C: ABBY
D: So you're saying men are incapable of love?
C: MIKE
D: Did I burst your little Harlequin Romance bubble?
N: Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed. *
C: ABBY
D: The only thing you burst is your credibility. Men are absolutely capable of experiencing love.
C: MIKE
D: Okay, I'll bite. Who's the guy?
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: What?
C: MIKE
D: The guy, Mr. Wonderful, the one who's so capable of love. Who is he? What's he like?
C: ABBY
D: Well, he's not like you, that's for sure.
C: MIKE
D: Thank you very much. Go on.
C: ABBY
D: He's smart...he's handsome but doesn't know it... He's successful, but in a job that means something. He loves red wine, classical music, Cary Grant movies...
E: enjoying the fantasy
C: MIKE
D: This is a guy in America, right? You're not calling from Europe or anything.
C: ABBY
D: Are you interested in listening or not?
C: MIKE
D: No, please. I'm loving this.
C: ABBY
D: He works out, not because he's vain, because it's healthy. He's socially liberal but fiscally conservative. He likes dogs but he's a cat person. He never gets out of bed before you on a Sunday morning --
C: MIKE
D: Oh my god. You're a lesbian!
C: ABBY
D: What?!
C: MIKE
D: Well, you're describing a woman.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Why are those qualities so threatening to you? Perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women aren't interested in you. At least women of quality.
N: Mike scoffs, but he's thrown. He takes a moment, then...
C: MIKE
D: Where is this guy? I will give you one hundred dollars of my own money to bring him down here and let me meet him.
C: ABBY
D: Oh, he's out there...somewhere.
C: MIKE
D: Wait a second. You're not even dating this guy?!
C: ABBY
D: Well, no...I'm just describing a type...I thought that's what we were doing.
C: MIKE
D: You don't even know him?!?
N: Mike bowls over LAUGHING. Abby realizes she's been had.
C: MIKE
D: Hold on...whoa...now I get the whole picture. You're a dog.
E: CONT'D
C: ABBY
D: Excuse me?
N: She rips the perfectly made bed apart and starts over. *
C: MIKE
D: You heard me. You must be. If you were hot, you'd be out breaking some poor schmuck's heart instead of spending all your time fantasizing about Mr. Wonderful. Face it, you're ugly!
C: ABBY
D: I am not ugly!
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Well, of course you don't think so. Ugly people never know they're ugly. It's like people who have B.O. They never know it because they're surrounded by their own stench all the time.
N: Now Abby's really fuming. She snaps a sheet violently. *
C: ABBY
D: That is the most ridic --
C: MIKE
D: Look, lemme help you out here. You might as well just face the fact that you're gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never going to get. Get a hobby. Build housing for the poor. Anything.
C: ABBY
D: How could you possibly --
C: MIKE
D: Hey, Lassie -- the show's called "The Ugly Truth". If you can't face it, don't call. Well that about wraps it up for today. I'm Mike Alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty.
E: switching gears
N: As he smiles smugly, Abby SCREAMS and THROWS the phone across the room. D'Artagnan, terrified, jumps off the bed, which is * now in total disarray. *
S: INT. KPHX - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
N: Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room. Dori and Josh are already there.
C: JOY
D: How did the date go?
C: ABBY
D: I ended up pantsless in a parking lot.
C: JOY
D: That's awesome!
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 Stuart walks into the conference room.
C: STUART
D: Morning, everybody.
N: He puts a DVD in the player.
C: STUART
D: Now before I play this, I have to warn you... ...he's a little rough around the edges.
E: hits play
N: ON TV: Mike's face appears.
C: MIKE
D: Face it, you're ugly!
E: ON T.V.
C: ABBY'S VOICE
D: I am not ugly!
E: O.S.
N: Joy looks at Abby.
C: JOY
D: Is that you?
C: ABBY
D: What?! No!
C: MIKE
D: Ugly people never know they're ugly. It's like people who have B.O.--
E: ON T.V.
N: Abby grabs the remote and turns off the T.V.
C: ABBY
D: Why are we watching this?!
C: STUART
D: One word. Ratings. Say hello to our new guest commentator. I'm starting him with two segments a week. Three minutes a pop.
C: ABBY
D: Are you kidding me?
C: JOSH
D: Who the hell is this guy?
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: STUART
D: His name is Mike Alexander.
C: ABBY
D: And he's a quintessential misogynist uber-moron who represents everything wrong with television and society at large...
C: DORI
D: I get crap every time I suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now you're gonna put this douchebag on the air?
C: STUART
D: He's got a point of view. We don't have to like him, we're news people. We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. It's good for ratings.
N: Abby holds up a piece of paper.
C: ABBY
D: I've got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings. We don't need him.
N: Stuart takes the memo, reading it.
C: STUART
D: A live debate on immigration policy? Never work.
C: ABBY
D: What are you talking about? Albuquerque is 45% Latino.
N: At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town, Latino guys like to have a lot of sex. Which means they'd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they can't bring grandma across the border.
E: as they all stare at him MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 MIKE (cont'd) Sorry, I was eavesdropping out in the hall.
C: STUART
D: See, what did I tell you? He's great.
C: MIKE
D: Thanks, boss.
N: Abby spins to face Stuart.
C: ABBY
D: You already hired him?!
C: MIKE
D: Who's this delightful creature?
E: re Abby
C: ABBY
D: Your superior.
C: MIKE
D: Mmm...I like a woman on top.
S: INT. ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Abby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria.
C: ABBY
D: I am an award-winning news producer. I am an award-winning news producer...
E: chanting
N: A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, no hard feelings, right?
C: ABBY
D: You don't even knock?
C: MIKE
D: I knocked. I got no response.
C: ABBY
D: So, essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Wow. You are wound like a fuckin' top.
N: Abby glares at him.
C: ABBY
D: Woof woof. Recognize the bark?
N: He stares at her, surprised.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, what do you know? You're not ugly at all.
E: then; realizing
C: ABBY
D: Imagine my relief.
C: MIKE
D: You know, if it weren't for you, I would have never gotten this gig. You and I make good TV.
C: ABBY
D: I'm sorry, what channel is your show on?
C: MIKE
D: Eighty three.
C: ABBY
D: This is channel two. You do know that the lower numbers are better, right? More people watch. So don't tell me that "you and I" make good TV. I am an award-winning news producer. I make good TV. You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel.
C: MIKE
D: I hadn't really been picturing you that way, but thanks for the image.
C: ABBY
D: Let me tell you something. I am not one of your viewers. My cat stepped on the remote.

S: INT. KPHX - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Abby strides down the hall with Georgia and Larry.
C: ABBY
D: There is no way Mike Alexander is going to stay on my show. I want you to skewer him. Make him look like a complete idiot. Not that it will be hard. The man is a moron of unseen proportions.
C: GEORGIA
D: That's just what we need on this show.
E: re Larry
C: LARRY
D: Does anyone think my highlights are too shiny?
C: ABBY
D: Larry, listen to me. I want Mike Alexander to go down in flames. I want Mike Alexander to be nothing but a pile of ash on the seat next to you. I want the janitor to come in with his Dustbuster and vacuum up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and then when he throws the ashes into the dumpster outside, I want the rats to vomit and then defecate on the ashes of Mike Alexander.
N: She strides off. Larry looks at Georgia.
C: LARRY
D: And I thought you were angry and bitter.
C: GEORGIA
D: Uh, no, that would be my untouched vagina.
S: 25 INT. KPHX - SACRAMENTO AM SET - DAY 25 *
N: Cameras roll as Larry and Georgia sit at the anchor desk. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: GEORGIA
D: For years, there have been concerns about lowering television standards. But many believe that this man and his local public access show, "The Ugly Truth," have brought things to a new low. With that, we welcome Mike Alexander.
N: Mike gives a cocky wave.
C: MIKE
D: How ya doing, guys?
C: LARRY
D: Mike, how do you respond to those who say your show is offensive?
C: MIKE
D: It is... but then again, so is the truth.
C: GEORGIA
D: The truth about what, Mr. Alexander?
C: MIKE
D: What relationships are really like.
S: INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
N: Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. Cliff mans the bank of monitors.
C: MIKE
D: Take marriage for instance. It's about mutual benefits, social pressure, and taxes. It's not about love and we should stop pretending it is.
N: We INTERCUT with Georgia, Larry, and Mike on set.
C: ABBY
D: C'mon Georgia, let him have it.
C: GEORGIA
D: Sounds to me like no one's ever loved you and you're taking it out on the female population.
N: In the control room, Abby smirks. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Ooh, good one.
C: MIKE
D: Well, while we're making observations, you two project this image of the perfect couple, when clearly, it's a lie.
C: LARRY
D: Excuse me?
N: Abby nervously gnaws on the straw from her Kombucha drink. *
C: ABBY
D: Cliff, let's go to commercial.
E: nervous
C: CLIFF
D: Stuart told me to keep rolling, no matter what.
C: ABBY
D: What? When?
N: Cliff shrugs. Abby is pissed.
C: ABBY
D: This is my show.
C: CLIFF
D: Not right now it isn't.
N: On the set, Mike continues his vivisection of Larry and Georgia.
C: MIKE
D: I mean, come on Larry, I grew up watching you on TV. You used to be this cool confident cat. Georgia's no dumb bunny. She knew the only way she was getting off the weekend shift was by hooking up with you. But then lo and behold, she became more popular than you and ended up with twice your salary.
C: ABBY
D: C'mon, Larry. Take him down.
N: She starts twisting her straw into shapes, as -- * 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: LARRY
D: I'm proud of my wife's success.
C: MIKE
D: Bullllloney you are. You hate her success. You feel emasculated by her and that screws with your head which inevitably screws with your manhood.
C: GEORGIA
D: What's your point, Mr. Alexander?
C: ABBY
D: Good girl, Georgia. Take control.
C: MIKE
D: My point? My point is that your husband hasn't had sex with you in...I'm gonna say. . .three months?
C: LARRY
D: That's not my fault!
C: MIKE
D: I know, it's her fault!
C: GEORGIA
D: Why is it my fault?!
N: In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out.
C: ABBY
D: Oh, dear God.
C: GEORGIA
D: Well, what am I supposed to do, give up the money, so he can get an erection?
C: MIKE
D: I agree. You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque? It's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. You're not going to do any better than Larry. You just have to let him be a man. LET HIM
C: BE A MAN, GEORGIA!
E: MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 MIKE (cont'd) (to Larry) And you, Frowny McFlacid, give it to her. Now! Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. The crew goes crazy. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. Abby sinks down into a chair. *

C: JOY
D: Found her.
N: Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet.
C: STUART
D: One thousand, one hundred and forty- seven calls and over three hundred E-mails. And fifty-three percent of them were women. This guy's a lightening rod!
C: ABBY
D: People liked him?!
E: confused
C: STUART
D: Liked him? They loved him.
C: ABBY
D: How is that possible?
C: STUART
D: I don't know, but I'm scaling back the news and giving it to "The Ugly Truth." Corporate wants five minutes of Mike Alexander, five days a week.
C: ABBY
D: Stuart, I really think this is a mistake --
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008

C: JONAH
D: Dude, you totally hosed me!
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: JONAH
D: Last week on your show, you said you should always be mean to hot girls because they'll want you more. I tried it today, she cried, and then I got detention.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: First of all - don't listen to what I say on my show. Second of all, you're supposed to do that to 25- year-old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want. Not 14-year-old girls. They're going through puberty. They have enough problems.
C: JONAH
D: Mom said when she was fourteen, she was the prettiest girl in the class.
C: MIKE
D: Well, I was there when she was fourteen and let me tell you something -- she lied.
N: Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box.
C: ELIZABETH

C: ELIZABETH
D: It's nothing worse than what he's heard on your show.
N: She hands him the cake box.

N: Mike's goofing with the pretty makeup girl, as Abby walks up to give him some last minute tips.
C: ABBY
D: Keep it clean, keep it moving, and stick to the script. You're on a live affiliate network news program. You do not have the luxury of using the words "blow" and "job" in the same sentence. If you say anything scatological, you're fired.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Really? Because I thought you were gonna get fired if you don't keep me happy. I've got a list of demands to go over after the show. And let me just warn you -- they're gonna be scatological.

C: MIKE
D: I'm Mike Alexander and this is "The Ugly Truth," where we'll be taking a few minutes every day to talk about men, women and relationships. Let's start with men. Men are simple. To illustrate my point -- on my left we have the best our world has to offer.
N: He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside the table, a man plays violin.
C: MIKE

N: She walks off. Confused by her reaction, he follows. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: C'mon, we were a good team back there. You were the one who told me to lick the Jello.

N: Abby puts on her shoes as Colin opens his wallet and hands her a card. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008

D: Not exactly. We're taking things slow -- getting to know each other first. Why am I talking about this with you?
E: then
C: MIKE
D: You're the one who brought it up.
C: ABBY
D: Dr. Anderson is everything that you could never be. In fact....
N: Abby takes Colin's card from her wallet, dials a number, then --
C: ABBY
D: Hi, this is Abby Richter calling for Dr. Anderson. Yes, I'll hold.
E: CONT'D into phone
C: MIKE
D: You're calling the guy?! You can't do that. You've gotta let him call you.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Please. It's the twenty-first century...
N: Abby shoots Mike a snide grin.
C: ABBY
D: Hi Colin. This is Abby. Your neighbor. From last night.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while going over patient files.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, hi. Everything okay?
T: We INTERCUT.
C: ABBY
D: Couldn't be better. I just wanted to call and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you.
N: Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at him, but she can't stop him.
C: COLIN
D: Oh, thanks.
C: ABBY
D: So... I was just thinking that we should have dinner.
C: COLIN
D: Oh... great.
E: not great
N: Mike shakes his head, knowing where this is going.
C: ABBY
D: There's this new French Bistro that got fantastic reviews and there's a gallery opening in Old Town on Friday. So, if you want, we could have dinner, then go to the opening.
C: COLIN
D: Hmmm, Friday... wow.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Is that not a good time?
C: COLIN
D: Actually, Abby, I'm still kind of unsettled with the move and everything so I`m really not --
N: Mike snatches the phone from Abby and hangs it up.
C: ABBY
D: What the hell are you doing?
C: MIKE
D: Saving you. He was blowing you off.
C: ABBY
D: He was not.
N: She moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to stop her.
C: MIKE
D: Don't! He'll be expecting you to call him back. When you don't, he'll call you.
C: ABBY
D: How do you know?
C: MIKE
D: Because I know men. If you want it to work out with this guy, you'll listen to me and do exactly as I say. You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call. It might even be too late. Even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than Abby, his desperate neighbor.
C: ABBY
D: I'm not desperate! Why, did I sound desperate?
E: then
C: MIKE
D: Listen to you -- desperately asking me if you sound desperate.
N: A concerned look from Abby as...the phone rings. Her caller I.D. says SACRAMENTO MED. * 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Although you won't admit it, you know I know what I'm talking about. It's your call, dude.
E: CONT'D beat
N: She thinks, looks at the phone again...
C: ABBY
D: Okay. What do I do?
C: MIKE
D: Pick up the phone and say: "Hey, Doug."
C: ABBY
D: Why would I --
C: MIKE
D: Just do it.
N: She answers the phone.
C: ABBY
D: Hey, Doug.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: A confused look from Colin as he talks on the phone.
C: COLIN
D: No, this is Colin.
T: We INTERCUT.
C: ABBY
D: Oh my God. Sorry.
C: COLIN
D: Who's Doug?
C: MIKE
D: Just a guy I'm seeing. It's nothing serious.
E: whispering
N: Abby hesitates. Mike shoves her.
C: ABBY
D: Just a guy I'm seeing. It's nothing serious.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: COLIN
D: Oh.
C: MIKE
D: Hang on a sec.
E: whispering
C: ABBY
D: Hang on a sec.
N: Mike puts the phone on hold.
C: ABBY
D: What now?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: Make him wait.
N: A long pause.
C: ABBY
D: This is so rude.
C: MIKE
D: That's the point.
C: ABBY
D: When do I pick up?
C: MIKE
D: Never. You make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up. If he's still holding on after thirty more seconds, you may actually have a chance.
C: ABBY
D: You'd better be right about this.
C: MIKE
D: Think about it. Would you wait on hold for somebody you were trying to blow off?
C: ABBY
D: You have a point.
C: MIKE
D: Just give me a little bit of time and I can make this guy your bitch.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: I don't want a "bitch." And Colin would never be a bitch. He's a well-rounded man capable of mature emotions and deep abiding love. Things which you know not of.
E: scoffing
C: MIKE
D: Maybe not, but I know about lust, seduction, and manipulation. And clearly, you do not.
C: ABBY
D: Why would you want to help me?
C: MIKE
D: Because then you'll have to admit that I know more about this stuff than you do.
N: They stare each other down. Then Mike looks at his watch.
C: MIKE
D: Thirty seconds.
E: CONT'D
N: The phone light is still blinking.
C: ABBY
D: My God, you're right. Now what?
N: Mike hangs up the phone.
C: MIKE
D: Always make an impression. Let's get out of here. We have work to do.
C: ABBY
D: But what about --
C: MIKE
D: Don't worry, in five seconds he'll call back.
C: ABBY
D: What are you, Nostradamus? That's --
E: skeptical
N: The phone RINGS again. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: -- amazing.
E: CONT'D in awe
N: He hustles her out of the room. A moment after the door closes, Mike rushes back in and hangs up the ringing phone. He smiles, then bolts.
S: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Dial tone. Colin hangs up the phone.
C: COLIN
D: Unbelievable.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET ­ DAY
N: Abby and Mike walk down the street.
C: MIKE
D: Rule number one. Never criticize.
C: ABBY
D: Even if it's constructive?
C: MIKE
D: Never. Men are incapable of growth, change or progress. For men, self- improvement ends at toilet- training. Rule number two. Laugh at whatever he says.
C: ABBY
D: What if what he's saying isn't funny?
C: MIKE
D: That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm.
C: ABBY
D: And a fake orgasm is good?
C: MIKE
D: No, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all.
C: ABBY
D: A fake orgasm is no orgasm.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Only to you. You're not the only person in the room, you know. Let's not be selfish.
N: Abby giggles. Mike is struck by the sound of her laughter.
C: MIKE
D: That was perfect. You have a perfect laugh. Real or fake?
E: CONT"D
C: ABBY
D: You'll never know.
N: He raises an eyebrow, impressed.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Mike and Abby wait for their lattes.
C: MIKE
D: Rule number three. Never talk about your problems. Men don't really listen or care.
C: ABBY
D: Some men care.
C: MIKE
D: No. Some men pretend to care. When we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for "let me put my dick in your ass."
C: ABBY
D: Okay, I'm trying to decide whether I should just walk away right now, or run.
C: MIKE
D: I know you think Colin is above it all, but he's a guy. If he's even remotely into you, he's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times.
C: ABBY
D: I love how you assume every man is as perverse as you are.
C: MIKE
D: I don't assume. I know. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
S: EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.
C: MIKE
D: Rule number four. Men are very visual. Ninety percent of a relationship is based on how good the woman looks. We have to change your look.
C: ABBY
D: What's wrong with my look?
C: MIKE
D: Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies? Nurse shoes?
E: taking her in
C: ABBY
D: These aren't nurse shoes! They're Lady Keds.
C: MIKE
D: Abby, you're a very attractive woman but you are completely inaccessible. You're all about comfort and efficiency.
C: ABBY
D: What's wrong with comfort and efficiency?
C: MIKE
D: Nothing. Except no one wants to fuck it.
N: With that, a MONTAGE BEGINS...
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
N: Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie.
C: ABBY
D: I am not getting breast implants.
C: MIKE
D: Size isn't everything. Breasts just have to be friendly. They have to say, "Hello, everybody! Look at me!"
N: Abby looks down at her breasts, curiously. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: What are mine saying?
C: MIKE
D: Uh, "I'm reading Tolstoy and I don't want to be disturbed"?
C: ABBY
D: Really? I hate Tolstoy.
N: A SALESWOMAN passes them.
C: MIKE
D: Excuse me ma'am, but we need some bras that will make my friend's boobs say, "Put me in your mouth -- I taste good."
E: CONT'D
N: The saleswoman looks disturbed, but hands him a push-up water bra.
C: SALESWOMAN
D: This should do the trick.
C: MIKE
D: Sweet. Strap it on, flapjacks.
E: to Abby
N: Abby glares at him as we CUT TO --
S: INT. SHOE STORE - DAY
N: Abby, wearing high heels, awkwardly makes her way over to Mike.
C: ABBY
D: I look like a hooker.
C: MIKE
D: That's a good thing.
N: She falls, KNOCKING OVER a large display of shoes. MIKE (cont'd) Well, you're on your back, so that works.
S: INT. HAIR SALON - DAY
N: Abby sits at a rinse chair, while Mike and the HAIRDRESSER study her look. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: You're not touching my hair until I know exactly what you're going to do with it.
C: MIKE
D: We're giving you bedhead.
C: ABBY
D: Why would I want bedhead?
C: MIKE
D: Bedhead is sexy. A ponytail implies that you are either operating heavy machinery or emptying the litter box. Neither of these things inspires an erection.
E: re her current hairdo
N: The hairdresser shoves her head under the sink and douses her with water.
S: EXT. CONDO COMPLEX - NIGHT
N: Night has fallen on the condo complex.
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.
C: ABBY
D: I just don't want to be perceived as a bimbo.
E: O.S.
C: MIKE
D: I don't want you to be a bimbo. You need to be two people, the saint and the sinner, the librarian and the stripper. It's a delicate balance. On one hand, you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado.
N: Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs. Her hair and make-up are sexy but not trashy.
C: ABBY
D: Well just don't sit there. Say something.
C: MIKE
D: Glasses.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Huh?
C: MIKE
D: You need glasses.
C: ABBY
D: But I wear contacts. Besides, doesn't the woman usually remove glasses during a makeover?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, but we're going for a stripper­librarian thing. Right now, I wouldn't trust you to find me a book.
N: Abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses. She puts them on.
C: MIKE
D: Not bad. Now we need to practice flirting.
E: CONT'D
C: ABBY
D: I know how to flirt.
C: MIKE
D: Do you want to be an old maid?
C: ABBY
D: So, if I don't listen to you, I'll be an old maid?
C: MIKE
D: "My name's Abby and I'm arthritic and alone. I have eighteen cats who keep me company."
E: acting old
C: ABBY
D: Oh, ha ha. That's very funny. "Are you wearing underwear?"
E: sarcastic pretending to be Mike
N: She grabs his ass.
C: MIKE
D: Come on! I wouldn't say that and I wouldn't grab ass.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: "Hey babe, what's wrong with a little ass grabbing?" "I mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? You're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas."
E: still as Mike continuing to pinch his ass
C: MIKE
D: You're a deeply, deeply disturbed person.
N: Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm.
C: ABBY
D: Maybe I'm just a good student.
C: MIKE
D: Would you stop doing that?
C: ABBY
D: Doing what?
C: MIKE
D: Touching me with your finger.
N: She seductively leans into him.
C: ABBY
D: Why? Am I turning you on?
C: MIKE
D: Maybe.
N: She gives him a look.
C: ABBY
D: Actually, I kind of like it.
C: MIKE
D: Really...
N: She leans in closer.
C: ABBY
D: Sucker.
N: He shoves her away. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: No teaching the teacher.
N: Just then, the doorbell RINGS.
C: ABBY
D: Who is it?
C: COLIN
D: It's Colin.
E: O.S.
C: ABBY
D: Oh my God!
C: MIKE
D: Told you he'd drop by.
C: ABBY
D: I'm not ready for this. Am I? I'm not.
E: panicking
C: MIKE
D: Calm down. Keep the conversation under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep him guessing.
N: Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there.
C: ABBY
D: Oh. Hey.
C: COLIN
D: Hi. Wow, you look great.
C: ABBY
D: Thanks.
C: COLIN
D: What happened to you today?
C: ABBY
D: What do you mean?
C: COLIN
D: You put me on hold and didn't call me back.
C: ABBY
D: That was you? I'm so sorry.
E: steering him to the door MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 ABBY (cont'd) Can you call me later? I'm super busy. She hustles him out the door.
C: ABBY
D: Bye.
E: CONT'D
N: Colin bangs on the door.
C: COLIN
D: Abby wait...
E: 0.S.
N: Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs up.
C: ABBY
D: Now what?
E: whispering
C: MIKE
D: Make him suffer.
C: COLIN
D: Do you want to go the Lobos game on Saturday?
E: O.S.
N: She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness.
C: MIKE
D: What the hell is that?!
N: As she continues to dork out, we CUT TO --
S: EXT. BALLPARK - DAY
N: The ROAR of the crowd at the Lobos game. Colin walks with Abby, who adjusts something in her ear. Now she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other end... MIKE'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- A different angle of Abby walking down the aisle.
C: MIKE
D: Nod if you can hear me.
N: BINOCULARS POV -- Abby nods. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Just relax. You're gonna be fine. I'll walk you through this.
E: CONT'D
N: Colin looks at Abby and smiles as they take their seats, * popcorn in hand. *
C: COLIN
D: Do you follow baseball?
T: We INTERCUT with Mike.
C: MIKE
D: There's no right answer to that question. Do something non- committal...
N: Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin hooks at her, confused.
C: COLIN
D: I'm really more of a fair weather fan myself. I do like watching Mike DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing bone structure.
C: MIKE
D: Laugh.
N: Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks at her.
C: COLIN
D: What's so funny?
C: ABBY
D: Your joke.
C: COLIN
D: What joke?
C: MIKE
D: Shit, he was serious?
N: Feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, Abby takes out her * floss. * MIKE * Wait -- what the fuck are you * doing? Is that floss? * Abby freezes. * 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 MIKE * Jesus! Put that away! * She puts the floss back in her purse. * MIKE (CONT'D) * Good. Now toss your hair. * She dramatically tosses her hair from one side to the other.
C: MIKE
D: Okay, that was a little over the top, but nice try.
E: CONT'D
C: ABBY
D: Thank you.
C: COLIN
D: For what?
N: Abby realizes she's spoken aloud.
C: ABBY
D: Thank you for... just being you.
C: COLIN
D: You're welcome...
C: MIKE
D: Okay, no more improvising. Just repeat everything I say, "You're so much fun to be with."
C: ABBY
D: You're so much fun to be with.
C: COLIN
D: Thanks.
N: A FAN calls to Mike.
C: FAN
D: Hey, down in front!
N: Mike gestures for the fan to leave him alone as he continues to instruct Abby.
C: MIKE
D: You're not like the other guys I`ve dated.
E: to Abby
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: You're not like the other guys I've dated.
C: FAN
D: Hey, sit down, jackass.
N: Mike waves him off, trying to remain focused on Abby.
C: MIKE
D: You're so much more interesting and informed.
E: to Abby
C: ABBY
D: You're so much more interesting and informed.
C: COLIN
D: That's nice to hear.
N: The fan throws peanuts at Mike. Mike turns around and shouts at the fan.
C: MIKE
D: Dude, what the fuck?!
C: ABBY
D: Dude, what the fuck?!
C: COLIN
D: What?
N: Abby blanches, waiting for Mike instructions.
C: MIKE
D: Oh, shit.
C: ABBY
D: Oh, shit.
N: Colin is now just staring at her.
C: MIKE
D: No, I'm not talking to you.
E: to Abby
C: ABBY
D: I'm not talking to you.
C: COLIN
D: Did I do something wrong?
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Abby, listen -- tell him you saw him looking at another girl. It's the only way out of this.
C: ABBY
D: Were you looking at another girl?
E: to Colin
C: COLIN
D: Who?
C: ABBY
D: Uh -- her?
N: She points to the only nearby female -- an Elderly Obese Hot Dog Lady.
C: COLIN
D: Yeah. I was just trying to get us a hot dog.
C: ABBY
D: Oh.
N: There's an awkward moment as Colin hands her the hot dog.
C: MIKE
D: Alright, we need a recovery. Make sure to eat your hot dog slowly. Men like watching penis-shaped food go into a girl's mouth.
C: ABBY
D: What?!
N: Repulsed, she flinches, losing control of her drink, DUMPING it into Colin's lap. He flinches.
C: ABBY
D: Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
N: She grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis.
C: COLIN
D: It's fine, really...
C: ABBY
D: No, I have to get it out or else it will stain --
N: She puts some muscle into it. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: What fabric is this...
E: CONT'D
C: COLIN
D: Cotton.
C: ABBY
D: Cotton's the worst. Well actually leather's the worst, followed by suede...
N: Unbeknownst to them, the batter hits a pop fly near them. THE JUMBOTRON CAMERA follows the guy catching the fly, then finds Abby and Colin. PANS over to them and -- It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB. The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare.
C: ABBY
D: Are you sure they're cotton cause this should be coming out, wait... it's coming. It's definitely coming. It's...done!
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles at Colin. As he looks nervously up at the JUMBOTRON. Abby follows his gaze -- and sees SHE'S ON IT. Everyone at the stadium is looking at her. The organ player bangs out "Charge." The stadium starts WHOOPING and HOLLERING.
S: EXT. BALLPARK - DAY
N: Abby is getting a citation from a self-righteous POLICE OFFICER.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: This is a family place, ma'am. Not an open-air hand job palace.
C: ABBY
D: I understand, officer.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: You want to pull those kind of stunts, you do it at home. Or in the backseat of a car, like moral upstanding people do.
N: He hands her a ticket and walks off. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
S: EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Colin walks a defeated Abby to her door. NEARBY, Mike watches this, unseen and impassive.
C: COLIN
D: Well, I can't say it was boring.
C: ABBY
D: That was pretty much the all-time worst first date ever.
C: COLIN
D: Gee, thanks.
N: Mike looks worried.
C: MIKE
D: Where are you going with this? No guy wants to hear that!
E: to Abby
C: ABBY
D: No, no, I take full responsibility. So... ...Thanks. But, hey, at least your pants are clean.
E: sticking out her hand as he shakes her hand
N: He smiles, amused.
C: COLIN
D: You're not what I'm used to.
C: ABBY
D: I know...
E: sighing
C: COLIN
D: Actually, that's a good thing. I'm used to women I can figure out in five seconds. I can't do that with you.
N: Mike rolls his eyes.
C: MIKE
D: He's an idiot. I figured you out in two.
E: MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 MIKE (cont'd) Now tell him good night and stick your tits out. We're going to give this one last shot.
C: ABBY
D: Good night.
E: Sticking her tits out
C: MIKE
D: ...And walk away.
N: She starts to walk away when Colin stops her, grabbing her arm and pulling her in for a kiss.
C: COLIN
D: That definitely made up for my wet crotch.
C: ABBY
D: Me, too. Just -- scratch that.
E: dreamily off his look; realizing
N: Colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends to enter her house until she sees Colin close his front door. Then, she turns around and rushes over to -- MIKE. She throws her arms around him, embracing him.
C: ABBY
D: You did it! You did it!
N: Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.
C: MIKE
D: I didn't do anything. It was you. Don't ask me why, but I think he likes you.
C: ABBY
D: He's really a great guy, isn't he?
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, he's dreamy.
C: ABBY
D: And he fits all ten criteria on my checklist!
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: Right...weren't items one through nine something to do with him pretty much being gay?
N: Abby puts her key in the door.
C: ABBY
D: I'm going to ignore that because I'm in a very good mood.
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, I heard, wet crotch.
N: Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Jonah and Mike sit on the couch, playing "Fight Night."
C: JONAH
D: So, no date tonight?
C: MIKE
D: As a matter of fact, I did have a date. It wasn't mine, but it was a date. I was helping out a friend.
C: JONAH
D: Guy or girl?
C: MIKE
D: Girl.
C: JONAH
D: Ooh...is she hot?
C: MIKE
D: She would be if she were less irritating.
C: JONAH
D: So she likes to make fun of your clothes and stuff?
C: MIKE
D: No, actually I make fun of hers'.
C: JONAH
D: You told me not to do that.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: That's right. And you should listen to me.
C: JONAH
D: If you know so much about chicks, why are you sitting here playing "Fight Night" with me when you could be out with the Jello girls?
C: MIKE
D: Because this is better.
N: Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her laptop. She hands Mike a digital camera.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hurry, take a picture of me. I'm online with Fugly35 and he wants to know what i look like.
C: MIKE
D: You really want to go out with a guy named Fugly35?
C: ELIZABETH
D: He's being ironic. Look, he's hot.
N: She holds up her laptop. Mike peers at it.
C: MIKE
D: Uh...look closer. That's Jim Morrison. Who I'm pretty sure isn't an accountant in Rio Rancho.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shit. Are you serious?
N: Jonah holds out his hand to his mom.
C: JONAH
D: You owe me a dollar.
C: MIKE
D: What are you wasting your time on the internet for anyway?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Says the man who hasn't had a decent relationship since 1999.
C: MIKE
D: At least I date.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ELIZABETH
D: No...you fornicate.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ZOO - DAY
N: A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR. LESTER.
C: DR. LESTER
D: Of all primates, Bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings, both genetically and socially ­- especially when it comes to sex. For the Bonobo, sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions.
C: MIKE
D: So summing up Bonobo-land, the chicks look great, get freaky in bed and in turn, they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day.
C: DR. LESTER
D: That's one way of looking at it.
C: MIKE
D: If that's not an argument for evolution, I don't know what is.
N: He winks at the camera as --
C: CAMERA GUY
D: Cut!
N: NEARBY Abby watches. Mike walks over to join her.
C: MIKE
D: What did you think?
C: ABBY
D: It was good.
C: MIKE
D: Did you hear Corporate's taking me to Saffron tonight? What do you think --
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Colin called. He wants to get together again.
E: cutting him off
C: MIKE
D: Cool.
N: He starts pulling off his gorilla suit as he heads for the van. Abby follows him.
C: ABBY
D: How long do you think I should wait to sleep with him?
C: MIKE
D: The more you make him beg for it, the more you've got him on the hook. Do everything but. Then show him beneath that control freak exterior, there's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed.
C: ABBY
D: I am not a sexual deviant.
C: MIKE
D: Good point. If memory serves us right, you've been out of practice for what? A year?
C: ABBY
D: No...eleven months.
E: defensive
C: MIKE
D: Alright, well, how often do you --
C: ABBY
D: Do I what?
C: MIKE
D: You know... Flick the bean?
E: under his breath
C: ABBY
D: What bean?
N: Mike throws her a look. Abby catches on. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Ewww, gross. That's what you call it?
E: CONT'D
C: MIKE
D: No, I call it masturbating, but I thought it would offend your delicate lady-like sensibilities. So... how often do you flick it?
E: beat
N: ABBY * How often do you flick it? * MIKE * You only want me to answer that so * you can picture me flicking mine * while you flick yours. * ABBY * Trust me, I would never think about * you while I'm flicking it. Not * that I would ever do -- that. * MIKE * Never? * Abby looks away haughtily. *
C: ABBY
D: I find it impersonal. *
C: MIKE
D: What could be more personal?
C: ABBY
D: I just don't think of myself that way.
C: MIKE
D: Well, you need to start. Because if you don't want to have sex with you, why the hell should Colin?
S: EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT
N: Abby opens the door to find a gift bag on her doorstep, with a card that reads: "This present isn't for you. It's for your bean. Love Mike." 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

S: INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear. She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the remote. She turns it on. Nothing happens. She tries again. Nothing.

C: MIKE
D: You have to come with me.
C: ABBY
D: Where?
C: MIKE
D: My dinner with Corporate. I don't want to fuck it up.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: I can't. I have a date with Colin.
C: MIKE
D: We'll pick him up on the way.
C: ABBY
D: Mike, I'm not going on your dinner.
C: MIKE
D: So, if it doesn't go well and they cut the segment and the ratings go back down to negative fourteen and they cancel the show, you're cool with that?
N: Abby thinks a moment, then --
C: ABBY
D: Let me get my purse.

S: INT. MIKE'S TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Mike's driving. In the passenger seat, Abby turns to Colin, who sits in the back.
C: ABBY
D: We'll just stay for one drink. I'm really sorry about this.
C: COLIN
D: No worries. Are you a news producer as well?
E: to Mike
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: MIKE
D: No, dude, I'm the talent.
C: COLIN
D: So you're one of the anchors?
C: MIKE
D: No, "The Ugly Truth." Hasn't he ever seen our show?
E: to Abby
C: ABBY
D: Not everyone wants to start their day by watching you rant about implants and g-strings.
C: COLIN
D: You talk about g-strings?
E: to Mike
C: ABBY
D: Oh, look! We're here!
S: INT. SAFFRON - BAR AREA - NIGHT
N: As Abby, Mike and Colin walk into the bar, two buxom blonde twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike.
C: MIKE
D: Hey, ladies. You're looking quite fetching.
C: BAMBI
D: Hi, Mike!
C: CANDI
D: Do you like my dress?
N: She leans over and displays her cleavage.
C: ABBY
D: Are these the Jello Girls?
E: displeased
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, they're my dates.
N: She tries to control her displeasure, as Stuart walks in with two guys in suits, BOB and HAROLD, in their 50's.
C: STUART
D: Hey, the gang's all here! Abby, you know Harold and Bob.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Of course.
C: BOB
D: And we all know Mike Alexander...
E: ignoring Abby
N: They slap him on the back, eyeing the twins.
C: HAROLD
D: And who are these lovely ladies?
C: BOB
D: Something tells me we won't be talking about the news tonight...
S: INT. SAFFRON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The group sits down at the table.
C: MIKE
D: So, you guys here to give me a raise, or what?
N: UNDER THE TABLE Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE
S: NEXT TO THEM. AT THE NEXT TABLE
N: A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on. AT ABBY'S TABLE As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back.
C: STUART
D: That's my guy. Always with the jokes.
N: Abby turns to Bob and Harold.
C: ABBY
D: We're really excited about the ratings increase this year. Next quarter we hope to --
N: Suddenly, her smile quickly changes to horror. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 ABBY (cont'd) Oh, God. She shifts in her seat, trying to control her NOW-VIBRATING UNDERWEAR.
C: COLIN
D: What's wrong?
C: ABBY
D: Nothing...
N: She leans down to grab her purse. UNDER THE TABLE She pokes her head under the table to see that the contents of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers.
C: MIKE
D: What are you doing?
C: ABBY
D: I'm looking for the remote.
C: MIKE
D: What remote?
C: ABBY
D: For...the...underwear.
E: gritting her teeth
N: Mike starts laughing.
C: MIKE
D: You're wearing them? Now?
N: She writhes again, hitting her head on the bottom of the table. AT THE TABLE Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote.
S: AT THE NEXT TABLE
N: The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher. Abby's eyes roll back. She looks like she's on three hits of ecstasy. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: COLIN
D: Are you okay?
C: ABBY
D: This ceviche is just so....GOOD! I'm going to ask the chef for the -- ooh -- recipe! Excuse me --
N: She starts to get up when Stuart stops her.
C: STUART
D: Hold on. Tell Harold about the new teaser campaign we're starting next week. You're going to love this.
E: to Harold
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, Abby. Tell us about the teasers.
N: Abby glares at Mike and sits back down.
C: ABBY
D: Well, it's fifteen seconds...each hour.
N: As she fumbles, Mike spots the kid at the next table, remote in hand. He starts to get up but -- ABBY (cont'd) They're very -- oh! Abby grabs Mike's arm, yanking him back down, in the throes of panic and pleasure. ABBY (cont'd) Mike! -- Wait! You -- tell them. She looks into his eyes, imploring.
C: MIKE
D: Actually, I'm really enjoying the way you're telling them.
N: Candi looks at Harold, intrigued by Abby's display.
C: CANDI
D: What's in a ceviche?
N: As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: It's fifteen seconds every hour of Mike telling an Ugly Truth and...Jesus...GOD, they're good.
E: rapid fire
N: She leaps to her feet. ABBY (cont'd) Ohhhhh... Then she sinks back down, spent. Harold and Bob applaud, as do the twins. Relieved, Stuart turns to Bob and Harold.
C: STUART
D: See what I mean about her?
C: COLIN
D: You've got to love her enthusiasm.
E: proudly
S: INT. SAFFRON - BAR AREA - NIGHT - LATER
N: As they all walk out, Mike grabs the remote from the kid.
C: MIKE
D: Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.
N: Abby spots this and snatches the remote out of Mike's hand.
C: ABBY
D: You knew he had it the whole time, didn't you?
C: MIKE
D: No, just part of the time. Figured I should let you finish.
N: She shoots him a look. MIKE (cont'd) Seriously, thanks for coming tonight. I mean, you know, to dinner.

C: MIKE
D: So, what's next? A little three-way Scrabble? Some Twister? Maybe a massage chain? We could write in each others' diaries...
C: COLIN
D: I think we've got it from here.
N: Mike's truck pulls up and he gets in.
C: MIKE

S: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
N: Mike stands at the sports bar with Dwayne, Steve and Gary, as a DRUNK GUY praises Mike.

T: CUTE BRUNETTE
N: I got implants, just like you said!
C: MIKE
D: Indeed you did.
E: horrified
C: DWAYNE
D: Here's to implants!
N: Steve clinks his beer bottle against Mike's.
C: STEVE

S: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: A waiter takes Colin and Abby's order.

D: I'll have one, too.
N: Colin smiles at her as THE MONTAGE ENDS.

C: ABBY
D: The Balloon Fiesta is coming up, so, I was thinking for sweeps, we could do a segment on "how men are full of hot air."
N: He doesn't answer. ABBY (cont'd) I was kidding -- Mike isn't even listening. He's watching a trashy redhead at the bar. Abby notices. ABBY (cont'd) Colin would never like a girl like that.
C: MIKE
D: I forgot, Colin only likes "women of quality."
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: That's a trait to be admired, not mocked, man-whore.
C: MIKE
D: Who says I'm a man-whore?
C: ABBY
D: I've seen you with the Funbag Twins, remember?
C: MIKE
D: You saw me what? Take them to dinner and introduce them to some network executives? They want to be actresses. Who am I to kill their dreams?
C: ABBY
D: You're telling me you've never slept with those girls?
C: MIKE
D: I didn't say that...
C: ABBY
D: Exactly my point. Man-whores want women who wear slutty clothes and suck lots of cock.
C: MIKE
D: Every man wants that. And for your information, I was only with the one who can read. Did you just say cock?
E: then
C: ABBY
D: What? I can say cock. You don't own that word. Cock. There. I said it again.
C: MIKE
D: A week ago you cried at the thought of a vibrator. Now you're all "cock this,""cock that." You had sex with Colin, didn't you?
E: then
C: ABBY
D: NO! We're saving that for this weekend. He's taking me to Santa Fe.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008

S: 79 INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY 79 *
N: On set, Mike addresses the camera.
C: MIKE
D: So there you have it. Never assume a girl is easy, or assume she's a prude. There are many layers in between and it's your job, gentlemen, to peel back those layers and figure out exactly what type of woman you are dealing with.
N: NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby.
C: JOY
D: What happened to him? That sounded almost enlightened.
N: Abby doesn't know weather to be pleased or worried.
C: MIKE
D: Because once you do peel back those layers, my friends, her lady garden awaits. And I'm pretty sure you're gonna want to fertilize that patch of petunias. And that there is the Ugly Truth.
C: JOY
D: And -- he's back.
N: AT THE ANCHOR DESK 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 Larry turns to the camera.

N: Georgia winks at him.
C: GEORGIA
D: I hope mine do...
N: Abby rolls her eyes as Mike walks up.
C: ABBY
D: Yes, the city gets treated to flower-vagina metaphors. Georgia O'Keefe would be so pleased.
N: At this, a slick AGENT in a suit, 30's, walks up and slaps Mike on the shoulder.
C: AGENT
D: Are you ready for this? I just got you on to "The Tonight Show". They want you as a guest.
N: Mike is stunned.
C: MIKE
D: Jay Leno wants me on his show? You're shitting me.
N: Abby looks at the agent, confused.
C: ABBY
D: Who are you?
C: MIKE
D: This is Rick. My agent.
C: ABBY
D: Since when do you have an agent?
C: AGENT
D: Since he became the hottest thing in morning TV.
C: MIKE
D: Holy shit. Leno? This is amazing.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Yeah...
E: trying to process

N: Stuart pokes his head in.
C: STUART
D: Abby? I need you.
N: She rises and goes out into the hall.
S: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Abby frowns at Stuart's serious expression.
C: ABBY
D: What's up?
C: STUART
D: I just found out Mike was offered a job by the local NBC affiliate at twice the pay. This Leno thing is his audition.
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: What?!
C: STUART
D: If Bob and Harold find out about this, we're dead. I need you to fly out there and talk him out of it.
C: ABBY
D: Today? Now? But I'm going to Santa Fe --
C: STUART
D: Just don't let him know you know beforehand. Let him do the show and get us our publicity, then convince him to sign with us for the next three years. Now go.
E: ignoring her
S: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
N: An airplane lands at LAX.
S: INT. CAB - DAY
N: A pissed Abby sits in the cab, having a conversation with herself.

N: The CAB DRIVER looks at her.
C: CAB DRIVER
D: What did you just call me?
C: ABBY
D: Nothing. Just practicing my speech.
S: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
N: Mike walks out of the lobby, as Abby gets out of a cab, suitcase in hand.
C: MIKE
D: Abby? What are you doing here?
N: Abby glares at him, about to show her true feelings, but then quickly covers. Smiling. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Stuart decided you needed a cheerleader.
C: MIKE
D: I thought you were going to Santa Fe...
C: ABBY
D: Apparently, he felt that you needed a producer more than I needed to get laid.
S: INT. TOWN CAR - DAY
N: Abby and Mike sit in the backseat. Abby looks down at her notes.
C: ABBY
D: Okay, so let's go over the pre- interview questions.
N: Mike studies her.
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry you didn't get to meet little Colin this weekend. And by little, I don't mean undersized, although I highly suspect that's the case.
C: ABBY
D: Really? Colin's penis? That's what you want to talk about right now? I was thinking maybe we should talk about what you're gonna say on the show. So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly Truth" start?
E: doing Jay
C: MIKE
D: Well, Jay, I had a sales job where I drove around a lot, listening to talk radio. I started calling in and lo and behold, people liked what I had to say. Then I decided what the hell, I need my own show. I have a message people need to hear.
N: Abby rolls her eyes, still angry with him. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: Yes -- thousands of lives are being enriched by your wisdom.
C: MIKE
D: Excuse me, lady, but you have a boyfriend right now because of me.
C: ABBY
D: It may have started because of you, but it's lasted because of me.
C: MIKE
D: So, you've been acting like your normal control freak psycho self in front of him?
C: ABBY
D: I'm not a control freak.
C: MIKE
D: When you checked into the hotel, did you or did you not insist on getting an "Eastern-facing" room on "a floor not below seven"?
C: ABBY
D: I like rising with the sun. And a view.
C: MIKE
D: My point is, Colin likes the Mike version of Abby, not the Abby version of Abby. So, don't go knocking my words of wisdom when you're living proof that they work.
N: Abby sits there, fuming that he's right.
C: ABBY
D: I could be having sex right now --
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, thanks to me.

C: AGENT
D: Dude, this is awesome. You're about to go on Leno! NBC is going to give you the moon --
N: Mike shoots him a "shut up" look. Abby pretends not to notice.
C: AGENT
D: -- in a gift basket, of course.
C: MIKE
D: This isn't helping.
C: AGENT
D: Just do what you always do.
C: MIKE
D: What do I always do?

C: MIKE
D: That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
C: ABBY
D: Your welcome.
N: She smiles at him. Looking a little calmer, he smiles back at Abby. The Agent rolls his eyes. The handler gives Mike the nod, as we HEAR --

E: O.S.
N: The audience applauds as Mike takes a deep breath and heads on stage.

N: Abby now sits in the audience, watching as Jay interviews Mike on stage. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: JAY
D: So what's your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love?
C: MIKE
D: Don't do it. Try to find lust instead. It's a lot easier and a lot less messy. Blue balls only last a few hours. A broken heart can last years.
N: The audience reacts with hollers and cheers. Abby shakes her head.
C: JAY
D: So, what's her name?
C: MIKE
D: Who?
C: JAY
D: The girl who screwed you up. She must have been a doozy.
N: Mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly.
C: MIKE
D: Like I said, better a floozy than a doozy.
N: Abby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction.
C: JAY
D: Well, what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty-seven years? We can't be the exception to the rule, can we? There's plenty of us out there.
C: MIKE
D: Well, Jay, let me tell ya --
N: He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.
C: MIKE
D: Marriage starts off great. She's cute, you're cute, the world's cute. Nothing can burst your bubble of everlasting love.
E: MORE
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 MIKE (cont'd) Then, ten years later, she's put on twenty pounds, you've got nose hair, you're voting for different presidents, and one day, the receptionist at Jiffy Lube accidentally grazes your hand as she hands you back your keys and you realize that's the first time a woman's touched you in three months. By year twenty, you've learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle, you're living with someone who can barely tolerate your presence and, on the rare occasion that you actually do make love, she probably thinks about Jake Gyllenhaal. Jay looks stricken, going along with the bit.
C: JAY
D: You're right. I'm going to get a divorce. My whole life is a lie. Sorry, honey.
E: to camera
N: The audience laughs, as we CUT TO --

C: ABBY
D: I know about the offer from NBC.
N: He looks at her, surprised, then --

C: ABBY
D: So...who was the doozy?
C: MIKE
D: What are you, trying to kill my buzz?
C: ABBY
D: No, I'm interested. In what makes you...you.
N: Mike sighs, deciding to level with her.
C: MIKE
D: It wasn't just one...it was more like a parade. By the time I hit thirty, I realized you can only have so many bad relationships before you figure out there's no such thing as a good one.
C: ABBY
D: You can't really believe there's no such thing as a good relationship.
C: MIKE
D: To my very core.
N: Just then, the waitress walks up.

N: Mike and Abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor.
C: ABBY
D: Mike, no --
C: MIKE
D: You'll be fine.
N: Abby looks at him, sure that he's about to make a fool of them both. Then, he takes her in his arms, completely self-assured, and starts leading her in a salsa dance and... ...he's good. But not just good. Great.

D: Good night.
N: Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby. And suddenly -- They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER. In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their furious groping blocks it, until -- A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at each other. MIKE (cont'd) So, I guess I should --

D: Oh. Okay...
C: COLIN
D: What's the matter?
C: ABBY
D: Nothing. I'm just so -- surprised to see you.

N: He turns and walks the other direction. Then stops and turns back. MIKE (cont'd) Nut up, Alexander. You can do this... He KNOCKS on Abby's door. After a second it opens and -- There's Colin, standing there SHIRTLESS.

C: MIKE
D: How convenient.
C: ABBY
D: I thought it was you at the door.
N: He stops and looks at her.
C: MIKE
D: I guess we're all interchangeable. I've taught you well. Maybe you should take over the show.
N: He starts to walk off.
C: ABBY
D: Mike, wait -- tell me what just happened in the elevator.
N: They hold eye contact for a very long moment. ABBY (cont'd) Should I tell Colin to go? Mike looks away.
C: MIKE
D: Why pull up anchor now? You've worked damn hard to get him here.
C: ABBY
D: Really? That's it? That's all you have to say.
C: MIKE
D: What else do you want me to say?
N: A lot. But he's not saying it.

D: No worries. The rest of the night is ours.
N: He pours her a glass of wine. COLIN (cont'd) To the first of many romantic evenings to come. Abby takes the glass and drinks. And keeps drinking. COLIN (cont'd) Whoa -- Abby finishes the glass and looks at him.

D: Why do you like me?
C: COLIN
D: Well, you're beautiful, you're smart --
N: Abby smiles, pleased, then he continues... COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd) You're open, you laugh at my jokes, you never criticize...
T: Abby's smile fades.
N: COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd) You never try to control the situation, and I've got to say, it's a breath of fresh air. A lot of women I know are total control freaks -- and it's a nightmare. I love that you're not like that. Abby looks at him, nodding, then --
C: ABBY
D: You know what? I am like that.
C: COLIN
D: What do you mean?
N: 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008
C: ABBY
D: To be honest, I didn't like the way you poured the wine. I would have decanted it. And I was editing that speech as you were giving it.
N: She looks around. ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Plus, this bed should be facing north-south instead of east-west!
C: COLIN
D: Are you serious?
E: confused

C: STUART
D: I thought you said we had him.
C: ABBY
D: What are you talking about?
C: STUART
D: He quit this morning. I got a smug call from Channel 4 saying they closed a deal with him. Corporate's having a shit fit. What the hell happened?
N: Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred.
C: ABBY
D: We don't need Mike Alexander. He's a dime a dozen.

C: JACK MAGNUM
D: Most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks. Let me assure you, you're in good hands. You're looking at a guy who's personally had sex with over 137 women. Most of them conscious.

D: We're here at the Balloon Fiesta, and I'm supposed to be telling you men are full of hot air, but I think we all know, it's the ladies that are full of crap. Just because she says no, doesn't mean she means no.
E: ON T.V.
N: At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket. After a moment -- A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

N: Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.
C: ABBY
D: Take Mike Alexander, for instance. He up and quit the show without so much as a word. You think you know what men are going to do, you think you know what they want to do...but when it comes down to the moment where they actually have to nut up, they turn around and do something completely different.

E: O.S.
N: She turns to see -- MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.
C: ABBY
D: Hey --
C: MIKE
D: Women would have us believe that they are the victims. They aren't. They want us to think that we break their hearts for sport. That's crap. They say they want romance. They say they want true love, but all they want is a checklist. Is he perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a doctor?

C: JOY
D: Well, kinda true.
N: Mike continues his rant.
C: MIKE
D: You men that fit the criteria -- don't kid yourselves. They're not sleeping with you. They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices. Money over substance. Looks over soul. Polish over principles. No gesture, no matter how real or romantic, will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials.
C: ABBY
D: Says the man who's never made a gesture except for this one --
N: She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

D: Oh, that got your interest? If you think we're going to finish what we started in LA, you're out of your mind. You lost your chance.

C: MIKE
D: As many of you know, sometimes a guy's gotta admit what he thought was the truth isn't necessarily the whole truth. Yes, women have a checklist, but sometimes that list includes a foul-mouthed idiot who took way too long to realize he was in love. Let's continue this conversation in a second.
