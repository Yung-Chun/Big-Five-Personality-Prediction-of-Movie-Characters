S: INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes. After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up to the house. Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens it.
C: WOMAN
D: Mr. Vale?
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
C: WOMAN
D: Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to meet you.
C: WALTER
D: Yes. Come in.
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you.
N: She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.
C: WALTER
D: Can I take your coat?
C: BARBARA
D: No, thank you.
C: WALTER
D: OK. Would you like anything to drink?
C: BARBARA
D: No. Shall we get started?
E: Beat
C: WALTER
D: OK.
S: INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
N: Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close proximity.
C: BARBARA
D: Let's try it again.
C: WALTER
D: The same thing?
C: BARBARA
D: Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like a tunnel.
C: WALTER
D: OK.
N: Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress. They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is only a beginner. And not a very good beginner.
C: BARBARA
D: Don't flatten.
N: Walter keeps playing.
C: BARBARA
D: Make room for the train.
E: CONT'D
N: Walter stops.
C: WALTER
D: What?
C: BARBARA
D: I said "make room for the train." It's something that I tell my kids. If you curve your fingers like this... Then the train can pass through the tunnel.
E: She demonstrates
N: She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter looks at her for a long moment.
S: INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then hands Barbara some money.
C: WALTER
D: Here.
C: BARBARA
D: Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same time?
C: WALTER
D: No. I don't think I'm going to continue with our lessons.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, no. Are you giving up?
C: WALTER
D: No.
N: Barbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the lessons.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh. OK. Goodbye.
C: WALTER
D: Goodbye.
N: Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts it.
C: BARBARA
D: Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many teachers have you had before me?
C: WALTER
D: Four.
C: BARBARA
D: Well, for what it's worth, it's difficult to learn an instrument at your age. Especially if you don't possess a natural gift for it. I'm not saying this to be mean. But if you do decide to give up then I would really like to buy your piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
N: Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.
C: BARBARA
D: Goodbye.
E: CONT'D
N: Barbara turns and leaves. Walter shuts the door.
S: INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, LECTURE HALL - DAY
N: Walter stands before a half-empty class. He is wrapping up a lecture on economic theory. There is nothing inspiring about it.
C: WALTER
D: East Asia's experience is really the exception to the rule, because the conditions there that made trade liberalization for the Middle East successful weren't present in the developing countries in sub- Saharan Africa, and in Central and South America.
S: EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAMPUS - DAY
N: Walter walks across the campus.
S: INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
N: Walter sits in a meeting with seven other COLLEAGUES.
S: INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER

C: WALTER
D: Come in.
N: A STUDENT opens the door and enters.
C: STUDENT
D: Hi.
N: He sits down and sets a paper on the desk.
C: STUDENT
D: Sorry it's late.
E: CONT'D
C: WALTER
D: Why is it late?
C: STUDENT
D: I had some personal things to deal with.
N: Walter hands back the paper.
C: WALTER
D: I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.
C: STUDENT
D: But...
C: WALTER
D: I'm sorry.
N: Walter goes back to work. The Student sits stunned for a moment and then gets up and picks up his paper. He opens the door and then stops.
C: STUDENT
D: You know you still haven't given us a syllabus.
C: WALTER
D: I know.
E: Lying
N: The Student shakes his head and leaves without another word.
S: EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Walter pulls into the driveway of his house. He gets out, grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside.
S: INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK
N: Walter is making dinner. Classical music plays from the other room. He adjusts the flame and covers a sauce pot. He leans against the counter and picks up a half empty bottle of wine and pours some into his glass. He catches sight of A SMALL FRAMED PICTURE of him and HIS WIFE, smiling.
S: INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Walter sits at the piano and practices. It is still going badly. The wine glass sits on top of the piano. He lifts his hand and inspects his "tunnel".
S: INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Walter is at his computer. He pulls up his YEAR SYLLABUS on the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006. He saves it. His work is done. There is a knock at the door.
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
N: The door opens and Walter's colleague, CHARLES VAN HORN steps in.
C: CHARLES
D: Hello Walter.
C: WALTER
D: Charles.
C: CHARLES
D: I'm sorry to interrupt.
C: WALTER
D: That's OK.
C: CHARLES
D: Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her.
C: WALTER
D: Why can't she go?
C: CHARLES
D: She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby.
N: Walter is caught off guard.
C: WALTER
D: When?
C: CHARLES
D: Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements.
C: WALTER
D: I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles.
C: CHARLES
D: I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure.
C: WALTER
D: I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book.
C: CHARLES
D: You're only teaching one class, Walter.
C: WALTER
D: So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now.
C: CHARLES
D: I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point.
N: Walter is trapped. He comes clean.
C: WALTER
D: Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it.
C: CHARLES
D: That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument.
N: Walter just stares him.
C: CHARLES
D: Good bye.
E: CONT'D
N: And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him.
S: INT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT
N: Walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar. The wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks down the bar and sets it in front of Walter.
C: KAREN
D: Here you go, cutey.
C: WALTER
D: Thanks.
C: KAREN
D: So I thought you forgot about me. Where've you been hiding?
N: Karen automatically refills his wine glass.
C: WALTER
D: Just busy with work.
C: KAREN
D: Well you're never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse. I'm glad your back. Give a holler if you need anything. I'm just gabbing with one of my girlfriends.

C: WALTER
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D
N: There is no answer. He walks down a LONG HALLWAY and looks in the kitchen. Nothing. He walks over to the FIRST BEDROOM and looks inside. There are signs of someone living there. He looks in the SECOND BEDROOM. He sees nothing. Suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the bathroom. He notices a light under the door. He walks to the bathroom and listens.

C: AFRICAN WOMAN
D: Who are you? What are you doing in here!?
C: WALTER
D: This is my apartment.
C: AFRICAN WOMAN
D: What do you mean? This apartment does not belong to you. How did you get in?

D: My name is Walter Vale. I have keys. It's my...
N: Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard.
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: What the fuck?!
N: A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face. He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him.
C: YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
D: Who are you?! Zainab?!
C: ZAINAB
D: I'm in here! He is crazy!
C: WALTER
D: Stop it! I am not...

D: OK. OK.
C: ZAINAB
D: Tarek. What is happening?
E: O.S. In French

C: ZAINAB
D: What does he mean it's his apartment?
E: in French
C: TAREK
D: I don't know! Show me your keys!

D: This is my apartment. I've owned it for twenty-five years.
C: TAREK
D: So why haven't you been here!?
C: WALTER
D: I live in Connecticut. I haven't used it in a long time.
N: Walter is starting to get through.
C: TAREK
D: Are you friends with Ivan?
C: WALTER
D: Ivan? Who is Ivan?
N: Tarek is getting nervous.
C: ZAINAB
D: I knew this would happen! He probably called the police.

D: Did you call the police?
E: to Walter
N: Walter hesitates.
C: WALTER
D: No.
C: TAREK
D: You didn't call the police?
C: WALTER
D: No.
N: Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.
C: TAREK
D: And you don't know Ivan?
C: WALTER
D: I don't know Ivan. Who is he?
C: TAREK
D: He rented us this place. He said it belonged to his friend who was out of town.
C: WALTER
D: I don't know who he is but this is my apartment. I assure you.
N: Tarek looks at Walter for a long moment. It's clear that he's telling the truth.
C: TAREK
D: Shit!
C: ZAINAB
D: I told you not to trust anyone. You never saw a contract.
E: O.S. In French
C: TAREK
D: Enough! OK. Look. We don't want any trouble. We will get out of your apartment. This is all a mistake. I'm sorry.
C: WALTER
D: OK.
C: TAREK
D: We will leave, OK?

D: Yes. OK.

C: TAREK
D: I don't know but we have to go.
E: In French
C: ZAINAB

C: TAREK
D: Are you OK?
C: WALTER
D: Yes. I'm just going to sit down.
C: TAREK
D: Of course. Please.

C: TAREK
D: I know I'm in trouble when she starts speaking Wolof.
C: WALTER
D: How long have you lived here?
C: TAREK
D: Two months. We will pay you if you want.

C: TAREK
D: Is that everything?
E: CONT'D To Zainab
C: ZAINAB
D: I think so. Do you want to check!?
N: He hands her a SMALL PLASTIC BAG from a local grocery.

C: TAREK
D: OK. So we'll go. I am sorry again. Thank you for your understanding. Good bye.
E: CONT'D To Walter
C: WALTER

WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted, decorative FRAME off of the sill. It is a PHOTOGRAPH of Tarek and Zainab. They are hugging each other and smiling. Walter looks down onto the street. He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the street.

Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and move down the street.

S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER

C: TAREK
D: You like classical music, huh?
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
N: Walter sets down the CD.
C: TAREK
D: Me too. Do you play piano?

N: Tarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away.
C: ZAINAB
D: Tarek. No!

C: ZAINAB
D: What are we going to do, Tarek?
E: CONT'D
C: TAREK
D: I don't know. We'll figure it out tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll let us stay. He's not really using the place.
C: ZAINAB
D: I don't want to be his roommate!
C: TAREK
D: OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in the morning. I promise, habibti.

D: OK.
C: TAREK
D: Now just give it a couple of bangs.
N: Walter gives it a couple of hard bangs.
C: TAREK
D: Not so hard. You're not angry at it.

D: Are you OK?
C: WALTER

N: Darren and Tarek look at Walter.
C: DARREN
D: You think that's true?
N: Walter is put on the spot.
C: WALTER
D: Well...if China continues to threaten the wage earners in the first-world economies by keeping wages down, then it's really just a matter of time. What they buy they inflate. What they sell they deflate. But then you have to ask the question `who's paying the cost?'. And the answer is the Chinese people.

D: Why wouldn't they appeal it?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Fear of being deported. It used to be that when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal. A lot of people didn't bother with it. Getting denied once was enough to spook them.
C: WALTER
D: So what happens if that's the case?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he won't even go before a judge this time. He'll just be deported.
C: ZAINAB
D: They had to leave Syria! They had no choice!
N: This is also news to Walter.
C: MR. SHAH
D: Look, one step at a time. Let me talk to him then we'll have a better idea of his status and what our options are.
C: WALTER
D: Is there anything I can do?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Visit him.
N: The lawyer slides a card across the table. Walter takes it.
S: INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY
N: Walter rides the subway. He looks down at the lawyer's card.
S: EXT. QUEENS - LATER
N: Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of paper and starts walking.
S: EXT. QUEENS - LATER
N: Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues walking.
S: EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
N: Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a bit more barbed wire. He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He walks inside.
S: INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER
N: Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room. A few SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian. The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a Slavic accent.
C: GUARD
D: That detainee has been moved.
C: SLAVIC MAN
D: To where?
C: GUARD
D: I don't know.
C: SLAVIC MAN
D: He was here yesterday.
C: GUARD
D: But now he's not. That's all I know. You can call ICE. The number is on the wall. Next. Sir, step aside please.
N: The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of paper on the window sill.
C: WALTER
D: Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.
N: The Guard takes it.
C: GUARD
D: You been here before?
C: WALTER
D: No.
C: GUARD
D: Can I see your license please?
N: Walter takes out his wallet.
S: INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
N: Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY MACHINE immediately in front of him. Walter empties his pockets and steps through. Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is alone in the small white room until a door on the other side slides open. He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for lawyer consultations. Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass is another seat and a phone. Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.
S: INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
N: Walter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and smiles. They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.
C: TAREK
D: Walter. Thank you for coming.
C: WALTER
D: Of course.
C: TAREK
D: How is Zainab?
C: WALTER
D: She's upset. I have a letter from her.
C: TAREK
D: You can't give it to me. It has to be sent to me by mail. But you can put it up to the glass.
N: Walter hesitates.
C: TAREK
D: Go ahead. Open it and place it up to the glass so I can read it. It's OK. It's allowed.
E: CONT'D
N: Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter. Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's phone. Walter picks it up.
C: TAREK
D: Thank you, Walter.
E: CONT'D
N: Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back into his coat.
C: WALTER
D: How are they treating you?
C: TAREK
D: OK. The place is very depressing. There is no privacy. The lights are always on.
C: WALTER
D: Do you need anything?
C: TAREK
D: No. I just want to get out of here.
C: WALTER
D: Zainab and I met with a lawyer today.
C: TAREK
D: Yes. What did he say?
C: WALTER
D: He is going to stop by to see you tomorrow.
N: They both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.
C: WALTER
D: Tarek, Zainab said you were denied asylum.
E: CONT'D
C: TAREK
D: You mean when we came here? Yeah.
C: WALTER
D: Did you go to your deportation hearing?
C: TAREK
D: Yeah.
C: WALTER
D: You did?
C: TAREK
D: Yeah. We did everything they told us to.
N: Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.
C: TAREK
D: Hey, could you tell Darren? I didn't call him.
E: CONT'D
N: A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks to him. We can't hear what is being said.
C: TAREK
D: I have to go. They have to do a bed count. Usually, I can visit for one hour. Can you come tomorrow?
E: CONT'D To Walter
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
C: TAREK
D: Good. And tell Zainab I will call her as soon as I can.
N: Walter nods. Tarek gets up.
C: TAREK
D: Goodbye, my friend.
E: CONT'D
C: WALTER
D: Goodbye.
N: Tarek walks away. Walter watches him go.
S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/ KITCHEN
N: Walter and Zainab are sitting at the kitchen table. Zainab is holding her letter.
C: ZAINAB
D: Did you ask him if he went to his hearing?
C: WALTER
D: Yes. He said that he did.
N: Zainab stands up.
C: ZAINAB
D: Walter, I'm going to leave now. I have a cousin in the Bronx. I will stay with him for now.
C: WALTER
D: You don't have to leave. You can stay here.
C: ZAINAB
D: I think it's best if I leave. When Tarek calls me then I will tell him. You know how to reach me if you need to. Is it OK if I leave Tarek's things here for now? My cousin's place is not very big.
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
S: EXT. WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER
N: Zainab walks away from the apartment.
S: INT. SMALL BAR - NIGHT

S: INT. CAFE - NIGHT
N: Walter eats alone.
S: EXT. STREET CORNER - MORNING
N: Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He is surrounded by them.
S: INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITOR'S ROOM - SAME
N: Tarek talks to Mr. Shah.
S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Walter is playing the drum. He finishes with an "end beat". He looks around the quiet apartment.
S: INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - DAY
N: Walter is waiting for Tarek. The visiting room is empty. Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit. She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment. Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is the innocent smile of a child. Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter one last moment before disappearing behind the door.
S: INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
N: Walter is talking to Tarek.
C: WALTER
D: But I thought you said you went to the hearing.
C: TAREK
D: We did. I remember it.
C: WALTER
D: So why is there a final order on you? Did he say?
C: TAREK
D: No. He didn't know yet. He just said that unless he can find a way to reopen the case quickly they're going to deport me.
C: WALTER
D: Maybe you should call your mother. She might have...
C: TAREK
D: No. I don't want her to worry. I can handle this.
N: Tarek shakes his head.
C: WALTER
D: Did he say anything else?
C: TAREK
D: Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case. I don't even understand it.
N: Walter nods.
C: TAREK
D: Walter, there are guys who have been in here for years! I can't do that Walter. I'll go crazy.
E: CONT'D
C: WALTER
D: He's trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible.
N: Tarek goes silent.
C: WALTER
D: Tarek. I have to go back to Connecticut. I'll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything.
E: CONT'D
N: Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head.
C: TAREK
D: OK. Just please...don't forget about me in here.
C: WALTER
D: I won't.
C: TAREK
D: Are you still practicing?
C: WALTER
D: Yes.
C: TAREK
D: You should go back to the drum circle.
C: WALTER
D: No.
E: Quickly
N: Tarek laughs.
C: TAREK
D: OK. But listen to that Fela CD. That will help you, I promise.
C: WALTER
D: I will.
C: TAREK
D: So show me what you've been working on.
C: WALTER
D: What?
C: TAREK
D: Show me. On that. Come on. I need some music, man.
N: Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter.
C: WALTER
D: Now?
C: TAREK
D: Don't worry. They can't arrest you. At least not yet.
C: WALTER
D: OK.
N: Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top. Tarek watches and listens for a moment.
C: TAREK
D: Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You are getting better.
N: And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together.
S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
N: Walter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at his door. He exits the room.
S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Walter opens the door. Standing there is a strikingly attractive forty-five year-old ARAB WOMAN. She seems startled to see Walter.
C: WALTER
D: Hello.
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment.
N: She starts to walk down the hall.
C: WALTER
D: Can I help you?
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: I'm looking for my son.
C: WALTER
D: Are you Tarek's mother?
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: Yes.
C: WALTER
D: Oh. This is Tarek's apartment. I...share the apartment with him.
N: The Arab Woman is cautious.
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: He did not mention that he lived with someone.
C: WALTER
D: I'm not here very often. I live in Connecticut.
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: Is Tarek here?
C: WALTER
D: No. He's...uh...he's not here. But please come in.
N: Mouna hesitates.
C: WALTER
D: Please.
E: CONT'D
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: Thank you.
N: Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door.
C: WALTER
D: I'm Walter. Walter Vale.
C: ARAB WOMAN
D: I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to show up unannounced but my son calls me everyday. He has not called me now for five days. I have tried his cell phone but he does not answer.
C: WALTER
D: Would you like to sit down?
C: MOUNA
D: Thank you.
N: Mouna sits.
C: WALTER
D: Would you like something to drink? Coffee or water?
C: MOUNA
D: No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?
C: WALTER
D: Tarek was arrested. He's being held in a detention center in Queens. They are trying to deport him.
C: MOUNA
D: Where is Queens?
C: WALTER
D: It's not far from here. Twenty minutes.
C: MOUNA
D: You have been there?
C: WALTER
D: Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK.
C: MOUNA
D: How did this happen?
C: WALTER
D: He was stopped in the subway station. He didn't do anything wrong.
C: MOUNA
D: I would like to go there. To Queens.
C: WALTER
D: OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer mentioned that...I don't think that you can...
C: MOUNA
D: I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr. Vale. I just want to see where they are holding him.
C: WALTER
D: OK. I can take you if you'd like.
C: MOUNA
D: Thank you.
C: WALTER
D: Let me get my coat.
N: Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the apartment and spots Tarek's drum. The sight of it is almost enough to push her over the edge.
S: INT. SUBWAY - LATER

N: Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention Center.
C: WALTER
D: That's it.
C: MOUNA
D: This is where the prison is?
C: WALTER
D: Yes. That's it.
N: Walter points to the Detention Center.
C: MOUNA
D: It does not look like a prison.
C: WALTER
D: I think that's the point.
C: MOUNA
D: How many people are in there?
C: WALTER
D: Tarek said about three hundred.
C: WALTER
D: There is a coffee shop on that corner. It's not very nice but...
E: CONT'D
C: MOUNA
D: I'll wait there. Here.
N: She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter.
C: MOUNA
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
N: Walter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers, taking in the building.
S: INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
N: Walter is waiting for Tarek. He is watching as a LATIN WOMAN holds her BABY up to the glass as her HUSBAND taps on it from the other side. Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his.
C: TAREK
D: Walter, I thought you were leaving.
C: WALTER
D: I was. Tarek, your mother is here.
N: This stops Tarek cold.
C: TAREK
D: What? My mother?! Where?
C: WALTER
D: She is waiting outside.
C: TAREK
D: When did she arrive?
C: WALTER
D: Today.
C: TAREK
D: Oh man. Why did she come? She can do nothing for me.
C: WALTER
D: She said she hadn't heard from you.
C: TAREK
D: Walter. Listen to me. She can not stay here. She doesn't know anyone in New York. I'm sorry but you must get her to go back to Michigan.
C: WALTER
D: OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from her.
N: Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass.
S: INT. QUEENS, DINER - LATER
N: It's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory workers. Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea. She looks very out of place. Two DETENTION CENTER GUARDS enter and sit down in a booth. Mouna watches them. An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter. He keeps looking at Mouna.
C: WAITER
D: Do you need anything else?
C: MOUNA
D: No.

E: CONT'D In Arabic

E: CONT'D
N: Walter nods and sits down. He hands Mouna her letter.
C: MOUNA
D: How is he?
C: WALTER
D: He's good but he's concerned about you being here.
C: MOUNA
D: I will not leave.
C: WALTER
D: Mrs. Khalil, I'm not sure that your being in New York will do any good. We have a very good lawyer working on Tarek's case...
C: MOUNA
D: Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to Michigan knowing that my son is in that building. Even if I can't see him, I will stay.
E: Politely but forceful
N: She stands up, ready to leave.
C: MOUNA
D: Shall we go?
E: CONT'D
N: Walter stands. Mouna digs in her purse.

N: He sees Mouna.
C: JACOB
D: Oh, hello again. Did you find your son?

D: I let her in earlier. I'm Jacob, by the way. I live on the third floor. And this is Sprinkles.
E: To Walter To Mouna
C: MOUNA
D: Nice to meet you, Jacob. I'm Mouna.
C: JACOB
D: So you two know each other?
N: There is an awkward pause.
C: MOUNA

C: WALTER
D: Please. I was with Tarek when he was arrested. He was in the subway in the first place because of me. Please. Stay. Even if it's just for the night.

N: Walter walks out of his bedroom. He hears talking from the living room. He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in Arabic. He turns and walks back down the hallway.
S: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN
N: Walter pours a cup of coffee. He notices two newspaper's on the counter. One is the Financial Times and the other is Al Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. He picks up the Financial Times and reads the front page. Mouna enters.
C: MOUNA
D: Good morning.
C: WALTER
D: Good morning.
C: MOUNA
D: Tarek said hello.
C: WALTER
D: How is he?
C: MOUNA
D: I can't really tell. He wants me to leave. But I am not leaving.
C: WALTER
D: Well, you can stay here as long as you need to.
C: MOUNA
D: Thank you. That is very generous of you.
C: WALTER
D: Thank you for the newspaper.
N: Mouna nods and pours some more coffee for herself.
C: MOUNA
D: Walter? Did Tarek and his girlfriend, Zainab, live here together?
C: WALTER
D: Uhm...Yes. They did.
C: MOUNA

C: WALTER

C: MOUNA
D: I would like to meet her.
C: WALTER
D: We can go by her stall.
C: MOUNA

C: MOUNA
D: Oh. OK.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING - LATER
N: A large office building in downtown Manhattan.
S: INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
N: Walter and Mouna are standing in silence.
C: MOUNA
D: Do you spend a lot of time in the city?
C: WALTER
D: No. Not really. I just came down to present a paper at a conference.
C: MOUNA
D: You wrote it?
C: WALTER
D: Yes. Well I coauthored it.
C: MOUNA
D: Congratulations.
N: Walter shrugs.
S: INT. MR. SHAH'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Walter and Mouna are talking to the Mr. Shah.
C: MR. SHAH
D: And what happened after the hearing?
C: MOUNA
D: We appealed. It took two years.
C: MR. SHAH
D: And your appeal was denied?
C: MOUNA
D: Yes.
C: MR. SHAH
D: Then they should have sent you a bag-and-baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be deported.
N: Mouna nods.
C: MR. SHAH
D: But you didn't receive it?
E: CONT'D
C: MOUNA
D: No.
C: MR. SHAH
D: You sure?
C: MOUNA
D: Yes. I would remember this.
C: MR. SHAH
D: Did you move?
C: MOUNA
D: Yes. Eventually we had to. But we had our mail advanced.
N: Mr. Shah is satisfied.
C: MR. SHAH
D: Well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened. And pre 9/11 it wasn't much of a priority tracking people down.
N: Mouna bristles at the implied connection.
C: WALTER
D: So if they didn't get the letter then does this help us?
C: MR. SHAH
D: It keeps our chances alive. If they got it and just ignored it then we couldn't push to reopen the case.
C: MOUNA
D: So you can help him?
C: MR. SHAH
D: It's still a long shot. Like I said, the Government's approach has changed radically.
E: MORE
C: MR. SHAH
D: It's very black and white now. Either you belong or you don't. Which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention. Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't even have lawyers.
E: CONT'D He starts writing
N: Mouna blanches.
C: MOUNA
D: Lucky?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Relatively speaking. We just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration. Then, we'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application.
E: Without looking up
N: Mouna and Walter share a look. They're lost.
C: MOUNA
D: Can you explain what that means?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Actually, I don't have the time right now. I have to be in court very shortly
C: MOUNA
D: How long will he be in detention?
C: MR. SHAH
D: I can't predict that. I'm sorry but I am gonna have to wrap this up.
E: Without looking up
N: Walter looks at Mouna. Mouna stares at the Mr. Shah.
C: MOUNA
D: Do you have children, Mr. Shah?
C: MR. SHAH
D: Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's worth my uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty- three years. If I can get Tarek out, I will.
N: Mouna softens.
C: MOUNA
D: Thank you. Where are you from?

E: Angrily shouting MORE
C: WALTER
D: It's not fair! We are not just helpless children! Do you hear me?!
E: CONT'D
N: The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the room. It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly adrift. Unsure of what to do next.
C: MOUNA
