S: 1 INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM
N: BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex- girlfriend.
C: MAN
D: Billy Boy! J.D. BANKS enters the office.
E: O.S. mid-20s, always looking for a good time
C: J.D.
D: Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on! J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.
C: J.D.
D: Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it once and for all. J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.
C: BILLY
D: Don't!
C: J.D.
D: Dude, it's been six months. You have to move on. BILLY nods knowingly.
C: J.D.
D: You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long.
C: BILLY
D: You're such a romantic, J.D.
C: J.D.
D: It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment.
C: BILLY
D: Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long.
C: J.D.
D: Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 2.
C: BILLY
D: Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors.
C: J.D.
D: So what? It's Friday! You have all weekend to do that.
C: BILLY
D: No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow. J.D. thinks for a moment.
C: J.D.
D: Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then?
C: BILLY
D: Who? J.D. gets a big smile on his face. He has an idea.
S: INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM
N: HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day. BILLY and J.D. approach...
C: BILLY
D: Harold, listen, I need you to update these models for me.
C: HAROLD
D: But aren't you supposed to...
E: confused
C: BILLY
D: I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay? Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to protest, J.D. steps forward...
C: J.D.
D: And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp.
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 3. J.D. (cont'd) With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking. He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next.
C: HAROLD
D: Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.
S: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM
N: BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.
C: BILLY
D: Wow! I can't believe how easy that was!
C: J.D.
D: Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.
S: INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE
N: Billy and J.D. enter the car.
C: J.D.
D: Now get ready. It's time we embark on...Operation Get Some! And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut:
S: INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE
N: Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it. When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner. J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his car zooms out of the parking lot. QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off. He looks at the stack of papers they gave him...

D: Fuck.
N: OMIT
S: INT. DR. WOODRUFF'S OFFICE - NYU MEDICAL SCHOOL
N: KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT. He's American.
C: KUMAR
D: Mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite.
C: DR. WOODRUFF
D: Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're one of the best applicants I've ever interviewed. Not that it's a surprise. Your father is very respected in his field. You know he and I had some pretty wild times when we were in med school.
C: KUMAR
D: Really?
C: DR. WOODRUFF
D: Yeah. We started our own basketball team-- the Hemoglobin Trotters... Yeah, we were crazy. Kumar nods and smiles. Woodruff finally stops laughing...
E: cracking up
C: DR. WOODRUFF
D: Anyway-- just one more question. What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?
E: reading from a clipboard
C: KUMAR
D: Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 5.
C: KUMAR
D: I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.
E: to Dr. Woodruff
C: KUMAR
D: Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking. Oh, hey. Nothing important. I can talk. What's up? Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office. Intercut:
E: into the phone listening listening
S: INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - SIMULTANEOUS
N: Harold is talking on his office phone...
C: HAROLD
D: I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office.
C: KUMAR
D: Fuck that shit! We had plans! Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.
E: into the phone
C: HAROLD
D: I know, but I gotta get this work done.
C: KUMAR
D: Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.
C: HAROLD
D: Listen, I'd love to go home, but...
E: O.S.
C: KUMAR
D: No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone.
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 6. KUMAR (cont'd) So you're just gonna have to chill the fuck out, bring your work home, and prepare to get blazed, because in a couple of hours I expect both of us to be blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay good. See you later. Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down. Dr. Woodruff is stunned.
C: KUMAR
D: Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock.
E: to Dr. Woodruff
C: DR. WOODRUFF
D: Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a proper interview. Do you actually believe after the way you've behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?
E: livid
C: KUMAR
D: No. I'd actually be pretty surprised. Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.
C: KUMAR
D: Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I'm not really planning on going to med school.
C: DR. WOODRUFF
D: But...you have perfect MCAT scores!
E: confused
C: KUMAR
D: Well, I'm not an idiot. Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr. Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.
C: KUMAR
D: Wow! Is this your daughter? A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands.

S: INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE
N: Harold shuts down his laptop. He then puts the laptop along with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office.
S: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT
N: Harold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is parked. As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground. Harold is frustrated as he picks it up.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT EXIT GATE
N: After other cars zoom through uninterrupted, the ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT stops Harold and checks his ID before letting him leave.
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING PARKING LOT - 6:21 PM
N: Harold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot...
C: HAROLD
D: Yes! Right in front... Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND. The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof. Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.
C: HAROLD
D: Those assholes. The driver, COLE , puts down his window... COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold.
E: frustrated, to himself 20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth
C: COLE
D: This is America, dude! Learn how to drive!
E: mock Asian accent
N: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Better ruck tomorrow! Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving... DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 8.
S: 11A EXT. SEMI-URBAN STREET 11A
N: He ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel park. He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot.
S: 11B EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING 11B
N: Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building... Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators. HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl. Harold takes a deep breath...
C: HAROLD
D: Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.
S: 11C INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY 11C
N: Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They give each other a friendly smile. We hear a "BING" sound, indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and Harold and Maria walk inside.
S: INT. ELEVATOR
N: HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak...
C: HAROLD
D: So Maria, what's been going on?
C: MARIA
D: Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week. How about you?
C: HAROLD
D: My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change.
C: MARIA
D: Really?
C: HAROLD
D: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right?
E: deadpan
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 9. Maria laughs. Harold's pleased that his joke worked.
C: HAROLD
D: So what are you up to tonight?
C: MARIA
D: Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place. He's cooking me a really nice dinner.
C: HAROLD
D: Really?
E: disappointed
C: MARIA
D: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. I'll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch Blind Date.
E: smiling beat
C: HAROLD
D: That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria. They smile at each other...
E: playful
C: HAROLD
D: Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place.
C: MARIA
D: Maybe.
E: flirty
N: We hear the "BING" of the elevator...
S: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING(LOBBY)
N: We're back in the lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A FANTASY. Harold and Maria enter the elevator.
S: INT. ELEVATOR
N: HAROLD and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up. It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator.
S: INT. HALLWAY
C: MARIA
D: Bye.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 10. MARIA walks over to her apartment and goes inside.
C: HAROLD
D: Bye.
S: INT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM
N: Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of "BILLY MADISON."
C: HAROLD
D: Kumar?
C: KUMAR
D: Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however.
E: O.C.
C: HAROLD
D: Kumar?
C: KUMAR
D: In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM , where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside...
E: O.C. neat, tidy, IKEA furnishings
C: HAROLD
D: Kumar, what the hell are you doing!
C: KUMAR
D: I'm trimming my pubes. Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.
C: HAROLD
D: Why aren't you doing this in your room!
C: KUMAR
D: The mirror's in here. Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai tree!
E: re: his crotch
C: HAROLD
D: I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 11.
C: KUMAR
D: Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something...
C: HAROLD
D: Are those my scissors? Oh my God! I trim my nose hair with those!
C: KUMAR
D: Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.
N: HAROLD GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM! Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk...
S: 16A INT. KUMAR'S BEDROOM 16A
N: Kumar puts on some boxers and a T-shirt (I love Bush: the pussy not the president).
C: KUMAR
D: So what the hell is your problem, anyway?
E: calling out to Harold
C: HAROLD
D: Other than my roommate's boney ass?
E: O.C.
S: INT. HAROLD'S BEDROOM
N: Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working.
C: HAROLD
D: One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room...
E: calling out
C: KUMAR
D: I assume you gave him the appropriate "go fuck yourself."
C: HAROLD
D: If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no problem sir" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 12.
C: KUMAR
D: Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say "no" once in a while. Now lets get high.
C: HAROLD
D: No. I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.
C: KUMAR
D: Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...
C: HAROLD
D: One joint.
C: KUMAR
D: One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover-- inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana. Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy. The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up. MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (on the answering machine) Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your interview today was good. I'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late! Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T. book and starts rolling a fat blunt... MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT It is very important you show up on time! Mommy and I will be very upset if you do not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 13. Harold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now untucked) enters the living room. Kumar is now licking the blunt.
C: HAROLD
D: Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed.
C: KUMAR
D: So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to.
C: HAROLD
D: Well, then what are you going to do?
C: KUMAR
D: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat.
C: HAROLD
D: Sounds like a plan.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: OMIT
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 7:00 PM
N: HAROLD takes the first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar, as if to say "that's good shit." Kumar takes the blunt from Harold and inhales...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - 7:30 PM
N: Harold and Kumar are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG, while watching TV. The room is filled with smoke. ANGLE - TELEVISION It's an episode of "The Router Workshop." ANGLE - HAROLD AND KUMAR
C: KUMAR
D: I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel...
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 14. ANGLE - TELEVISION It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are listening to rock music in a house without parents. One teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired).
C: BLONDE HAIRED KID
D: Come on, dude. Just take one hit. Don't you want to be cool? Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right after he exhales, he walks over to his DAD'S GUN RACK and takes out a LONG RIFLE...
C: BLONDE HAIRED KID
D: Hey man, what are you doing?
C: BROWN HAIRED KID
D: I'm so high! Nothing can hurt me! The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth. We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo!" BANG!
N: WE HEAR A GUNSHOT AS THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK...
C: ANNOUNCER
D: Marijuana kills.
E: V.O.
N: ANGLE - HAROLD AND KUMAR They're laughing their asses off at the commercial.
C: KUMAR
D: I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels...
C: ANGLE- TV
D: We see a News report
C: NEWSCASTER
D: Tonight...a Cheetah escaped from the Morristown Zoo... ANGLE - Harold and Kumar Harold's not interested. He continues flipping...
C: HAROLD
D: Nice. Sixteen Candles is on.
C: KUMAR
D: And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to...
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 15. KUMAR (cont'd) (mock opening an envelope) ...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow!
C: HAROLD
D: Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved...
C: KUMAR
D: Hey look! It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs. Harold isn't amused. We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents].
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke...
C: HAROLD
D: We're so high right now.
C: KUMAR
D: We're not low.
C: HAROLD
D: I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls.
C: KUMAR
D: No shit! Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that have been left on the floor...
C: KUMAR
D: Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight.
C: HAROLD
D: What about KFC?
C: KUMAR
D: Nah, we've been there too many times. I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food...
E: beat
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 16.
C: VOICE ON TV
D: Are you hungry? HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they see A WHITE CASTLE COMMERCIAL taking place. In the commercial, we see DOZENS OF TINY BURGERS lined up in a row.
C: VOICE ON TV
D: Then come to White Castle and try our Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and a soft drink for only 2.99. HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE
N: FROM THE BURGERS ON THE T.V.
C: VOICE ON TV
D: Imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now. Mmmmmh.... HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers.
C: VOICE ON TV
D: Don't you like food that's tasty and delicious? Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly.
C: VOICE ON TV
D: Then what are you waiting for? Head over to White Castle. It's what you crave. The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them.
S: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - 7:45
N: HAROLD and KUMAR exit their apartment.
C: HAROLD
D: You're sure you know how to get there? I haven't been to White Castle in ages.
C: KUMAR
D: I'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick. They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment. On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking...
S: INT. ROSENBERG AND GOLDSTEIN'S APARTMENT
N: HAROLD and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs. (Instead of a "BILLY MADISON" poster, there's one of "HAPPY GILMORE.") DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 17. Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words, "FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold and Kumar enter...
C: KUMAR
D: Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up. We're going to White Castle. Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...
C: ROSENBERG
D: Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.
C: KUMAR
D: No waiting. We're starving... Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee table.
C: KUMAR
D: ...Put that down! We're not eating `til we get to White Castle. Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.
E: scolding Harold
C: KUMAR
D: Now come on guys, let's go.
E: to Rosenberg and Goldstein
C: GOLDSTEIN
D: Sorry man! We're not going anywhere. Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie!
C: HAROLD
D: Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits?
C: ROSENBERG
D: We're talking about Katie Holmes here. You would never think a sweet, innocent girl like her would ever take her top off. Which is precisely why we have to watch her do it.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 17A.
C: GOLDSTEIN
D: Dude, the things I'd eat out of her ass, you have no idea. Bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you name it...
E: beat
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 18.
C: ROSENBERG
D: That's a very vulgar statement.
E: to Goldstein
C: GOLDSTEIN
D: So is "I want to pound Britney Spears in the pussy." But it's true.
C: ROSENBERG
D: Touché. Anyway, if you guys want to wait till the movie's over... HAROLD and KUMAR have already shut the door.
E: to Harold and Kumar
S: INT. BY THE ELEVATOR - 7:50 PM
N: HAROLD presses the "down" button. KUMAR notices that Harold has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder...
C: KUMAR
D: What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys.
C: HAROLD
D: You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.
C: KUMAR
D: Shit, I forgot my cell phone.
C: HAROLD
D: Why don't you just run back and get it?
C: KUMAR
D: Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. "Bing!" The elevator door opens and the guys enter.
E: thinks for a moment
S: INT. ELEVATOR
N: As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a DOOR SLAM behind them. They turn around and see MARIA locking her door. She hasn't noticed Harold and Kumar yet.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time?
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 19. Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed" button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them.
C: KUMAR
D: What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle. Harold doesn't say anything. He looks down in shame.
C: KUMAR
D: You're worthless.
C: HAROLD
D: I'm not worthwhile.
S: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY)
N: Harold and Kumar exit the elevator...
C: KUMAR
D: Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore...
C: HAROLD
D: It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim.
C: KUMAR
D: Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.
C: HAROLD
D: God, she invites me to everything.
C: KUMAR
D: So what? She's fucking cute. Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building...
S: 26A EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING 26A
N: Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep. They're about to get back in the jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them.
C: COLE
D: Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag! Let me guess, the yellow one's the catcher!
E: to Harold and Kumar
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 20. COLE AND THE PUNKS LAUGH HYSTERICALLY. Harold is uncomfortable. Kumar just ignores them.
C: COLE
D: Come on, guys! Let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew!
E: to the Punks
N: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme! They take off, driving by Harold and Kumar. Harold gives them a pissed off look as they drive away.
C: HAROLD
D: Why do I have to be the catcher?
C: KUMAR
D: Dude, forget about those pricks. Let's just go. They continue walking...
N: OMIT
S: EXT. STREET

D: If I may interject for a moment... I've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that when you're craving White Castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it. In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its place. If I were you, I'd suck it up and make the trip. KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case. HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important moment for the guys...

D: Oh, come on, you always exaggerate. We weren't gonna get laid.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! And what about Cindy?! She was looking hot tonight! The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay!
C: HAROLD
D: I know Cindy's cute, it's just...
C: KUMAR
D: What? You'd rather have Maria? From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.
C: HAROLD
D: Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle?
C: KUMAR
D: Fine. Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...
C: HAROLD
D: Now what are you doing?
C: KUMAR
D: Daddy needs to urinate. Harold rolls his eyes.
S: EXT. WOODS NEAR ROAD - 11:50 PM
N: KUMAR gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS PEEING ON THE BUSH..
C: KUMAR
D: Oh yes! Yes, that's nice.
S: INT. CAR
N: HAROLD TAKES OUT HIS LAPTOP AND BEGINS WORKING FEVERISHLY. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 42. As he types, A RACCOON JUMPS INTO THE CAR AND CRAWLS INTO THE BACK SEAT. HAROLD doesn't see this.
S: EXT. BUSH NEAR DARK ROAD
N: KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR! Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore...
C: KUMAR
D: Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?
C: CREEPY GUY
D: What do you mean?
C: KUMAR
D: Why did you decide to piss here right next to me? Why not that bush over there?
C: CREEPY GUY
D: Well, this looked like a good bush to pee on. Why'd you choose this bush?
C: KUMAR
D: Nobody was here when I chose this bush.
C: CREEPY GUY
D: So you can pee here and nobody else can, is that it?
E: getting heated
C: KUMAR
D: I was just saying....
C: CREEPY GUY
D: Is this like your special bush or something?
C: KUMAR
D: No, I just... You know what? Forget about it. I'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.

D: I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon.
C: HAROLD
D: We better. It starts to rain...
C: HAROLD
D: Shit, now it's raining.
C: KUMAR
D: What's the big deal?
C: HAROLD
D: Look, I'm completely on edge right now, okay? After all the shit we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take.
N: AT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS BITING HIS NECK... HAROLD

C: HAROLD KUMAR
D: Shit!!! Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins walking over to them.

D: Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window. The DRIVER peers inside...
C: GOLDSTEIN
D: What the hell do you think you were doing? You almost killed us! GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR.

N: Kumar is sitting in the waiting room. He hides his head in a jittery manner, as if he's hiding from someone. Next to him are DANIEL and SHANKAR, who are both badly beaten and nursing their wounds. They all make eye contact. It's weird. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 46A. Harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck...

D: I don't have rabies. Kumar stands up quickly.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 47.
C: KUMAR
D: Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...
N: MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.) Kumar!!! Kumar know that voice all too well...
C: KUMAR
D: Shit.
N: KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.
C: HAROLD
D: Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.
C: KUMAR'S FATHER
D: I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I.
E: thick accent
C: SAIKAT
D: What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a beamer. And I get laid whenever I want. You can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school.
E: no accent
C: KUMAR
D: Eat my balls, Saikat.
C: SAIKAT
D: God, you're 22 years old already! When are you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit? Like your life is so tough. Kumar doesn't have a response. Saikat's right.
C: KUMAR'S FATHER
D: I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you.
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 48. KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd) If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, I'll

D: Oh, come on, dad!
C: KUMAR'S FATHER
D: "Daddy will not be coming on anything!" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head. He's been put in his place.
C: KUMAR
D: You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug. He even gives SAIKAT a hug.
C: KUMAR
D: It won't happen again.
C: KUMAR'S FATHER
D: Good. I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned...
C: HAROLD
D: Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh?
C: KUMAR
D: Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money!
C: HAROLD
D: But...you just hugged him...
E: extremely confused
C: KUMAR
D: I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.
C: KUMAR
D: Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 49.
S: 74A INT. DOCTOR'S LOUNGE 74A
N: Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on...
C: KUMAR
D: Look, I'm telling you, they see an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and they'll just assume we're doctors. Then we walk right into the pharmacy and get the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.
S: INT. HALLWAY
N: HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...
C: HAROLD
D: If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea.
C: KUMAR
D: We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE .
E: frazzled, touchy feely
C: MALE NURSE
D: Dr. Patel, thank God I found you! I need your help immediately! The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room...
S: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM
N: The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient...
C: HAROLD
D: What the hell's going on here?
E: whispering to Kumar
C: KUMAR
D: He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 50.
C: MALE NURSE
D: The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen. No exit wounds. HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.
C: HAROLD
D: Oh shit! This guy's gonna die!!!
N: THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD.
C: MALE NURSE
D: It's a good thing I found you two. All the other surgeons are working on other patients... The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.
C: HAROLD
D: Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all wrong. We're not doc... KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.
C: KUMAR
D: What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.
C: MALE NURSE
D: Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist. The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.
C: KUMAR
D: Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
C: MALE NURSE
D: Marijuana? But why...
E: confused
C: KUMAR
D: We don't have time for questions! We need marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it! KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 51.
C: MALE NURSE
D: But doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital. HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.
C: KUMAR
D: Shit. Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest. Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...
E: to himself
C: MALE NURSE
D: We're losing him! You gotta do something!
C: KUMAR
D: Very well. I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face. Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"
E: disappointed
C: KUMAR
D: First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on board. Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe what's going on. Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace.
E: CONT'D
C: MALE NURSE
D: Doctor! The patient is desatting! Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...
C: KUMAR
D: Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat! After a couple seconds go by...
C: KUMAR
D: What's taking so long?
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 52. The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE! Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined. With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier. His heart rate drops back to normal.
C: MALE NURSE
D: Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94! Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery.
C: KUMAR
D: Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? A chorus of "yes, doctors."
E: casual
C: KUMAR
D: Well, it looks like my work here is done. Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...
E: taking off his gloves
C: KUMAR
D: Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you?

C: HAROLD
D: I'm officially done with my work. I'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something...

C: KUMAR
D: Hey, check it out! Your movie's playing. Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.
N: SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.
C: KUMAR
D: And look who went to see it... Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.
C: HAROLD
D: Holy shit.
C: KUMAR
D: You see? You thought you two had nothing in common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle?
C: HAROLD
D: No way. Forget about it. Just drive. Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention.
C: KUMAR
D: Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you "this is a sign."
C: HAROLD
D: Stop it.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 54.
C: KUMAR
D: Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way...
C: HAROLD
D: Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.
C: HAROLD
D: What are you doing?!
C: KUMAR
D: Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN
E: calling out
N: REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR STARTS PEELING OUT...
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas. Just then,
N: THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...
C: KUMAR
D: Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING
E: looking up
N: DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL. KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill. Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.
C: HAROLD
D: You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now!
C: KUMAR
D: Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road!
C: HAROLD
D: I told you I didn't want to speak to her! Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway.
E: composing himself
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 55.

D: Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!" Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.
S: EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM
N: HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site.
C: HAROLD
D: Godammit. You know how to change a flat?
C: KUMAR
D: Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare. It's missing.
C: HAROLD
D: Where's my spare tire?
C: KUMAR
D: I don't know.
C: HAROLD
D: Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers...
C: KUMAR
D: Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?
C: HAROLD
D: What bridge? What the hell are you talking about?
C: KUMAR
D: Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad.
E: realizing
C: HAROLD
D: Your bad? What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 56. It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.
C: UGLY MAN
D: You boys need some help? The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is freaky. He has a SKULLET . HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.

C: HAROLD
D: Thanks for helping us out.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would Jesus do?" Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...
C: FREAK SHOW
D: So, you boys worship Christ? The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.
C: HAROLD KUMAR
D: Uh...Yeah. Sure, he's great.

D: Great. Good to hear it. The name's Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.
C: KUMAR
D: I'm Kumar. This is Harold. Good to meet you, Mr...Freak Show.

C: HAROLD
D: So where exactly are we going?
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 57.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Don't worry. My place isn't too far from here. Once we get there, I'll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy. The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a
N: RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.
C: KUMAR
D: Eww-- check out those boils on his neck! HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.
E: whispering to Harold
C: KUMAR
D: Oh my God! You gotta look! One of them's actually pulsating!
E: whispering
C: HAROLD
D: Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you! KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.
E: whispering
C: KUMAR
D: Now there's some sort of puss! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!
E: whispering
C: HAROLD
D: What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now.
E: whispering
C: KUMAR
D: Don't worry, he can't hear anything. Not with all that crust in his ear. HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. Harold seems relieved.
E: whispering
C: FREAK SHOW
D: I heard every word you said. FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 58.
S: EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE - 1:30 AM
N: HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Now it's gonna take me a little while here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have something to drink, watch tv-- anything you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do. FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...
C: KUMAR
D: Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?
C: HAROLD
D: He couldn't have said that.
C: KUMAR
D: But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. They reach the front door and are about to enter...
C: HAROLD
D: Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like?
S: INT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE
N: HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.
C: LIANE
D: Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane. Would you boys like some pink lemonade? HAROLD and KUMAR can't move. They're awestruck.
C: LIANE
D: Let me go bring in a pitcher. LIANE leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she turns on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG ABOUT JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house. There are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with Freak Show and Liane's wedding picture...
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 59.
C: HAROLD
D: Okay. It's official. We've entered the Twilight Zone.

C: KUMAR
D: Thanks. So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently?
E: beat
C: LIANE
D: Oh, never been better. We love each other very much. KUMAR looks disappointed. HAROLD, however, is intrigued...
C: HAROLD
D: Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself?
C: LIANE
D: Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary. Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we talking about the same Freakshow?"
C: LIANE
D: Well, one day after Easter service, I told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. The rest is history. And we've been in love ever since. HAROLD ponders this for a moment. He and KUMAR begin drinking their lemonade.
C: LIANE
D: So you boys gonna fuck me or what? HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

D: No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.
C: HAROLD
D: Nevermind. Okay, rock, paper, scissors...
E: to Kumar, swinging his hand
C: LIANE
D: Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time.
C: HAROLD
D: Huh?
C: LIANE
D: Come on. Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.
C: KUMAR
D: I'm not sure we quite understand...
C: LIANE
D: I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...
C: KUMAR
D: Um, are we talking about one hole or two?
C: LIANE
D: However you want to do it.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 61.

D: Sorry, no thank you.
C: KUMAR
D: Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. Shotgun anus!
E: to Harold beat
C: HAROLD
D: Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...
C: KUMAR
D: What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!?
C: LIANE
D: Well...okay. Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts.
E: to Harold
C: LIANE
D: Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...
E: to Harold, re: breasts
C: HAROLD
D: Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Hey boys-- I changed your tire... FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...
C: FREAK SHOW
D: What the hell are you doing with my wife!
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 62.
C: HAROLD
D: Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar!
E: scared shitless
C: FREAK SHOW
D: I most certainly did not say that!
C: KUMAR
D: No. You did. We both heard you.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Are you sure?
E: calming down
C: KUMAR
D: Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Oh...my mistake then.
C: KUMAR
D: No problem.
C: FREAK SHOW
D: Well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome?
N: FREAK SHOW PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HAROLD AND KUMAR...

C: KUMAR
D: Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened.
C: HAROLD
D: Agreed.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 63. KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are.
C: KUMAR
D: Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?
C: HAROLD
D: And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...
C: KUMAR
D: Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway.
C: HAROLD
D: Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil , gets into the car.
E: hitchhiker
C: NEIL
D: Yo, man, thanks for picking me up. HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other. THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry.
C: HAROLD
D: Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris?
E: to Neil
C: NEIL
D: Yep.
C: KUMAR
D: Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol!

C: KUMAR
D: So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
C: NEIL
D: Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.
C: KUMAR
D: Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
C: NEIL
D: No, I didn't go all the way with her.
C: HAROLD
D: Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you?
C: NEIL
D: I don't even know where the fuck I am right now. I was at this party earlier tonight, and this dude hooked me up with some killer X. Somehow I ended up getting thrown out of a moving car, and I've been tripping balls ever since. HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.
C: KUMAR
D: Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked.
C: NEIL
D: Dude, forget White Castle. What we need is some pussy.
C: HAROLD
D: Huh?
C: NEIL
D: It's a fucking sausage fest in here. Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll go to White Castle.
C: KUMAR
D: You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night.
C: NEIL
D: I've been craving burgers too. Fur burgers, that is.
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 65. NEIL (cont'd) Let's pick up some trim at a strip club. The Doogie line always works on strippers. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET leading up to a gas station in the distance...
S: EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE - 1:50 AM
N: HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car. NEIL is still in the backseat. The car is still running.
C: HAROLD
D: We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.
C: HAROLD
D: What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny?
C: KUMAR
D: I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with
N: TWO OF THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS.
C: COLE
D: Late night math league meeting, homos?
N: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 (to Cole) Extreme!
C: HAROLD
D: Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...
E: upset
S: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE
N: HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests... DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 66.
C: INDIAN CASHIER
D: Please...the pies...do not... Cole and the Punks ignore him. Harold and Kumar then approach the Indian Cashier...
E: to Cole and the punks
C: HAROLD
D: Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.
C: KUMAR
D: He probably can't speak English...
E: to Harold
N: KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It sounds like it's very complicated. Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store. Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...
C: KUMAR
D: Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...
C: HAROLD
D: Huh? Oh, good.
E: to Kumar
N: COLE (O.S.)
C: EXTREME KAYAKING!!!
D: HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY
N: THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR... In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid- air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS, GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC. The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 67. The kayak lands on the floor. COLE gets out and celebrates with his friends.
C: COLE
D: That was so fucking extreme, man!
N: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine point five. Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers. The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI. Extreme Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other. Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS. He goes apeshit over his find. EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme Cheddar! He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place. The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling. Cole picks up the Cashier...
C: COLE
D: Extreme Cashier!!! Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER around and around.
C: HAROLD
D: Somebody should do something.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.
E: to Cole
C: EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS
D: Oooooooooh! Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get their asses kicked.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 68.
C: HAROLD
D: I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...
E: to Kumar
C: KUMAR
D: Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.
E: pissed off at himself
C: COLE
D: Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking with me one more time. Just try it! Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.
C: KUMAR
D: Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated. With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.
E: to Kumar, embarrassed
C: COLE
D: Thank you, come again!
E: like Apu

D: Kumar-- you okay?
C: KUMAR
D: Yeah, I just hate those dicks. Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry...
E: beat
N: SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START. HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP WALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 69. THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES OFF, DRIVING THROUGH A SIGN, AND GETTING ON THE ROAD... Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence...
C: HAROLD
D: Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?
E: calm
C: KUMAR
D: I think he did.
N: HAROLD
C: FUCK!!!!!!
D: You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker!
E: to Kumar
C: KUMAR
D: Rold, calm down!
C: HAROLD
D: Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?!
C: KUMAR
D: I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over?
C: HAROLD
D: This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.
C: KUMAR
D: Where are you going?
C: HAROLD
D: I'm going to call the police! I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face. "Extremes" all around!
C: KUMAR
D: There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 70. Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street. On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.
C: KUMAR
D: So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right?
C: HAROLD
D: I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.
C: KUMAR
D: You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous.
C: HAROLD
D: Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again.
C: HAROLD
D: Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide.
C: KUMAR
D: This is ridiculous. Just walk across.
C: HAROLD
D: It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds. It doesn't change.
C: KUMAR
D: Come on, there's not a car in sight!
C: HAROLD
D: Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street.
C: KUMAR
D: Finally.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 71. Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS TRACKS.
C: HAROLD
D: Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as OFFICER PALUMBO gets out of the car and walks over to them...
E: 30's, good looking, tough
C: HAROLD
D: Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo?
E: looking at cop's name- tag
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Is there a problem? Ever hear of jaywalking?
C: HAROLD
D: Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again.
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing you up a ticket. OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket. Kumar walks over, flabbergasted...
C: KUMAR
D: A ticket?! Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
E: to Kumar, unthreatened
C: HAROLD
D: Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and...
E: stepping in front of Kumar
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Pipe down and give me your ID.
C: KUMAR
D: Wait. Hold on.
E: to Officer Palumbo
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 72. KUMAR (cont'd) How can you give him a ticket for jaywalking? I mean, look at this street! He wasn't causing traffic or anything!
C: HAROLD
D: Kumar, shut up...
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass.
E: to Kumar
C: KUMAR
D: Bust my ass?!
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass. What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit. What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim... Harold points to his ID.
E: to Harold
C: HAROLD
D: Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Yes. Harold. That's a great name. You should be proud of that name, son.
C: HAROLD
D: Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away.
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: As you were, ladies. Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.
C: KUMAR
D: 220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.
C: HAROLD
D: Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...
C: KUMAR
D: No, no, no. I understand what's going on.
E: to Officer Palumbo
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 73. Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him.
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Hey, hands down! No sudden moves! Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses.
C: KUMAR
D: Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!

D: Oh shit.

D: Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check.
E: calling out
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 74.
C: HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM
D: Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again.
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the talk we had, right Brad? Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.
C: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
D: Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...
E: shaken
C: HAROLD
D: Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...
C: RADIO ANNOUNCER
D: The search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight. It was last spotted in Randolph Township, heading South... Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him is a black man sitting down, reading a book. Harold sits down, across from Tarik. While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.
E: TARIK
C: HAROLD
D: So what are you in here for?
C: TARIK
D: For being black.
C: HAROLD
D: Come on. Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 75.
C: TARIK
D: I am serious. You wanna know what happened? Harold nods.
C: TARIK
D: I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right? Harold shrugs his shoulders.
C: TARIK
D: Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything." So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting.
C: HAROLD
D: Holy shit. What did you do?
C: TARIK
D: I kept saying, "I understand that I'm under arrest. Please stop beating me." But that didn't work. Then another cop showed up. Then another. When it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here.
C: HAROLD
D: That fucking blows! Tarik nods and continues reading his book. Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed.
C: HAROLD
D: I don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this.
C: TARIK
D: Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance. And I have two gay fathers. I've had people messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago, there's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time. Because in the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should.
E: beat
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 76. Harold takes this all in.
C: TARIK
D: So what are you in here for?
C: HAROLD
D: Assaulting an officer.
C: TARIK
D: They tried to pin that shit on you too?
C: HAROLD
D: No. I actually did hit the cop. But only because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend.
N: Suddenly, OFFICER REILLY hangs up the phone on his desk. He shouts out to the other officers in the room:
C: OFFICER REILLY
D: Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Finally, some action! I'm going! Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up...
C: OFFICER MARTONE

D: What the hell was that?
C: KUMAR
D: Rold? Is that you?
E: O.C. from inside the shaft
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 77. Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words. Tarik is very confused.

D: Are the cops still there?
E: O.C.

D: No, they... Wait a second, did you...

D: I called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park...
E: O.C.

D: I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle.
E: O.C.
C: HAROLD
D: Forget it! I don't want to get in any more trouble! I'm already in here because of you!
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do? Stand there and take the hit? You know, I've never taken a swing at you before. Never.
E: O.C.
C: HAROLD
D: Well, I never got your car stolen!
C: TARIK
D: Hey, I'm trying to read here.

D: Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not the only one dealing with shit. My dad's cutting me off, remember?
E: O.C.

D: Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to me about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don't want your help.
C: KUMAR
D: You don't want my help? Fine! I'm outta here!
E: O.C.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 78. We hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft. Then a couple more. Then a couple more. Pouting, Harold pretends to ignore it.

D: Uh...Rold? How do I get out of here? Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

D: Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.
C: KUMAR
D: You sure you don't want to get out?
C: HAROLD
D: And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop.
C: KUMAR
D: So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second.

D: Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something...
C: KUMAR
D: What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk.

N: KUMAR (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF COFFEE.

KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room. He obviously feels guilty... KUMAR GETS UP AND RUNS OVER TO THE BAG OF WEED.

C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: You thought you could get away with this, huh?
E: to Nathaniel

D: Where am I? I was in bed. I didn't fire any gun, I swear... Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell...
C: OFFICER REILLY
D: Look! All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the weed. He doesn't know what to do. Harold is scared shitless.
E: pointing
C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Shit! Jackson's trying to escape! Tarik looks up from his book...

C: OFFICER PALUMBO
D: Stop trying to escape!
C: TARIK
D: I'm not trying to escape! Look at me, I'm sitting down! They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him and throw him down against the bed.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 82.
C: OFFICER REILLY
D: He's trying to break free! Hold him tight! In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls him out of the cell. HAROLD GOES OVER TO PALUMBO'S DESK AND PICKS UP HIS WALLET AND LAPTOP, along with the police report. They start running out of the room. Kumar's still clinging to the weed.

D: Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude.
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL.

D: What was that?

D: Just a coyote. Don't worry.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 83.

D: Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?
C: KUMAR
D: That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down.
N: SUDDENLY, A CHEETAH JUMPS OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND LETS OUT A MONSTROUS ROAR!
C: KUMAR
D: Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
E: CONT'D
C: HAROLD
D: We're gonna die.
C: KUMAR
D: Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans.
N: WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING.
C: HAROLD
D: We're gonna die.
C: KUMAR
D: Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins walking directly over to HAROLD...

D: This isn't working.

N: HE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME! HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS. Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH. DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 84. THE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD. HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY THAT HAROLD HAD IN HIS PANTS.
C: KUMAR
D: I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship.
E: annoyed
C: HAROLD
D: He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...
C: KUMAR
D: Dude, I think I have an idea.
C: HAROLD
D: What is it?

D: Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.
C: HAROLD
D: This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on. Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt...

HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY gives Harold the same scary look from before.... FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with. KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy. Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill, UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into each other's eyes... DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 86.

E: O.S.
C: COLE
D: ...extremely gay that is.
N: SUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD STARTS GUSHING OUT. HE FALLS OFF THE KAYAK, INTO THE WATER. HAROLD is shocked. He turns around and sees MARIA, HOLDING A CROSSBOW. She smiles at him. HE THEN JUMPS ON TOP OF HER AND THEY BEGIN MAKING LOVE ON TOP OF THE BURGERS...
C: MARIA
D: Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God-- you have the biggest dick of all time! It's so long! And wide, for that matter! Suddenly, Harold turns and sees the BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE lying down near them. He is staring at them, with no expression on his face, with his hand down his pants-- rubbing his penis furiously. Harold is disturbed.
C: MARIA
D: Don't worry about him... MARIA rolls over so SHE'S ON TOP OF HAROLD. SHE STARTS

D: I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the past half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up. HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.
C: HAROLD
D: What happened to the cheetah?
C: KUMAR
D: It ran away. But forget about that. I have some bad news and some worse news.

D: I checked out some road signs. The cheetah took us in the wrong direction.

D: Your laptop is completely destroyed. Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces.
N: HAROLD WHAT????????
C: KUMAR
D: It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah.
C: HAROLD
D: Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was the "worse news"?

N: Harold and Kumar stand there, speechless, as Neil drives right past them, splashing a puddle in Harold's face! They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off. Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he shouldn't push Harold any further.

E: O.S. to Kumar
C: COLE
D: Who's running the Quik-E-Mart while you're gone? COLE pounds fists with his friends.

D: Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points...
E: to Rold
C: HAROLD
D: Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT.

C: KUMAR
D: Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."
C: KUMAR
D: You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.
C: HAROLD
D: Hey, why don't you just leave us alone?
E: to Cole
C: COLE
D: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it, Mr. Miagi? Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID... Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh...

D: Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit!

D: Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows.
N: SUDDENLY, HAROLD SNATCHES COLE'S KEYS FROM THE HOOD OF THE JEEP AND RUSHES INSIDE THE DRIVER'S SIDE. One of the Extreme Sports Punks sees Harold doing this... EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Hey, Cole! Look! Cole turns to see Harold in his car. Kumar is about to get in the passenger's side. Cole and the Punks start running towards the car! Kumar sees this and quickly gets inside.

D: I had to do something. KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...
C: KUMAR
D: Wait. Do you smell that? KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.

D: No. I've got everything under control. We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. Just find us some tunes. A tape is resting in the tape deck.

D: No. No way. Not a chance. I'd rather turn myself in than die.

D: You hang-glided? I don't remember that.

D: We did it on our trips to India. I swear. I know exactly what I'm doing. I've even done it with two people at the same time. My brother and I did it.

C: KUMAR
D: You think this just about the burgers, huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The scene is very picturesque...
C: KUMAR
D: Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America.
N: THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...
C: KUMAR
D: You think this is just about the burgers? No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.
E: turning to Rold
C: KUMAR
D: And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you. From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...

C: OFFICER BRUCKS
D: It appears they've escaped. They ditched their jeep. OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop would taste cocaine during a bust.
E: to the walkie-talkie
C: OFFICER BRUCKS
D: Good news. I found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years. Looks like they've terrorized their last convenience store. Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks again at the bag.

E: not paying attention
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 108.
C: KUMAR
D: Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it. KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...
C: KUMAR
D: Hey, Rold, are you listening to me? I'm having a major epiphany here.
C: HAROLD
D: I'll be right back... At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...
C: J.D.
D: Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?
C: BILLY

C: BILLY
D: Look, I have to admit something to you. At the start of last night, all I really cared about was getting some. But then I met you, Zoe. You're so different from all the other women I've ever met. You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess what I'm trying to say is...
C: HAROLD
D: What the fuck is going on here? BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...
E: O.S.
C: BILLY
D: Harold? What are you...?
C: HAROLD
D: Never mind me. What are you doing here? I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with "clients." Isn't that why I had to do YOUR work?

C: J.D.
D: Hey! What the hell is going on here?
C: HAROLD
D: Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.
C: J.D.
D: Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy?"
C: HAROLD
D: Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.
C: J.D.
D: Oh, I'm not quick enough? He thinks I'm not quick enough. Well, I got news for you... I am quick enough... ...cock boy! J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.
E: to Billy to Harold long beat, thinking beat
C: BILLY
D: Listen Harry...
C: J.D.
D: Don't even bother with him. We'll just tell Berenson later...

C: J.D.
D: No, no-- you don't understand...
C: HAROLD
D: No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore.
N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 110. HAROLD (cont'd) And if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson and tell him what's really going on. Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...
C: HAROLD
D: And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out. They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D....
C: HAROLD
D: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows. Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock.

THEN, FINALLY, THE DOOR KNOB BEGINS TO TURN AND THE DOOR OPENS-- A GOOD-LOOKING, MUSCULAR HISPANIC MAN (LUIS) IS STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR WEARING ONLY HIS BOXERS. HE HAS LIPSTICK ALL OVER HIS NECK AND CHEST...

N: (MORE) DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 112. LUIS (cont'd) She seemed so sweet at first, but it turns out she's into some pretty freaky shit. She even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it...
C: HAROLD
D: Look, I really don't need to hear it. I guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys... Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend. Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...

D: Are you coming or what?
C: LUIS
D: Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do me a favor-- make me that omelette you were talking about. You know, with the sun-dried tomatoes. Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know how to respond to this.
N: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 113.
C: LUIS
D: So you want me to leave her a message or something?
