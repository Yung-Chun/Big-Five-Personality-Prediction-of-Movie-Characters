S: EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS AREA - DAY
N: DRONE SHOT Superimposed: Early 70s An amazing contrast. The beautiful landscape of Colorado Springs, the City sits nestled within the rugged Mountain terrain. The majestic Pikes Peak, the jagged beauty of The Garden of the Gods, The plush Broadmoor Resort, The Will Rodgers Shrine of The Sun.

D: I went to College.

D: How do you feel about Vietnam?

C: CHIEF BRIDGES
D: Think a lot of yourself, don't cha?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Just trying to be of help, Chief. Plus, I hate working in The Records room. Sgt. Trapp reacts knowing Ron shouldn't have said that about the Records Room. CHIEF BRIDGES looks at Ron, matter of fact.

D: Well, I think Records is a good place for you to start, Rookie.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Chief, want me clean shaven?
C: CHIEF BRIDGES

C: RON STALLWORTH
D: No Toads here.
C: LANDERS
D: Excuse me?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: I said, I don't have any Toads. I do have Human Beings and if you give me their names I can pull the Files.
N: Landers scowls. Ron stares back at him, Eye to Eye.
C: LANDERS
D: Heard you think you Hot Shit but you ain't nuthin' but a Cold Fart. Name's Maurice, Maurice Smalls...That respectful enough for you, Officer Toad.
N: Ron pulls The File, throws it down on the Counter as Landers snatches The File and storms off.
S: INT. RON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

S: INT. CSPD - NARCOTICS DIVISION - DAY
N: Ron, dressed in Bell-Bottoms and a Hip Italian Knit Shirt, Marshmallow Shoes steps inside the Narcotics office, which is literally The Basement of The Station. He looks around at The Area Buzzing with Activity and sees ANGLE - UNDERCOVER COPS at their desks. Looking less like Cops and more like unkempt Hippies or Rock N' Rollers. CLOSE - RON just stands there looking at all the activity. CLOSE - CHIEF BRIDGES waves Ron back to the rear of The Room for privacy. CLOSE - FLIP ZIMMERMAN
C: FLIP
D: Rookie, you're late.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Sorry, it won't happen again.
N: Flip, late 30's, long hair, looks like anything but a Cop, he however is somewhat of a closed-off guy, all business, Ron sits across from him. Chief Bridges steps before them.
C: CHIEF BRIDGES
D: We've got limited time so I'll be quick. That Black Radical Stokely Carmichael is giving a Speech Tonight at Bell's Nightingale.
E: CONT'D
N: Ron is surprised at this.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: The Nightclub?
C: CHIEF BRIDGES
D: No, Emmanuel Missionary Baptist Church!!!
N: Flip just listens.
C: CHIEF BRIDGES
D: Carmichael is a former High Muckity- Muck with The Black Panthers and as far as I'm concerned, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was dead right when he said The Black Panthers are The Greatest Internal Threat to The Security of these United States. This Carmichael Joker, former Panther or not, they say he's a Damn Good Speaker and we don't want this Carmichael getting into The Minds of the Black People here in Colorado Springs and stirring them up.
E: CONT'D
N: Ron's face cringes at Chief Bridges's words. He steps to Ron.
C: CHIEF BRIDGES
D: Ron, your assignment is to go to this Speech tonight and infiltrate these Bunch of Subversives and monitor The Audience reaction to Carmichael. You ready?
E: CONT'D
N: Flip and Chief Bridges stare at Ron.

C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Any chance this thing Fucks Up?
C: FLIP
D: Fuck yeah.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Then what?
C: JIMMY
D: Just stick to The Game Plan.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Which is?
C: FLIP
D: Improvise. Like Jazz. This isn't some Big Bust. We just want some Intel, that's it.
C: JIMMY
D: What happens if someone offers you a Marijuana Cigarette?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: You mean a Joint?
C: JIMMY
D: Yeah.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: "Soul Brother, I'm already High on Life. Can you Dig It?"
C: FLIP
D: And if someone pulls a Gun on you?
N: Ron is caught off guard.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: You expecting that?
N: Flip pulls his Gun.
C: FLIP
D: Barrel of a 45's in your face, Finger on the Trigger, now what?

S: EXT. CITY STREET - OUTSKIRTS OF DOWNTOWN - NIGHT
N: Ron pulls an unmarked Sedan to the curb. He gets out and looks around. A Crowded sidewalk overflows into The Street, filling a line that Bottlenecks into The Club with the Sign: CLOSE SIGN - BELL'S NIGHTINGALE ANGLE - TONIGHT: KWAME TURE SPEAKS Ron walks to the back of the line. He becomes an Every Brother slowly moving forward as People enter. As he moves forward he notices a striking Woman at the Front Door. ANGLE - PATRICE DUMAS Mid 20's, an Angela Davis Afro, she wears a Hip array of Militant wear, Black Leather Jacket, Love Beads but on her it looks fantastic. Ron is taken by her Beauty, he watches as she monitors the door, clearly in charge.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: How are you doing, my Soul Sista?
N: Patrice gives Ron a good look summing him up.
C: PATRICE

D: Indeed it is.
C: PATRICE
D: Have you heard Brother Kwame speak before?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Who?
C: PATRICE
D: Kwame Ture.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Actually, I haven't, I didn't know he changed his name.

C: RON STALLWORTH
D: That's Heavy. Do you know how he got to Colorado Springs?
C: PATRICE
D: The Colorado College Black Student Union invited Brother Ture.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: I can dig it. I can dig it. You with The Black Student Union?
C: PATRICE
D: I'm The President.

D: Right On. Right On.
S: INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
N: The Club is PACKED, a Sea of Black Faces punctuated by an occasional White Face. Ron moves through The Crowd. He avoids direct Eye Contact, trying like Hell to act casual. Ron steps to The Bar and signals The BARTENDER JABBO, 60's, Black.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Rum and Coke with Lime.
N: As Jabbo makes his Drink, something catches Ron's Eye. Patrice exits through a door with several Black Bodyguards. Ron observes as a Tall figure comes out from Backstage with Patrice, ODETTA and HAKEEM. The Tall figure hangs back covered by The Bodyguards. Ron on his feet, Black Fist in the air with The Crowd. Patrice on Stage with Kwame Ture with her Fist raised too. The Shouting and Chanting finally cease, as Patrice speaks.
C: PATRICE
D: The Black Student Union of Colorado College is honored to bring The Vanguard of Revolutionaries fighting for The Rights of Black People all over The World. Let's show some Black Love to The One and Only, The Former Prime Minister of The Black Panther Party, The Brother Man with The Plan who's stickin'it to the Man, put your Hands together my People... for Our Kwame Ture.
N: PANDEMONIUM! As Kwame Ture walks onto a small raised stage with Patrice. The entire place rises to their Feet, Fists Raised, Clapping, Shouting "Ungawa Black Power!" Ron watches as Patrice and Kwame hug. Patrice sits on Stage with Odetta and Hakeem. Kwame soaks in the Crowd's reaction, until...
C: KWAME TURE
D: Thank you all for coming out tonight, My Beloved Sista's and Brotha's. I Thank you...
N: CLOSE - KWAME TURE towering at Six Feet-Four with an infectious smile and Flawless Dark Skin, he's oozing Charisma out of every pore. He stands behind a small podium.
C: KWAME TURE
D: ...I'm here to tell you this evening it is time for you to stop running away from being Black. You are College Students, you should think.
E: CONT'D
C: KWAME TURE
D: It is time for you to understand that you as The growing Intellectuals of this Country, you must define Beauty for Black People, Now that's Black Power.
E: CONT'D
C: BLACK MASS
D: BLACK POWER!!! BLACK POWER!!!
N: The Black Students in The Audience are laser focused on him.
C: KWAME TURE
D: Is Beauty defined by someone with a Narrow Nose? Thin Lips? White Skin? You ain't got none of that. If your Lips are Thick, Bite them in. Hold your Nose! Don't drink Coffee because it makes you Black!
N: The Audience laughs! Loving it.
C: KWAME TURE
D: Your Nose is Boss, your Lips are Thick, your skin is Black, you are Black and you are Beautiful!
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone cheers including Ron!
C: KWAME TURE
D: We want to be like The White people that oppress us in this Country and since they hate us, we hate ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember that when I was a Boy I used to go see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I loved me some Jane too. Jane was A Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used to Beat up The Black Natives. I would sit there yelling "Kill The Beasts, Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!" Actually I was saying: "Kill Me." It was as if a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking Jews off to Concentration Camps and cheered them on. Today, I want The Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan and send him back to The Caves of Europe. But it takes time to become Free of The Lies and their shaming effect on Black Minds. It takes time to reject the most Important Lie: that Black People inherently can't do the same things White People can do unless White People help them. The Audience laughing, overwhelmed, shouting back support! A ROAR from The Crowd. Ron finds himself clapping along.
E: CONT'D
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Right on!!! Right On!!!
N: Ron looks around at everyone caught up in Kwame's spell.
C: KWAME TURE
D: If a White Man wants to Lynch Me, that's his Problem. If he's got The Power to Lynch Me, that's My Problem. Racism is not a question of Attitude; it's a question of Power.
E: CONT'D
N: Ron is struck by the remark.
C: KWAME TURE
D: The vast majority of Negroes in this Country live in Captive Communities and must endure their conditions of Oppression because and only because they are Black and Powerless. Now We are being shot down like Dogs in the streets by White Racist Police. We can no longer accept this Oppression without retribution. The War in Vietnam is Illegal and Immoral. I'd rather see a Brother Kill a Cop than Kill a Vietnamese. At least he's got a reason for Killing The Cop. When you Kill a Vietnamese you're a Hero and you don't even know why you Killed him. At least if you Kill a Cop you're doing it for a reason.
E: CONT'D
N: Another Applause Break. CLOSE - RON Ron listens, challenged, torn.
S: INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
N: Kwame holds The Crowd in The Palm of his Hand. Members of the Audience who were sitting already are rising to their Feet... CLOSE - RON sits, claps vigorously, as if forgetting he is Undercover... CLOSE - KWAME
C: KWAME TURE
D: In closing I know it's getting late, may I leave you Sista's and Brothers with these Last Words. "If I am not for myself, who will be? If I am for myself alone, who am I? If not now, when? And if not you, who?" We need an Undying Love for Black People wherever We may be. Good Night and POWER TO THE PEOPLE, POWER TO THE PEOPLE.
E: CONT'D
N: The BLACK MASS STANDS AS ONE WITH KWAME TURE. KWAME TURE AND BLACK MASS ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL POWER TO ALL THE PEOPLE Caught up in the moment, Ron gathers himself, as if remembering why he is here. Kwame takes Patrice's Hand and raises it in Celebration and Unity!
S: INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
N: Ron moves down the Greeting Line for Kwame. He watches as Patrice stands near him. Kwame pulls her in close, whispers something in her ear. She smiles, a bit smitten. Ron watches as he finally reaches Kwame, shaking his hand.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Brother Ture, do you really think a War between The Black and White Race is inevitable? Kwame pulls Ron in close toward his face. Too close.
S: INT. SURVEILLANCE CAR - BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
N: Flip and Jimmy wearing Headphones listening react to ear- splitting Audio feedback.
S: INT. BELL'S NIGHTINGALE - NIGHT
N: Ron stands mid-grip with Kwame. Nerves pinballing. Kwame lowers his voice, looking around conspiratorially.
C: KWAME TURE
D: Brother, arm yourself. Get ready. The Revolution is coming. We must pick up a Gun and prepare ourselves...Trust me, it is coming.
N: Kwame pulls back. Returns to his normal speaking voice.
C: KWAME TURE
D: Thank you for your support, Brother.

C: PATRICE
D: I'm waiting for Brother Kwame, I have to make sure he gets back safely to the Hotel and he's squared away.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: I can dig it.
N: Ron starts to walk away.
C: PATRICE
D: Maybe, if it's not too late, I'll meet you at The Red Lantern. You know where that is?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: I do.
C: PATRICE
D: So I'll see you then.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Cool. All Power to All The People.
S: INT. RED LANTERN INN - NIGHT
N: Black folks are dancing, getting down. At the bar, Ron looks at his watch having been there a while. He finishes his Rum and Coke with Lime watching the door open but it is not Patrice. He decides to call it a Night, stepping off his stool, paying his Tab to BRO POPE, The Bartender when...
C: PATRICE
D: Sorry I'm late...
N: Patrice is right there near him. She flops down on the Bar stool, exhausted, and lights up a Kool Cigarette.
C: PATRICE
D: ...You won't believe what happened. Patrice says to Bro Pope, The BARTENDER.
E: CONT'D
C: PATRICE
D: Bro Pope, Seven and Seven, please... The Pigs pulled us over.
E: CONT'D
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Say what?
C: PATRICE
D: Yeah, they knew Brother Kwame was in Town. Made us get out the Car. Pigs pulled us over for no reason. Total harassment.
C: RON STALLWORTH

N: Kwame, Patrice, Hakeem and Odetta are all Spread Eagle against the Car. Master Patrolman Landers pats them down. Another Police Cruiser pulls up. TWO MORE COPS, SHARPE and CINCER, both White 50's, get out and observe. CLOSE - LANDERS He takes Extra Time patting down Patrice getting some "Groping" in for Good Measure.
C: LANDERS
D: Search The Car. I know these Niggers are holding something.
E: CONT'D
N: Cincer and Sharpe enter Patrice's Car, searching it. Landers turns Kwame around, facing him.

E: CONT'D
C: KWAME TURE
D: My Name is Kwame Ture.

D: The next day when we dropped Brother Kwame off at the Airport he told me The Black Power Movement needed Strong Sistah's like me to lead the fight against Capitalist oppression and The Politicians and Pigs who perpetuate it. His words almost made that whole Pig Nightmare worth while...

D: Cops... Police...
C: PATRICE
D: Bunch of Racist Cops on a Power Trip.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: So you think all Cops are Racist?
C: PATRICE
D: It only takes One to pull a Trigger on a Innocent Sister or Brother.
N: Patrice absorbs all of this.
C: PATRICE
D: Why were you at Brother Kwame's Speech?
E: CONT'D
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: He's got some good ideas. I don't agree with all of them but he's a smart Brother who's worth hearing.
C: PATRICE
D: Are you Down for The Liberation of Black People?

D: This is Ron.
C: WALTER
D: This is Walter. Is this Ron? Your Voice sounds different over The Phone.
E: O.S.
N: Ron has to THINK FAST.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Allergies acting up again.
N: A steady Beat of Silence on The Line. Then...
C: WALTER
D: ...Yeah, I get that all the time.
E: O.S.

E: O.S.
N: Sgt. Trapp and Ron walk and talk.
C: SGT. TRAPP
D: I've got a friend that's up with these Groups. He says they're moving away from the Ole Violent Racist Style. That's what Davis is peddling now, it's become Mainstream.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Davis?
C: SGT. TRAPP
D: Devin Davis current Grand Wizard of The Klan, always in a three piece suit, he now goes by National Director. He's clearly got his Sights on Higher Office.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Political Office? How so?
C: SGT. TRAPP
D: Yeah, I guess they're trying to move away from their History of Selling HATE...
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: ...Keep going.
C: SGT. TRAPP
D: Affirmative Action, Immigration, Crime, Tax Reform. He said no one wants to be called a Bigot anymore. Archie Bunker made that too Un-Cool. The idea is under all these issues, everyday Americans can accept it, support it, until eventually, one day, you get somebody in The White House that embodies it.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: America would never elect somebody like Devin Davis President of the United States of America?
N: Sgt. Trapp just stares at Ron for a long moment.

C: PATRICE
D: From the inside?
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Yeah, from the inside.

C: PATRICE
D: No!!! We fight for what Black People really need! BLACK LIBERATION!!!
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Can't you do that from the inside!
C: PATRICE
D: No! You can't. White Man won't let us.
N: Ron gets frustrated. Patrice stops him.
C: PATRICE
D: What did Dubois say about "Double Consciousness"? "Twoness". Being an American and a Negro? Two Souls? Two Thoughts? Two warring ideals in one Dark Body?
E: CONT'D
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: I know how that feels. I'm Two damn people all the time!
C: PATRICE
D: But you shouldn't be! We shouldn't have a War going on inside ourselves. Why can't we just be Black People?

C: RON STALLWORTH
D: That surprises me.
C: DEVIN DAVIS
D: I know. People think I hate Negroes. I don't and The Organization doesn't either.
N: Ron gives a "This Is Crazy!" Look.
C: DEVIN DAVIS
D: They just need to be with their own. That's what Pinky would say, she had no problem with Segregation because she wanted to be with her own kind.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: Sounds like she was a Mammy to you.
C: DEVIN DAVIS
D: She was. You ever see "Gone with the Wind"? Pinky was my Hattie McDaniel. She won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
C: RON STALLWORTH
D: You were Scarlett and she was Mammy.
C: DEVIN DAVIS
D: That's right. When she passed away it was like we lost one of the Family.

C: RON STALLWORTH
