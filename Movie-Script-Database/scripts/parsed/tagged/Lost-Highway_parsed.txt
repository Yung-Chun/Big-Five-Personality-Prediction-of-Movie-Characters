S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
N: in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him. In the darkness, there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen. As the curtain moves, hard-edged light begins crawling across the room, and we see everything clearly. Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's early morning. CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette. CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes seem empty, glazed over. Fred is 32 years old, with dark hair. THE DOORBELL RINGS. Fred looks up, startled by the noise. He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m. FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the mirror. He pushes a button. A VOICE comes over the intercom.
C: VOICE OVER INTERCOM
D: Dick Laurent is dead.
N: Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house. He is on the upstairs level. He looks through a narrow slot window, but can't see the front door below. He goes further in the house to a picture window that overlooks the street below. There is NOBODY there.
T: CUT TO:

S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, buttoned up white shirt. He picks up a music case. A woman comes into the room. This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand.
C: RENEE
D: You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
C: FRED
D: What are you going to do?
C: RENEE
D: I thought I'd stay home and read.
N: Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying.
C: FRED
D: Read?... Read what, Renee?
N: Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink. Fred comes over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh.
C: FRED
D: It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
C: RENEE
D: I like to laugh, Fred.
C: FRED
D: That's why I married you.
C: RENEE
D: Wake me up when you get home.
N: Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to linger for a moment on her face.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: Fred is on the bandstand. He takes a solo on his saxophone. Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop. The BAND wails madly behind him. The PATRONS explode onto the dance floor, making it a wild scene. Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, driving everyone nuts.
T: CUT TO:

N: Fred puts down his music case, goes to the bedroom, and sees Renee sleeping soundly.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DOORSTEPS - DAY
N: Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the mail. She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the step. She picks it up. CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank. She takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Renee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous when she sees a videotape inside. She stares at it. Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe. He sees Renee staring at the videotape - before she hears him enter. When she does hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.
C: FRED
D: What's that?
C: RENEE
D: A videotape.
C: FRED
D: Who's it from?
C: RENEE
D: I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
C: FRED
D: Does it say anything on the tape?
C: RENEE
D: No, nothing.
E: looking it over
N: Fred walks over and picks up the tape.
C: FRED
D: Well, let's see what's on it.
N: Fred takes the tape to the VCR. He inserts it into the machine, and turns it on. Fred goes toward the couch.
C: FRED
D: Come on.
E: CON'T to Renee
N: They sit on the couch in front of the television. The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills the entire frame. The videotape shows the front of THE MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it. The picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND. After the camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow. Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments. Renee looks relieved.
C: RENEE
D: It must be from a real estate agent.
C: FRED
D: Maybe.
N: We see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy image on the TV.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and grapefruit in front of her. She is wearing glasses, reading a book. Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or acknowledge him. Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just off the dining room. He comes back into the dining room with a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee. He lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her.
C: FRED
D: Good book, huh?
C: RENEE
D: Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
E: she looks up
C: FRED
D: Same one you were reading the other night?
C: RENEE
D: What night?
C: FRED
D: When you didn't come to the club.
C: RENEE
D: Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
C: FRED
D: I called, you know.
C: RENEE
D: Called? When?
C: FRED
D: From the club. You didn't answer.
C: RENEE
D: I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
C: FRED
D: You were asleep when I got home, yes.
N: Renee goes back to her book. Fred sips his coffee and smokes.
C: RENEE
D: I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to.
E: without looking up
N: Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares at him. CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression. Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her glasses back on and resumes reading.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Fred is in bed waiting for Renee. He hears noises from the bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing. Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before getting into bed. Naked under the covers, she switches out her bedside lamp. The only light in the room comes from the outside, through the windows. Fred moves closer to Renee, puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast. She does not respond. Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her passionately. Renee accedes to his demands, but does not participate willingly. He makes love to her voraciously, but her lack of passion disturbs him. Fred can't stop, however, and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him maternally while he calms down. He climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed. CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and humiliation. They lie there in the dark silence for a while. Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness.
C: FRED
D: I had a dream about you last night...
C: RENEE
D: Yeah?
C: FRED
D: You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: FRED'S DREAM Fred is walking slowly across the living room. Fred's POV: moving - searching. Fred stops and listens.
C: RENEE
D: Fred? Fred, where are you?
E: tentatively - distant and off screen
N: The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning slowly into the bedroom. Renee is lying below in the bed.
C: FRED V.0.
D: Then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... It looked like you... but it wasn't.
N: The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT CLOSE UP. Her face registers TOTAL FEAR.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her bedside lamp. Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not Renee's face. It's a face Fred has never seen before. Fred quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own.
C: RENEE
D: Fred, are you all right?
N: Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face. Renee covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY
N: Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep. She opens it, pulls out a videotape. A large dog is BARKING incessantly somewhere in the neighborhood. Renee looks around to see if she can see the dog.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the mail. She is a bit puzzled and unsettled. She puts the tape down on a table. She stares at it. Fred comes in.
C: FRED
D: You're up early.
C: RENEE
D: That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
C: FRED
D: Who the hell owns that dog?
N: Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table.
C: FRED
D: What's that? Another tape?
C: RENEE
D: Yes, I just found it on the step.
N: Fred picks it up.
C: FRED
D: Don't you want to watch it?
C: RENEE
D: I guess so.
N: Fred goes to the VCR and inserts the tape. He turns the television on. He is about to start the tape - he looks up for Renee. She's hanging back.
C: FRED
D: Well, do you wanna watch it?
N: Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the couch.
C: RENEE
D: Yeah.
N: Renee sits on the couch. Fred starts the VCR and joins her. As before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape fills the frame. This tape shows the front of the house, as before, then shows the INTERIOR of Fred and Renee's house - AT NIGHT. The eerie DRONING SOUND goes throughout. The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping. The tape image then goes to snow. Fred and Renee stare at the snowy TV picture. After a few moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set. She is visibly shaken, trembling. She stares fearfully at Fred who seems less disturbed.
C: RENEE
D: We've got to call the police.
C: FRED
D: All right.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Renee is on the telephone. Fred is pacing, smoking, behind her.
C: RENEE
D: ...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.
N: Renee looks around anxiously. Fred gives her his cigarette, which she puffs on. He lights another and continues pacing.
C: RENEE
D: Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... we live at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... That's right... Yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... Someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... Isn't that enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.
N: Renee hangs up.
C: FRED
D: So?
C: RENEE
D: Two detectives are coming out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Two men in suits - the Detectives, ED and AL, are seated on the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape. The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several moments, until Fred shuts it off.
C: FRED
D: That's it.
C: ED
D: Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
N: All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look around, especially up toward the ceiling.
C: AL
D: Very strange.
C: RENEE
D: What is?
C: AL
D: The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
C: ED
D: How'd the camera get so high like that?
C: AL
D: And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
C: ED
D: Like you'd get if it was hand held.
C: AL
D: Right ... This just glided along.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
N: The Detectives enter the bedroom. Fred and Renee follow.
C: ED
D: This is the bedroom.
N: The Detectives look around without touching anything.
C: AL
D: Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
C: FRED
D: This is our bedroom.
C: ED
D: There's no other bedroom?
C: FRED
D: No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
C: AL
D: You're a musician?
C: FRED
D: Yes, I thought my wife ...
C: ED
D: What's your axe?
C: FRED
D: Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
C: ED
D: Tone deaf.
E: shakes his head
C: AL
D: Do you own a video camera?
E: to Renee
C: RENEE
D: No. Fred hates them.
N: The Detectives both look at Fred.
C: FRED
D: I like to remember things my own way.
C: AL
D: What do you mean by that?
C: FRED
D: How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
C: ED
D: Do you have an alarm system?
C: RENEE
D: Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
C: AL
D: Why not?
C: FRED
D: It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
C: ED
D: Might be a good time to try using it again.
C: AL
D: Anybody else have a key to the house.
C: RENEE
D: No.
C: AL
D: Maid? Relative?
C: RENEE
D: No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
C: ED
D: Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.
E: to Al
N: They all leave the bedroom.
T: CUT TO:

N: Ed is checking the door for marks.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: Ed and Al are standing by an unmarked police car with Fred and Renee. The Detectives are about to depart. AL We'll keep a watch on the house.
C: ED
D: As best we can.
C: AL
D: If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card. Ed hands Renee a card.
C: RENEE
D: We will.
C: FRED
D: Thanks, guys.
C: ED
D: It's what we do.
N: Ed and Al get into the car and drive off. Renee and Fred look at each other, warily, then go back into the house. THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS IN THE VIDEOTAPE.
T: FADE OUT: CUT TO:
S: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT
N: Fred is on the bandstand, sweating, and honking his saxophone. He handles the horn roughly, braying like a beast as the CROWD gathered in front of the stage gyrates as one swept away in the madness of the moment.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - SAME
N: At the back, near the side door, Renee can be seen with TWO MEN, only one of whose faces we see. The trio are going out the side door led by one of the men; we see only the back of his head. Renee glances briefly at the bandstand before she exits with the two men.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LUNA LOUNGE - BANDSTAND - SAME
N: CLOSE UP OF FRED as he plays, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings. His eyes open and shut as he clamps down on the horn.
T: CUT TO:

N: In the back of the club, the side door slowly closes.
T: FADE OUT: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STAIRWELL / LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction of the stairwell. We HEAR someone's steps coming up the stairs. It's Renee, who eventually comes into view. She is holding another manila envelope. She arrives at the top step. She and Fred lock eyes. Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to the VCR. He inserts it very carefully, slowly. He hits play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on the couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension. Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills the screen: We see the interior of the house at night. The camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are sleeping. Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout. in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera holds on him. He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the room. He comes to a sitting position, his head straining upwards, looking in the direction of the camera. At this point, the videotape image turns to snow.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Fred and Renee are on the couch. The TV remains on, showing snow. Renee is very upset, crying.
C: RENEE
D: What the hell is going on?!
C: FRED
D: I wish I knew.
E: equally horrified - frightened
N: Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his. She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not respond. Suddenly, she jumps with fright.
C: RENEE
D: What was that?!!!
C: FRED
D: What?
C: RENEE
D: On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
N: Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image.
C: RENEE
D: There! Play it!
E: CON'T
N: Fred runs the tape forward. We see snow - then a half-second long MEDIUM SHOT of Fred on his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed. He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly grimace, contorted. His eyes are WIDE WITH HORROR. Fred runs it back again and FREEZES the tape there on his tormented image. This image fills the screen. He and Renee stare at it.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and the couch. The three videotapes in their manila envelopes are stacked on a coffee table in the center.
C: AL
D: You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
C: ED
D: Or something.
C: FRED
D: No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
C: RENEE
D: Why would anyone do something like this?
C: AL
D: Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
C: ED
D: Or not so recently?
C: FRED
D: No, not to me.
N: Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee.
C: RENEE
D: I... no. No. No threats.
C: ED
D: We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
N: Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their agreement.
C: AL
D: We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
C: RENEE
D: I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
C: FRED
D: Where would you feel safe?
C: RENEE
D: I don't know. maybe a hotel.
N: Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee with keen interest. There is a strained silence between them.
C: ED
D: Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
C: FRED
D: The first night ... Not the last two.
C: AL
D: Why not?
C: FRED
D: I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
E: shrugs
C: RENEE
D: Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm!
N: Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces.
C: FRED
D: I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
C: RENEE
D: But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
N: Ed and Al rise from their chairs. Ed picks up the envelopes.
C: AL
D: We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.
N: Renee stands with the Detectives. Fred stands apart - his expression, pained and bewildered.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee. ANDY, 37 years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, making small talk, kissing and being kissed. The PEOPLE here are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain- wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses. Through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people cavorting in a swimming pool. Everyone has a drink in his or her hand. Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to Fred who walks away with it. Andy grabs Renee, and dances with her. They laugh and talk. Renee appears to be a bit intoxicated. Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then sets the empty glass down on the bar. Then he swallows the other drink, too, and sets down the glass. A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than Fred, approaches him.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: We've met before, haven't we?
C: FRED
D: I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: At your house. Don't you remember?
C: FRED
D: No, no I don't. Are you sure?
E: surprised
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
C: FRED
D: What do you mean? You're where right now?
E: incredulous
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: At your house.
C: FRED
D: That's absurd.
N: The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a cellular phone and holds it out to Fred.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Call me.
N: Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke. The Mystery Man puts the phone into Fred's hand.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Dial your number.
E: CON-T
N: Fred hesitates, puzzled.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Go ahead.
E: CON-T
N: Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as we stay on FRED'S FACE.
C: PHONE VOICE OF MYSTERY MAN
D: I told you I was here.
N: Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in front of him.
C: FRED
D: How did you do that?
N: The Mystery Man points to the phone.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Ask me.
N: Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now of the videotapes. He speaks into the phone.
C: FRED
D: How did you get into my house?
E: angrily
C: PHONE VOICE OF MYSTERY MAN
D: You invited me. It's not my habit to go where I'm not wanted.
N: Fred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into the phone.
C: FRED
D: Who are you?
N: The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.
C: PHONE VOICE OF MYSTERY MAN
D: Give me my phone back.
N: The man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone. Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: It's been a pleasure talking to you.
N: The man walks away from Fred. Renee appears and comes up to Fred.
C: RENEE
D: I thought you were getting me a drink?
C: FRED
D: Just a minute.
N: He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the party, Andy. He grabs Andy and points across the room toward the Mystery Man, who is engaged in conversation with OTHER GUESTS.
C: FRED
D: Andy, who is that guy?
C: ANDY
D: I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
E: looking at the Mystery Man
C: FRED
D: Dick Laurent?
C: ANDY
D: Yes, I believe so.
C: FRED
D: But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
E: remembering something
C: ANDY
D: He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
N: Andy and Renee exchange a worried look, which Fred does not notice.
C: FRED
D: I don't. I don't know him.
C: ANDY
D: Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
E: angrily
C: RENEE
D: Honey, who?... Who's dead?
N: Fred takes Renee by the arm away from Andy.
C: FRED
D: Let's go home.
C: RENEE
D: But...
C: FRED
D: Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
N: Fred drags the reluctant Renee out of Andy's house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Fred is driving fast and recklessly. Renee is drunk and is smiling at him.
C: FRED
D: How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?
N: Renee stares out the front window - thinks back.
C: RENEE
D: It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
C: FRED
D: What job?
C: RENEE
D: I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
C: FRED
D: He's got some fucked up friends.

N: Fred enters the house, careful to turn off the alarm first.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: There are only a couple of dim lights on, the house is mostly dark. Fred moves slowly and carefully through his house - searching each room for a possible intruder. Fred's POV - moving creepily room by room through the dark house - past the telephone - down the hall to the bedroom. There is NO ONE there. He goes back outside for Renee.

D: It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before. I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that.
N: Fred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, disturbed, seriously disquieted. Renee, still tipsy, follows him, moving from room to room.

N: No one is in the living room now - but a SHADOW moves slowly across a wall.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Renee's POV - down the hallway. There is just darkness at the end of the hall. It is EERIE. After a moment, Fred slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee. He walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Footsteps can be heard on the stairs. Fred's head appears at the top of the stairway. He comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously received. His expression is strained. He is alone. Fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the VCR, turns it on. He sits on the couch and watches. We go from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video. On the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, accompanied by the DRONING SOUND. The camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle. The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down. BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls. The camera drifts. THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot of the bed. She is badly mutilated. Fred is hovering over her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. On the tape, Fred turns away from Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood. His movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure. He looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Fred, sitting in front of the TV, shudders as the tape ends. He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and finally releases a tortured, warbly cry.

N: We are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom and living room windows. Inside the house, INVESTIGATORS and FORENSIC EXPERTS are moving around, measuring, scraping samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT
N: Renee's CORPSE on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an ATTENDANT. The entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall. The Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a rack of instruments, positioning the corpse. As he is doing these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his GIRLFRIEND. The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo. The young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, pearls, spike heels. The couple are close; she has an arm through his, and she laughs, nervously. He is smoking a cigarette.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?
C: M.E.
D: Party at the mayor's house, George. This is his daughter, Joyce.
C: ATTENDANT
D: Howdy, Joyce.
C: JOYCE
D: Howdy, George.
N: The Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled: L. ARM, HEAD, R. BREST (misspelled).
C: M.E.
D: Just like Christmas.
E: looking at the packages
N: He begins to unwrap them.
C: JOYCE
D: I don't know if I can watch this.
N: The M.E. tosses his cigarette down on the floor. The camera goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's filter screen.
C: M.E.
D: Leave any time you want, lover. I won't take it personally.
E: Voice-over
N: The camera stays on the drain as we HEAR the M.E. unwrapping the packaged body parts. Joyce's high heels enter the frame around the drain. She is stepping nervously, like a spooked horse. The clatter of her heels is very loud. We hear the M.E. chuckle.
C: M.E.
D: Easy, girl, easy.
E: Voice-over
C: JOYCE
D: You talking to me or... her?
C: M.E.
D: A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce.
E: laughs

S: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
N: The camera is behind a female FOREMAN in the jury box. The shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she stands. Over her left shoulder we see Fred standing at the defense table. Over her right shoulder the JUDGE is seated.
C: JUDGE
D: Have you reached a verdict?
C: FOREMAN
D: Yes, we have, your honor.
C: JUDGE
D: Please hand it to the bailiff.
N: The BAILIFF goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, then takes it to the Judge. The Judge opens it and reads it to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it to the Foreman.
C: JUDGE
D: And what is your verdict?
N: The camera moves to Fred, registering his tension. The camera goes to the Foreman's face.
C: FOREMAN
D: We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
N: Fred faints. Fe is lifted up by his ATTORNEY and GUARDS in attendance. Fred revives slightly.
C: JUDGE
D: Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair.
N: We see Fred's eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and upwards, looking at the video camera high on the wall of the courtroom, pointing down on him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY
N: MARIAN and RAQUEL, two exquisite young women, are looking over the merchandise.
C: RAQUEL
D: Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
C: MARIAN
D: How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
C: RAQUEL
D: They're gonna cook him.
C: MARIAN
D: Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
C: RAQUEL
D: Which would you choose?
N: Marian holds up a black teddy to her body.
C: MARIAN
D: Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
C: RAQUEL
D: Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
C: MARIAN
D: The heart, I guess.
C: RAQUEL
D: I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
N: Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest.
C: MARIAN
D: Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh?
N: They both giggle at the obvious joke.
C: RAQUEL
D: Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out. It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.
N: Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch.
C: MARIAN
D: You might be right, Raquel.
N: Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it. The girls giggle. Raquel sees Andy walking into the store. He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything. When Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her eyes.
C: ANDY
D: Guess who?

S: INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY
N: Fred, in the custody of GUARDS, wearing handcuffs and leg irons, is being escorted to his cell. He appears zombie-like as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his shackles, and lock him in.
C: GUARD
D: Make yourself to home, fella.
N: The guards leave. Fred stands near the cell door, begins to look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat. He hears the muffled, DISTORTED NOISES - VOICES from the surrounding cells. Lost voices - the voices of death row. Fred realizes where he is now. He walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge. Fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean.
T: FADE OUT: FADE IN:
S: INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY

N: This is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for population. This yard is for use by death row prisoners only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself. Fred is released into the area, which is more like a dog run. The Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise yard.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - NIGHT
N: There is more activity on the row tonight than usual. A COUPLE of MEN in suits walk through with an air of authority. There is a building murmur among the prisoners.

N: Fred sits on the edge of his bed, listening as sound of the prisoners builds. He's shaking.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRIS0N - DEATH ROW - NIGHT
N: TWO GUARDS are standing at the guard station. GUARD #1 (very quietly - solemnly) Here he comes. Several of the men in suits, along with several GUARDS, and a CLERGYMAN, a PRISONER in the middle of the group, enter the hallway. They proceed past the guard station down the hall. As the procession files by, DEATH ROW INMATES come to their doors and talk to the prisoner. INMATE #1 See you soon, Sammy. Don't think takin' a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me back the twenty you owe me. INMATE #2 Don't take it personal, pal. INMATE #3 Un fuerte abrazo, amigo! As the men march down the hallway, they pass Fred's cell. His window panel is empty. The camera stops on Fred's cell door, as we HEAR other prisoners talking to the inmate on his way to the ELECTRIC CHAIR. INMATE #4 Hang in there, honey. INMATE #5 Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.

S: INT. PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT
N: The prisoner is strapped into the electric chair. Behind a glass partition WITNESSES are seated. One of the men in suits, the WARDEN, goes to a telephone on the wall and stands with his hand on the receiver. He picks it up.
C: WARDEN
D: Line check. Okay.
E: into phone pause
N: The Warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it. We see one of the condemned man's WRISTS being clamped with an electrical device. The other wrist is clamped. A metal halo is placed around the condemned man's head. A large electrical cable leads off from the halo. Electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas where the clamps have been placed. The Clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to give the man his last rites. When he is finished, he nods to the Warden. The Warden approaches the condemned man.
C: WARDEN
D: Any final words, Sam?
N: The condemned man shakes his head "no". The Warden and the others clear the room and the doors are locked. The EXECUTIONER steps into place near a huge lever. He looks to the Warden. The Witnesses sit in silent anticipation. The hands of the clock on the wall have moved past midnight. The Warden takes one last look through a window at the condemned man - then nods to the Executioner.
T: CUT TO:

T: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. PRIS0N - EXERCISE YARD - DAY
N: The Guards release Fred into the yard for his exercise. At first the sunlight is blinding, and Fred covers his eyes. He moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way. Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face. Very soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is bathed in shade. Fred stands up, but is almost immediately hit by a searing pain in his head. Fred holds his head with his hands, sinks down to his knees. The Guard, who has been observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him.
C: GUARD
D: Something wrong?
C: FRED
D: My... My head.
C: GUARD
D: Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in? Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.

N: The guard assists Fred back inside the building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY
N: Fred is on his cot, holding his head. He is obviously in pain. He gets up and staggers to the cell door. Fred pushes a CALL button next to the door to summon a guard. The GUARD comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening.
C: GUARD
D: What's botbering you, Madison?
C: FRED
D: The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
C: GUARD
D: I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
N: The guard leaves. Fred collapses to the floor of the cell, writhing in pain.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY DAY
N: Fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a GUARD on either arm. He is placed on a chair in the middle of the room. The guards stand one on each side of him. A DOCTOR enters. He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows. Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest. The Doctor lifts Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing. The Doctor takes a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's eyes. He feels Fred's forehead. After this, he allows Fred's head to drop down again. The Doctor takes Fred's pulse. He drops Fred's wrist. He next takes Fred's blood pressure.
C: DOCTOR
D: You sleeping okay?
C: FRED
D: I can't sleep.
E: strained whisper
N: The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and removes a large blue pill. He fills a paper cup with water from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in Fred's mouth. The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of Fred's shirt. The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make sure he swallowed the pill.
C: DOCTOR
D: You'll sleep now. Take him back to his cell.
E: to Guards
N: The guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out of the infirmary.

S: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT
N: Fred awakens on his cot. He turns and sits up in the darkness. A stream of light through the slot window illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and discolored. He staggers up and shuffles over to the call button, which he leans on. A few moments later, a GUARD appears on the other side of the mesh.
C: GUARD
D: What is it?
C: FRED
D: Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
C: GUARD
D: The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
C: FRED

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The guard walks away from Fred's door to the guard station, where another GUARD is sitting at a table, reading a magazine. GUARD #1 Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up. GUARD #2 (not looking up from his magazine) Which one? They both laugh.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRIS0N - FRED'S CELL - SAME - NIGHT
N: Fred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing on his head. Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now. He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, making grotesque, otherworldly sounds. As the camera moves into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the discolored swelling has increased. Fred looks up, sensing something.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - NIGHT

S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store. HOT MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo. Marian and Raquel are dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be. Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body. His eyes are closed at first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur. He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he collapses again. Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance. Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically. The girls' breasts tumble out of their teddies. Raquel drops her end of Andy, turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy. Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around. Andy makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches for her but falls back, dead to the world. Raquel and Marian don't quit.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT
N: Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock his body. He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his nostrils. His head is badly swollen. Fred vomits repeatedly, and drags around in his mess. Fred turns, straining upwards as we've seen him do before. His face and head are hideously deformed. Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead. He pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes. As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets. We move into the eye sockets and beyond.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights. We are floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape. This gliding, eerie POV continues until the headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the road. This figure is a man, PETE DAYTON. Pete turns, unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to him. The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete. There is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the house. She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete. Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly at us. Now Pete seems to move toward us as we move toward him. His head fills the screen.

N: A GUARD is making his early morning rounds. He stops at each cell and looks in, making a mark with a pencil on a piece of paper on a clipboard. when he comes to Fred's cell, he is about to make a check-mark, but looks in again and appears confused. THE MAN INSIDE IS NOT FRED.
C: GUARD
D: Who are you? What are you doing in this cell?
N: The MAN in the cell sits still on the cot, staring straight ahead. The man is thin, younger than Fred.

C: DR. ROGOFF

S: INT. PRISON - LONG CORRIDOR - DAY
N: Pete's parents, BILL and CLAIRE DAYTON, escorted by a PRISON GUARD, are approaching the Warden's office. It is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office. The Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple. Bill Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck-tail. He's working-class, ex-biker. Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze. She retains the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast. Claire is wearing sunglasses.

N: The Daytons are ushered in by the guard. The Warden is standing behind his desk. Dr. Rogoff is standing to one side, and next to him is Captain Henderson. The Daytons stand just inside the room for a moment before the Warden extends his right hand.
C: WARDEN
D: I'm Warden Clements. This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff. Please, sit down.
N: Bill and Claire move to the chairs in front of the desk and sit down. The Warden, Dr. Rogoff and Captain Henderson all sit down.
C: WARDEN
D: Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, Peter, is here.
E: CON'T
N: Claire Dayton removes her sunglasses. She and Bill wait - the warden is searching for words.
C: WARDEN
D: He... He was discovered this morning... in a cell on death row.
E: CON'T
N: Bill and Claire look at each other - bewildered.
C: WARDEN
D: A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
E: CON'T
C: BILL
D: The wife killer?
C: WARDEN
D: Yes.
C: CLAIRE
D: How is this possible, Warden?
N: The warden shakes his head.
C: WARDEN
D: ...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him?
N: Bill and Claire look at each other again - briefly.
C: BILL
D: His condition? What do you mean?
C: WARDEN
D: His physical condition.
C: BILL
D: Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
E: hesitates
N: Bill and Claire look at each other once again.
C: CLAIRE
D: I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday. He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay? Can we see him?
N: The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: He has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis... that's redness and swelling around the eyes.
C: BILL
D: Was he in a fight?
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: These conditions don't indicate a fight.
C: CLAIRE
D: But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell?
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: He can't talk. Or won't.
C: BILL
D: That doesn't sound like Pete.
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: Your son has experienced some sort of trauma, I'm afraid. We were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here.
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: You don't know Fred Madison?
C: BILL
D: No... Only what was in the news.
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: Do you think Pete knows him?
C: CLAIRE
D: I wouldn't know how.
C: WARDEN
D: You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
E: to Claire
C: CLAIRE
D: When he went to work, right.
C: WARDEN
D: What about yesterday?
C: CLAIRE
D: He didn't come home.
C: BILL
D: Sometimes he stays at a friend's.
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: Any particular friends?
C: BILL
D: A girl's, a buddy's. I don't know. He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.
C: CLAIRE
D: I want to see him.
C: WARDEN
D: Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can. Mel, let's get Peter in here.
E: to Dr. Rogoff
N: Dr. Rogoff leaves the room. While he's gone, nobody talks, increasing the tension. Dr. Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt. Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen. He can walk, but unsteadily. Pete looks around the room - sees his parents. Claire jumps up.
C: CLAIRE
D: Pete...
E: tenderly
N: She and Dr. Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair. Bill is taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing.
C: WARDEN
D: Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
E: CON'T
C: CLAIRE
D: Pete, what happened to you?
N: Pete has a dazed look on his face. He starts to speak, then stops.
C: CLAIRE
D: It's okay. Take your time, honey.
E: CON'T
N: Pete's gaze drifts from his mother's face around the room and back to her face.
C: PETE
D: Where ... am I?
E: afraid - quiet
N: The Warden and Captain Henderson look to Dr. Rogoff.
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: You're in the state penitentiary. You were found in a cell on death row.
C: PETE
D: My head hurts.
N: Pete rubs his head like it's about to explode with pain.
C: WARDEN
D: A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell. He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him.
C: PETE
D: I... I don't know.
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: Do you know Fred Madison?
C: PETE
D: No.
E: straining
N: There is a silence in the room, as Pete massages his throbbing temples.
C: CLAIRE
D: Warden, can we take him home?
E: worried
N: The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.
C: DR. ROGOFF
D: From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not.
E: to Warden
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: We need to find out what happened here.
C: BILL
D: Have you made any charges against him?
E: standing up
C: WARDEN
D: No.
C: BILL
D: Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
C: WARDEN
D: All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later. For now, he's free to leave.
N: Bill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of the warden's office. With a nod from the Warden, the guard accompanies them out of the room. The Warden, Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff stand but remain in the office.
C: CAPTAIN HENDERSON
D: You just gonna let him go?
E: to warden
C: WARDEN
D: We'll get a tail put on him.

S: INT. DAYTON HOUSE - DAY
N: Bill and Claire take Pete to his room, which has a bed, desk, two chairs and a sea of disassembled motorcycle parts belonging to a classic Indian motorbike which Pete is rebuilding.

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
N: Pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands. He stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, unwatered lawn on his bare feet. He walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence. His eyes fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic swimming pool. He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows it lazily in a circle. A small plane drones overhead. In the distance, a WOMAN finishes hanging out some wash and goes in the back door of her house. The slamming of her screen door sounds a thousand miles away. Pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him.
T: CUT TO:

D: The night before you showed up in the slammer...
C: CLAIRE

S: INT. DAYTON HOUSE - PETE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television. He hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE ("V") saunter in.

C: "V"
D: Texaco... What's wrong with that?
C: PETE
D: Listen.
C: "V"
D: You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
N: Pete shakes his bead with disgust. "V" pulls the car off the boulevard into "Tops" drive-in. Cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the side of the building where people are hanging out under a long metal awning. MUSIC is playing LOUD. "V" pulls into a parking spot by the awning. The headlights illuminate a group of HIPSTERS - some dancing, some just hanging out. THREE or FOUR GIRLS hanging out together turn toward "V's" car. They see Pete in the front seat, and one of the girls, Sheila, smiles and walks toward him.
C: SHEILA
D: Hey. Where have you been?
N: Pete talks to her through the open window while "V", Carl and Lanie climb out through "V's" door. "V" leans back in.

A WAITRESS takes orders for drinks. Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance. "V" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her. Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance. The music is fast, but they dance slow.

C: MR. EDDY
D: Oh, shit... Is that what I think it is?
N: Pete turns and looks back. A car is TAILGATING them, the silver-gray Infiniti. The two assistants in the backseat turn nonchalantly to take a look - then they return their look to Mr. Eddy. Mr. Eddy starts to take a slow burn - keeps looking at the Infiniti in the rearview mirror. The assistants look to one another take a deep breath. Mr. Eddy slows slightly and then keeps the Pullman steady at 32 m.p.h. The Infiniti moves up ten feet behind the Pullman, and blows its horn. Mr. Eddy rolls down his window. The assistants are paying close attention - they buckle their seatbelts. Pete notices a tension in the car. He watches Mr. Eddy's face. Mr. Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out the window and waves the Infiniti by. The Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman. When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy "the bird" and flies past. CLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas pedal. The Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti. Pete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support. The Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash. The Infiniti tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more power.
C: MR. EDDY
D: This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off.
E: clenched teeth
N: Mr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland. The Driver of the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber. At a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a mountain and into a little glade of trees. Dust and brush fly everywhere. Mr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make for the Driver's side of the Infiniti. Mr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll. Mr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips the Driver to the ground. He smashes the butt of his gun across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood. Mr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the Driver. Mr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man.
C: MR. EDDY
D: DON'T YOU EVER FUCKIN' TAILGATE.

S: INT. ARNIE'S GARAGE - DAY
N: Pete is on a skate - working under a car. The radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it gives him a headache. The tune is one of Fred Madison's be- bop saxophone pieces. Pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio. He changes the station. PHIL, another mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete.
C: PHIL
D: Why'd you change it? I liked that.
C: PETE
D: Well, I didn't.
N: Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car, he lays on the skate - unable to work. A car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage. Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors. He sees a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his direction. Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car. He stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees - back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like Renee. CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except she is about eight years younger. The girl is staring right into Pete's eyes. Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from Pete. Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between Pete and the girl.
C: MR. EDDY
D: I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
C: PETE
D: Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
E: regaining his composure
C: MR. EDDY
D: If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
C: PETE
D: It'll be ready.
C: MR. EDDY
D: You're my man, Pete.
N: Mr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but aliows. Mr. Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the Pullman is waiting. Pete watches her walk and move. He watches her until Mr. Eddy drives her away. She steals one last glance back at Pete before she disappears. When she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this beautiful girl over again in his mind. The scene is accompanied by Lou Reed's version of "This Magic Moment".

S: INT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed. He HEARS a succession of highly-amplified SOUNDS at intervals with eerie stretches of silence: CRICKETS in fractured cadence a distant TELEVISION - a FLY buzzing slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES. Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion. Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, steady DRONE. Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily. He moves toward his bedroom door. As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift. He can hear laughter. The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter - to hide it. Pete opens his door and peers out. Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction. They are smoking a joint, passing it back and forth. They are not looking directly at him. They seem to be looking, but not seeing. Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room. There is no one there - just an empty hallway. Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward each other - they start to laugh quietly again. Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no one in the living room. It's empty.

At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss streaming into an empty coffee cup. The camera stays on the top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition. Al's head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street. He closes the door and zips up his trousers.

N: Pete drives through the night - up Ventura Boulevard with the "Cruisers". He looks in the other cars and looks at the GIRLS on the street. He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows. He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando valley neighborhood streets. He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn. He lights a cigarette while he waits. In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window.
C: SHEILA

C: PETE
D: Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?

C: SHEILA
D: Why don't you like me?
C: PETE
D: I do like you, Sheila.
N: Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers.
C: SHEILA

N: Alice steals a look back.
C: ALICE
D: I don't recognize the car...
N: At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly peels out between on-coming cross traffic. He swerves between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view. Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier and trap them. ANGRY DRIVERS lean on their horns. Pete and Alice have lost them.

N: Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers". He spots "V's" car parked at "Tops". He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine. The usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila. Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello. He lights a cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the awning above. "V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad mood. Sheila is over with her girlfriends. She hasn't seen Pete arrive. Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction. She looks like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything. She keeps looking - staring. Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but Pete is not there. Pete looks at Sheila. He's unsettled and confused by her staring, but not seeming to see him. He watches her turn away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out to dance to the LOUD music. Pete watches her dance. Suddenly, he can't see her. He thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the building - out of view. He moves to look and his head is struck by a violent pain. He grabs his head with his hand and leans forward. "V" grabs his arm.
C: "V"
D: You okay, man?
C: PETE
D: What?
C: "V"
D: You okay?... What's wrong7
N: Pete looks up at "V". He doesn't seem to recognize him - "V's" head is a featureless blur. Pete shakes his head trying to drive out the pain. He looks over again for Sheila. He sees her there dancing with her girlfriend.
C: "V"
D: Pete... You okay?

D: Yeah.
N: Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "V" - recognizing him.
C: PETE
D: I'm, okay... You okay?
E: CON'T
C: "V"
D: Sure, I'm okay.
N: Some drunk GUYS move over to Sheila and her girlfriend. They cut in on the girls. The guy with Sheila puts his hand around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind. She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter - laughing with his buddy. "V" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post. Pete crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila. He slams his fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in the process. The man goes down bleeding. Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready for a fight. He hits the man in the gut - the man's head goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's face. The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then continues on as the man falls to the floor. Pete picks him up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off. Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger. Sheila is there beside him.
C: SHEILA

N: ALICE'S STORY We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an office building. Alice is waiting nervously. A SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door. There is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses. No one is saying anything.

E: voiceover MORE
N: ALICE (cont'd) weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited. We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of Alice waiting. We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door. We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of weight. Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door. The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack. He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through. Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room. There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls. There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room. She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair. They all just stare at her silently. She looks around nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's. Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and cocks it against her head. Alice goes weak in the knees. Her eyes fill with fear. The men continue to stare. Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?". Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't asked for it with words. Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she knows how. The men just stare without expression. When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to him. Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making herself available for whatever he wants. Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes. She reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek...

D: I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus ... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
C: PETE
D: Okay...
C: ALICE
D: Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
C: PETE
D: Okay.
N: Still entwined with each other, Alice reaches for the phone and dials a number. It starts to ring and she smiles at Pete when she hears it being answered.
C: ALICE
D: Andy?... It's me, Alice. How ya doin?... Andy... I can get away tomorrow night... I could come to your house... That sounds good... Around nine... Yeah, me too, Andy... Great... See ya then.

C: PETE
D: Why are ya goin' so early?
C: ALICE
D: 'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
C: PETE
D: What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
C: ALICE
D: Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
C: PETE
D: What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
C: ALICE
D: I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin' somewhere else.. To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
E: off his look she smiles
C: PETE
D: Oh, yeah?... What else?
N: Alice reaches down between their legs. Pete smiles.
C: ALICE
D: This... and this.
N: They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly - then wildly. Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete.
C: ALICE
D: Are you my man?
E: CON'T
C: PETE
D: Yes.
E: getting hotter
C: ALICE
D: Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
N: Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means.
C: ALICE
D: Are you?
E: CON'T
N: Pete stares at her - then nods.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway. When he gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front step. She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to see him. She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she YELLS.
C: SHEILA
D: THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!
E: total horror
N: As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this time. Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step.
C: PETE
D: Sheila?
E: frightened
N: She heads toward him.
C: PETE
D: Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
C: SHEILA
D: You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
C: PETE
D: Sheila...
C: SHEILA
D: You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
N: Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his shirt.
C: PETE
D: Hey... Sheila.
C: SHEILA
D: What's the BITCH'S name?!
C: PETE
D: Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
C: SHEILA
D: YOU'RE SORRY!!
C: PETE
D: Go home, Sheila.
N: Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest.
C: SHEILA
D: YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!!
N: She starts crying and hitting him harder.
C: SHEILA
D: FUCK YOU!!
E: CON'T
N: Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood. INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER. Bill comes out of the house. Claire is behind him waiting on the front porch. Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground. She is sobbing as she tears at him.
C: PETE
D: Sheila... Stop...
C: SHEILA
D: FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
N: Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders. Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill.
C: BILL
D: Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila.
N: Sheila gets to her feet - crying. She looks down at Pete, who remains lying on the front lawn. For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED. The DRONING SOUND returns.
C: SHEILA
D: You are different.
E: to Pete
C: BILL
D: Sheila...
C: SHEILA
D: TELL HIM!
E: to Bill
N: The phone inside the house starts to ring. Claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it.
C: BILL
D: Sheila... Don't.
C: SHEILA
D: I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again.
N: Sheila runs off crying. Pete and Bill watch her go. Claire comes to the door.
C: CLAIRE
D: Pete... There's a man on the phone. He's called a couple of times tonight.
N: Pete pulls himself up.
C: PETE
D: Who is it?
C: CLAIRE
D: He won't give his name.
N: Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it up.
C: PETE
D: Hello.
C: MR. EDDY
D: Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
E: phone voice
C: PETE
D: Who is this?
C: MR. EDDY
D: You know who it is.
N: Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching Pete. Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his parents staring at him on the other. He waves his parents away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.
C: PETE
D: Mr. Eddy?
C: MR. EDDY
D: Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
C: PETE
D: Okay.
C: MR. EDDY
D: You're doin, okay? That's good, Pete.
C: PETE
D: Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
C: MR. EDDY
D: I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
N: Pete doesn't know what to say.
C: MR. EDDY
D: You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
C: PETE
D: Yeah.
C: MR. EDDY
D: That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
N: Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone. There is a long silence. Pete can hear breathing.
C: VOICE
D: We've met before, haven't we?
N: Pete freezes. His mind is scrambling.
C: PETE
D: I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
C: VOICE
D: At your house. Don't you remember?
C: PETE
D: No. No, I don't.
C: VOICE
D: We just killed a couple of people...
C: PETE
D: What?
N: Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.
C: VOICE
D: You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it.
N: Pete is getting pale with fear.
C: PETE
D: What's goin' on?
C: VOICE
D: Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
N: Pete can hear the phone being passed again.
C: MR. EDDY
D: Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.
N: The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his fate. He hears a NOISE and turns. Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him. CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something, but not seeing. PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond. There is no one there.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. STREET - BUS STOP - NIGHT
N: A City Bus pulls up to the stop. The doors open and Pete climbs on.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BUS - NIGHT

T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - BUS STOP - NIGHT
N: The bus stops and Pete gets out. He starts walking.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT
N: We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place". Pete walks up the street looking at numbers. He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House. He stares at the house from the sidewalk. Lights are on upstairs and down. The hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house. Pete looks at his watch. It reads: 11:05 p.m. He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back. He stops and listens. He pulls himself up and over the fence, but crashes on something on the other side. He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece. He hears echoing sounds of love making. He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries the back door. It opens.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room. Pete stops short and stares. A movie projector is running in the living room. A porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end. Alice is in the porno film. A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS of flesh banging flesh. Her face is in the foreground. Her eyes look out directly at Pete. She is loving every minute of it. Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control. He looks around. He sees clothes scattered about. He picks up a girl's sweater and smells it. He looks up the stairs. Feet appear at the top of the stairs. They start down. Pete runs for the bar. Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well- stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, and ducks behind the bar. He can hear Andy approaching. He can hear Andy gather two glasses. He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno film. He clenches his teeth with rage. Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him. They see each other. Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head. Andy falls. The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead. Pete turns. Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for a pair of panties. Lipstick is smeared around her mouth. She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase. Her porno film is playing on the wall behind her. These images jump and spin in Pete's mind. He moves unsteadily toward her.
C: ALICE
D: You got him.
C: PETE
D: Alice, I...
E: still holding the figurine
N: Pete starts to tremble. He drops the figurine. He tries to embrace her. There is a crashing noise behind him. Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE. Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down. When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms. This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table. There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead. CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor.
C: ALICE
D: Wow!
E: amazement - no feeling
N: Pete pulls himself off the floor. Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body. While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it lay Andy's trousers. She goes through the pockets, finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band. Alice hands the roll to Pete.
C: ALICE
D: Put this in your pocket.
E: CON'T
N: Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck. These items she puts inside the empty pillowcase. Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on. Pete watches her, trembling, unable to say anything. She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, hyperventilating.
C: ALICE
D: You all right?
E: CON'T
C: PETE,
D: We killed him.
C: ALICE
D: You killed him.
C: PETE
D: Alice?
N: Alice slides up close to Pete.
C: ALICE
D: It was an accident... Accidents happen every day.
N: Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding on for dear life.
C: PETE
D: Alice...
C: ALICE
D: We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
E: pushing back
N: Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase. Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur. He looks around the room, which spins in and out of focus. His eyes land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall. This photo troubles him. Pete squints, then points to the photograph.
C: PETE
D: Is that you? Are both of them you?
N: CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy. Alice stops and comes back. She looks at the photo, walks closer to it, and points at herself.
C: ALICE
D: That's me.
N: She turns to Pete. Pete is staring at the photograph - at Alice and Renee in the photograph. His nose is bleeding profusely.
C: ALICE
D: Pete?...
E: CON'T
N: Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.
C: PETE
D: Where's the bathroom?
C: ALICE
D: Up the stairs - down the hall.
N: Pete runs up the stairs - about to get sicker. Alice watches him go with a nuance of disdain.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
N: Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the hallway. THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE. Pete wanders down this "changed" hall. On his left, he identifies a door with the number 25 on it. He pauses for a moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he comes to a door with the number 26 on it. He enters through this door. Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN. Her arms are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her from behind. The man's face is blank, featureless, and is buried in the woman's back - we can't see it. Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror. He's looking at her reflection in the mirror. Pete's head is pounding.
C: WOMAN/ALICE
D: Did you want to talk to me?
E: to Pete
N: Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe.
C: WOMAN/ALICE
D: Did you want to ask me "why"?
E: CON'T laughs
N: Pete staggers out of the room. He closes the door. The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's hallway. The doors no longer have numbers. Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering. He starts down the stairs.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at the desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and jewelry. She has a PISTOL in her hand. Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's face as Pete makes his way to her. His head is still throbbing with pain. His focus goes from her face to the gun - which is pointing right at him - back to her. Alice smiles.
C: ALICE
D: Don't you trust me, Pete?...
N: She laughs and hands him the pistol.
C: ALICE
D: Stick that in your belt.
E: CON'T
N: She shows him the pillowcase filled with loot.
C: ALICE
D: Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car... We can go anywhere.
E: CON'T going through the loot looks up at him
C: PETE
D: Alice?
N: Alice grabs Pete's arm and hurries him toward the door.
C: ALICE
D: Come on, baby.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
N: Alice takes Pete to Andy's car and throws him the keys.
C: ALICE
D: You drive.
N: Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase in the back. Pete takes the revolver out of his belt. He opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits inside. He sets the pistol on the seat between them. He looks up at her. She smiles wildly. Pete slalms the door - starts the car and they drive off.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - EDGE OF THE DESERT - NIGHT
N: Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the end of a street at the edge of a desert. Alice gets out into a hot wind. Pete stays in the car as she goes up to the house. Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell. She waits in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in the wind. A HOUSEBOY opens the door. Alice says something to him - Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his driver's side window is down. All he can hear is the hot wind blowing. The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in the car. The Houseboy and Alice exchange information. The Houseboy points out toward the desert. Alice turns back to the car. The Houseboy watches her.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ANDY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Alice gets into the car.
C: ALICE
D: Come on.
N: Pete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive. The Houseboy is still standing - watching them.
C: ALICE
D: We have to go to the desert. He's at his cabin.
E: CON'T
N: Pete and Alice drive off. The Houseboy continues to watch them.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: We see the clean moving POV illuminated by headlights. We're floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, desert landscape.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
N: Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
N: Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts next to a dry lakebed. They both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door. There is no answer. Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.
C: ALICE
D: We'll have to wait.
N: The hot wind continues to blow. Alice and Pete walk back down to the car. The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window and switches on the RADIO. She can't get anything in but static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out. She hits the "seek" button. The radio starts to search. Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her. Alice walks slowly to him. The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then drifts toward them.
C: PETE
D: Why me, Alice? Why choose me?
N: The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with longing. Alice begins to dance. She takes Pete's hand and pulls him close to her.
C: ALICE
D: So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete?
N: Alice gives Pete that wild smile.
C: ALICE
D: More than ever?
E: CON'T
N: She kisses Pete over and over. He begins to kiss her back. She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them. The scene is out of a dream. Alice and Pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind whips at their bodies. They sink down on the soft ground and start making love. The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, bathing them in a pristine glow. The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static for another station. The music it finds now is LOUD and INTENSE. Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with Pete. She is the aggressor, highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not giving, insatiable. The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light. They become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light. Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her. The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static. The radio strains to hold the station. Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice. He chokes with emotion.
C: PETE
D: I want you... I want you...
N: With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness. The wind billows a black cloud of dust around them. Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear.
C: ALICE
D: You'll never have me.
N: Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him from above. She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears within it. Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness. He's holding his head and shaking. As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED. As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES. Fred looks at the car. He sees some movement inside. Fred looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat. CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party.
C: VOICE FROM BEHIND FRED
D: Hello.
N: Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now standing in the doorway. Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty. He looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the doorway.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Here I am.
N: Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion. He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside. Fred stops in the doorway. He looks around.
C: FRED
D: Where's Alice?
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Alice who?
N: Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room. Fred stares at him.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Her name is Renee. If she's told you her name is Alice, she's lying. AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR NAME?!
E: CON'T filled now with anger
N: Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to the car, stumbling more than once. Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical charge by the use of the headlights and radio. The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin. He starts toward Fred. The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically. The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car, The engine catches. Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is reaching for him. Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes off across the dark desert.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
N: Fred pulls up onto the two-lane highway. An old, rusted roadsign is posted there. It reads: "LOST HIGHWAY".
T: CUT TO:
N: Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway". The wind is picking up even stronger than before. A big storm is blowing in. Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL. The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it. Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it. He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story building.
T: CUT TO:

C: FRED
D: I need a room.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: The hallway is strangely similar to Pete's vision upstairs at Andy's. Fred comes to the door numbered 25, looks at his key which says "25" and unlocks the door and enters.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - NIGHT
N: Fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under the pillow on the bed. He sits on the edge of the bed. He takes a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches. Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow. Lightning cracks outside the window. Fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside table. As the last of the blue smoke drifts away, Fred falls back on the bed. Fred closes his eyes.

N: Al walks over to where Ed is looking at the photo on the wall. Al looks at it.
C: AL
D: It's her, all right. Fred Madison's wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there.
N: CLOSE UP ON THE PHOTOGRAPH - that shows RENEE AS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE PICTURE, standing between Andy and Mr. Eddy/ Laurent.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN
N: Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling on her stockings. Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her. Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps. Renee leaves the room, closing the door as quietly as possible behind her. As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up. He sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN
N: Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE - the same attitude he had on the videotape. He strains upwards and looks eerily around the room. He gets up and crosses slowly to a window. He takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back. The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel. Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away. Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN
N: Fred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door.
T: CUT TO:

N: Mr. Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears the knock.
C: MR. EDDY/LAURENT
D: Renee?
N: He goes to the door and opens it a crack. As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room. Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun barrel. Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose.
C: MR. EDDY/LAURENT
D: What the fuck? What's going on?
C: FRED
D: You're coming with me.
E: pointing the gun at him
N: Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye. The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot. Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car. Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman. As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. The hand moves the window curtain further to one side. The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man. The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYBREAK
N: Fred is driving along the road. Suddenly he pulls the car off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted spot, stops and gets out. Fred opens the trunk. When he does ... Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred - knocking them both to the ground. Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great. Fred tears loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head back. Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, searching. A KNIFE appears. it comes into Fred's hand from another. Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down. Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped around his throat - trying to hold his neck together. Blood is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound. Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead. CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares at Fred. Blood is rushing out of him.
C: MR. EDDY/LAURENT
D: What do you guys want?
E: wet and jagged
N: The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is holding the gun, not Fred. The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a little watchman TV. He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it. Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen. Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former videotapes. The full frame of the TV screen reveals -
S: INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room. Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several people in shadows behind the light of the projector. Among them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY. Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up under her skirt. They are watching the porno film. They are watching murky images of sex turning to violence. In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, aroused. The image on the Watchman changes now.
S: EXT. DESERT - DAYBREAK
N: On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him. The Mystery Man's image speaks.
C: MYSTERY MAN
D: Now you can hand it back to me.
E: on TV screen
N: Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a hand. Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up. The Mystery Man has his arm outstretched just as it was on the video image. Mr. Eddy/ Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the Mystery Man.
C: MR. EDDY/LAURENT
D: You and me, mister, we can really out- ugly the sumbitches, can't we?
E: wet and jagged
N: The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who jerks and dies in the dust. The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his ear. The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF FRED'S EYES as he listens. The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun. He is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man. Fred turns to go back to the car.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING
N: Fred drives up to his house in Mr. Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes 600 Pullman and stops in front. He gets out of the car, goes to the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL. There is a BEEP sound.
C: FRED
D: Dick Laurent is dead.
E: into intercom
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STREET - EARLY MORNING
N: As Fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing Ed and Al pull in to the curb just up the street from Fred and Renee's house.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING
N: Fred turns and sees the cop car. He jumps in his car, fires it up, and peels out. The cops give chase.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
N: Fred is behind the wheel of his car. Behind him are the cops. CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield. The shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit. Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as he races into the vortex. His tormented SCREAM blends with the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him. THE END
