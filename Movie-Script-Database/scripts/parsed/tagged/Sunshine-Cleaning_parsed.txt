T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY
N: ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights. On the highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a tangle of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise in the distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the foothills.
S: EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY
N: Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.
S: INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party. She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses. Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool. A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer. He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.
S: INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY
N: The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.
C: OWNER
D: I've got the five stores here and then two in Rio Rancho.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 2.
C: JOE
D: That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf.
N: Joe pulls out some order forms.
C: OWNER
D: Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order.
N: The owner looks at Joe's business card.
C: OWNER
D: How about I give you a call if I decide to--
C: JOE
D: I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.
C: OWNER
D: Yeah, tomorrow's not good.
C: JOE
D: Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break.
N: The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.
C: JOE
D: My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this...
N: Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.
C: JOE
D: Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather?
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 2A. The owner is not amused.
S: EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY
N: Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters to his rusted Monte Carlo.
S: EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the exchange with amusement. Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and joins the fray.
C: MR. KIM
D: You are fired.
C: NORAH
D: I so don't care.
N: Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might not have been the best decision ever.
C: NORAH
D: Fuck.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 3.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY
N: A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down the drain. Gone. Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the empty hall.
S: INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR - SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY
N: A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.
S: INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY
N: The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his attention to another customer. The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin. A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to horrible anticipation. He braces for the...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER
N: Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt, talks to the STORE OWNER.
C: CARL
D: Yep, these shotgun cases are a real pain in the ass. What we call a wide field of contamination.
E: MORE
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 4. CARL (cont'd) Guy's all over the place and every little glob of him's a biohazard. The owner rubs his temples.
C: CARL
D: Gonna lose some inventory.
C: OWNER
D: Selfish bastard.
C: CARL
D: Trust me, you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guy's tooth in her brand new fanny pack.
N: A ABOVE AND BEYOND WORKER in a polo shirt waves his arm to get Carl's attention.
C: CLEAN SWEEP WORKER
D: He's over here in fishing too.
C: CARL
D: Yep, a real pain in the ass.
N: Carl walks over to his assistant. Detective, `MAC' MACDOWELL, approaches the owner.
C: MAC
D: We're wrapping it up.
C: OWNER
D: Three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor. Can you believe that?
N: Mac and another DETECTIVE walk toward the entrance.
C: MAC
D: Hey, can you handle the report tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do.
C: DETECTIVE
D: A blonde thing or a brunette thing?
S: INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 5. A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong. You are powerful. You can do anything. You are a winner.' Rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face.
C: ROSE
D: I am strong. I am powerful. I can do anything. I am a winner.
N: She doesn't look like she believes it.
S: INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged pop-can-pipe.
C: NORAH
D: The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you.
N: Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's.
C: RANDY
D: I think you're scared of it.
N: The phone RINGS. Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one.
C: NORAH
D: I'm not scared of it.
E: Holding in the smoke
C: RANDY
D: Uncomfortable then. You just need to get better acquainted.
N: Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The phone RINGS again.
C: NORAH
D: Dad, get the phone.
E: yelling
C: RANDY
D: There's absolutely no pressure here.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 6. Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers. She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear. The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks up the receiver.
C: RANDY
D: You can touch it if you want.
C: NORAH
D: Hello.
E: into phone
C: ROSE
D: You haven't left yet? Damn it Norah, my class starts in fifteen minutes.
E: O.S. through receiver
C: NORAH
D: I know, I know.
E: into phone
N: As Norah holds the phone her eyes slide from Randy's face to his off screen penis. She takes the pencil from behind her ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.
S: 14 INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 14 *
N: Joe sits in the living room, busily putting stickers on cans * of Fancy Corn. Norah and Randy enter from Norah's room. * JOE * Doesn't Rose have her thing * tonight? * NORAH * I'm going. I need to borrow your * car. * JOE * Here. Take some corn. * Norah leaves.

N: Randy pulls up to a small house and stops. Norah gets out, collects the canister from back and heads inside.
S: INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Norah enters the tidy two bedroom house with a barrel of Fancy Corn under her arm.
C: NORAH
D: Sorry.
C: ROSE
D: I'm gonna be so late.
N: Oscar runs from the bedroom and flings himself onto Norah. Pale and skinny, Oscar is the kind of kid easily picked off in slaughter-ball.
C: NORAH
D: I brought fancy corn!
C: ROSE
D: How can you eat that stuff?
E: Looking for her purse
N: Norah and Oscar both jam a handful into their mouths.
C: ROSE
D: He'll be hyper all night.
N: Rose finds her purse and quickly puts on lipstick. She leans down and gives Oscar a kiss on the forehead.
C: ROSE
D: Be good.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 8. She turns to Norah.
C: ROSE
D: And no lobsterman stories. He had nightmares all week. Just use some common sense.
E: opening the door
C: NORAH
D: You're welcome.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Rose lies on her back being fucked. Her head nearly hits the headboard with each thrust.
C: ROSE
D: You want me?
N: Rose closes her eyes. Her head starts to thump the headboard.
C: MAC
D: Yeah... baby... I want... Oh...
E: Rhythmically
N: Mac comes.
S: INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Oscar and Norah lie in Oscar's little bed. Oscar holds the covers tight under his chin. Norah drinks a beer. There's a half eaten canister of `Fancy Corn' between them.
C: NORAH
D: He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there... somewhere... coming for him. And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox.
C: OSCAR
D: Why did he lick the mailbox?
C: NORAH
D: I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes.
C: OSCAR
D: Why wasn't he in school?
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 9.
C: NORAH
D: Are you gonna let me tell the story?
N: Oscar nods.
C: NORAH
D: An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming.
C: OSCAR
D: Maybe he didn't go to school because he had the ACD.
N: Norah looks at Oscar.
C: OSCAR
D: Sorry.
N: Norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down next to another empty.
C: NORAH
D: He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Curtains drawn in the cheap hotel room. Rose gets out of bed and pulls on her clothes. Mac watches for a moment, then rolls out of bed. He stops. Grimaces.
C: ROSE
D: Still sore?
N: Mac shakes his head and pretends not to be.
C: ROSE
D: I don't know why you did that.
C: MAC
D: You should hear the way he goes on about his lean body mass index bullshit. Drinking that antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme crap all the time.
N: Mac limps over to his clothes hanging over a chair. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 10.
C: ROSE
D: When was the last time you even played basketball?
C: MAC
D: He needed to be brought down a peg or two.
C: ROSE
D: I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him.
N: Rose smiles and Mac pretends to be offended.
C: MAC
D: I should introduce him to your sister.
C: ROSE
D: Norah and a cop? That would happen.
N: Mac shrugs and steps into his slacks.
C: MAC
D: We were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store. So they had this cleaning crew out there, right? You would not believe how much money they charge for that shit. It's ridiculous.
C: ROSE
D: With the dead body there?
C: MAC
D: Naw, the body's gone, it's just the blood and stuff.
C: ROSE
D: Sounds horrible.
N: Rose peels the backing off a nicotine patch and carefully sticks it on her arm.
C: MAC
D: You ask me it's a racket. You should get into that.
N: Rose slips on her blouse looks at Mac. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 11.
C: ROSE
D: You think that's all I can do? Clean other people's shit?
C: MAC
D: Come here.
E: He sighs
N: Rose steps toward him and eyes Mac as he buttons her blouse.
C: MAC
D: You know that's not what I think.
C: ROSE
D: I am gonna be a real estate agent.
N: Rose rubs the nicotine patch on her arm. Mac nods and smiles.
C: MAC
D: I know. With business cards.
S: INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans out the window and exhales, takes another toke. The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.
C: NORAH
D: It's about time. I thought your class got over at 9:30.
N: Rose looks at Oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch.
C: ROSE
D: Why isn't he in bed?
C: NORAH
D: Said he was scared. I think he was fakin' it though.
N: Rose fumbles in her purse and pulls out a ten-dollar bill.
C: NORAH
D: I'm not taking money.
C: ROSE
D: It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad told me about you getting fired.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 12. Norah makes a face like `great, here it comes.'
C: ROSE
D: What happened?
C: NORAH
D: Nothing.
C: ROSE
D: What, were you stoned or something?
N: Norah waves her hand dismissively.
C: NORAH
D: It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head.
C: ROSE
D: I thought you liked Mr. Kim.
C: NORAH
D: Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God.
C: ROSE
D: When are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for--
C: NORAH
D: Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody.
C: ROSE
D: Shut up and take the ten.
N: Norah takes the ten. Rose looks at the TV.
C: NORAH
D: There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress.
N: Rose looks at Norah.
C: ROSE
D: Any pie?
N: Norah smiles and opens the door to leave.
C: NORAH
D: Completely pie free.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 13.
S: INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
N: Rose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another MOLLY MAID wipes down the last window. Through the window, a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks toward the house with shopping bags in hand.
C: MOLLY MAID
D: The lady's here.
N: Rose nods and heads downstairs.
S: INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
N: PAULA DATZMAN-MEAD sets her bags down on the table and fishes a checkbook from her purse. Rose enters with the vacuum cleaner in tow.
C: ROSE
D: We're all finished. Since it's our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally we'll alternate those weekly. Nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didn't bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra...
C: PAULA
D: Rose? Rose Lorkowski?
N: Startled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time.
C: PAULA
D: It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading squad junior year.
N: Recognition punches Rose in the face.
C: ROSE
D: Paula Datzman. Wow.
N: Awkward silence.
C: ROSE
D: How are you?

N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 14.
C: ROSE
D: Congratulations.
C: PAULA
D: Thanks. We're expecting our second in a couple of months.

C: PAULA
D: How are you? You look just the same.
C: ROSE
D: I'm good. Really good!
C: PAULA
D: God, I always envied you so much. Head cheerleader... dating the quarterback... So did you and Mac end up getting married?
C: ROSE
D: Nope. No. I'm not sure...I think he ended up marrying Heather Volkman.
E: Awkward silence
C: PAULA
D: Wow. Well it's so good to see you. Let me get your info so I can send you an invite to the baby shower.
N: Paula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to Rose.
C: PAULA
D: It'll be like a big reunion. The whole gang from high school will be there.
N: Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper.
C: PAULA
D: So what are you doing now?
N: Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question.
C: ROSE
D: I... I've just gotten my real estate license, and so...
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 15.
C: PAULA
D: Real estate?
C: ROSE
D: Yeah, this... this is just kind of a temporary thing and I'm about to just really phase over into the real estate full time.
C: PAULA
D: You're kidding, I'm in real estate!
N: Paula pulls a business card from her purse and hands it to Rose. The card has a picture of Paula's smiling face.
C: PAULA
D: With Long and Foster. Who are you with?
C: ROSE
D: Me? Um. You know, I haven't really decided yet. I might check out Long and Foster.
N: Paula nods. Uncomfortable.
C: PAULA
D: Maybe you'll just be independent.
C: ROSE
D: Yeah. Maybe.
N: They grasp for something to say. They fail.
C: PAULA
D: What was that about the laundry?
S: EXT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - DAY
N: Rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies out to a rusted Nissan Sentra with a Molly Maid door magnet. She throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch, starts to close it, then stops. Rose walks to the side of the car, peels off the Molly Maid magnet and throws that in as well. She looks at the Datzman- Mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame. She gets into the car and cries. Her cell phone rings. She digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 16.
C: ROSE
D: Hello.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Oscar sits outside the counselor's office on a bench. He cranes his neck to watch the secretary typing forms.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Rose sits nervously across from the school COUNSELOR, a serious man in his mid forties and a TEACHER with cotton candy hair. The man speaks first.
C: COUNSELOR
D: It's not just this incident. There have been several episodes over the past year where Oscar has... has engaged in disruptive behavior.
N: Rose shifts her eyes from the counselor to the teacher and back to the counselor.
C: COUNSELOR
D: There was the incident in gym class.

C: COUNSELOR
D: Now it's... licking.

C: TEACHER
D: I will not tolerate it. I will not tolerate that behavior in my classroom.
C: COUNSELOR

N: Rose looks even more confused.
C: TEACHER
D: First it was the pencil sharpener. Then the aquarium.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The secretary stops typing and offers a sympathetic glance to Oscar. He capitalizes on the moment by licking the wall.
C: COUNSELOR

N: The secretary recoils and returns to her typing.
S: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The counselor leans forward with genuine concern.
C: COUNSELOR

C: TEACHER
D: He licked my leg.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 18-19.
S: INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Oscar finds Joe asleep on the Lazy Boy. He snores in that scary sleep apnea way ­ holding his breath between snores. Oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf of a book case. He pulls up a chair to investigate. The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. Behind it, dusty books about birds. Oscar grabs the binoculars and climbs down. Oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too far apart. Oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking through only one lens. He focuses on his grandpa's nose hair. Joe wakes.
C: JOE
D: Where'd you get those?
C: OSCAR
D: Up there.
N: Oscar points to the book shelf. Something sad stirs in Joe.
C: JOE
D: Come here.
N: Oscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's small face. Better.
C: JOE
D: Those were your grandma's. She'd watch birds with those.
N: Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and clunks them against a lamp in the process.
C: JOE
D: Hey, hey. Careful.
N: Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars.
C: JOE
D: Why don't we put those away.
N: Oscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow. Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 19A.
C: OSCAR
D: Why can't I play with them?
C: JOE
D: Because it's not a toy. It's a scientific instrument.
N: Oscar's disappointed.
C: JOE
D: You can play with them when I'm around to supervise.
C: OSCAR
D: You're around now.
C: JOE
D: I'm tired now.
N: Joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them back on the shelf.
S: INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Rose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish.
C: ROSE
D: Well I'm not putting him in special ed. I'll figure out a way to put him in private school before I do that.
C: NORAH
D: Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school?
C: JOE
D: Who's going to private school?
N: Rose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way.
C: ROSE
D: Nobody dad, we're just talking.
C: JOE
D: Oscar get suspended again?
N: Yes, that's it. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 19B.
C: JOE
D: The kid's a little strange. What? That's against the law now? It's not like he's out killing kittens or any damn thing. I swear everyone's so damn uptight these days.
S: 29A INT. FAIR AND SQUARE - DAY 29A

C: ROSE
D: What do you mean `no thanks'? What else do you have to do? You don't have a job. You don't go to school. What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life?

C: NORAH
D: You are so out of touch.
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY
N: A large bellied SUPERINTENDENT leads Rose and Norah up a flight of stairs. Beads of sweat drip from his doughy face.

D: Found it.
E: O.S.
S: INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
N: Norah and Rose stand frozen at the threshold. They are awe struck by the horrible scene in front of them. Blooms of splattered blood dry on tile walls. It gathers in sticky brown lines around grout. The mirror is broken. The shower curtain hangs half torn.
C: NORAH
D: Think they loved each other?
C: ROSE
D: Yeah.
S: INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER
N: Hands pull on yellow cleaning gloves. Pinkish foam slides down Norah's glove as she scrubs bloody grout with a toothbrush. Metal shower rings CLINK against the metal bar as Rose pulls down the shower curtain. A rag is wrung out in a bucket of reddish water. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 22. Rose and Norah clean in silence. Reverent but detached. The way you would act at a stranger's funeral.

N: Norah puts blood spattered towels into a washing machine. She spots a dish on the dryer filled with pennies and buttons and other odds and ends. She fishes out a PINK CANDY HEART. It reads, `Luv U 4 ever'. Norah pockets the candy.

N: Joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a stool. The bartender pours him a beer. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 23.
C: BARTENDER
D: See where old Miller's house sold?
N: Joe nods. A grizzled REGULAR nearby looks over at Joe.
C: REGULAR
D: Bet you could get a chunk of change for your place. You should cash out now before the market turns sour.
N: Joe shakes his head.
C: JOE
D: I'm not selling my house. No way. I don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. I got history in that house. You think they understand about history?
C: REGULAR
D: Still... How much commission you get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to-
C: JOE
D: Hey, the corn's good. Really good. Not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon.
N: The bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space between Joe and the grizzled regular.
C: JOE
D: It'll get there. Takes time to get to know the market. Develop a relationship with the buyers. But it'll get there. Who doesn't like popcorn for Christ's sake.
C: REGULAR
D: My brother-in-law's in sales.
N: The regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn.
C: REGULAR
D: Last year he buys a cow.
C: JOE
D: Why would you buy a cow?
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 24.
C: REGULAR
D: Not a live cow. A whole butchered cow from a rancher. On the hoof they call it.
C: JOE
D: Mm hmm.
N: Joe looks at him with renewed interest.
C: REGULAR
D: He sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants. Direct. Made a killing.
N: The grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers.
C: JOE
D: What'd he do with the brains and intestines?
N: Regular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning.
C: JOE
D: So he cuts out the middle man. Not a bad idea.
N: Joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over.
C: JOE
D: Course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. Like... shrimp.
S: EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - SIX DAYS LATER - MORNING
N: Another day in paradise.
S: INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

D: Apparently some crazy bag lady squatter person died and--

N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 26. Norah shakes her head in frustration.

D: How long is this gonna take?
C: ROSE
D: All we have to do is go in and throw everything away. Cake.
S: INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
N: Rose and Norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of decayed flesh splashes them in the face. They lift their T- shirts up over their noses and walk inside. Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates. Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ. She darts to another room and retches.
C: ROSE
D: Great, now we're gonna have to clean that up too.

D: Maybe if you'd gotten me a coffee.
E: without turning
S: INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
N: Rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that only her eyes are exposed. She strains to open a window that's been painted shut. She bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge. Rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of the window in an attempt to break the seal. Rose grows more desperate with each failed effort.
S: EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
N: Norah watches Rose struggle with the window. Pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick. Birdseed tumbles on to her shoe. She turns. A weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and tosses birdseed to the pigeons.
C: NORAH
D: I'm standing here.
N: Norah looks back up to Rose still struggling with the window. Finally, Rose muscles it open and throws Norah an angry look of triumph. There!

N: Joe and Oscar drive to a potential sale.
S: INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

N: Rose shrugs. Looks around. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 27A.
C: ROSE
D: Dumpster?
N: Rose and Norah lift the mattress and drag it to the door. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 28.
S: EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
N: Rose and Norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to the dumpster. It is a clumsy process. The thing tips and falls on Norah.
S: INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY
N: Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business. Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families. Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to Joe and the MANAGER.
C: MANAGER
D: You're telling me this Fancy Corn stuff is some kind of health food?
C: JOE
D: Well, it's a candy... and a health food. Absolutely. Absolutely.
C: MANAGER
D: Yeah, I don't know. We don't have much more shelf space.
N: Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a Twizzler package.
C: JOE
D: Glycerol monostearate? What is that? I can't even read that.
N: Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the ingredients.
C: JOE
D: Read that.
N: The manager leans close.
C: MANAGER
D: High fructose--
C: JOE
D: No. The first thing listed. The number one ingredient.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 28A.
C: MANAGER
D: Corn.
C: JOE
D: Exactly. Corn. Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake.
N: The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions himself next to the girl.
C: OSCAR
D: Do you know if they sell fancy corn here?
N: The girl looks at him suspiciously.
C: OSCAR
D: Do you even know what fancy corn is?
C: GIRL
D: Yes.
C: OSCAR
D: Well, do they sell it here?
C: GIRL
D: I dunno.
N: She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar.
C: OSCAR
D: I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength.
C: GIRL
D: That's stupid.
C: OSCAR
D: It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength.
N: The girl gives Oscar a long stare.
C: GIRL
D: I don't believe you.
C: OSCAR
D: I don't care if you do or not.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 28B. The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mother's shirt.
C: JOE
D: I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now.
C: MANAGER
D: Like I said, I already put in all the orders I want for this year.
N: Just then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager.
C: GIRL'S MOTHER
D: Excuse me. Do you carry something called fancy corn?
N: Joe looks at Oscar. Oscar smiles. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 29-30.
S: INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
N: Much progress has been made on the trailer. Rose and Norah work on the last remaining piles of trash.
C: NORAH
D: It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away.
N: Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it. Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the ID looks street-worn and crazy.
C: NORAH
D: I bet this is her.
N: Rose sweeps. Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon. Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school photos. Each photo is of a different grade. Norah flips through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.
C: NORAH
D: Wow, look at this.
N: Norah holds the senior photo next to the ID. The resemblance between the two is clear.
C: NORAH
D: Think it's her daughter?
N: Rose looks. Shrugs.
C: NORAH
D: Shouldn't we do something? Try to find her or something?
C: ROSE
D: That's none of your business, Norah.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 31. Rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers. She screams and drops the bag. A giant ball of maggots writhes at her feet.
C: ROSE
D: Hand me that.
E: pointing
N: Norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to Rose.
C: NORAH
D: What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't you want to know if this was mom?
N: Norah looks closely at the I.D. as Rose deposits trash and maggots into the garbage bin. The comparison angers Rose.
C: ROSE
D: Mom was never like this. Mom would never have been like this.
N: Norah thinks about that and looks back at the I.D.
C: NORAH
D: I wonder how she died?
C: ROSE
D: Damnit Norah, we still have a lot of shit to do here. Are you just gonna talk?
S: EXT. CANDY STORE - DAY
N: Joe and Oscar roll a handcart strapped with Fancy Corn canisters through the parking lot to the car.
C: JOE
D: That was real good. You're a natural. You got the timing, you got the nerve. You're a real sharp cookie, you know that?
C: OSCAR
D: No I'm not. I'm stupid.
C: JOE
D: You're not stupid. What are you saying? You're not stupid.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 32.
C: OSCAR
D: Yes I am. They want to put me in retard classes.
C: JOE
D: Don't say that.
C: OSCAR
D: What?
C: JOE
D: It's those teachers who are retarded. You're probably just too advanced for those classes. You're bored. Do you get bored in class?
C: OSCAR
D: Yeah.
C: JOE
D: See. You're too smart! And those teachers just don't know how to handle you. You're probably a goddamn genius.
C: OSCAR
D: You think so?
C: JOE
D: I know so!
S: EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - DAY
N: Weeds grow in the yard of the small house.
S: INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY
N: Norah empties the contents of the fanny pack onto her bed. She examines the photos and picks up what appears to be a senior photo. She turns it over and sees, written on the back, LYNN WISEMAN - 1998.
S: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Rose's Sentra is again parked next to the blue Camry. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 33.
S: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Same room as before. Same curtains drawn. Mac unzips Rose's skirt and kisses her neck.
C: ROSE
D: It was so disgusting. I mean the smell, you would not believe.
N: Mac's in the sex zone. He unbuttons his shirt and tunes out all those distracting words tumbling from Rose's mouth. Rose, animated, slips her skirt off and tosses it aside.
C: ROSE
D: There were flies everywhere and, really, the smell. I can't even describe it.
N: Mac's shoes hit the floor with a thud. He sets his belt and gun on the dresser.
C: MAC
D: Shhhh.
N: Rose pulls her shirt over her head. Mac kisses her belly.
C: ROSE
D: But, after we finished... you woulda never even known. We took all that away... made it right.
N: Mac pulls off his pants. Rose hangs her bra on the back of the chair and slips off her undies.
C: MAC
D: I can't believe you... I mean, I feel like I got you into this mess.
N: Her sense of pride wilts. Her hand instinctively reaches up to massage the nicotine patch on her arm.
C: ROSE
D: No, I--
C: MAC
D: Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real estate classes. Okay?
N: Rose looks at Mac. Shrugs. Mac smiles. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 34.
C: MAC
D: We'll get you your license and then get you a little photo in the real estate section. You can drive people around all day and talk about... Gosh, what would you talk about? Crown molding?
E: Suddenly very serious
N: Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke.
C: ROSE
D: Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding.
N: The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac.
C: ROSE
D: Property easements, square footage, appliances...
N: Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk. He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow.
C: MAC
D: You're holding out on me.
N: Rose rolls her eyes and laughs.
C: ROSE
D: Freak.
C: MAC
D: Say it. Come on. One time.
N: She smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents.
C: ROSE
D: Curb appeal.
N: Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck. He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand. It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where his wedding ring isn't. Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring.
C: ROSE
D: Why'd you pick her?
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 35. Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades.
C: MAC
D: You know it wasn't like that.
C: ROSE
D: How was it like?
N: He takes a step back.
C: MAC
D: Are you going to do that?
C: ROSE
D: No.
C: MAC
D: If this is going to get all heavy--
C: ROSE
D: No.
N: Rose turns around and kisses Mac. One of those soft, teasing kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear.
S: EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY
N: Rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area and double checks the address on a scrap of paper.
S: INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY
N: Rose and Norah enter this no frills operation. Cinder block walls and concrete floors. A small TV on the front counter offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up. As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost.
C: ROSE
D: Winston?
N: WINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full lips, looks up.
C: ROSE
D: I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Rose Lorkowski.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 36. Rose sticks out her right hand. Winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He clumsily shakes her hand with his left.
C: ROSE
D: So, our situation is...
N: On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and Norah both turn and look at the TV. The waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word. Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues.
C: ROSE
D: We're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult...
C: NORAH
D: Smelly.
N: Rose looks at Norah and nods.
C: ROSE
D: Really smelly job where the lady had died and they didn't find her for a while and it was really...
C: NORAH
D: Stinky.
C: ROSE
D: The odor was really strong.
C: WINSTON
D: A decomp.
N: Rose smiles a little too enthusiastically.
C: ROSE
D: Yeah, a decomp!
N: Winston motions them to follow him through the store. He indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice.
C: WINSTON
D: General purpose cleaners, extraction cleaners, odor control. We carry both the Winzyme and the DR 450. Disinfectants, stain removers and shampoos.
E: MORE
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 37. WINSTON (cont'd) Steamers, buffers, foggers, that kinda stuff's in there, for rent or purchase. Quick absorbing sawdust, good for vomit. The tour ends at the back corner where respirators, safety glasses, gloves and Tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves.
C: WINSTON
D: And you've got your personal protective gear back here.
N: The door BEEPS as it opens. CARL SWANSON walks in wearing his `Above and Beyond' polo shirt. Winston returns to the counter.
S: INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY
N: Carl grabs a case of disinfectant and sets it on the counter. Winston pulls out some paperwork.
C: CARL
D: You hear there're a couple of amateurs poaching jobs?
N: Winston shakes his head. Rose and Norah make their way to the counter with arms full of supplies and stand within earshot of Carl and Winston.
C: CARL
D: Bruce said they took a decomp for five hundred bucks. What do you wanna bet they threw all that shit right in the dumpster.
N: Norah nudges Rose. Carl pays and Rose and Norah watch him leave. They step up and set their supplies on the counter. As Winston rings them up, Rose notices the shellacked puzzle picture of a big white cat on the wall.
C: ROSE
D: Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a hard one. I think I got lost in the white and gave up.
N: Rose flashes a `captain of the cheerleading squad' smile.
C: WINSTON
D: Fifty-eight twenty-four.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 38.
C: ROSE
D: You like cats?
N: Winston looks squarely at Rose and steps into the back room.
C: NORAH
D: Great. You freaked him out.
C: ROSE
D: I asked him if he liked cats.
N: Winston returns with several books and pamphlets. Hazmat Guidelines, Biohazard Recovery and Disposal, etc.
C: WINSTON
D: Bring these back.
S: INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY
N: Rose drives while Norah scans one of the books.

D: Turns out it's against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster. Who knew?
N: Rose processes the visit.
C: NORAH
D: How perfect was he with the one arm?
C: ROSE
D: Hmm?
C: NORAH
D: The creepy guy. Do you think he was born like that?
C: ROSE
D: I didn't think he was creepy.
C: NORAH
D: Dude, he has one arm.
C: ROSE
D: They think we're just a couple of hacks.
C: NORAH
D: We are a couple of hacks.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 39. Norah looks out the window.

D: You have class tonight?
E: sarcastically
N: Rose smiles uncomfortably.
C: ROSE
D: Mortgage lenders and financing.
N: Norah shakes her head in disgust.
C: NORAH
D: Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her.
N: Rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering wheel. Norah gets out of the car.
C: NORAH
D: God, you're pathetic.
N: Norah slams the door and watches Rose drive off. Norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN. Just then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 40.

C: NORAH
D: What?
C: LYNN
D: Why are you following me?
C: NORAH
D: I'm not following you.
C: LYNN
D: You are following me!
N: Lynn freezes for a moment. It seems she isn't even breathing. Her anger twists into fear.
C: LYNN
D: Aren't you?
N: Norah remains silent. Lynn paces back and forth.
C: LYNN
D: Oh no.
C: NORAH
D: What?
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 41.
C: LYNN
D: Shit! This is not happening.
N: Norah is uncomfortable. Lynn spins around to face Norah.
C: LYNN
D: Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I thought you were following me.
C: NORAH
D: That's all right.
N: Lynn steps closer.
C: LYNN
D: You think I'm crazy.
C: NORAH
D: No. No I don't.
C: LYNN
D: I'm not crazy.
C: NORAH
D: It was a mistake. No big deal.
N: Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens.
C: LYNN
D: It's not moving.
C: NORAH
D: Let's press the alarm button.
N: Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud quick ring. They wait for something to happen. An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises. Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small, illustrated hands before her.
C: LYNN
D: Go to the university?
C: NORAH
D: Me? No.
N: Lynn leans close and checks out the book. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 42.
C: NORAH
D: Hobby...
N: Lynn sizes Norah up.
C: NORAH
D: There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla.
C: LYNN
D: I think I've seen something on--
N: Norah nods.
C: NORAH
D: KoKo.
C: LYNN
D: Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.
N: Norah offers a sad nod.
C: NORAH
D: Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken.
N: A KNOCKING sound reverberates through the elevator.
C: LYNN
D: Kind of weird, don't you think? Teaching a gorilla to talk. Probably, gorillas aren't supposed to talk.
C: NORAH
D: That's what's so cool about it.
N: Lynn takes a long bold look at Norah. Norah sweats. The elevator moves.
C: LYNN
D: I'm sorry again about the...
C: NORAH
D: No, don't... it's fine.
N: Lynn lightly touches the crook of Norah's arm. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 43.
C: LYNN
D: You've got nice veins.
N: Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood Services."
C: LYNN
D: You should give blood.
N: Lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a rack. She glances back with a smile just as the doors close.

D: Oh, excellent.
C: ROSE
D: God, do people even use those anymore?
C: OSCAR
D: What is it?

C: ROSE
D: No.
C: OSCAR
D: Try the CB!
N: Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static. Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed. She clicks the CB off.

C: NORAH
D: Yeah well, what about Dad?
C: ROSE

N: As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and on to Norah's leg.
C: NORAH
D: Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. Don't you teach this kid anything?

N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 53.

D: I'm glad to see you're doing a little homework. A lot of people, you know, they think they can just jump in to this, make lots of money. But, they don't know what they're doing. No idea. They're not professional and that makes us all look bad.
E: smiles
C: ROSE
D: Well, we're not like that. I just have to complete this seminar and we're certified.

D: That makes total sense. Why didn't I think of that?
C: CARL
D: You just figure all this shit out as you go. Experience.

D: It's not how I thought it'd be. I thought it'd be gross.
N: Rose stops. Reflects. Turns to Carl.

N: Rose looks at Norah with concern.
C: OSCAR
D: Jeremy said I was a bastard. What does that mean?
N: Rose has no idea how to respond. Norah turns to face Oscar.
C: NORAH
D: It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you.
N: Oscar looks to Rose and then back to Norah. Rose's phone rings. She answers it, relieved for the distraction
C: ROSE
D: Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well, I'm glad you liked the Fancy Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah.

C: ROSE
D: We're the cleaning service.
C: MRS. DAVIS

C: MRS. DAVIS
D: Yes dear, I think I would.

S: INT. BRICK RANCHER - LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture of antiques and things that are simply old.

N: Norah enters the red splattered room. A walker lies on its side next to a blood-soaked rug. Golden sunlight pours through the windows. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 58. A yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee table. The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'.

D: So he's in heaven?
N: Rose nods.
C: OSCAR
D: Maybe we could let her use our CB and she could talk to him.

C: OSCAR
D: Maybe he would hear her.
N: Rose smiles. Doesn't seem like the moment to correct him.

C: ROSE
D: What are you talking about?

D: No. It's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. It's a growth niche industry right now ­ highly technical and competitive.
C: MOUSEY
D: What does that mean ­ biohazard removal whatever?
C: ROSE
D: A lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. So, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary.
N: Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.
C: ROSE
D: People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 91.
C: PAULA
D: Oh my God.
C: ROSE
D: Course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um... professional techniques. Like I said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know... methodology behind it.
N: Pleased with herself, Rose grabs another cheese puff.
C: ROSE
D: Real growth industry.
C: MOUSEY
D: I can't imagine. You like doing it?
C: ROSE
D: Yeah.
N: Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.
C: ROSE
D: I do. We come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. They've lost somebody. The circumstances are different but that's the same.
N: As Rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. Relaxes. That brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.
C: ROSE
D: And we help them. In this one small way... we help.
N: Rose is lost in her thoughts. Something profound is shifting.
C: MOUSEY
D: Sounds horrible to me.
C: PAULA
D: I believe I'd vomit.
S: INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Norah stuffs bedding in biohazard bags and wraps the mattress in plastic sheeting. A fan clanks at the window. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 92. Norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door. It tips and Norah bangs her hand against the door frame.
C: NORAH
D: Shit.
N: The incense falls from the dresser. Norah finally muscles the mattress through the doorway.
S: EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON
N: Norah drags the mattress to the driveway. A wisp of smoke curls from the window behind her. As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW rise from the bushes. She investigates. A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.
C: NORAH
D: Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind?
N: The kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for a meow. Norah is powerless to resist.
C: NORAH
D: It's okay.
N: As Norah leans down to pick up the kitten, it darts from the bushes and heads toward the road.
C: NORAH
D: No, no, no.
N: Norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and disappears behind a house. After a moment, Norah emerges from behind the house. She coos at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her. Norah runs toward the house.

N: A PEPPY WOMAN with the enthusiasm of a game show contestant stands on a stool and waves her arms. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 93.
C: PEPPY

C: MOUSEY
D: Oh I love this game.
C: PEPPY
D: You all can--
N: Somewhere a cell phone rings. The peppy woman stops and looks at Rose. Rose digs into her purse and pulls out the offending phone. She checks caller ID. It's Norah. She cuts it off.
C: ROSE
D: Sorry.
N: Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start distributing the diapers.
C: PEPPY
D: You can look, smell and taste. The first to identify all five correctly wins!

E: over the phone
C: NORAH
D: FUCK!

S: INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Rose watches with a detached expression as Floral clad women stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 94. It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula.
C: ROSE
D: You know what? I... uh...Actually, there's somewhere I need to be.
C: PAULA
D: Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're just starting the games.

N: Rose drives as the sun sinks into the desert landscape.
S: EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror. Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones on. Kitten curled up in her lap. Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door and slides out of the van.
C: NORAH
D: It was an accident.
N: Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable consequences of the scene before her.
C: ROSE

C: NORAH
D: It was an accident.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 95.
C: ROSE
D: How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ!
C: NORAH
D: Jesus Rose, Calm down.
N: Rose throws her keys at Norah. Norah turns to shield the kitten. The keys thump her arm. Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be.
C: NORAH
D: Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me.
N: Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose.
C: ROSE
D: This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You.
C: NORAH
D: Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing.
C: ROSE
D: I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility.
C: NORAH
D: I am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit. Why don't you take a look at you're own life, huh? You're a real inspiration.
C: ROSE
D: Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 96.
C: NORAH
D: Fuck you. I'm done being your excuse.
N: Norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from Rose, the fire and everything. The kitten clings to her shirt.
C: ROSE
D: Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away.
N: Without turning or breaking her stride, Norah flips off Rose. Rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches the firemen hose down the house.
S: EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT

C: ROSE
D: You know?
C: WINSTON
D: Carl told me.
C: ROSE
D: How does he...?
N: Realization slaps.
C: ROSE
D: That's just great. We burnt down a client's house. How do you get around that?
C: WINSTON
D: Insurance?
N: Rose shrugs.
C: ROSE
D: I figured we'd wait and get the better rate once I got certified.
C: WINSTON
D: Didn't you go to that?
N: Rose doesn't respond. She slowly blinks and lets her new reality ooze over her.
C: ROSE
D: There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know.
N: Winston looks at Rose. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 98.
C: ROSE
D: Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at that.
N: Winston looks away.
C: ROSE
D: And cheering. I was pretty good at that too.
C: WINSTON
D: Cheering is good.
C: ROSE
D: Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd think.

N: Rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.
C: MAC
D: Rose?
E: O.S.

C: MAC
D: Hey beautiful.
N: Mac smiles for the both of them.
C: MAC
D: I was starting to think you were on a date or something.
N: Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.
C: MAC
D: You okay?
N: Rose nods.
C: ROSE
D: Long day.
C: MAC
D: Can I come in?
C: ROSE
D: It's not really a good time.
N: Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.
C: MAC
D: I got you something.
N: Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.
C: MAC
D: It's for your business cards. You put `em in there and, I don't know... impress people.
N: He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.
C: ROSE
D: It's beautiful.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 100. Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.
C: MAC
D: You don't like it?
C: ROSE
D: No, I like it very much.
N: Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.
C: ROSE
D: It's just this thing we're doing.
C: MAC
D: Come on, let's not do that.
N: But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.
C: ROSE
D: I don't want this anymore.
N: Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.
C: MAC
D: So that's it?
N: Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.
C: MAC
D: That's it then.
N: Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he nods and Rose watches him walk away.

N: Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn. Lynn sees Norah and looks away. GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.) Is this your first time donating? Norah turns to the GUY IN THE WHITE COAT addressing her. He holds a clipboard.

C: NORAH
D: What's that supposed to mean?
C: LYNN
D: Do I really need to spell it out?
N: Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn.
C: NORAH
D: Here.
N: Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can. A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.

C: OSCAR
D: Are you coming to my party?

C: JOE
D: That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks.
E: MORE
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 103. JOE (cont'd) They just didn't have the heft you want in a pair of lenses. No weight. No history. Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.
C: JOE
D: These here are the real deal. I want you to have them.
N: Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't see this coming. But still.
C: ROSE
D: Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks.
N: Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.
C: JOE

S: INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - DAY

C: NORAH
D: Winston cleans up pretty good.
N: GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 104. Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.
C: NORAH
D: I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that. So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.
E: pause
N: Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.
C: NORAH
D: Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay?
N: It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.
C: ROSE
D: God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse.
N: Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.
C: NORAH
D: I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose.
C: ROSE
D: I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job.
N: Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault. GREEN REVISION 3/5/07 104A.

N: Shrug.
C: ROSE
D: How?

D: Don't sell the van.
C: ROSE
D: Have to. Can't afford the payment.

C: JOE
D: Just don't sell the van yet. Okay?
N: Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm he lifts the binoculars to his face.

C: WINSTON
D: Not really.

N: As if in a dream Rose watches the image of her mother disappear off screen. She smiles.
S: EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag. She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at her. She looks up to see the CB on. Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment before taking the handset.
C: ROSE
D: Hello? Mom?
N: Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming.
C: ROSE
D: Oscar turned eight today. We had this whole big thing at Hinkle's. Winston came. After dinner Oscar and Norah got a high score on Centipede and put in ASS as their initials and got in trouble by the manager. I don't know if you're in heaven or what.

With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls. It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting. Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.
