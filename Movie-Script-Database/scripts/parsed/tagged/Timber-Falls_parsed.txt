T: FADE IN:
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1
N: CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks. CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth. CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together. CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt. IRON SPIKES ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS. FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table. AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES. OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD- CURDLING SCREAM cries out. The Young Woman's breathing intensifies. She watches the light bulb, listens to the screams. The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop. Peace for a moment. But she knows that won't last.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #2
N: A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess. CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH, sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by... A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands. His left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together again... SPARKS FLY.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: Please-please stop. D-don't.
N: The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side. ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1
N: CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS. The screams of the Young Man echo through the room. The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and... Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up. The light bulb returns again to normal. The screams stop. The Young Woman gives a final hard push and... FREES HER RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound. No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #2
N: CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and... ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS.
S: INT. CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1
N: The Young Woman's left hand POPS free. Blood oozes out. OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN. She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain. Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can. The SCREAMS STOP. Lights return to normal. Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds.
S: INT. HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2
N: The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear. It is. We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right. The door across from her is slightly ajar... YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the door and the Young Man. The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her. THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself. The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words "I Love you". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as... LIGHTS FLICKER. OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again. The Young Woman quickens her pace. The SCREAMS drown out any sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP... The lights return to NORMAL. The Young Man STOPS screaming. The place goes silent. The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP... A LOUD CREAK RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES. TORTURE ROOM #2-- The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound. HALLWAY, STAIRS-- The Young Woman holds her breath. Did he hear her? TORTURE ROOM #2-- A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention), rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon.
C: YOUNG MAN
D: SARAH! RUN!
N: HALLWAY, STAIRS-- Sarah (Young Woman) bolts up the remaining steps. TORTURE ROOM #2-- The Concealed Figure rushes for the door. In pursuit.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. FOREST - SUNSET
N: SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs, anything in her way. Not too far behind... THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden) follows her. WEAPON IN HAND. SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips, falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears... THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance. SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away.
S: EXT. FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET
N: Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side... SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom, 200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby. Before Sarah can fully digest the situation... THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in his hand. Anticipating its use. Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier. Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do? The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other. The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over... AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD mixes with the water turning it a deep RED. CUE TITLE: TIMBER FALLS...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. HIGHWAY - WEST VIRGINIA - DAY (HELICOPTER 2ND UNIT)
N: A black four-door VW Passat cruises the interstate. A Gortex duffel is strapped to the roof. I/E. PASSAT (MOVING) - DAY MIKE WARREN, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to kill, sits at the wheel. Even a flashy pair of sunglasses can't mask the twinkle in his eye. SHERYL JAMES, late 20s, rides shotgun. This beauty's got it all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile. An opened bag of chips sit in her lap. A couple of Diet Cokes in the cup-holders. She cradles a cellphone MP3 player.
C: MIKE
D: Come on, hit me.
C: SHERYL
D: Chill...I gotta find -- alright.
E: Flipping through tunes
C: MIKE
D: You got one?
N: Sheryl hits the "Play" button.
C: MIKE
D: "Warning Shots", Thievery Corporation.
N: Mike grins. Sheryl rolls her eyes.
C: MIKE
D: Come on. Next one.
N: Sheryl scrolls again, hits play.
C: MIKE
D: "Bullets" by the Editors.
N: Sheryl frowns. Mike grins and shoots her a wink.
C: SHERYL
D: You loaded these songs. You don't need to be so impressed with yourself.
C: MIKE
D: I know I don't have to be.
C: SHERYL
D: I haven't even heard of half these bands.
C: MIKE
D: It's called good music. You should try to familiarize yourself with it, instead of listening to the crap you do.
C: SHERYL
D: I listen to crap?
C: MIKE
D: Hurts me to be the one to tell you.
C: SHERYL
D: I'm sure it does.
C: MIKE
D: You gotta be more like me, baby. Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm looking for the next Beatles, U2 or Radiohead.
N: Sheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles.
C: SHERYL
D: So, where does this band fall into that group?
N: The music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, "I WANT TO BE A COWBOY" blares.
C: SHERYL
D: Fresh, new or cutting edge?
N: Mike immediately begins to backtrack.
C: MIKE
D: How'd that get on there?
C: SHERYL
D: You loaded the songs. You tell me?
C: MIKE
D: Must be a mistake.
C: SHERYL
D: Says here you've listened to it 86 times.
N: Busted.
C: SHERYL
D: Is this true? Have you always wanted to be a cowboy?
N: Sheryl spies more...
C: SHERYL
D: You also got "Men Without Hats" greatest hits? I didn't know they qualified for a greatest hits album. Can you break me off a little "Safety Dance"?
N: Mike reaches for the MP3 player.
C: MIKE
D: Okay, give me that.
N: The Passat speeds past a "West Virginia" state sign. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 7.
S: EXT. NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - DAY
N: The sun BURNS above. The Passat turns into the park.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY
N: The Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. Next to the lot is the Ranger Station.
S: INT. RANGER BASE STATION - DAY
N: Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant bear, fill in the gaps. Mike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor. SAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike wait. And wait. Then...
C: MIKE
D: Good morning.
N: Sam holds up a "wait a second" finger. After a beat...
C: SAM
D: Now what can I do you two for?
N: Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc.
C: MIKE
D: Well...ah...
C: SAM
D: First time here and you're not quite sure where to begin.
N: Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier. ANGLE ON - There are pictures, an Emergency Contact Information, Guided Tour Info, etc.
C: SAM
D: Something like that.
C: SHERYL
D: Precisely like that.
N: Sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort. As he digs around for something... SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 8. Sheryl notices, on the board... ANGLE ON - A flier for a young missing couple. Below that... ANGLE ON - A photo of a girl: "Sarah Travers"(from the opening scene). Sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms with Mike at the desk.
C: SAM
D: Get you started with one of these.
N: Sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple.
C: SAM
D: How long you folks hiking for?
C: MIKE
D: Two days. Heading out early Sunday.
C: SAM
D: Well, if you move at a decent clip, you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow. Should still give you time to take it all in and make it down.
C: SHERYL
D: Any particular path?
C: SAM
D: You folks experienced hikers?
C: MIKE
D: We've done some ah--
C: SHERYL
D: No. Nothing like this.
E: interrupting
C: SAM
D: For first-timers, I recommend either Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.
C: SHERYL
D: Donner Trail? As in "The Donner Party?"
C: SAM
D: I'm not sure of the name's origin. They're the two paths we regularly patrol. Something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.
C: MIKE
D: Where do we camp?
C: SAM
D: Unless it says not to, you can set up where you like. Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. Oh, and this here's bear country. They're not animals to fool with. You see one, you head the other way, especially if he's feeding. If the bear thinks you're getting in the way of his food, that's all she wrote.
N: Sheryl warily eyes the stuffed Bear in the station.
C: SHERYL
D: Great.
E: Sarcastic
C: SAM
D: You got yourself a first aid kit?
C: MIKE
D: Nurse Betty here's my first aid kit.
N: Sam looks confused...
C: SHERYL
D: Don't mind him. I'm a nurse.
C: SAM
D: Good for you. The question was, do you have a first aid kit?
C: SHERYL
D: Yes, we have a first aid kit.
C: SAM
D: Great, see how easy that was. It's off-season, park's pretty quiet. Even more than usual. You may run into a few locals, but--
E: Moving on
C: SHERYL
D: People live up here?
C: SAM
D: We have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home. Most of `em are friendly. Respect their land and they'll respect you.
N: Mike twangs and air banjos, "Dueling Banjos" from `Deliverance.' Sam is not amused. Sheryl fights her temptation to laugh.
C: MIKE
D: Sorry.
C: SAM
D: Base is just outside, to the left. At about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path.
E: Moving on
C: MIKE
D: Thanks.
N: Mike and Sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit.
S: EXT. RANGER BASE STATION - DAY
N: Mike and Sheryl exit. They burst out laughing.
T: TIME CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY
N: Mike digs through his backpack, double-checking everything. What he doesn't show Sheryl... wrapped in some socks: a .38 Revolver. He tucks it discreetly away. Sheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service.
C: MIKE
D: You getting anything?
N: Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no."
C: MIKE
D: I'll lock them in the car.
C: SHERYL
D: I'll take mine.
C: MIKE
D: Why?
C: SHERYL
D: Just to annoy you.
C: MIKE
D: Seriously...
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 11.
C: SHERYL
D: In an emergency, I'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there.
N: Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment. Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. Zips it shut. ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain. Mike locks the door.
C: MIKE
D: Okay, we all set?
C: SHERYL
D: Yup.
E: Excited
C: MIKE
D: Let's do this.
N: Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof.
C: SHERYL
D: Hey, Einstein. What do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us?
N: Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car.
C: MIKE
D: I was just seeing if you were paying attention.
N: Mike comes back to the car for the tent. Sheryl shakes her head and smiles.
S: EXT. BASE TRAIL #1 - DAY
N: The mountain is breathtaking. Nature at its best. Mike and Sheryl have begun their ascent.
C: SHERYL
D: It could be fun.
C: MIKE
D: Not a chance. High School reunions serve only two purposes... to try to
E: MORE
N: MIKE (cont'd) rehash so-called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super-model.
C: SHERYL
D: So what were you?
C: MIKE
D: Me? I was a stoner.
C: SHERYL
D: So what does that mean?
C: MIKE
D: How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was high all the time.
N: Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana.
C: MIKE
D: Where'd you get that bandana?
C: SHERYL
D: It's cute, right? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your eyes.
C: MIKE
D: And when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe...
C: SHERYL
D: Oh...well...it was the last one...
C: MIKE
D: The last one?
C: SHERYL
D: Yeah...
C: MIKE
D: The entire Army-Navy store... sold out?
C: SHERYL
D: Completely. There was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute.
N: Sheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 13.
C: SHERYL
D: Here... You big baby.
N: Sheryl turns, as she does... Mike pinches her behind, she playfully SHRIEKS, hustles away from him, but he pursues her, as they both CRACK UP, they spill off the trail... OFF THE PATH... Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay, when... SHERYL LOOKS DOWN, SCREAMS! A BLOODY, MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP. The Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. The kill looks fresh.
C: MIKE
D: Fucking nasty.
C: SHERYL
D: What is it?
C: MIKE
D: Looks like it's a, or was, a fox. Come on.
N: Mike and Sheryl head back to the path. ANGLE ON - The MUTILATED, BLOODY FOX.
S: 21A EXT. BRIDGE ON BASE TRAIL - DAY 21A
N: Mike and Sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge.
S: EXT. BASE TRAIL #2 - DAY
N: Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing. There are a number of signs pointing toward different trails. (Donner Trail, Willow Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc.) Sheryl grabs the map and some water. Mike swigs some water, munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.
C: SHERYL
D: What do you think? "Cannibal" Trail or the other one?
C: MIKE
D: Guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views.
C: SHERYL
D: We're not Lewis and/or Clark. We're gonna stick to one of the ones the Ranger said.
C: IDA
D: You folks need some help?
E: OS
N: IDA FOSTER, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon. She is worn, haggard, but has a friendly, smile. She wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots.
C: MIKE
D: We're just going over our options here.
C: IDA
D: Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong.
C: SHERYL
D: The Ranger at base suggested Donner Trail or...
C: IDA
D: ...Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam only knows those two trails. Well. Between those, I'd pick Donner Trail. Willow Creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see. Donner weaves through Peddler's Point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view.
C: SHERYL
D: What do you think?
E: To Mike
N: Then, she notices a ring on Sheryl's finger.
C: IDA
D: That's a pretty ring.
C: SHERYL
D: Thank you.
C: IDA
D: Not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the Lord's eyes. How long have you two been wed?
N: Sheryl and Mike trade looks.
C: SHERYL
D: Oh... we're not married. Not yet anyway.
N: Mike shoots her a look: "not yet?"
C: SHERYL
D: It's a ring my father gave me for graduation.
C: IDA
D: Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like you was married is'all. Both so beautiful. I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird. I need to mind my own business.
E: embarrassed Beat
C: SHERYL
D: No, it's fine.
C: MIKE
D: Which one of those trails got the best clearings?
E: changing topics
C: IDA
D: Clearings? Neither will give you much in the way of clearings. But, there's another path, this one here. Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see.
E: Points to the map
C: MIKE
D: Sounds perfect. Yeah?
E: To Sheryl
C: IDA
D: Well, I'll leave you to it. Last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private time.
C: SHERYL MIKE
D: Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the tip.
N: Ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away.
C: IDA
D: I'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry... I bet the Lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child. Good luck and God bless you both.
N: Sheryl and Mike don't know how to respond. Ida leaves. Once out of earshot...
C: SHERYL
D: I suddenly feel the need for confession.
C: MIKE
D: Not yet? Love taking your shots, don't ya?
E: Still lingering on...
N: Sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.
C: SHERYL
D: When I see an opening.
C: MIKE
D: That path she was talking about winds through these falls. What do you think?
E: Checks map
C: SHERYL
D: I think... if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain.
C: MIKE
D: And they say romance is dead. Timber Falls it is.
E: Smiling wide
N: They throw on their backpacks and head on their way.
C: MIKE
D: Who's Lewis and/or Clark?
C: SHERYL
D: You really were stoned through high school.
N: As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path... ANGLE ON - The directional sign, "Timber Falls"
S: EXT. TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #1 - DAY
N: Looking back down on the thin path. FIND - Sheryl and Mike continuing their trek. (SPLINTER UNIT) Mike maneuvers around a massive tree. He freezes. Gestures for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "Don't Move." Sheryl stops, startled. Mike motions towards... A MOUNTAIN STAG, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant in the distance. Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera. Snaps a photo of the animal. The Stag stops chewing and looks at them. After a long beat, the Stag skips away through the trees. Sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles. Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl. He helps remove her backpack and kisses her. She kisses him back. ANGLE ON - Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt.
C: MIKE
D: You're going to lose that out here.
C: SHERYL
D: It's fine. I never take it off. Not since you gave it to me. Betcha don't remember...
C: MIKE
D: ...February 27, 2006.
N: Sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike. Speechless.
C: MIKE
D: I remember every moment with you.
C: SHERYL
D: I've got you so whipped.
N: They kiss. Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap. He leans back, better positioning, places his hand down, when...
C: MIKE
D: OUCH! FUCK!
N: Mike brings his hand back up. BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL
T: CUT across his palm.
C: SHERYL
D: What?
C: MIKE
D: My hand... Something stuck it.
N: Sheryl quickly examines the cut. Mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy. He turns away from the wound.
C: SHERYL
D: It's okay. It's not too deep. Let me get the first aid kit.
N: Sheryl rummages through her bag. Mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing. Sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can. She applies some peroxide...
C: MIKE
D: Fuck. That stung.
C: SHERYL
D: Gotta clean the wound, baby.
N: OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES-- From a distance... A SICKLE BLADE enters frame, pulls a branch aside. Sheryl attends to Mike's wound. The POV narrows... solely on SHERYL. TIMBER FALLS, TRAIL #1-- Mike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes.
C: MIKE
D: You know me and blood... we don't do so well.
C: SHERYL
D: I know. All done.
E: She finishes
N: OFF SCREEN: CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket. Sheryl glances toward the sound. Mike admires the dressing of the wound.
C: MIKE
D: Not bad, Nightingale. Not bad at all.
C: SHERYL
D: Did you hear something?
N: Mike follows her eye-line. There's a softer CRUNCH.
C: MIKE
D: It's probably the deer.
C: SHERYL
D: The deer went in the other direction.
N: Mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy.
C: MIKE
D: Maybe it's someone, or something, stalking us.
C: SHERYL
D: Quit it.
C: MIKE
D: Something inhuman watching our every move.
C: SHERYL
D: I said, knock it off.
C: MIKE
D: Something coming for you, Sheryl.
N: Sheryl straps on her backpack.
C: SHERYL
D: Just when I think there's hope for you.
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: SHERYL
D: You're an asshole.
N: Sheryl walks away.
C: MIKE
D: This is a joke. You're not really mad, are you? Sheryl...?
N: She turns the corner and is out of sight.
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry! Unbelievable.
E: Under his breath
N: Mike's in disbelief. He grabs his backpack, heads after her.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!
N: He turns the corner, looks up, but doesn't see her. The path winds like a snake. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 20.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl, wait up!
N: Mike moves up the winding path. He stops, eyes searching. Something's wrong. The path opens up. Mike can now see a hundred yards ahead, but... No sign of Sheryl.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl?! This isn't funny.
E: Calls out
N: Silence. Two birds SCREAM and fly from their perch overhead. Mike eyes the birds, then takes off. Mike's heart-rate increases. He moves quickly up the path, a steep incline. He brushes past a bush and stops. Lying just off the path... SHERYL'S BLUE HIKER'S TOWEL. He picks it up.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl?!
N: No reply. His heart now POUNDING. Mike moving faster. Up ahead, he stops again, finds... SHERYL'S RED BANDANA.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!
N: Silence. Mike picks up the bandana. He's flying. He cuts through some tiny evergreens, off the path...
S: EXT. JUST OFF THE TRAIL, TIMBER FALLS #1 - DAY
N: Mike freezes when he sees... Sheryl's backpack lies against a tree. A few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts. Next to them... her shirt. But no Sheryl, until...
C: SHERYL
D: Good old Hansel. Following the trail of bread crumbs.
E: OS
N: Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock, wearing just her bra and panties. She smiles at him coyly. Mike exhales deeply. Relieved, but fuming.
C: MIKE
D: You bitch.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 21.
C: SHERYL
D: Doesn't feel good to be teased, does it?
N: Okay, he had that coming.
C: MIKE
D: Truce?
C: SHERYL
D: Truce.
N: He takes her in. She's quite a sight. He sits down next to her. They kiss. Then... Mike breaks the embrace.
C: MIKE
D: Don't disappear on me again.
N: Sheryl mouths the words, "I promise." Crosses her heart. He leans in, they kiss again. Soft and sweet at first. Then it deepens. Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss again. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another. Mike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her legs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about to remove it, when:
C: DARRYL
D: Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out.
E: O.S.
N: DARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE, 20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by... BRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other.
C: DARRYL
D: Looks like we got ourselves a little party.
N: Brody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike, who shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra back closed.
C: MIKE
D: We were just moving our way up the mountain.
C: LONNIE
D: You were moving your way'round more than just that.
N: Sheryl eyes her discarded clothes. Darryl spots them too. He grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them.
C: DARRYL
D: Like a peach.
E: Referring to the smell
N: Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly.
C: BRODY
D: You folks best be careful about what you do up here... Never know who's watching.
C: MIKE
D: Appreciate the advice...I think we learned our lesson.
N: Brody nods as he looks them up and down.
C: LONNIE
D: You city folk, ain't ya? Up from Charleston roughing it, seeing how the "other" half lives?
C: MIKE
D: No, we're from Virginia, just up for a weekend trip. And, uh... you folks live up here?
N: Brody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike.
C: BRODY
D: It's easy to spot the city folk. It's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be.
C: MIKE
D: I think you just startled us is all.
N: Sheryl looks over at... ...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly flails it about. Uncomfortable silence.
C: MIKE
D: We'll just be on our way. May I have those?
E: Re: Sheryl's shorts
N: A bold move from Mike.
C: DARRYL
D: Finders keepers.
N: Long beat. Tension high.
C: BRODY
D: Darryl.
N: Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back. Darryl reluctantly obliges. Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does. Mike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun.
C: BRODY
D: Where you runnin' off to?
C: LONNIE
D: Yeah, we just getting acquainted and shit.
N: Mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest. He can no longer hide his fear.
C: MIKE
D: We just want to get a little further along before the sun sets.
N: Darryl eyes the sky. The sun beams down through the trees.
C: DARRYL
D: Plenty of time'fore that.
C: MIKE
D: Look. We don't want any trouble. We just want to be on our way...
C: BRODY
D: And why do you suppose we mean to make trouble?
N: Mike looks down at the gun. Brody smiles a yellow smile. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 24.
C: BRODY
D: You folks enjoy the spirits?
C: MIKE
D: Excuse me? The what?
C: DARRYL
D: Spirits.
C: LONNIE
D: Booze!
C: MIKE
D: Sure. Yeah.
N: Brody hands Darryl the shotgun and drops his sack. Brody pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack.
C: BRODY
D: Why don't you try a taste of this?
N: Brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to Mike. Mike eyes Sheryl. Clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea. Mike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip. He squirms, winces, but forces it down. Mike turns red and coughs. Brody and Darryl are loving it.
C: DARRYL
D: Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that?
N: Darryl would win that bet.
C: BRODY
D: Fifty bucks.
N: Mike has no idea what he's talking about.
C: BRODY
D: I'll sell you the jar for fifty bucks.
C: DARRYL
D: Or maybe we could do us a little trade.
E: Ogles Sheryl
C: MIKE
D: Let me get my wallet.
N: Mike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around. ANGLE ON - INSIDE THE BAG... the .38 Revolver. Mike thinks about grabbing it. Sheryl shocked to see the gun. She tenses up. ANGLE ON - Brody. The shotgun. Mike thinks, then...
C: SHERYL
D: Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain. Pay the man.
E: To Mike
N: Mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet. He counts out the cash, hands it to Brody. Brody smiles, hands the jar to Mike.
C: BRODY
D: Pleasure doing business with ya. Take care now.
N: Brody nods at Mike and Sheryl, walks off down the trail. Darryl grins at Sheryl, follows Brody.
C: LONNIE
D: Should you tire of your present company... just holla and I'll come running with bells on darling.
N: He smiles a creepy wide smile. He turns and catches up to the others. Once they are out of sight... Mike takes a moment to gather himself. Sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground, puts it on.
C: MIKE
D: Are you okay?
C: SHERYL
D: You brought a gun?
N: No response. Sheryl picks up her towel and bandana.
C: SHERYL
D: Why did you bring a gun?
C: MIKE
D: Same reason you brought your cellphone. Better to have it and not need it. To protect us.
C: SHERYL
D: Lotta good it just did.
N: Sheryl turns from Mike, walks back to the path.
C: MIKE
D: You want to go back? Sheryl? I'm sorry.
E: Then, call out No response
C: SHERYL
D: We should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths.
N: Sheryl charges ahead, back to the path.
C: MIKE
D: Fuck.
E: Under his breath
N: Mike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl.
S: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)
N: The sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a magnificent light.
S: EXT. WATERFALL - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #2 - DAY
N: Mike and Sheryl move right along. Still not speaking. The path forks at a BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL. Mike stops, faces the falls, turns to see... Sheryl behind him, catching up. As she does, she slips...
C: MIKE
D: You alright?
C: SHERYL
D: Yeah.
E: balances herself
N: She's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's hand and holds it.
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry.
C: SHERYL
D: Do you know how many times I've had someone die on me? How many children? I stopped keeping count.
C: MIKE
D: I thought... I wasn't thinking. What do you want me to do?
C: SHERYL
D: Get rid of the gun.
C: MIKE
D: What... now? Out here?
N: She holds firm.
C: MIKE
D: I can't just leave it here in the woods, some kid could find it.
C: SHERYL
D: Then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home, you get rid of the gun.
N: Mike thinks about it. His instincts SCREAMING not to do this, then...
C: SHERYL
D: Please.
N: Mike relents. He removes his backpack, ZIPS it open. He pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out. Mike WITH A DEEP BREATH, TOSSES THE BULLETS into the woods.
C: SHERYL
D: Was that all of them?
C: MIKE
D: Yes.
N: Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug.
C: SHERYL
D: Thank you.
N: CRACK! A strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl. Mike turns as well. Their eyes WIDEN. CRACK! The FIGURE emerges from the clearing, practically landing on top of them. It's... CLYDE, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly. He's got a weed cutter in his hands, wears a PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. He's just as surprised to see them. Sheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile.
C: CLYDE
D: Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks. Just clearing some of the brush off
E: MORE
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 28. CLYDE (cont'd) the path. We had some heavy rains this past week, knocked some trees and branches down. One of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday, but... if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
C: MIKE
D: It's fine. We were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled.
C: CLYDE
D: It's not, but... It's one of my favorite spots, so I often find an excuse to swing by.
C: SHERYL
D: It's gorgeous.
C: CLYDE
D: Yup. There are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so... inviting as this one. Now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself... How long's your stay?
C: SHERYL
D: Just til Sunday.
C: CLYDE
D: Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on the other side. It would take you a couple nights just to get there.
C: SHERYL
D: Maybe next time.
C: MIKE
D: This is a quickie trip. Just getting out of the city for a couple days.
C: CLYDE
D: The city, huh. Which? If it's Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya. Whole place smells like feet. I gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local Doc. Not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then...
C: SHERYL
D: No, we're not from Charleston.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 29.
C: MIKE
D: But apparently we look like we are.
C: SHERYL
D: We live in Alexandria. It's just outside of D.C.
C: CLYDE
D: Oh. I've been there, few years back. Now that city I like. Lotta beautiful churches if I recall correctly. Which congregation do y'all belong to?
C: MIKE
D: Um... Not sure. Sheryl keeps track of all that for us. Sheryl?
N: Sheryl gives Mike the "you're an asshole" look. Then...
C: SHERYL
D: Uh... We're between congregations at the moment.
N: Awkward.
C: CLYDE
D: Well... I should get back to work. Sun'll be down soon and that path ain't gettin'clear on its own.
N: Clyde walks off, until...
C: SHERYL
D: Excuse me... Sir?
N: Sheryl doesn't know his name. Clyde stops, turns back.
C: CLYDE
D: The name's Clyde.
C: SHERYL
D: Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night?
C: CLYDE
D: Be happy too... Let's see... Oh, I got it. "Five Corners" will be perfect. It's just a bit up the ways here, near the Lake. It's five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park. The rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up camp between them you won't be so cold.
C: SHERYL
D: Sounds perfect.
C: MIKE
D: Thanks.
C: CLYDE
D: Just doing my job. You have fun and be careful. Good evening.
N: Clyde tips his cap and disappears.
S: EXT. FIVE CORNERS - DAY
N: Mike and Sheryl hike up a steep slope. As they step through the woods, they look upon... FIVE LARGE ROCKS, arranged in an awkward semi-circle. They walk into the circle, take off their backpacks.
C: SHERYL
D: This is incredible.
N: Mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts.
C: SHERYL
D: Ranger said there's a lake near by.
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: SHERYL
D: The lake. I'd kill to rinse off.
N: Sheryl makes a move...
C: MIKE
D: Whoa. Wait a sec. It'll be dark soon.
C: SHERYL
D: Where's your sense of adventure?
N: She takes off.
C: MIKE
D: Sher. Seriously. Let's wait `til morning.
N: OBSCURED POV-- On SHERYL as she stops. Looks out towards the water. CLOSE ON - THE CONCEALED FIGURE'S EYES. Two different colors, with his left being void of almost all color. Also notice SCARRING around the left eye, there's no eyebrow and his skin is pale and splotchy. The Concealed Figure holds all his attention on... FIVE CORNERS-- Sheryl realizes he's right and walks back over to Mike.
C: SHERYL
D: Fine.
N: Mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet of instructions laid out. He holds one of the poles, which consists of separate links connected by a string. He has no idea where to begin.
C: SHERYL
D: Do you know what you are doing?
C: MIKE
D: I think its pretty obvious that I don't.
N: Sheryl laughs.
S: EXT. TREES, OUTSKIRTS OF FIVE CORNERS - CONTINUOUS
N: The Concealed Figure retreats into the forest.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
N: STARS FILL THE SKY. Crickets chirp, but aside from that, peace and quiet reign. A fire CRACKLES. A tent for two has been pitched. Dirty pots, pans litter the area. Dinner's over and done. Mike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire. A sleeping bag wrapped around them.
C: MIKE
D: That was... the worst dinner ever.
C: SHERYL
D: You cooked.
E: Beat
C: MIKE
D: Yeah, I'm aware. You know what would make this evening perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole jar of it. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. "I have a jar of moonshine." Matter of fact, I've got enough to share with our entire congregation...
E: Beat
C: SHERYL
D: ... in Charleston.
C: MIKE
D: Our home city, of course. But I should start with you... Would you like some moonshine?
N: Sheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully.
C: MIKE
D: Then what would you like?
C: SHERYL
D: I'd like to fuck you.
C: MIKE
D: Not very Christian of you.
C: SHERYL
D: I'm more Old Testament.
C: MIKE
D: What's that mean?
C: SHERYL
D: Not sure. But I think it's the nastier of the two books.
N: Sheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss. Strong and deep. Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. She stands up, pulls Mike into the tent with her.
S: INT. TENT - NIGHT
N: Sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the T-shirt. Mike kicks off his shoes, drops his pants. Mike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off. Sheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside. Mike slides her panties down her legs and off. Few things in life can be described as perfect. Sheryl's naked body is one of them. Sheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him. She reaches down and slides Mike inside her. Sheryl KISSES Mike. He slides his hands around Sheryl's butt. Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip HARD. The lovers move in unison. Perfection.
S: EXT. TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
N: Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue. Their campfire still burns. Suddenly... A SHADOW creeps into frame. Then a BOOT. Someone's outside their tent.
S: INT. TENT - NIGHT
N: Breaths get shorter, stronger. Sheryl and Mike build to climax. They don't/ can't notice... A SHADOW passes across the wall of the tent. The last final moments before... climax. The lovers EXHALE. Sheryl crashes on top of Mike. He wraps his arms tightly around her.
T: TIME CUT TO:
S: 36 A EXT. TENT - NIGHT 36 A
N: The last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT.
S: 36 B INT. TENT - NIGHT 36 B
N: Mike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed together as one.
C: MIKE
D: I was good. I mean, even better than usual.
C: SHERYL
D: If you don't say so...
C: MIKE
D: ... if I don't say so myself, yeah. Top notch performance. What, you disagree?
C: SHERYL
D: Nah, it was good. Do you think I had anything to do...
C: MIKE
D: No. All me.
C: SHERYL
D: Fine. I liked what the old woman said about us earlier.
E: Beat; cautious
C: MIKE
D: What did she say?
C: SHERYL
D: That she thought we were married.
C: MIKE
D: You are relentless.
E: Groans
N: Mike gets up, starts dressing.
C: SHERYL
D: I wouldn't be a proper girlfriend if I didn't nag every now and then.
C: MIKE
D: I get it, but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time. Which makes me feel like shit.
C: SHERYL
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Where are you going?
C: MIKE
D: Do out there, what you did in here.
C: SHERYL
D: What's that?
C: MIKE
D: Put out the fire.
N: Mike exits. Sheryl lies back down, exhales in frustration.
S: EXT. TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
N: Mike, now fully dressed, pours a bucket of water over the campfire. In the background, bags hang from a tree (just as Ranger Sam asked them to do.) A smoldering mist of smoke is all that's left of the fire. Mike drops the bucket, heads for the tent, when... He suddenly stops, notices... ON THE GROUND... A FRESH MUDDY FOOTPRINT. Mike compares his boot to it. It's not the same size. Mike surveys the area. All's quiet now. But an uneasy feeling has crept back into his bones. Mike climbs back inside the tent, zips it shut.
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: EXT. FIVE CORNERS - SUNRISE
N: The sun peeks over the horizon and through the clouds. A BIRD crows.
S: INT. TENT - DAY
N: Sheryl's eyes SNAP open. She's nestled comfortably in Mike's arms. He's still asleep.
S: EXT. TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY
N: Sheryl, now dressed, towel in hand, bandana wrapped around her hair, vomits behind some trees. After, she takes a couple deep breaths, swishes some water in her mouth. A beat later, she heads off.
S: EXT. LAKE - DAY
N: Sheryl stands on the lake's shore, checks a couple times over both shoulders. Then, she takes her sweats and bandana off. Lay them on top of her towel. Sheryl, wearing only her locket, carefully steps into the water... it's cold. But nevertheless her desire to feel clean outweighs the temperature discomfort. On her own little count to three... She dunks her head below the water. As she drops out of sight, REVEAL-- ON LAND, IN THE DISTANCE... THE CONCEALED FIGURE STANDS ON THE SHORE, WATCHES HER. IN THE WATER... Sheryl POPS up, turns towards land and... THE CONCEALED FIGURE is gone. Sheryl comes back to land. She grabs her towel, dries her hair and pats herself dry. She pulls on her sweatpants, starts to tie her bandana around her head, and turns straight into... THE CONCEALED FIGURE. CLOSE ON - THE STEEL SICKLE/ AXE SHERYL SCREAMS. The sound resonates over...
S: INT. TENT - DAY
N: Mike opens his eyes. Something woke him up, not exactly sure what. He sits up and yawns, stretches his stiff body. He's alone in the tent.
S: EXT. TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY
N: Mike, now dressed, stands behind a tree, takes a piss. He shudders slightly. It's cold. Mike finishes his business, grabs his water bottle and takes a long drink. He peels off the bandage from his hand. It looks fine today. He looks around, but no sign of Sheryl.
S: EXT. LAKE - DAY
N: Mike walks up to the water, looks in both directions. Nothing. A pang of concern registers. He kneels down, cups some water and splashes it over his face, hair. As he opens his eyes, he notices something. In the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight. It's Sheryl's locket. The chain broken. He picks it up...
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!
E: Calls out
N: Mike looks around. He's completely alone. The blood drains from his face. Mike pockets the necklace. He starts into the water... did she drown? Just as he gets knee deep... OFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT! Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!
N: He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods.
S: EXT. WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY
N: Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction and slips, BANGING his knee.
C: MIKE
D: Fuck! Sheryl!
E: Top of his lungs
N: Mike pushes himself up, continues on.
S: EXT. WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY
N: Mike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch of trees and hustles down a slope.
S: EXT. CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
N: Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing. Looking around wildly... POV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the same? Not even sure which direction he just came from.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!
N: Still nothing. Mike swallows. What to do now?
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
N: TIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees. HIS LEGS trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then... Mike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out. The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there. Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE. He removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it around his wound. Mike lays back, stares up into the sky. Tries to catch his breath, calm down. Then... Faint sound of LAUGHTER. Mike sits up. Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER. Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction.
S: EXT. WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
N: Mike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees. He stops at the top and looks down. POV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles. Mike's about fifteen feet above them. He narrows his focus in on... MIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand. It's Sheryl's blue hikers' towel. Mike turns red with fury. He looks back down... MIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder. Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near a tree, parallel to him.
S: EXT. TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY
N: Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until... OFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK. Darryl stops, turns. Lonnie looks at Daryl.
C: LONNIE
D: What is it? Hear something?
N: Darryl holds his look into the woods, then...
C: DARRYL
D: Nah. It's nothing.
N: Suddenly, Mike LEAPS from behind a tree, WHACKS the surprised Darryl across the face with the stick. Darryl drops like a sack of potatoes. Mike locks eyes with a terrified Lonnie.
C: MIKE
D: Where is she!?
N: Lonnie pauses, frozen. He then takes off, disappearing through the trees. Darryl lies on the ground, MOANING. He pushes himself up to his knees. BLOOD POURS from a fresh gash across his head. Mike grabs Darryl's shotgun, aims at Darryl.
C: DARRYL
D: Whoa... take it easy.
C: MIKE
D: Where is she?
C: DARRYL
D: Who? What the fuck you talking about?
C: MIKE
D: What did you do to her?
C: DARRYL
D: I didn't fuckin' do nothing.
C: MIKE
D: WHERE IS SHE?!
C: DARRYL
D: I don't know!
N: Mike CRACKS Darryl across THE JAW with the barrel.
C: MIKE
D: You have Sheryl's towel...What the fuck did you do to her?!
N: Darryl's a mess, his nose busted. He gags on blood and teeth. Mike stares at the bloody desight that is Darryl. Even Mike has to turn away for a moment for this. Then...
C: DARRYL
D: Foun' towel.
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: DARRYL
D: I foun' the towel.
C: MIKE
D: You found it? That's you're fucking story, you inbred fuck?! Stop fucking lying or I will kill you!
E: Points gun at Darryl's head
C: DARRYL
D: Don' kill me...Please...I foun' it... Up...Up the paf back `dere...just a bit ago... fuckin'swear!
N: Mike's finger itches the trigger. He's turning red. Breathing hard, heavy. Then... Mike relents. Lowers the weapon, turns his back to Darryl, stares into the woods. The tension fades for the moment. But only a moment.
C: DARRYL
D: Didn't think you had dat in you, city boy. Shit... I just got dis shirt.
E: Looks at his shirt; the blood
N: Darryl, while Mike is distracted, seizes his opportunity, reaches behind... ANGLE ON - Darryl slides a POCKET KNIFE from his back pocket.
C: DARRYL
D: Damn shame you lost dat fine piece o'ass. Something dat sweet don't come'round every day. Even for pretty folk like you.
C: MIKE
D: Shut the fuck up.
N: ANGLE ON - Still concealed from Mike, Darryl opens the pocket knife, the BLADE fully extended.
C: DARRYL
D: You best hope you find her'fore I do. `cause I will enjoy tearing her ass apart. And when I'm done there, I will cut her eyeballs out and skull fuck her. Any luck, Brody's already beat me to it.
E: Mike turns, faces Darryl Mike simmers to a boil
C: MIKE
D: Sonofabitch!
N: Mike takes a step towards Darryl, when... Darryl LUNGES OUT AT MIKE, POCKET KNIFE IN HAND. Darryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to knock Mike down, the shotgun falls to the side. Darryl pins Mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife into him, but Mike grabs his wrist. They struggle. Darryl PUSHES down, the knife INCHES CLOSER TO MIKE'S CHEST, until... Mike HEAD-BUTTS Darryl, sending the skinny Hick off him. Darryl rolls away in pain. Mike scrambles, crawls for... the shotgun. He grabs it. Darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with... WHACK! MIKE bashes Darryl's face with the butt. This knocks Darryl completely out. Mike stands over Darryl. A beat. Then...
C: MIKE
D: SHERYL!
S: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)
N: The morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce the cloudy skies.
S: EXT. FIVE CORNERS - DAY
N: Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow. He freezes, completely floored. Everything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits, everything. Even the fire pit. Mike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless. He SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells. He closes it, heads back into the woods. OMIT
S: EXT. WOODS #3, TIMBER FALLS TRAILS - DAY
N: Mike moves deeper into the woods. He's a mix of paranoia and determination. Mike pauses, catching his breath, when... A FEW BLOOD DROPS OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the blood. What the fuck? A couple more DROPS hit him. Mike LOOKS UP... A MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by coarse thick ropes. Mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware... A FEW FEET BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP. Mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer... his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP... SNAP! CRUNCH! MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN ON HIS LEG! Mike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel.
C: MIKE
D: HELP!?!?!
N: Mike writhes in pain on the ground. His eyes watering. The pain UNBEARABLE. Then... MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden. Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then... Ida bends down next to Mike.
C: IDA
D: Michael, can you hear me? Michael...
N: Her words fade out. He promptly PASSES OUT.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
N: ON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS.
T: FADE IN:
S: INT. IDA'S CABIN - DAY
N: CLOSE ON - Mike's eyes SNAP open, dart side to side, blink. REVEAL - Mike lays on a ragged couch. The place is dark and dusty. A glance around... Gaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT. Mike's memory slowly comes back. He leans up when...
C: MIKE
D: Ow!
N: A sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced the Gray Bandana on his arm. Ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen. She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops.
C: IDA
D: Look who's up.
C: MIKE
D: Where am I?
C: IDA
D: You're in my home, Michael. You gave me quite a scare. I thought I lost you.
N: Ida grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and walks back to Mike.
C: IDA
D: Lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it. I know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing. That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I'll get some "evening primrose" in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well... just about everything. So's do I.
N: Ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound.
C: IDA
D: Try and relax.
N: Ida cleans the wound. Mike winces. He can't watch.
C: MIKE
D: Thank you. For saving my life.
C: IDA
D: You don't have to thank me. Up here, we take care of one another. That's the only way any of us survive.
C: MIKE
D: Um... I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.
E: Thinks...
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 44.
C: IDA
D: Oh for the sake of sunshine... how rude a host am I? Name's Ida Foster.
N: Ida moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear liquid. It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody.
C: MIKE
D: Ida, I need some help.
C: IDA
D: I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie.
C: MIKE
D: No, not me. It's Sheryl. My girlfriend. You met her with me yesterday. Something's happened to her. She was gone this morning when I woke up. I looked everywhere and I couldn't find her. We need to call someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We need to find her right away. Do you have a phone?
C: IDA
D: I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really had use for one. I do have a radio. We can call down to base if you'd like.
E: Beat
N: Ida comes back to the couch.
C: IDA
D: After we take care of you.
C: MIKE
D: I'm fine, Ida, please... if you could call now.
C: IDA
D: You want to lose this leg? Cause that's what you're risking. Soon as we're done, I'll call. Okay?
N: Mike concedes. Ida hands a second rag to Mike.
C: IDA
D: Bite down on this... I ain't gonna lie... Lotta pain about to hit you sweetheart.
N: Mike puts the rag in his mouth. Ida dips the used cloth in the moonshine. He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies the moonshine to the wound. Mike SCREAMS through the cloth.
C: IDA
D: It's okay. It's almost over.
N: Ida repeats. Mike SCREAMS again. His eyes water. Ida offers her palm. Mike opens his mouth. The cloth falls into her hand. Mike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain. Ida crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths and grabs a larger towel. She walks back to Mike and wraps his calf with the towel.
C: IDA
D: We'll get some of that primrose in you and you'll be good as new.
C: MIKE
D: Ida? The radio. Please... Can you call down please?
C: IDA
D: I'll take care of it right now.
N: Ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room. She opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her. Mike relaxes, as best he can anyway. Until... KNOCK, KNOCK.
C: BRODY
D: Ida, you in there?!
E: OS
N: MIKE'S POV - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits outside. Ida exits the room, heads for the door.
C: MIKE
D: He's looking for me.
E: Whispers
C: IDA
D: Why's that?
E: Whispers; concerned
C: BRODY
D: Ida!
E: OS
C: MIKE
D: I think he had something to do with Sheryl going missing.
E: Whispers
N: KNOCK, KNOCK.
C: IDA
D: I'll take care of it.
E: Whispers
C: BRODY
D: Ida, lemme in!
E: OS
C: IDA
D: I'm coming!
N: Ida helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove. He winces all the way. She leans him up against the near wall so that he is out of view of the door. Ida goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an agitated Brody, shotgun in hand. Suspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin. She doesn't budge.
C: BRODY
D: What took you so long?
C: IDA
D: What do you want, Brody?
C: BRODY
D: I'm looking for a man hiker.
C: IDA
D: This "man hiker" alone or wit someone?
C: BRODY
D: He had a lady friend, but... I'm just looking for him now.
N: ON MIKE - Listening nervously.
C: IDA
D: Well, I ain't seen no one in days.
N: Brody glares at her. She glares right back. Brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.
C: IDA
D: What'd he do you for anyway?
C: BRODY
D: He busted Darryl's face in with a shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and teeth. Nearly killed him. You spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me.
E: Beat
C: IDA
D: Fine.
N: Brody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.
C: IDA
D: He's gone. Brody and those boys are a pain in the backside. I'm sure that cousin of his had it coming.
N: Ida leads Mike back to the couch.
C: MIKE
D: What did the Ranger say? Does he need to speak to me? When is he coming?
N: Ida heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot water into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water.
C: IDA
D: Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone.
N: Ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike.
C: MIKE
D: God damnit!
N: Ida pauses...then:
C: IDA
D: Please don't take the Lord's name in vain in this house.
N: She GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until...
C: MIKE
D: I'm sorry.
C: IDA
D: Drink this.
N: Ida hands him the steaming mug. Mike's mind races.
C: MIKE
D: Something's not right.
C: IDA
D: I'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute. We'll try them again and we'll find Sheryl. You'll see. She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of "don't know where." Happens lots of times. Please drink up, Michael, it will make you feel better.
E: Looks to the mug
N: Mike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his lips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him. Unnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping.
C: IDA
D: What's wrong?
C: MIKE
D: How did you know my name?
C: IDA
D: Excuse me?
E: Confused
C: MIKE
D: Michael. You keep calling me Michael. You did it just now. You did before, just after I woke up. You called me Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.
C: IDA
D: I'm sure you're mistaken. You musta told me before.
C: MIKE
D: No, I would have told you "Mike." Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me Michael.
C: IDA
D: Well, how else could I have known your name?
N: ANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 49.
C: MIKE
D: On my driver's license and credit cards, it says Michael. If you stole my wallet from the campsite... that's how you'd have known.
E: Beat; thinks...
N: Long beat.
C: IDA
D: You're accusing me of stealing your wallet? I saved your life. Twice. Why would I steal your wallet? Now, just drink your primrose...
E: Mike doesn't respond
C: MIKE
D: Fuck the primrose!
N: Mike TOSSES the mug across the room. It SHATTERS. Mike lifts himself up. Despite the pain, he heads for the room Ida went in to make the radio call.
C: IDA
D: Where do you think you're going?
C: MIKE
D: I want to call the Ranger myself.
C: IDA
D: NO!
N: Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.
C: MIKE
D: I'm getting in that room, Ida.
N: Mike maneuvers around her, when... Ida grabs the iron fire poker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat.
C: IDA
D: I can't let you in there.
N: Mike takes a step forward. Ida SWINGS the poker. Nearly hits Mike. Mike jukes left, she SWINGS again. Misses.
C: MIKE
D: Where is Sheryl, Ida? She's in that room, isn't she?
C: IDA
D: You sinners are all alike. I heard you last night. Spitting in the face
E: MORE
N: IDA (cont'd) of the Lord and his laws. Dining on the sins of the flesh. FLASH BACK TO:
S: EXT. TENT - FIVE CORNERS - LAST NIGHT
N: Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl make love. Their campfire still burns. Suddenly... A SHADOW creeps into frame. Then a BOOT. REVEAL: IDA STANDS OUTSIDE THE TENT. BACK TO:
S: INT. IDA'S CABIN - DAY
N: Suddenly, Ida appears in a new light...
C: IDA
D: You and your bitch whore girlfriend will atone for your sins.
N: Mike LUNGES forward, grabs hold of the poker before Ida can swing it again. THEY STRUGGLE, CRASH UP AGAINST THE WALL! The poker falls to the floor. Ida JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat. Mike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against the wall. The two fall to the floor. Mike pushes himself up, but before he can get away... IDA GRABS HOLD OF HIS BEAR TRAP WOUND, SQUEEZES! MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY! Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the face, boot to nose. Ida's head snaps back, then falls face first on the floorboard. Mike is PANTING, glances at Ida. She's out cold. Mike pushes himself up, limps to the door. He grabs the handle, PUSHES IT OPEN...
S: INT. SEWING ROOM, IDA'S CABIN - DAY
N: Mike enters to find a sewing machine, some yarn, an antique radio, but more importantly, No Sheryl. He steps over to the radio, when he notices... SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 51. AN INCH THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE RADIO. He swipes it with his finger. This thing hasn't been used in years. Mike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the floor... HIS FOOT SINKS a little. Mike tests the floor board again. It's RICKETY. He pulls the rug out... REVEAL: A TRAP DOOR. Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open.
S: INT. TRAP DOOR STAIRCASE
N: FROM BELOW... Looking up past a weathered, worn and wooden staircase up at Mike. Carefully, Mike makes his way down the steps, into...
S: INT. CHAPEL - CABIN BASEMENT - DAY
N: Religious artifacts, lots of them. Crosses, photos of Jesus, statues of Mary, etc. Don the walls, shelves... everywhere. On the far side of the room... like an altar shrine... NINE LARGE GLASS JARS FILLED WITH LIQUID... INSIDE EACH JAR - HUMAN FETUSES, all in various stages of development and DEFORMITY. Each jar is labelled with their own individual bronze nameplate (#1, MATTHEW... #2, JOHN... #3, PETER... #4, LUKE, etc...). THE LAST JAR - The fetus is closest to term, maybe 8 months along). The nameplate reads, "TIMOTHY." Mike, completely freaked out, backpedals, bumps into AN IRON DOOR. He turns the handle, opens it...
S: INT. HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
N: It's pitch black as Mike opens the door. Next to the door, a light switch... He flips it ON. Sounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable. Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of the hallway. Mike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards the doors. Just as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike. As he brushes himself off. A SCREAM cries out.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl!?
N: Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and...
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
N: Mike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO THE ROOM, falls across... Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches. Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock. Euphoria, pain all at once.
C: MIKE
D: Oh my God.
N: Mike runs to her, touches her face. He checks the ropes tying Sheryl. They're very secure.
C: MIKE
D: I need something to cut you down, baby.
N: Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room. Mike follows her gaze... Searching wildly... scanning the room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS! ON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT, then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE. Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl. He slides the blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES. Several tense moments later... the rope breaks. Mike tosses the rope and gag away. They kiss.
C: MIKE
D: Are you okay?
C: SHERYL
D: Get me out of here. Hurry.
N: Mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists.
C: SHERYL
D: He'll be back soon.
C: MIKE
D: Who's he?
N: OFF SCREEN: A LOUD THUD resounds. Where did it come from? Not wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort.
C: SHERYL
D: Come on, come on, come on...
N: SNAP! Finally, the ropes tear. Sheryl's free. Just as... ALL THE LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY GO OUT. COMPLETE AND TOTAL DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a short, but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her. BREATHING INTENSIFIES. Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each other's arms. Then... Mike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT. He feels around for the bench, when... WHACK.
C: MIKE
D: Fuck!
N: He banged his injured leg on something.
C: SHERYL
D: What are you doing?
E: Whispers
N: Mike reaches the tool bench, feels around. Finds it.
C: SHERYL
D: Mike? Mike?
E: Whispers
N: Mike TURNS ON THE FLASHLIGHT. The beam CUTS through the darkness and onto... The Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike brandishing his axe/sickle. SHERYL SCREAMS! The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR. Mike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife.
C: MIKE
D: Sheryl, run!
N: But Sheryl freezes. SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 54. He comes at Mike again, but... he eludes the attack. Mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach, and SWINGS, STRIKING THE CONCEALED FIGURE IN THE KNEE, he drops to the ground. The Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall! Sheryl's frozen in fear. He SQUEEZES his throat harder, tighter. Mike can't breathe. Mike smacks the Concealed Figure in the face, squirms, all to no avail, until... Mike JAMS his THUMB INTO HIS EYE. He SCREAMS, DROPS Mike. They both fall to the floor. The fallen flashlight's beam illuminates Sheryl backed in the corner.
C: MIKE
D: Get the fuck out of here! Now!
E: To Sheryl
N: Finally Sheryl runs out of the room...
S: INT. HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
N: Sheryl feels her way out by touching the wall...
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
N: As the Concealed Figure writhes in pain... Mike catches his breath, attempts to stand, only... his body buckles under the pain. He throws a look to the Figure, then crawls over to the tool bench. He pulls himself up using the bench for support. He haphazardly feels for a weapon... any weapon. He grabs a hammer, turns and... The Figure grabs Mike's wrist, then HEAD-BUTTS MIKE between the eyes. He falls to the floor. Out cold. The Concealed Figure holds his injured eye with one hand, grabs the SICKLE/AXE with the other.
S: INT. HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT
N: Sheryl reaches the iron door, but stops. Looks back into the darkness.
C: SHERYL
D: Mike? Mike?
E: No response
N: Still no answer. Then... Sheryl spots the light switch, FLIPS IT... THE LIGHTS SNAP ON! Suddenly, THE CONCEALED FIGURE APPEARS OUT OF THE DARKNESS! SHERYL SCREAMS! HE LUNGES FOR SHERYL, but misses. She runs through the door, into...
S: INT. CHAPEL - IDA'S CABIN - DAY
N: ... Sheryl rushes into the room, but trips on something. When she gets up, the first thing she sees... THE FETUS JARS! She coughs violently, almost pukes. She stumbles, hurries up the trap door steps... A moment later... The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door. For the first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly... THIS IS DEACON. Half his body scarred, burned. He stands well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere. A frightful sight. He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl...
S: EXT. IDA'S CABIN - DAY
N: Sheryl BURSTS through the front door, running for the woods. Deacon exits the cabin, spots Sheryl. Runs after her.
S: EXT. WOODS #4 - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
N: SHERYL runs as fast as she can. Breaking branches in her way, leaping rocks. Anything to get away from... DEACON follows. This is his terrain, turf. He moves quickly and efficiently through the brush. SHERYL looks back, and as she does... trips over some tree roots. She falls FACE FIRST INTO A GIANT PUDDLE. She pushes herself out of the puddle. She's soaked, but doesn't stop. She resumes running. DEACON... closing the gap. SHERYL, confused, scared and lost, looks around wildly. Has no idea where she's going. Then suddenly she hears something. She looks down a slight hill... SHERYL'S POV - A RANGER TRUCK drives along a gravel road.
C: SHERYL
D: Thank you God... HELP!
E: At the top of her lungs
N: Sheryl darts down the hill, and falls out onto... I/E RANGER TRUCK/ GRAVEL MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY The RANGER TRUCK SLAMS on the brakes, inches from running over Sheryl. She SLAMS her arms down on the hood. Clyde, startled beyond belief, looks out at Sheryl. He gets out of the car, goes to her. She HUGS Clyde tightly, starts crying. He looks at her... the blood, cuts, etc.
C: CLYDE
D: Oh my stars, what happened to you?
C: SHERYL
D: You have to help me. I was kidnapped. My boyfriend came... And this man's chasing me. He's chasing me right now.
E: Out of breath
C: CLYDE
D: Calm down. I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying.
C: SHERYL
D: He's coming. He's right behind me.
N: Clyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but... all's peaceful at the moment. No Deacon.
C: CLYDE
D: Look, miss, there's no one there.
C: SHERYL
D: Oh my God, Mike.
N: ANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles Sheryl. Deacon steps into frame. Sickle/Axe in hand. He starts toward Clyde and Sheryl.
C: CLYDE
D: It's going to be fine, Miss. I promise you. Everything's going to be fine.
N: Sheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest. SHERYL'S POV - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing. SHERYL SCREAMS. CLYDE HOLDS ONTO SHERYL. Off her look, Clyde turns... DEACON AND CLYDE STAND FACE TO FACE. The moment's frozen. For too long. Something's not right.
C: CLYDE
D: Deacon, what's going on? How the heck did she escape?
N: Sheryl looks at Clyde, in shock. Deacon lowers his head, ashamed.
C: CLYDE
D: Want something done, gotta do it yourself.
N: Clyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt... Sheryl turns, about to run, when... CLYDE CRACKS HER ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB.
T: CUT TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY
N: SHERYL'S POV - OUT OF FOCUS, WOBBLY. LIGHTS, a rainbow of FUZZY COLORS DANCE BEFORE US. Slowly, bring into focus... Sheryl coughs, gags on something. SHERYL'S POV - She lifts her arms to discover her wrists are tied together tightly. SHERYL'S POV - Ida enters the room carrying something. Sheryl's breath quickens. Ida walks right up to Sheryl. She places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit.
C: IDA
D: Perfect. Just perfect. You are lovely as a summer's day. It's almost time.
E: Checks her watch
N: Sheryl catches her REFLECTION in a small wall mirror.
S: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
N: ANGLE ON - A ROPE looped through a hook in the ceiling. FOLLOW THE ROPE DOWN... PASS A PAIR OF BLOODY AND BRUISED HANDS, WRISTS... keep going... end on Mike. Mike's passed out. He dangles in the middle of the room. He wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope gags his mouth. ANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE. As it moves towards Mike... Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye. An eye for an eye? Mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but...
C: CLYDE
D: Deacon!
E: O.S.
N: Clyde enters. He wears a long garment around his neck, carries a bible.
C: CLYDE
D: That's enough. Get him ready.
N: Deacon backs off. He undoes a slipknot on the far wall, which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon lifts Mike to his feet, positions him. It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room. The FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and everywhere. An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's hollow, full of static and futz. Mike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as... The iron door slowly CREAKS open. ANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time. Shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still bound. Her mouth gagged. Mike and Sheryl take each other in. Tears spring to Sheryl's eyes. She takes another jerky step closer. Ida is visible behind her, guides her towards Mike. She positions her next to him so that both face the altar. Clyde glances to Ida who silences the music.
C: CLYDE
D: And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband."
C: IDA
D: Amen.
C: CLYDE
D: And so, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you Michael... and you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage?
N: Mike and Sheryl stare at Clyde. Neither flinch. Clyde glances to Deacon, who immediately steps forward, touches the sickle blade to Sheryl's throat.
C: CLYDE
D: I'll ask again... Do you accept this covenant of marriage?
N: Sheryl nods immediately. Mike nods too. Clyde signals for Deacon to step back. He obeys.
C: CLYDE
D: Then by the power vested in me, I pronounce you man and wife.
N: Clyde signals to Ida. Ida removes Sheryl's graduation ring from her finger. She then slides TWO TARNISHED GOLD BANDS, one on Sheryl's finger, the other on Mike's. Clyde unties the rope securing Mike's gag in his mouth, removes it.
C: MIKE
D: Why are you doing this? We did nothing to you people. Let us go!
C: CLYDE
D: You may kiss the bride.
C: MIKE
D: You fucking people are fucking sick!
N: Clyde's temper flares...
C: CLYDE
D: Do not use that type of language in this house again. Now... kiss the bride or... ... he'll cut off your lips.
E: Stern and cold Gestures to Deacon
N: Mike stares in horror at Clyde, turns to Sheryl.
C: MIKE
D: I love you.
N: Mike kisses her briefly on the cheek. Clyde smiles satisfied, nods to Deacon. He immediately lifts Sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder.
C: MIKE
D: What are you doing?
N: Deacon carries her from the room. Sheryl CRIES.
C: MIKE LET HER GO! SHERYL!
D: Let her go!...Please, let her go!
E: To Clyde
N: Clyde pulls the ropes, hoists Mike back into a dangling position. He secures the knot before exiting the room.
C: MIKE SHERYL!
E: To Ida MORE
N: MIKE (cont'd) Please. Don't hurt her. Whatever it is you want, I'll give it to you.
C: IDA
D: I know you will.
N: She stuffs the gag in, secures it in place with the rope. She ties the knot. Perfect. Ida exits the room. Mike is alone. Mike tries to yank his hands through the knot. His wrists and hands turn red, his face is flushed...the knot is too tight. He stops. Mike takes a breath and tries again. His face and hands are beet red. He pulls and pulls...but the rope doesn't budge. Mike exhales. It's no use. He dangles there, helpless.
S: EXT. IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: Resting under the FULL MOON, sits the cabin.
S: 72 A INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT 72 A
N: Mike still dangles by his wrists. Clyde enters. Clyde unties the end of the rope on the floor. The rope UNFURLS, Mike DROPS to the ground. Clyde picks him up, sits him in a nearby chair. Mike's wrists, ankles and mouth still bound and gagged.
C: CLYDE
D: Gonna untie your mouth, now. Have a little "man to man" talk.
N: Clyde undoes the gag in Mike's mouth.
C: MIKE
D: Please... It's not too late. Let us go. We won't tell anyone.
C: CLYDE
D: How well do you know your bible, Michael?
E: Beat
C: MIKE
D: Jesus Fucking Christ...
N: Clyde SLAPS Mike across the face.
C: CLYDE
D: I told you before to watch that mouth, mister.
C: MIKE
D: Fuck you.
N: Clyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice. He readies a third.
C: CLYDE
D: You through?
N: Mike spits some blood on the floor. Nods.
C: CLYDE
D: I'll ask again... how well do you know the bible?
C: MIKE
D: Not very.
C: CLYDE
D: That's okay. It's fine. That's why I am here... teach you the way things are and the way they should be.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT
N: Sheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM). Ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair. Satisfied.
C: IDA
D: I'll be right back.
N: Ida exits the room. Deacon stands by the door. He and Sheryl alone together. Sheryl tries not to make eye contact. Deacon stares at her. Longingly. DEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting with every breath. ON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP DEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and lust in her eyes.
C: SHERYL
D: I want you, Deacon. I want you to fuck me. Hard.
E: Jump Cut to...
N: ON DEACON - His stare deepens. Sheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place. Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries.
S: INT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
N: Clyde sits in a chair next to Mike.
C: CLYDE
D: Lord knows the will of a man gets tested. Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. It's what makes a man, a man. Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles. Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment... Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. Relations prior to marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes. And because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but... as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character. But you'll do it. Because that's what needs to be done.
E: Beat
N: Mike stares unflinching at Clyde.
S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT
N: Deacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't. ANGLE ON - Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh. Sheryl squirms, but that's all she can do. Then...
C: IDA
D: Deacon!
E: O.S.
N: Deacon jumps up, backs off.
C: IDA
D: You get away from her. Git! Now!
N: Ida sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the room. She shuts the door behind him.
C: IDA
D: I'm sorry about that, Sugar. My brother, he's not well.
N: She retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl.
C: IDA
D: It's not all his fault. Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals. Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken to him. What happened with the others won't happen to you. He's promised me that.
N: What others? What did he do?
C: IDA
D: I'm gonna take that out of your mouth now. I brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some rest. Okay?
N: Ida unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips...
C: SHERYL
D: Please don't do this. Please let me go. Please..I just want to go home.
N: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 65.
C: IDA
D: Drink the tea.
E: Cold
N: Ida brings the mug to her lips again, pours some in Sheryl's mouth. She swallows a big gulp.
C: IDA
D: That's better. Good girl. I almost forgot to ask... How does it feel being married?
E: Changing topics
C: SHERYL
D: Why are you doing this?
C: IDA
D: I thought you'd be happy about that. All I ever wanted out of life was two things... to be married and to have a baby. The Lord blessed me with Clyde and I thank Him every day for that.
N: Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl.
C: IDA

N: ANGLE ON - The "Timothy" Fetus jar. The most developed of them all.
C: CLYDE
D: City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo words for the condition. Breaks my heart every time. That woman was born to be a mother. It's her calling in life. Just like you and Sheryl have a calling.

C: MIKE
D: You're out of your fucking minds.
N: Clyde grabs Mike's wrist, turns over his palm. Clyde takes a knife from his belt, SLICES MIKE'S PALM. MIKE SCREAMS. BLOOD POURS FROM THE WOUND.

S: INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT
N: Mike makes his way to the table, to Sheryl. He pulls himself to his feet. He takes Sheryl in. She looks peaceful. He runs his good hand through her hair. Tears roll down his cheeks. Mike checks each of Sheryl's ropes. They are all tightly secured. Mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room. But Clyde was right. No way out. Mike stares at the phonograph... HE KICKS IT OFF THE TABLE, KICKS AND BASHES IT TO PIECES. VFX: Mike's breathing INTENSIFIES. PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP... His world is not caving in, it's already caved.

D: No, but...
C: CLYDE
D: Did you understand what was expected of you?
C: MIKE
D: Yes, but... How do you expect...
C: CLYDE
D: Clearly you did not understand. You did not even attempt relations last evening.
C: MIKE
D: What you're asking to do is sick. You're sick.
C: CLYDE
D: You didn't have a problem when penetration was a sin, but when it's your wife, it's sick?!? Unbelievable.
N: Clyde glares angrily at Mike, then heads to the door.
C: CLYDE
D: You knew the rules, Michael. I warned you. Now, Deacon, here, will remind you.

C: SHERYL
D: What are they doing to him?
C: IDA
D: You should concern yourself with what's about to happen to you.
N: Ida opens a SEWING BOX, but instead of needles and yarn, she removes a CLEAVER. Sheryl looks at the cleaver, then... to her hand... the pinky finger separated and immobile.
C: SHERYL
D: What are you doing, Ida?
C: IDA
D: You think you're so much smarter than me, don't you?

D: No, I don't.
N: Yes she does.
C: IDA
D: Might surprise you, but I was quite the student back in the day. Straight A's. Every subject'cept for Science. Infuriated me how they tried to explain away the Lord's creations. Our teacher, Mr. Billings, once said... in the future, humans won't be born with a pinky finger'cause of evolution. Of all the... I shouted, "No! We are created in the Lord's image... not some nonsensical theory by Darwind."

D: You think I want to hurt a pretty thing like you? Pains me, but... until you and your husband obey, my hands, much like yours, are tied.
C: SHERYL
D: I know about your condition, Ida. It's not your fault. There are a lot of women that can't carry a baby full term. I know how much you're hurting.
N: Ida takes her attention from the finger, starts to pay attention to Sheryl.
C: IDA
D: You don't know anything about me or what I've gone through.

C: IDA
D: You wouldn't want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again, now would you?
C: MIKE
D: You'll never get away with this. We have friends and family. They know where we went. They'll come looking for us. They'll find us!

N: Sheryl takes a moment. Thinks carefully about how exactly to phrase this... Then...
C: SHERYL
D: Maybe... we should just give them what they want?
C: MIKE
D: What?
C: SHERYL
D: If it stops them from hurting you and me... maybe we should...
C: MIKE
D: Absolutely not. No fucking way. Forget the fact, that the moment you get pregnant, they'll kill me. Then the moment you give birth, you're dead. Beyond both of those reasons... ain't no fucking way I am going to give them our child.
N: Tears POUR from Sheryl.
C: MIKE
D: For all my coward marriage moments... I've thought about our child. Is that stupid? I picture what he'll be like...
C: SHERYL
D: He?
C: MIKE
D: Wishful thinking. I picture your heart... your eyes... And I picture us, raising him. Growing old with him. No. Ain't no fucking way I'm going to give him to them. They keep talking about sins... that would be the worst sin of them all. I'll get us out of this, Sheryl. I promise you.
