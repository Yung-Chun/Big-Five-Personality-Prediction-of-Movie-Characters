T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT
N: On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON. The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with an EERIE SQUEAK. Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: VO A CROWING HOWL
N: CAMERA PANS DOWN TO: CHICKEN PEN A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as they peck at the ground.
C: WERECHICKEN
D: The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
E: VO ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now
N: WERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING A RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens. (These shots are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.) Magnified GURGLING and HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: VO GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING
N: The terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer, his shadow falling over them. They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING wildly.
S: INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
N: MAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV while munching popcorn from a huge bowl. They're distracted by CHICKENS SQUAWKING.
C: ZEKE
D: Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
C: MAUDE
D: Jes' set easy, Zeke. I'll take a look-see.
E: she rises; heads for door
N: Zeke continues staring at TV.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT -- WERECHICKEN'S POV
N: Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate. CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: VO GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING
N: ANGLE WITHIN CHICKEN PEN The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken coop.
C: MAUDE
D: Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
E: as she goes
S: INT. CHICKEN COOP -- OTS MAUDE
N: AS Maude ENTERS from OUT OF CAMERA, her flashlight beam illuminates the chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner. They CLUCK nervously.
C: MAUDE
D: What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
N: Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: VO Low, gutteral CLU-UCK
N: Maude looks over her shoulder AT CAMERA, reacts.
C: MAUDE
E: GASP!
N: MAUDE'S POV -- THE WERECHICKEN Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it stands framed in the moonlit doorway. It opens its fanged beak in a horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: Frightening SHRIEK
S: INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV
N: Old black-and-white movie. MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK.
C: TV WEREWOLF
E: eerie HOWL

N: WAIST SHOT -- MAUDE She stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly.
C: MAUDE-CHICKEN
E: CLUCKS
C: ZEKE
D: What say?
E: VO
N: PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken from the feet up. First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet sprout. Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron. One foot scratches the floor.
C: MAUDE-CHICKEN
E: VO more CLUCKS
N: WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean. Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless, as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken. The Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes.
C: ZEKE
E: SCREAMS
N: He scrambles backwards off the couch.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT - WERECHICKEN'S POV
N: SCENE RED-tinted. We hear loud SQUAWKING from within house as chicken feathers fly out the open windows.

E: VO
T: DISSOLVE THRU TO:
S: INT. -- LABORATORY -- ON PETER AND RAY
N: They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the O.S. Egon. Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over it. SLIMER hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a dog. He finally dives right into it.
C: PETER
D: It's Your night to take out the trash.
E: CONT
C: RAY
D: And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
N: ANGLE ON EGON He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size of the room. He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon rises.
C: EGON
D: Be with you in ... ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
E: preoccupied; through above checks watch
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Peter and Ray exchange pained glances. Peter awkwardly attempts to pick up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked. PAN WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly lowers INTO FRAME. They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash bags flying.
C: PETER AND RAY
D: 
E: AD-LIB REACTIONS as they bounce off balloon
N: NEW ANGLE Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags. Slimer SQUEALS from within it.
C: SLIMER
E: VO big muffled SQUEAL
N: Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body flat as a Frisbee. SLIMER shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.
C: PETER
D: Thanks, Slimer. I really needed that!
E: pissed; sarcastic
C: SLIMER
D: Sorreee!
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Ray helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS.

C: WINSTON
D: Calm down... Where are you?... We'll be right there.
E: a BEAT as he listens
N: He hangs up. WIDER ANGLE Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags. Even Slimer is dragging one.
C: WINSTON
D: Ready for this one? Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
C: PETER
D: Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores. Let's roll!
E: he drops trash bags
N: Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and Winston. REAR VIEW ON EGON still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.
C: EGON
D: I think I've finally perfected it. Watch this, guys. Guys?
E: a BEAT, he looks around over shoulder
N: WIPE TO:
S: EXT. -- COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
N: ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.
S: INT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING
N: The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear. Slimer hovers in back seat.
C: RAY
D: It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
C: PETER
D: Why? Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
E: sarcastic
N: ON WINSTON Driving.
C: WINSTON
D: But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his? He'll be a rich man!
N: ON PETER Arms folded, grumpily.
C: PETER
D: Good. Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
S: EXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT
N: As it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a haystack. MOVE IN TO -- CLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings.
C: MAUDE-CHICKEN
E: Egg-laying CLUCKS
N: Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an enormous egg beneath her. Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn.
C: MAUDE-CHICKEN
E: SQUAWKS and CLUCKS
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
N: Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's obviously not buying it.

D: Had big blood-red eyes, it did. Biggest dang chicken I ever seen. Mebbe six feet tall.
N: Peter rolls his eyes.
C: WINSTON
D: Shouldn't be hard to find.
N: RAY is jotting info on notepad.

E: CONT over shoulder as he goes
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front.

E: as they go
N: CLOSER ANGLE -- MOVING
C: RAY
D: No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.

C: PETER
D: Get serious, Ray.
C: RAY
D: Then explain those!
N: Ray points at ground. Peter, Winston and Slimer look down. THEIR POV Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT
N: The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks. Slimer moves ahead, nose to ground like a bloodhound.
C: SLIMER
E: SNIFFS as he goes
N: ANGLE ON SLIMER He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him right into the haystack. We hear a BONK from within, then:

E: through above
N: ANOTHER ANGLE Egon looks around, reacts to egg.
C: EGON
D: Interesting. That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
N: Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.
C: PETER
D: I don't wanna hear about it, Egon. We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
N: Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly. Egon pushes glasses up off tip of nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it. CAMERA MOVES IN on egg and we --

S: INT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV
N: Through its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray and Winston peering in. CLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON They ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him. The barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and the beams of their flashlights. As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL.
C: WINSTON
D: Man, this place is creepy.
E: WHISPER
C: RAY
D: It's in here -- I can feel it.

C: WERECHICKEN
E: loud SHRIEKING SQUAWK
N: WERECHICKEN'S POV ZOOM-IN on Winston and Ray. They open fire. FULL SHOT The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton energy.
C: WERECHICKEN
E: SHRIEKS
N: A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with monstrous glowing eyes and fangs. The spirit lets out a ROAR more frightening than the Werechicken howl.
C: SPIRIT

N: CLOSE ON SLIMER In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine." Still asleep, Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up. Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.

C: SLIMER
D: Yummy!
E: licking his lips
N: Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg drives Slimer straight to the floor. The egg bounces on his stomach twice before he gets a grip on it. Straining his little green brains out, he floats the egg up into the air and o.s.
C: SLIMER
E: SQUEALS, then GRUNTS
N: ANGLE ON OVEN Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then moves O.S. The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver. ON SLIMER Slimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one: placemat, a plate, utensils, salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity that all focuses on his personal eating spot.
C: SLIMER
E: HUMMING through above
