N: BLACKNESS...
C: GIRL'S VOICE
D: I can't see anything... Are you there?
E: O.S. UKRAINIAN
N: Silence. GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D) Are you there!? Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame.
C: LUBA
D: God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door?
E: UKRAINIAN
N: She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating...
C: RAYA
D: Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try.
E: UKRAINIAN
N: RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching... CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto...
S: EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
N: A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof. Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.
C: RAYA
D: It's ammonia, not alcohol.
E: UKRAINIAN
C: BOY
D: You're so smart. I love you!
E: UKRAINIAN Drunk
N: He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into... TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in... A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance, silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want to think about what life holds in store. Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of the time. Yelling over to Luba... TWB 2.
C: RAYA
D: I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.
E: UKRAINIAN
C: LUBA
D: No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman wants us there at 9 in the morning.
E: UKRAINIAN
N: Raya looks at Luba. Torn.
C: LUBA
D: It's just a few months working in a hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like your mother? Marry one of these assholes? There's nothing here!.. He said it was both of us or no go!
E: CONT'D
N: Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates; she needs this so badly.
C: LUBA
D: Fuck your mom!
E: CONT'D
N: But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past Luba who watches her disappear.
S: INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT
N: Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn between anger and relief.
C: RAYA
D: I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but--
E: UKRAINIAN
C: HALYNA
D: It's three in the morning.
E: UKRAINIAN
N: Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom. SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's measly aspirations...
S: EXT. KYIV - MORNING
N: The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv.
S: INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING
N: Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod.
C: ROMAN
D: Big smile! TWB 3.
E: UKRAINIAN
N: Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up.
C: LUBA
D: I am Natalya Verbova. I am going to Budapest to buy carpets for re- selling. I am staying two days...
E: UKRAINIAN practicing
N: Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia, nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera.
C: LUBA
D: No-one's gonna believe we really did it!
E: CONT'D
N: Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement. CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE. Then the title of the film fades in... "THE WHISTLEBLOWER"
T: A FLASHLIGHT cuts across...
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT
N: POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to THE FRONT PORCH He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38. Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE standing in the doorway.
C: HUSBAND
D: It just got a bit heated, you know how it gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors tomorrow.
N: Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.
C: OFFICER LEEDS
D: Ready to go?
N: Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.
C: KATHY
D: You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?
N: The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...
C: WIFE
D: Really. It was nothing. TWB 4.
N: The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him, noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.
C: KATHY
D: You all have any children?
C: HUSBAND
D: Nope.
N: The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.
C: HUSBAND
D: So if that's all Officer...
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: I'd like to take a quick walk through the house.
C: HUSBAND
D: You can't do that without a warrant.
C: KATHY
D: Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.
N: The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...
C: HUSBAND
D: You're not coming in my house!
N: He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he... GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in EXTREME PAIN. O.S. POLICE SIRENS BLARE
S: INT. HOSPITAL HALL - NIGHT
N: Three POLICE OFFICERS linger. They peek through a door at...
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME
N: Kathy. She sits up on a gurney. The DOCTOR examines her shoulder. It's BRUISED PURPLE.
C: DOCTOR
D: Painful there?
N: Kathy winces. TWB 5. CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.
C: HAWK
D: I'm her Captain.
C: DOCTOR
D: Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going to have to set her arm in a cast.
C: HAWK
D: Lookin' for a route to the desk?
C: KATHY
D: Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my body until I'm captain.
N: Hawk laughs.
C: KATHY
D: I'm fine. I'm sure you have a hotter date than this tonight.
E: CONT'D
C: HAWK
D: I wish.
C: KATHY
D: Just when my self esteem was gettin' so healthy.
C: HAWK
D: We found a boy locked in the basement. Badly beaten. We charged the husband with domestic assault. You made the right call. But you should've waited for backup. ... I wish I didn't have to say this--
E: sighing
C: KATHY
D: You're giving Deke the gold shield.
C: HAWK
D: I have to Kathy. He has seniority.
N: Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.
C: HAWK
D: You deserve the promotion. You should be a detective and if we had more openings--
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: That gold shield was the first one in four years... Sir... I'm going to have to resign, and take that position overseas. TWB 6.
C: HAWK
D: I think that's a mistake. I want you on my team.
N: Kathy sighs, touched. But...
C: KATHY
D: Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on the streets much longer. Not if I don't know there's something on the other end.
N: She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at... The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15. This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk eyes Erin, sympathetic.
C: HAWK
D: Just think about it, will you?
N: He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
N: Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned.
C: ERIN
D: I wish you could stay here.
C: KATHY
D: Me too.
N: Erin turns. Serious. Weighing...
C: ERIN
D: I mean it's fine living at dad's, but... Now I really won't see you for a while.
C: KATHY
D: I'm doing this for us. If I have a better job, I can give you guys more.
N: Erin nods, tearing again.
C: ERIN
D: When do you have to decide?
C: KATHY
D: Come here.
N: Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug, wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face. TWB 7.
C: ERIN
D: Are you sure it's not dangerous?
C: KATHY
D: Of course. It's been four years. Things are getting back to normal over there.
T: SMASH CUT TO:
N: A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters: SARAJEVO - 3 KM. Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND!
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us, throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it. TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999
S: INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
N: Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the window, her eyes drinking it all in...
C: VOICE
D: You come here today as a beacon of hope, as representatives of humanity's highest aspirations.
E: O.S.
N: In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH. Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen, 20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace' sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY. In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR. The bus cranks around the corner, entering...
S: EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
N: The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin. TWB 8. IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...
C: CARMEN
D: Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are at eye level. People just running to the store.
N: All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads held high, ready for anything. We're in...
S: INT. MEETING HALL - LATER
N: BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge...
C: BILL HYNES
D: You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace International to represent the US as monitors for the United Nations, which means you are the only national contingent coming from a private military. So you people chose to come here. And for the next few weeks, we will teach you how to protect the rule of law in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil society brick by brick...
N: MOVING OVER more RECRUITS... On their laps, "DYNCORP" ORIENTATION FOLDERS. MEN, listening, determined...
S: EXT. OUTLYING SUBURB - DAY
N: Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR, shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES.
C: BILL HYNES
D: ...to ensure the dignity, equality, and inalienable human rights of every single person in this devastated place.
E: O.S.
N: The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I? ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans. TWB 9.
C: BILL HYNES
D: The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended this war, dictating that an International Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth the transition from war to peace.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY
N: KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER. CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field. A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader, TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out... A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"
C: BILL HYNES
D: But you will learn that peace is harder won than war..
E: O.S.
N: Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head down STEEP STEPS into...
S: INT. ARTILLERY DEPOSIT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Light sneaks through cracks, catching on the oil black barrels of THOUSANDS of GUNS. Todd hands out BINDERS.
C: TODD MYERS
D: We are still in the process of disarming the Muslim, Croat, and Serb militias. You will be cataloguing these arms for decommissioning records.
N: Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS.
S: EXT. SARAJEVO SUBURBS - DUSK
N: Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying... A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR... BELLA LUNA BAR Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.
S: EXT. AMERICAN DORMS - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - EVENING
N: Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall. TWB 10.
C: BILL HYNES
D: You will learn that every morning's hope...
E: O.S.
N: Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.
S: INT. LOCAL GROCERY STORE - DAY
N: Kathy inspects items on the shelves. Nothing familiar. MOVING POV FROM BUS - EARLIER A cluster of WOMEN in BLACK BURKAS. They sway like reeds in the wind, grief overcoming them as they watch:
C: BILL HYNES
D: ...is haunted by yesterday's nightmare...
E: O.S.
N: UN BLUE HELMETS supervise the dig of a mass grave. Bodies are revealed. A child's shoe is uncovered. A BURLY PEACEKEEPER turns, sickened.
S: EXT. TITO BARRACKS - AFTERNOON
N: The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY. MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.
C: BILL HYNES
D: But today is a new day. As Head of the United Nations Mission here I trust that we stake our highest values, even our lives, on the belief that we can rebuild, we must renew, we will witness the rebirth of this country.
N: The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back: Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.
S: INT. KITCHEN - IPTF DORM - EVENING
N: Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.
C: KATHY
D: I thought this was peanut butter but-- TWB 11.
C: CARMEN
D: It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too. Let's get out of here. I need a drink.
S: EXT. STREET - SARAJEVO - NIGHT
N: ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one, when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.
C: AMERICAN IPTF
D: That's a military Bar. You want the party in there...
N: He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit. Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo. There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.
C: CARMEN
D: Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.
C: KATHY
D: Hon, they're all yours.
N: They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.
C: CARMEN
D: Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a Jaegermeister.
N: Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...
C: JAN
D: What about you? You don't have an order?
C: KATHY
D: No. I'm the polite one.
C: JAN
D: I like polite.
N: Carmen turns his head toward her. TWB 12.
C: CARMEN
D: I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get toasted.
N: Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off. AT THE BAR Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye, but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous. And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...
C: ITALIAN SOLDIER
D: I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.
N: Kathy looks him over.
C: KATHY
D: Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.
N: The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.
C: TODD MYERS
D: We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale... Kathy, right?
E: O.S.
N: Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.
C: TODD MYERS
D: Look the basic lay of the land is we have to work with the other nationals, but we don't mix with them at night.
E: CONT'D
N: JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...
C: JIM HIGGINS
D: Lucky those wops don't carry guns or we'd've had ourselves a situation. Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping we'd get to squeeze some off.
C: TODD MYERS
D: At who? Better odds you'll step on a land mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do for you then?
C: JIM HIGGINS
D: I'd kill the fucker who buried it.
E: embarrassed
N: Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy. TWB 13.
C: TODD MYERS
D: You ever had to take someone down?
C: KATHY
D: Just once.
N: The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.
S: INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT
N: Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS. Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.
C: JAN
D: You should probably get her home.
C: KATHY
D: You probably shouldn't have let her drink that much.
N: Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her.
C: JAN
D: Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys. Nothing was going to happen to her.
N: Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her.
C: JAN
D: I was hoping you'd come back.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: Well I did. And now we're both leaving.
S: EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.
S: INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING
N: Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head.
C: CARMEN
D: What the hell happened last night?
N: Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock. TWB 14.
C: KATHY
D: Let's move. We're gonna be late.
S: EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY
N: Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings. Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...
C: CARMEN
D: Do you have any idea where we are?
N: Kathy shakes her head. No idea.
S: INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple of small offices off the open center. Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for them... Jan Van Der Velde.
C: JAN
D: Late night ladies?
N: They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder.
C: JAN
D: I'm your duty officer. You check the duty roster. Every day. You're each assigned to monitor and instruct a group of Bosnian local police. We work in six week shifts. You instruct in the mornings, then go into the field with them in the afternoon. One of you needs to go now.
E: CONT'D
N: He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs.
C: JAN
D: They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out the gate, then left, left, park, right...
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys.
C: JAN
D: My van. There's a map in front.
E: CONT'D
N: She drops the keys, grabs them, and rushes out.
S: EXT. 5TH CANTON - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - MORNING
N: A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS. TWB 15.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape. Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.
C: KATHY
D: Feel free to sit wherever you like.
N: Kathy waits for them to take their seats. They don't. A BOSNIAN WOMAN, pretty, rushes in. Spotting Kathy...
C: BOSNIAN WOMAN
D: Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.
C: KATHY
D: Great, well... I just asked them to sit.
N: The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.
C: BOSNIAN WOMAN
D: They like to be difficult. They understand if you're clear. Mostly they have trouble speaking English. But let's see if you can get them to talk at all.
N: Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening her binder as authoritatively as she can.
C: KATHY
D: Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime scene investigation today. If we could--
N: An older officer, DANIK, stands, defiant.
C: DANIK
D: Where do we sign to say we came?
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
C: KATHY
D: Actually, you sign the attendance at the end of the session. It's a UN mandate--
C: DANIK
D: Or we sign now?
N: Full of malice. Kathy puts the sheet away, then...
C: KATHY
D: We sign later. TWB 16.
N: The cop scoffs, and sits.
S: INT. CLASSROOM - LATER
N: Kathy stands in front of a BLACKBOARD with DRAWINGS on a CRIME SCENE. She crosses off TWO AREAS on the board.
C: KATHY
D: ...Keeping the crime scene clean is number one.
N: A weak smile. Nothing from the crowd. She trundles on.
C: KATHY INTERPRETER
D: Remember you could be Pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy stepping on the very evidence stavatu na scho nam pokazaye that could incriminate. You yaka bula nespodivanka. Treba have to track anything you vcyo datu v torbu. bag. We call that 'chain of evidence.'
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy looks out. The cops are barely paying attention. ONE stubs out a cigarette. Another closes the binder, defiantly.
C: DANIK
D: We sign sheet now?
N: Kathy leans back, disappointed. She hands him the sheet. They all sign, apathetic.
C: DANIK
D: You will tell UN we were cooperating?
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference stings. And just as they're about to leave...
C: KATHY
D: We have to go to the hospital together.
N: The cops eye her, agitated.
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars. IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch. Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.
C: KATHY
D: We got here as quick as we could.
C: CLARKSON
D: Just try to get them here on time. TWB 17.
E: BRITISH ACCENT
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall. Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The floors still hold the stains of old blood. Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...
C: CLARKSON
D: Seems we have two stabbings, one shooting, and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who can't remember what happened... Average night back in Brighton.
N: The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop. Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing... ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...
C: CLARKSON
D: "facial contusions from repeated beatings with fist", "lacerations on the eye caused by the edge of an iron"...
E: CONT'D reading chart
N: He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...
C: CLARKSON
D: "The right hand was the first entry point of a large kitchen knife"... "The second entry point in the upper left thigh"... It went through her hand and into her leg... Who's going to take this report?
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.
C: CLARKSON
D: Anyone?
E: CONT'D
N: No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant. TWB 18.
C: VIKO
D: I will take it.
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
N: The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy, hungry for support. But Danik scoffs.
C: DANIK
D: Tze ye yiyiy vuna.
E: BOSNIAK At Zlata
N: Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing.
C: KATHY
D: What did he say?
C: VIKO
D: She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.
C: CLARKSON
D: Alright, that's it. Everyone out.
C: KATHY
D: Isn't she filing a complaint?
E: at Clarkson
N: The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf. Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye. Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at Zlata, who lies helpless.
S: INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.
C: KATHY
D: She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions?
N: Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares.
C: CLARKSON
D: Quit it! You hear me?
N: Kathy reddens. The local cops look over.
C: CLARKSON
D: We are not investigators. We are monitors. You don't know a Serb from a Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic hatreds that started a war. This isn't just policing, it's diplomacy. TWB 19.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl.
C: CLARKSON
D: We don't run the show, we make sure the show runs smoothly.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING
N: Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out of her room, dolled up for the evening.
C: CARMEN
D: Come out. You can't solve this tonight. I'm not taking no for an answer.
S: EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT
N: Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.
S: EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order.
S: INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING
N: Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy.
S: INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top.
C: VIKO
D: Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman... They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this.
N: Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily...
C: VIKO
D: This is why you are here, no?
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes the files, flipping through them. Thinking... TWB 20.
C: KATHY
D: With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital... You can pull the records for every one of her visits.
S: INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY
N: A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files.
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.
C: KATHY
D: Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf.
S: INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING
N: Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.
C: KATHY
D: This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that?
N: Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.
C: KATHY
D: ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
N: Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.
C: KATHY
D: If an attorney presents this properly, referencing international standards, you might be able to get a conviction.
E: O.S.
N: Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last feeling they can really accomplish something.
S: INT. JAN'S OFFICE - ILIDZA STATION - DAY
N: Kathy comes inside, interrupting Jan and FRANZ, Dutch IPTF. TWB 21.
C: KATHY
D: Sorry, you wanted to see me?
N: Franz excuses himself, eyeing a tense Kathy. Jan closes the door behind Franz, turning to Kathy. All business.
C: JAN
D: Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
C: KATHY
D: What? Why?
C: JAN
D: I'm sure it's fine. You followed protocol, right?
N: Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret.
S: INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: Kathy sits alone in the office. Degrees, plaques, and awards cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated. MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair, British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash.
C: MADELEINE REES
D: Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.
N: Kathy eyes the malevolent hound.
C: KATHY
D: Ms. Rees, I--
C: MADELEINE REES
D: Madeleine. You've been stirring things up.
C: KATHY
D: Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've overstepped protocol--
C: MADELEINE REES
D: You have done in two months, what we've been trying to do for years.
N: Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens. TWB 22.
C: MADELEINE REES
D: All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you just facilitated the first conviction for domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty Officer who recommended you.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO GLASS TOWERS that punctuate Sarajevo's skyline.
C: MADELEINE REES
D: The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the current head, is leaving and I think you're the right person to take over.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy is taken aback.
C: MADELEINE REES
D: You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices. Any gender reports come through you. This involves anything from equality training to domestic and child abuse cases, fallout from war crimes against women, prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated like second class citizens. You could have a real impact on their lives. What do you think? Are you interested?
E: CONT'D
N: This is everything Kathy came to do...
C: KATHY
D: Absolutely.
S: INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT
N: Kathy paces, phone to her ear. Her suitcase open, she's packing at the same time. Carmen helps.
C: KATHY
D: I know hon, it's very exciting. If this works out. It's a real opportunity for the future, but it means I have to, I have to extend my contract for another six months... Hello?..
E: INTO PHONE
N: Kathy stops pacing.
C: KATHY
D: ...Erin?
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy pulls the phone close, listening. Carmen eyes her. TWB 23.
C: KATHY
D: No I didn't. I'll look right now.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE SCREEN: A PICTURE OF ERIN in a PROM DRESS. Kathy sits back, flushed with emotion. Her enthusiasm complicated by the realization of what she's missing back home. Softly...
C: KATHY
D: You look beautiful...
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
N: Carmen helps Kathy load boxes and suitcases into an SUV.
C: CARMEN
D: I can't believe they're moving you into the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your office?
C: KATHY
D: Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.
C: CARMEN
D: But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?
C: KATHY
D: I know. I don't even know if I'm still IPTF.
E: smiling
C: CARMEN
D: Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with the little people!
N: They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car.
S: EXT. SARAJEVO ROAD - NIGHT
N: Kathy drives into the CITY CENTRE.
S: INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kathy puts the last box down. She steps out onto the balcony. Looks out at Sarajevo, city of survivors, her new home.
S: EXT. UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS (UNMHQ) - SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: Member nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs. Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all. TWB 24.
S: INT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - MORNING
N: The modern lobby buzzes with UN OFFICIALS and DIPLOMATS. Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp.
C: RICK JONES
D: I'm glad to have an American in the mix. You'll be reporting to me.
C: KATHY
D: Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees' Office.
C: RICK JONES
D: It's a joint office. She's Human Rights. But you're Police Task Force. So you go through me. But we all report to Bill Hynes anyhow.
N: They walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS
N: Rick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess.
C: RICK JONES
D: Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files... We're waiting for Archives to get those out of here. I'll put another call in.
N: Kathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks of boxes, on papers and files strewn about.
C: KATHY
D: It's fine. Thanks for the tour.
C: RICK JONES
D: Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck.
N: He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's raring to go. She eyes a name plate: KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS. Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall. THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in the flickering fluorescent light. TWB 25.
S: EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT
N: Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open- doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.
C: JAN
D: I was wondering when you'd ask me out.
C: KATHY
D: It's not a date... No, seriously. It's not. I know you had a lot to do with my promotion, so I wanted to thank you.
N: He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.
S: EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER
N: Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).
C: JAN
D: Here's to not dating.
C: KATHY
D: Listen to me. I'm not joking around. You're a nice guy. But I...
N: The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.
C: WAITRESS
D: You are certain you have everything you need?
N: The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.
C: JAN
D: We're fine thank you.
N: The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.
C: JAN
D: You were saying I'm a nice guy--
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table.
C: KATHY
D: You must be in heaven over here.
C: JAN
D: The war left behind a lot of widows. TWB 26.
C: KATHY
D: You don't find that--
C: JAN
D: I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys don't. I don't know what else to say about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a nice guy but--
C: KATHY
D: I can't afford to mess this up.
C: JAN
D: It's only dinner. How bad can it get?
C: KATHY
D: Ask my two ex-husbands.
N: He grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry between them.
S: INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Rick introduces Kathy to various IPTF and UN colleagues.
S: INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS.
S: EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON
N: Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look up, their hands over their mouths, keening.
C: BARRY
D: This is the first time they've seen their homes in years.
N: IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on makeshift storm windows on her aparment. Kathy watches, Barry by her side.
C: KATHY
D: They're all widows?
C: BARRY
D: That's why they were so frightened to come back. TWB 27.
E: MORE
C: BARRY
D: They couldn't believe they'd be safe. That what happened before wouldn't happen again. Except now with nobody to protect them.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.
C: KATHY
D: Except us.
C: BARRY
D: I always thought helping refugees get home would be one of the best parts of the job. But it's so hard for them.
N: Kathy nods, moved.
C: KATHY
D: Thanks for taking me through this. Fill me in when you're done, and I'll send my report to Rick Jones.
N: Another FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face.
S: INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON
N: The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to... A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her surroundings, and... JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR. Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder. The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.
C: KATHY
D: It's okay, it's--
N: But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and then... SHE WAILS. Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her, trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs. Hopelessness in her eyes. And then... TWB 28. She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.
C: KATHY
D: Call a medic!
E: CONT'D at field worker
N: He rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death. Kathy holds her hand.
C: KATHY
D: Who is she?
E: CONT'D
C: FIELD WORKER
D: I found her out in the woods. She was speaking, I don't know, she's not local. I think she's one of the girls from the bars.
N: Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is... Raya. A long way from home. But then... THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA, 17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face bruised. Kathy looks up...
C: HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER
D: She was further back in the woods.
N: Irka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing...
C: IRKA
D: Florida Bar... Ciysh... Six girl there... Iy Policai...
E: ENGLISH/RUSSIAN
N: Kathy looks to Barry.
C: BARRY
D: It's a bar in the hills.
N: Kathy shakes her head. She looks at Raya and Irka.
C: BARRY
D: I'll take them to the women's shelter at Zenica.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy rummages through her files, catching up.
C: KATHY
D: Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.
N: Barry shrugs. Kathy's mind is racing. TWB 29.
C: KATHY
D: Where exactly is this bar?
E: CONT'D
S: INT./ EXT. - UN SUV - DAY
N: Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the opposite direction.
S: INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY
N: Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side. Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards... LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS. A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost... At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless. Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.
C: KATHY
D: What's going on here?
C: LOCAL COP
D: Xo brovnic ce klety scey forzcic nay.
E: SERBIAN
N: He moves past her, with the Girls in tow.
C: KATHY
D: Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring this raid?
N: SHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her.
C: TANJO
D: Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny Traba! Motherfockers!
E: SERBIAN
N: The cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls.
C: KATHY
D: Is that the owner? Are you taking him into custody? TWB 30.
C: LOCAL COP
D: Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky.
N: Kathy looks around, frustrated.
C: KATHY
D: Is there a translator on the scene? Translator?... Wait.
N: He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.
C: KATHY
D: This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.
E: CONT'D
N: The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls. WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH) Okay. I need a time and date.
C: KATHY
D: Now.
C: WALKIE VOICE
D: That's impossible. We need advance notice for field calls.
E: O.S.
N: The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him, but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward them, protectively, then sees... TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar. TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them. They seem surprised.
C: KATHY
D: Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Hey. Fred Murray.
N: He shakes her hand. Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder.
C: KATHY
D: Is that the owner? I tried to get an interpreter but--
E: off Fred's nod
C: FRED MURRAY
D: No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much done here anyway. TWB 31.
C: KATHY
D: Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office, saying they escaped from this place.
N: Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Yeah. Local police have been watching the place for a while. This whole thing happened pretty fast. I guess those girls must've run for it.
N: Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.
C: KATHY
D: Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones.
N: The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes, getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.
C: FRED MURRAY
D: You can see where they're taking them, but I can't intervene. You know the drill.
N: He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine start. Turning to it...
C: KATHY
D: Thanks. I'll look out for your report.
N: She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off. Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.
S: INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it. CUT WIRES hang over the stage. THE BAR AREA Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men, IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene.
C: KATHY
D: Jesus... TWB 32.
N: Kathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud. Kathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over. Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER! She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of electricity. Tiny sparks fly. She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And... PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls. She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file. Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled door. And pushes. It opens onto... STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage... The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal... At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with PADLOCKS. Smashed. Kathy pushes through the first door into...
S: INT. HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor. Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away. And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20... Some kind of RECORD. Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS. And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200... The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor. Kathy looks around, sickened.
S: EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT
N: A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you might think it was abandoned. TWB 33.
S: INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER
N: The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long- forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s, Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.
C: MILENA
D: These girls are told they have been bought and must repay the debt. They are told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll be let go when they earn back that money. But they never are.
E: ACCENTED ENGLISH
N: Kathy stares at her, taken aback.
C: MILENA
D: Sex trafficking is one of the worst things to happen after this war.
E: CONT'D
N: Milena hands over a medical report.
C: MILENA
D: Raya has a severe internal infection. The doctor found "intentionally placed foreign objects causing a disruption of the vaginal wall".
E: CONT'D reading
C: KATHY
D: Foreign objects?
C: MILENA
D: Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel deficient paying for sex, so they find other ways to feel powerful.
N: Milena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY... Hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding dripping leaks in the roof.
C: MILENA
D: We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is worried there could be something more serious.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: When will he know?
N: They pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain- smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak. TWB 34.
C: MILENA
D: Unfortunately that's all we can do for her. We're just a volunteer organization.
N: Kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...
C: KATHY
D: But if there are so many victims.
C: MILENA
D: We lost our funding because of those.
N: ...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee.
C: MILENA
D: It's the U.S. Department of State. They have their rules. I'll do anything to give these girls some protection. But the Department of State thinks "Condoms encourage prostitution." NGOs caught giving them out, no longer receive US funding.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: But these girls aren't prostitutes.
N: Milena shrugs.
C: MILENA
D: They don't realize the cycle they start. If there are no condoms in the bars...
N: They pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR TEENS. All broken. And desperate.
C: MILENA
D: ...the guys want to find ways of avoiding STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for virgins...
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone.
C: MILENA
D: So the traffickers bring more in. Younger and younger. Now it's a global industry. Simple economics. If there is demand, you supply.
E: CONT'D
N: Milena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed... TWB 35.
C: KATHY
D: Where can they get help?
C: MILENA
D: Try the Global Displacement Agency. They have good medical care, lots of funding. They might take them. Whether they'll keep them or not... I don't know.
C: KATHY
D: Where are the other girls from the Florida bar?
N: Milena looks at her. Blank.
C: KATHY
D: The local police were bringing them here.
E: CONT'D
C: MILENA
D: Those girls never arrived.
S: EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: UNMHQ stands over the crumbling red roofs of Sarajevo. In the foreground, a CEMETERY packed with crooked wooden crosses.
S: INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy walks in. Carmen sits behind a desk, piled with files.
C: CARMEN
D: Hey, where've you been?
C: KATHY
D: I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar yesterday.
N: Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer.
C: CARMEN
D: Your job is so exciting. The only thing I get to raid is the fridge. ... You sure there was a raid? There's no record here.
E: Reading off the computer
C: KATHY
D: No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken. TWB 36.
C: CARMEN
D: Sorry. No record of any raid.
N: Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up.
S: INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING
N: Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an OFFICE, and knocks.
C: KATHY
D: I'm looking for Fred Murray?
S: EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand- held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle. Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait... Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.
C: FRED MURRAY
D: We meet again!
N: Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.
C: KATHY
D: Is it okay for me to be here?
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Sure, sure. You're fine here on the gravel. What's going on?
C: KATHY
D: I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them.
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Turned out it was a local police mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or something. Thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses.
C: KATHY
D: Waitresses aren't kept under lock and key.
N: ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field. TWB 37.
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to get in there.
N: Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She watches him go.
S: EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY
N: Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV.
S: EXT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - DAY
N: A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice. Kathy's SUV pulls up front.
S: INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over the reception desk: GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY. The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999" Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996... LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away.
C: KATHY
D: Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will take them to the medical center. As soon as they get medical clearance we'll know where we stand.
C: KATHY
D: What do you mean?
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: Well, it's yet to be determined if they'll cooperate with the repatriation program. That's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA. TWB 38.
C: KATHY
D: They're critical... witnesses for a situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I understand. I'll be in touch.
C: KATHY
D: Will you be contacting their parents?
N: Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind...
C: KATHY
D: The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Women's Medica Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you have any idea where else they might have been taken?
E: CONT'D
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I didn't know there were any others.
N: Kathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look.
S: INT./EXT. UN SUV/GDA - NIGHT
N: Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then, cranks the wheel right.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road.

N: Laura in her office. HIGH MODERNITY. She works through her files. Opening one with Raya's photo on top. She dials.

D: Hello?
E: UKRAINIAN
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: Mrs. Kochan, I'm calling from the Global Displacement Agency in Sarajevo to confirm you have a daughter named Rayisa? TWB 39.
E: RUSSIAN
C: HALYNA
D: Yes. Yes!
E: RUSSIAN Straightening
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: We have located her...
N: Halyna falls into a chair, her chest heaving relief.
S: EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT
N: Kathy pulls up to a PARKING LOT full of CARS and UN SUVs. MUSIC spills out. BACK IN BUSINESS. She gets out of the SUV, moving inside...
S: INT. FLORIDA BAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers. Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off- duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where... Tanjo commands the scene, cheery, chatting with an IPTF OFFICER at the bar. Kathy stands, frozen , until she catches the eye of... Luba, sitting on the knee of a MIDDLE-AGED IPTF Officer. Kathy is filled with... anger.
S: INT./EXT. UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing: Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned... Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away.
S: INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kathy stands on the balcony. Taking in the cold air. A KNOCK.
C: JAN
D: Kathy, it's Jan.
E: O.S.
C: KATHY
D: Go home. TWB 40.
C: JAN
D: I don't understand. What's wrong?
E: O.S.
N: Kathy stands, quiet.
C: JAN
D: Let me in. Please.
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: Kathy waits a moment, breathing...
S: INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy paces as Jan struggles for words.
C: KATHY
D: How can you go up there, when you know what happens to these girls?
C: JAN
D: It was a good-bye party. I was--
C: KATHY
D: They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--
C: JAN
D: I know. If you let me finish, I got a call. Some friends needed a lift home because they got drunk. But hey lady, you better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel. The coffee shop down the street. The post office. My corner store. That's how it is here. I'm not interested, and I try and stay in clean places. And if you don't believe me, then fuck you.
N: He looks at her, hurt - He cares what she thinks. Kathy sees this. Something she hasn't felt in so long... Needed.
C: JAN
D: Are you okay?
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: No... I'm not okay. These girls... What are these guys thinking?
N: She looks at him, fighting the urge to trust him. Jan brushes a strand of hair from her face. She lets go. He pulls her in.
C: KATHY
D: Can you tell me what you know? TWB 41.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
N: Jan and Kathy in front of her computer. They're on an IPTF MESSAGE BOARD: Flashes of Various Posts: New Girl at the Berlin Bar; New Twelve Year-Old Pussy at the Old Grill. They scroll down dozens of posts. Kathy looks at Jan, shaken by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild.
S: INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT
N: Kathy watches Jan, asleep in her bed.
S: EXT. CENTRAL SARAJEVO - MORNING
N: Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo.
S: INT. GDA - MORNING
N: A DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form.

N: The phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer.
S: INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
N: Halyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles.
C: ZENIA
D: Roman will be home soon.
E: UKRAINIAN
C: HALYNA
D: Make your tea. I'll be quick.
E: UKRAINIAN
N: KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER Zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake. Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv.
C: HALYNA
D: Roman seems to be doing well.
E: UKRAINIAN CONT'D
C: ZENIA
D: Milk? TWB 42.
E: UKRAINIAN
C: HALYNA
D: I need to borrow money.
N: Zenia looks up, unsure.
C: HALYNA
D: They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go and get her. I don't need much.
E: CONT'D
N: Zenia nods, keeping still as possible.
C: HALYNA
D: Does he still hit you?
E: CONT'D
N: Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt. She wants so badly to say... but she can't.
C: HALYNA
D: You know I hate to ask. But she's my daughter... and your niece. Please--
E: CONT'D
C: ZENIA
D: I'll get you the money... But you have to go. Roman will be home soon. He won't give it to me if he knows it's for you.
S: INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - MORNING
N: Kathy watches Rick flip through her report.
C: KATHY
D: Fred Murray. There were other officers too. But the raid was not in the books. These girls were just sent back. They are clearly not waitresses. They are victims. I think IPTF were paid off to turn a blind eye.
C: RICK JONES
D: That's a serious allegation. And you don't have any evidence. I can't open an investigation based on a hunch.
N: He drops the papers.
C: RICK JONES
D: You're gonna need more than this.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. GDA BOSNIA - AFTERNOON
N: Raya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a document over to each of them. TWB 43.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: If you sign here, you confirm that you are voluntarily entering the repatriation program at the GDA.
E: RUSSIAN
N: Raya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly...
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: This means we can get you out of Bosnia. Isn't that what you want?
E: CONT'D
N: Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never thought this moment would come...
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: You'll stay here for two weeks, to continue medical treatment as well as psychological counselling. We'll give you a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to get started when you return.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly Irka's face drops.
C: IRKA
D: But... What do I do then? My parents were killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who sold me here... Can't I go somewhere else?
E: RUSSIAN
N: Laura fumbles.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: We can only send you home, but what you choose to do after that is up to you.
N: But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn.
C: RAYA
D: What about the others, the girls in the bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she couldn't... I don't know where she is... I can't go without her. Please...
E: RUSSIAN
N: Laura pauses, taken aback.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where you... could face charges for illegal prostitution.
N: Raya stares, reeling... To be made to feel like a criminal? TWB 44.
C: IRKA
D: I will sign.
N: Raya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back.
S: INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches... Fred Murray leading NEW RECRUITS through the halls. He jokes around, as the OFFICERS eye him with respect. The PHONE RINGS. Kathy turns.
S: INT. GDA - AFTERNOON
N: Kathy stands in disbelief. Laura is stern.
C: KATHY
D: Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a UN investigation. I thought we were all on the same team.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: Irka can stay. But I can't keep Raya here. She is refusing to cooperate in the repatriation program.
C: KATHY
D: Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then we can take it from there.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: We only house fourteen girls. It's a valuable spot.
C: KATHY
D: Two weeks. If she's going to testify, she's not safe anywhere else.
N: Laura shrugs, resigned.
S: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy sits across from Raya. A TRANSLATOR to the side, translates as Raya speaks.
C: RAYA
D: We were supposed to work in a hotel. Now... I can be charged with prostitution? TWB 45.
E: UKRAINIAN shaking her head
C: KATHY
D: There is another option... I want to help you find your friends. But you need to help me do that.
N: Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the table. Raya eyes it, defiant, no reason to trust her.
C: KATHY
D: None of this is your fault. I want to go after the people who hurt you. But I need to know exactly what happens. As a witness in UN custody, you will be protected and will not be charged for any crimes.
E: CONT'D
N: Raya stares, still not convinced.
C: RAYA
D: I...
N: The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to Kathy...
C: RAYA
D: UN will protect me? They don't protect me when they drink in bar and fuck me and my friends.
E: BROKEN ENGLISH CONT'D
N: Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw...
C: KATHY
D: I have a daughter, just your age... I wouldn't stop until I found her.
N: The two women stare at each other. A silent connection. Raya looks down, almost... ashamed. Struggling to get this out...
C: RAYA
D: I only left because... there was nothing, no jobs, no... chances. I was good in school. But with no money... My mother... She is on her own. She works so hard. But nothing changes. I thought I could help her. He said we would work in a hotel. With good wages...
N: Tears gathering in her eyes... It's terrifying to remember...
C: RAYA
D: But... When we got there... Other girls were there. Like us. From Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, everywhere... We were in the middle of nowhere. TWB 46.
E: CONT'D MORE
C: RAYA
D: Nobody could hear us... They... rape us... One girl go crazy, screaming... He shoots her. He shoots her right in the head. Then we was... sold. Like animal.
E: CONT'D
N: Raya is stopped by a rush of tears. Kathy reaches for her hand. Looking at this girl, so young... Raya looks Kathy squarely in the face. She slides the photo of Murray toward her.
C: KATHY
D: Do you know this man?
N: Raya nods.
C: RAYA
D: He is not the only one. They come every month. Tanjo give them money, so they don't raid the bar. That day you come... Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to punish him. Take his money. His girls. I ran...
N: Raya sobs, knowing she has betrayed the system. Betting her life on the hope that this system won't betray her.
S: EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - NIGHT
N: Milena leads Kathy through the halls.
C: KATHY
D: I need to get evidence. How many girls do you have here?
C: MILENA
D: At least thirty five.
N: MONTAGE: Kathy sits with GIRL after GIRL. Listening to their stories. Writing furiously... Kathy interviews EVA, 16. She talks through grateful tears.
C: EVA
D: ...Many of them come in. Uniforms like you. Different flags on the shoulders. I will testify. I don't care anymore. One brings cigarette. His name is Peter...
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
N: Kathy with a different girl, FADILA, 17. TWB 47.
C: FADILA
D: ...Sometimes if it's a party, a birthday, they pay for a group of girls, all together. Do whatever they want. Brian, the Irish guy, said Bosnia was better than Thailand for girls.
E: MACEDONIAN
N: Another girl, JASMILA, 18 - stunning, with haunted eyes.
C: JASMILA
D: The soldier from Italia say I was his girlfriend. I ask him to help me. But the bar owner pay him off. He has a tattoo of Tiger on his arm.
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
N: Yet another, NADIA, 14, nodding.
C: NADIA
D: Paolo come every week. He had a thin moustache, the other...here I have a picture...
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
N: Kathy wasn't expecting that. Nadia throws down a photo.
C: NADIA
D: He loved the Firecracker.
E: CONT'D
N: Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar. Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face.
C: NADIA
D: They burn me. Then they laugh.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength.
C: KATHY
D: Do you have any more pictures?
S: INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Kathy pins Nadia's photo on a large bulletin board. Steps back. The wall is covered in photos of girls. Kathy reaches for the phone. Dials.

C: KATHY
D: Erin. What are you doing? TWB 48.

D: Mom, are you okay?
E: O.S. CONT'D
C: KATHY

C: ERIN
D: Okay, can I go back to bed now?
C: KATHY
D: Yeah. Of course, I just... It's great to hear your voice.
S: INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Kathy stands before Rick's desk. He smiles at her, convivial.
C: RICK JONES
D: How're things?
C: KATHY
D: Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar. It's worse than I thought. There was a protection racket. IPTF... Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted. That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills.
N: Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished.
C: KATHY
D: I talked to thirty five girls at the Shelter. All this testimony can't be ignored. Our guys are patronizing the bars in large numbers. Rick, serious abuses are taking place. It's all in my reports.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy lays her stack of files on the desk.
C: RICK JONES
D: Okay, let's back up a second here-- TWB 49.
C: KATHY
D: I've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs--
C: RICK JONES
D: Testify where?
C: KATHY
D: In court.
C: RICK JONES
D: A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All International Personnel have immunity.
N: Kathy is stopped.
C: KATHY
D: I know. But there must be some channel, some exception--
C: RICK JONES
D: Look, you've done really good work here. These are serious allegations. Let me look into how to handle it. I'll get back to you.
S: EXT. OLD TOWN - SARAJEVO - EVENING
N: The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`.
S: INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him.
C: JAN
D: It's different for us. We're all military or police. Every contingent except for the U.S... if someone does something wrong, they have to answer to a military tribunal at home. With the Americans... your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have that.
C: KATHY
D: So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything?
C: JAN
D: To be honest, I think our superiors would keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen a military tribunal. TWB 50.
N: Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied.
C: JAN
D: You know my mission stay is up in a few weeks... You could come home with me.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: To do what?
N: She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter.
C: JAN
D: I was just... This place, y'know, it gets to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen to you a year from now.
N: She puts down her glass of wine, irritated.
C: KATHY
D: You don't need to worry about me.
C: JAN
D: Someone does.
N: She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's love.
C: KATHY
D: So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom?
C: JAN
D: In Bosnia, yes... but... I mean, something that public could get him sent home. And tried in his own country.
N: Kathy gets an idea.
S: EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - SARAJEVO - DAY
N: A crumbling edifice, once home to the world's finest, now a reminder of humanity's worst. INSIDE... Kathy walks with Madeleine, who unleashes Helen the hound.
C: MADELEINE
D: Helen loves it here. I think she has Olympic ambitions.
N: Kathy hands Madeleine the files. She flips through. TWB 51.
C: KATHY
D: I wanted these girls to testify in a trial against the IPTF officers. But--
C: MADELEINE
D: The immunity problem.
C: KATHY
D: Okay, but if the girls testify in a Bosnian court against their trafficker... Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else goes on in the brothels.
N: Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.
C: MADELEINE
D: It could work. If you make certain that in their testimony they mention every sordid detail of IPTF involvement--
C: KATHY
D: That is their testimony. Then it would be on record. Somebody would have to pay attention. Like...the State Department?
N: Madeleine grins, proud.
C: MADELEINE
D: They're gonna answer for this.
S: INT. BASEMENT - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Kathy weaves around the corner of a dimly lit, shabby hallway. She arrives at a doorway: VEHICLE DISPATCH.
S: INT. VEHICLE DISPATCH - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy talks to LEWIS, 20s, American.
C: KATHY
D: ...and the two girls have to go to the hospital to get immunized, or they can't stay in the country. I need an armored security vehicle.
N: Lewis looks at her, almost laughing.
C: LEWIS
D: You're lucky you have a car at all. We're stretched to the limit. Besides, isn't this a local police matter? Try them. TWB 52.
S: EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Kathy parks her SUV.
S: INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY

C: KATHY
D: I'm looking for--
N: Danik turns away...
C: DANIK
D: Viko... your American girlfriend is here!
E: BOSNIAK
N: Kathy eyes Danik. Viko comes out, smiling broadly at Kathy.
S: EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy and Viko walk out, energized with a sense of purpose.
C: VIKO
D: It's no problem. The Van is just sitting here. Let's go.
N: They arrive at a POLICE VAN. Kathy eyes it.
C: VIKO
D: It's not exactly armored, but it will do the trick. You follow me, yes?
E: CONT'D
N: He jumps in, and starts it up. Kathy follows in her UN SUV. Across the street, a LOCAL MAN watches from INSIDE A CAR.
S: EXT. GDA BOSNIA - EVENING
N: Kathy SWERVES up. Viko has the Van parked right up against the door. Kathy jumps out.
S: INT. FOYER - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER
N: Laura leads a very scared Raya out. Kathy smiles, gentle.
C: KATHY
D: Where's Irka?
E: at Laura
N: Laura takes a deep breath, eyeing Raya...
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I need to have a word with you. TWB 53.
N: Kathy looks at her watch -- at Raya. Viko taps her shoulder.
C: VIKO
D: I'll take her. Meet us when you're done.
N: As Viko and Raya leave, Kathy stops her...
C: KATHY
D: I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?
N: Raya nods, trusting in Kathy. Who turns, angry, back to...
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I was going to call you. There was a problem. During our repatriation procedures, we realized Irka had no passport.
C: KATHY
D: So we get her one. Where is she?
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: You don't get it. She was trafficked from Belgrade. Her parents were killed in Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She is a girl without a country.
C: KATHY
D: She is a witness for a UN investigation!
N: GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity.
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've already done every favour I could for you. This is not on me.
C: KATHY
D: You had no right to do that!
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: I had every right. We have a system that works here. You're the one disrupting it.
N: Kathy stares at her. Fuming.
C: KATHY
D: Where did they take her?
N: Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit. Just then the door opens. And... TWB 54. HALYNA Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising...
C: HALYNA
D: I... look for Laura Levin?
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
C: LAURA LEVIN
D: That's me.
E: RUSSIAN
N: Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting...
C: KATHY
D: If you know anything, this is on you.
C: INTERN
D: I think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad.
S: INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT

C: KATHY
D: I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago.
N: He shrugs, shaking his head.
C: KATHY
D: Can you check the border logs? She's about 15, the police brought her here but she didn't have a passport. Maybe--
E: CONT'D
C: GUARD

N: He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES.
C: GUARD

S: INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME
N: Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley.
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
N: Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up ahead... A SILHOUETTE. Kathy ACCELERATES.

N: Viko eyes the mirror. All clear. Turning onto a DESERTED STREET.
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

N: Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS forward. But.. GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT. The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window. Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails, SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate.
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
N: Kathy raises her arms, waving... Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights. TWB 57. Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks over, careful, slowly bending to help.

S: INT. BROWN VAN - SAME
N: IVAN, 40s, drives. Tanjo is in the passenger seat.
C: TANJO
D: We'll stop soon. We're far enough now.
E: SERBIAN
N: Ivan nods. Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on an overhead light, revealing... Five girls. Huddled in the back.
C: TANJO
D: So you want to testify?
E: RUSSIAN CONT'D
N: All the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away. TWB 59.
C: TANJO
D: It's okay. We all move to a new bar now. Somewhere no one will come look for you. Then we have a conversation.
E: CONT'D
N: The girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the light. The van drives off into the unknown.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING
N: Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the day. Then she sees... Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious.
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY
N: Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars.
C: KATHY
D: She's fifteen. I'm begging you--
C: FRED MURRAY
D: I don't know what you're talking about.
C: KATHY
D: If you know any of the other bars he owns, anything... I'm appealing to--
C: FRED MURRAY
D: Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time. And you can put this down in your investigation on me. I don't know what you're talking about.

S: INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - MORNING
C: MADELEINE
D: It's not your fault.
N: Kathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced.
C: KATHY
D: Irka won't testify now. It's completely understandable. She's way too scared. I just... I don't know what to do with her. The GDA won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city.
N: Emotion taking over...
C: KATHY
D: These girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system that's supposed to help them spits them right back out. It barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though it's a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows it. Are we supposed to wait around for that to change?
E: CONT'D
C: MADELEINE
D: Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy... Do you have a nice frock?
S: INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT
N: Kathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward.

N: She turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles.
C: JAN
D: You're beautiful.
N: But Carmen is tilting her head, doubtful.
C: CARMEN
D: You can stop standing like a farmer's wife for starters. These people are dignitaries. You gotta up your game.
N: She approaches her, and sweeps her hair up into an elegant chignon. She takes off her own earrings and puts them on Kathy. Jan nods, impressed. Kathy eyes herself, pleased. TWB 61.
S: INT./EXT. CAR/SARAJEVO HILLS - EVENING
N: A WHITE VOLKSWAGON RABBIT speeds though the Sarajevo hills. Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black dress, self-conscious.

C: MADELEINE
D: I call him Bill.
N: Kathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive...
S: EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER
N: The house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens, remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING. An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...
C: MADELEINE
D: Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?
E: familiar
C: JANET WELLS
D: We do what we can. Great to see you Madeleine.
N: Janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse.
C: MADELEINE
D: I hope you don't mind, I've brought along a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.
N: Kathy holds out her hand, a little nervous.
C: JANET WELLS
D: Great. I need as many gal pals as I can get. Look at this place.
N: She gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on Bill Hynes Surrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring. AMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back.
C: AMBASSADOR WELLS
D: What are your thoughts on dinner? TWB 62.
C: JANET WELLS
D: I think people are still busy drinking.

N: Madeleine looks at Kathy.
C: KATHY

C: AMBASSADOR WELLS
D: Coming right up. Madeleine, white for you?
E: nodding
N: Kathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in, chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of dignitaries.
S: EXT. BACK PATIO - U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT
N: A stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it, gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when...
C: MAN'S VOICE
D: Nice view, no?
E: O.S.
N: Kathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette.
C: KATHY
D: Oh I... I just needed some air.
C: PETER WARD
D: Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate these stuffy events. You never know anyone's agenda.

C: JANET WELLS
D: They just left her there? At the border? Poor girl... Just the psychological trauma. How can I help?
C: KATHY
D: She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking. Internationals got her in this situation. We owe her the chance to get out.
N: Janet is keen to follow, but a little lost.
C: MADELEINE
D: We want to repatriate Irka to the United States and find her a foster family. I was hoping you could use your influence--
N: Janet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically.
C: JANET WELLS
D: We're going to find her a home.
N: Kathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed.
C: KATHY
D: I also think the American embassy should be aware of some of the problems we're having with our officers.
N: Madeleine interjects...
C: MADELEINE
D: Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking.
N: Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the difference between a cop and a diplomat.
S: INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT
N: Kathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB. TWB 64.
S: EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY MORNING
N: Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road. He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him. In the van... Ivan rolls down the window.
C: BOY
D: Can I come with you?
E: SERBIAN
C: IVAN
D: Not today.
E: SERBIAN
N: The boy looks down, disappointed.

D: I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I had one like it.
E: SERBIAN
N: Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building.
C: TANJO
D: They're downstairs. I want to get them out today.
S: INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
N: Ivan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS GROW LOUDER as they descend into a BASEMENT TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door. Ushering Ivan INSIDE where... TWB 65. GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell. We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo waves his fingers, methodically...
C: TANJO
D: C'mon, let's go.
E: RUSSIAN
N: The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door.
C: TANJO
D: I want to show you what happens when YOU DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!!
E: CONT'D
N: They jump back. His scream echoes. They move THROUGH THE HALL To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a BARREN ROOM And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And we see that... Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.
C: RAYA
D: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
N: But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain. Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and drops... A PIPE onto the ground. The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.
S: EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNHCR - DAY

D: The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse. TWB 66.
E: MORE
C: MADELEINE
D: Ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. But because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. I'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the United States. I want to thank Janet Wells for her assistance in making this happen. I believe this can stand as a signal that the International community in Bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the International Community to intervene in Bosnia in the first place. Thank you.
E: CONT'D
C: REPORTER
D: Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking, how are you going to monitor it?
N: Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back, proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches.
S: EXT. FRONT STEPS - UNHCR - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success.
C: MADELEINE
D: Nothing on Raya?
N: Kathy shakes her head, saddened.
C: KATHY
D: I've sent an APB out to all police stations and UN field offices... But I'm pushing ahead with the other girls in Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo- line-up using the UN ID database, so they can identify all internationals involved. We've got to make them accountable.

C: KATHY
D: You've seen what they're doing.
C: CARMEN
D: I know. I know. I just, the stuff people are saying, I'm catching snippets, and I'm worried about you. Think about your kids.
N: Kathy is silenced. Then... A TAP ON HER SHOULDER...
C: MONITOR
D: Looking for you in Human Resources.
N: Carmen eyes Kathy, concerned. Kathy follows the monitor toward the exit. MONITORS and CIVILIANS buzz about, talking. But all around Kathy, the air is silent. Some IPTF OFFICERS eye her, coolly. Is she paranoid?
S: INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY
N: OFFICER BLAKELY smiles formally. Kathy shifts in her seat.
C: BLAKELY
D: I'm John Blakely, Human Resources.

D: See here? You can consolidate your leave. We'll contact our head offices in the U.K. and ensure none of your pay would be deducted... Just... Take a little vacation. Go home. See your kids. We're simply suggesting this out of concern for you.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: Are you suggesting I take time off. Or are you telling me?
C: BLAKELY
D: This is simply out of concern for you.
N: Kathy pushes her chair back, and leaves.
S: INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Kathy sits at the table, covered in photos of girls, flipping through the Dyncorp manual, irritated.
C: KATHY
D: Consolidate my leave... A fucking vacation?
N: She shakes her head, overwrought. Flipping through the manual, seeing...
C: KATHY
D: Who are these people? And why does Dyncorp, a company that sends American peacekeepers, have it's corporate headquarters in England?
E: CONT'D stopping on a page
N: She looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help.
C: KATHY
D: Of course I want to see my kids, of course. But... not like this. Not by being sent home like some hysterical woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to up and leave them. If I go home like this... It's like coming here, this whole thing was a... mistake. TWB 70.
E: CONT'D
N: She shakes her head, lost in thought... Maybe it was... Jan sits beside her, concerned.
C: JAN
D: Nobody who knows you could think that.
C: KATHY
D: Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects... It's one step forward, two steps back...
N: Jan tries to jump in. But--
C: KATHY
D: No, seriously. I'm just a cop from Nebraska. What do I know?
E: CONT'D
N: Jan shakes his head.
C: JAN
D: It's not what. It's who. You know them.
N: He points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over the table. Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and something much more instinctive...

E: RUSSIAN
N: Laura takes a second. Suddenly struck with an idea.
S: EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING
N: A large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains above the city of TUZLA. A VAN pulls up.
S: INT. OASIS BAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Raya, Luba follow Ivan up stairs. Ivan unlocks a BACK BEDROOM He bangs on a wall. FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He motions for them to go in. They do. TWB 71. MARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE DRAWINGS of SEXUAL POSITIONS. A price value by each.
C: MARA
D: You work in two hours.
E: RUSSIAN
N: Ivan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him. The other girls go about their business, barely noticing Raya and Luba. But JULIA and TANYA, 16, come over.

A sticky note on the first page: Insufficient Evidence. Kathy grabs another... Sticky note: Unreliable Witness. She sees the name NADIA at the top of the statement. She grabs...

C: JIM HIGGINS
D: Anyone know what this is about?
N: No one does. Kathy sits amongst the guys. Until... Rick walks up to the front.
C: RICK
D: I have some not so pleasant news, but bear with me. Lately, local police have raided some houses of `ill repute' and a number of `ladies of the evening' have been taken into custody. While the credibility of these witnesses is questionable, apparently photo line-ups have been made available to them.
E: Off a prepared statement
N: Rick eyes Kathy, pointedly.
C: RICK
D: This issue is currently receiving a lot of attention. Guys, you gotta be careful... Kathryn Bolkovac is heading up this investigation. If you have any questions refer them to her.

C: RICK
D: I'm not going to subject my men to this witch hunt based on the testimony of some hookers! Prostitution is illegal! Your witnesses are criminals.
N: Kathy can't believe what he's saying.
C: KATHY
D: They are SLAVES. By any American or International law. TWB 74.

D: Yeah? And how long do you plan on being around, because the last two guys who said that aren't here.
C: JAN
D: Don't.

C: JAN
D: They are. TWB 75.

S: INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING
N: Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall, focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS.
S: INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING
N: Kathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her, knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front.
C: MALE MONITOR
D: What can I do for you?
N: The Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then
C: KATHY
D: It's, I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official. I don't have a name, but--

S: INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY
N: Kathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s. He skims through the reports, nodding. TWB 76.

N: Kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid lunches and diplomats. She keeps her head low, focused ON THE ELEVATORS Ding. The doors open. Kathy steps in. As they close... TWO DIPLOMATS slip in. The elevator ascends. Kathy stares dead ahead.

N: Kathy stands at door 513. She takes a moment, then knocks.
S: INT. HOTEL ROOM - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative, unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world. He seems nervous.
C: KATHY
D: That was you today, in IA?
C: PETER WARD
D: Would you like a drink?
E: nodding
N: Kathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink.

D: Bullshit. Top Level Dyncorp commanders are walking into IA and removing your files. I've been told to shut down all your investigations.
E: CONT'D
C: KATHY
D: Why?.. There has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around--
C: PETER WARD
D: The United Nations. You're here.
N: Peter thinking about how to put this...
C: PETER WARD
D: Dyncorp's contract with the State Department in Bosnia alone is worth 52 million dollars. We're paid ninety, a hundred grand, right?. But it's a drop in the ocean compared to their profits. This is a global corporation, top five defense contractors in the states after Halliburton and KB&R. You think they're gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?

C: KATHY
D: Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--
C: PETER WARD
D: Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State Department. That includes you... So if something were to happen to you it wouldn't even make the news at home... No one would ever know... Poof. You're gone.
N: Kathy sits. Scared. Finally understanding the world she's in. O.S. VOICES. Kathy jolts. Peter moves to the door. THROUGH THE EYE-HOLE: A COUPLE checks in across the room. Peter turns back. Sees a panic-stricken Kathy. TWB 79.
C: PETER WARD

S: EXT. PARKING LOT - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY
N: Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched. TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to... HER SUV. Her pulse RACING. PARANOID. She checks around... The lot is empty. Quiet. She is alone.
S: EXT. UNITED NATIONS MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY
N: A row of international flags flap in the wind.
S: INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SAME
N: Kathy watches the flags. She shifts her gaze to the bulletin board. Eyeing the picture of Raya. Then... she moves to... THE FILE CABINET. She pulls out EVERY FILE. Photocopies them. Then... Opens the bottom filing cabinet -- pushes files to the front -- placing the copies in the back. She steps away... Closes the Cabinet. And locks it... Knowing she is operating outside of protocol now.
S: INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - EVENING
N: Raya stares at herself in a mirror. Dressed as a whore.
S: INT. OASIS BAR - EVENING
N: It's more of a medium-sized hall. A bar, some tables and a few `home touches'. Maps of Yugoslavia. Pictures of Tito. And FULL OF IPTF. Raya walks through, ogled. She sees... Luba, sitting on Mara's lap. Surrounded by TEN IRISH SOLDIERS. The soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them with charm. Luba blends in with remarkable ease.
C: RORY
D: You feel like a party?
N: RORY, Irish, grabs Raya's hand. TWB 80.
C: RAYA
D: Yes... of course.
E: forcing
N: He leads her to the back of the bar. Raya looks to Luba, but realizes she is alone. They walk through a BACK DOOR into a ROOM FULL OF BEDS SEPARATED with CURTAINS. We barely make out the shapes of various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. All busy. Until A curtain opens... And Jim Higgins walks out. His rite of passage complete. Rory pulls Raya to the cubicle, as Julia comes out.

CLOSE ON: RICK JONES + COLORADO SPRINGS 482 Matches for Rick Jones + Colorado Springs She scans down the page. None of the matches work. She shakes her head, about to give up, when...

N: An IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine..
C: MIKE SEARS
D: How's my favorite girl?
C: RAYA
D: I am good. Everything good.
N: She smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered. SUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT) I wanna party all night. The girls smile, nodding, playing along... SUIT 2 (AMERICAN) Let's go out. I wanna take you home. He squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily. SUIT 2 (CONT'D) Ivan! C'mere! Raya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host. SUIT 2 (CONT'D) We wanna party on mate. How much to take them home for the day? Ivan eyes the girls. Thinking... TWB 83.

N: He points at Raya.
C: IVAN
D: Three thousand each. You bring back, you get back deposit.
E: CONT'D off their scoffing

Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him. Julia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise.

D: Remember I can bring you back here the second you fuck up.
E: RUSSIAN
N: Mara nods. He shakes her hand. Ivan hands her a passport. She jumps into the car. It's an odd farewell. Ivan heads back to THE OASIS He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role. SUDDENLY... HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up. The two SUITS from last night appear at the door... Without the girls.
S: INT./EXT. KATHY'S UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER
N: Kathy slows... Seeing local police in the distance.

D: They had uniforms? Like mine?
N: The girls nod again. Absolutely sure. TWB 87.
C: JULIA
D: April 8. I never forget. The day I leave my home. We come to Bosnia some day later. I know because we stop at the border. We were six of us. Men from the border, they opened the doors... We give them our fake passports. My name was Irena Woycek. I thought they would see the fake passports, I thought...
N: She hesitates, the memories flooding back...
C: JULIA
D: I thought they would save us.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. GDA BOSNIA - DAY
N: Viko follows Kathy out.
C: VIKO
D: If there are records showing those girls came through the border with IPTF--
C: KATHY
D: Then you have conspiracy to traffick. And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's enough to do a raid that will stick.
C: VIKO
D: The main border station keeps the logs.
N: Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car).
S: INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT

S: EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson frolicking in foamy surf.
C: VIKO
D: So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep all this on file here? TWB 88.
C: BORDER COP
D: Of course! It's our fucking job!
C: VIKO
D: And other stations up the border send all their files to you?
C: BORDER COP
D: Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.
N: Disappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop.
C: BORDER COP
D: You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo? Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky guy in their archives loves to send files.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking...
C: BORDER COP
D: Okay, 11th... ... No, no. You like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian police do boring things?

D: You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in back. Stanley Harris.
E: CONT'D
N: He turns proudly to them.
C: BORDER COP
D: What you think? All his little sisters come to visit from America?
E: CONT'D
N: Viko looks knowingly at Kathy.
C: KATHY
D: That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.
N: He slaps a key. The file prints out on an old daisy-wheel printer. Kathy scans the pages...
S: EXT. BORDER STATION - MOMENTS LATER
N: Kathy and Viko hurry to the car.
C: KATHY
D: We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner. The border log corroborates the victims' testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid his place and get those girls out. TWB 89.
N: Kathy jumps INSIDE THE CAR...
C: KATHY
D: The raid has to be small. No-one knows the bar till we're on our way.

N: Bill on the edge of his desk. Kathy paces, frantic...
C: KATHY

C: BILL HYNES
D: Our resources are tight. I have to prioritize--
C: KATHY
D: This is real evidence. And that's just a drop in the ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos, corroborated statements. We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission--
E: holding the border logs
N: Bill shakes his head.
C: BILL HYNES
D: If I could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future.
C: KATHY
D: These girls--
C: BILL HYNES
D: Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War. It's nothing new. Every conflict produces them.
C: KATHY
D: You know as well as I do, those girls aren't a product of the war. TWB 90.
E: MORE
C: KATHY
D: They're a product of the peace. For the peace-keepers.
E: CONT'D
N: Kathy is repulsed. Bill takes a seat.
C: BILL HYNES
D: This is your first mission. You're eager. But we work in a very grey area and that can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to take the gloves off but they don't want us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking Catch-22. So what do we do? We prioritize. We do our best and we always look at the bigger picture. You're a mother. Fine. I see what you're doing with these girls. Maybe that's why you're thinking with your heart not your head. But you have a chance at a career in the international sector. Ride this out. Get a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia, Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And then, when you're running the show, you can implement whatever changes you see fit. But right now be smart and shut this bullshit down!
N: The veil is lifted. Kathy stands frozen. The blunt workings of the machine are laid bare.
S: EXT. PLAZA - UNMHQ - DAY

S: EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT
N: Viko pulls up to the bar. The UN SUV skids into the shadows. Viko and Danik go inside. Kathy glances back at her IPTF officers as they -- Pull their visors down, and WAIT -- Quiet -- Wind in the trees -- MUSIC ECHOING from inside as... Viko and Danik emerge, chatting with Ivan. Suddenly... Ivan jolts back -- COPS grab him -- He's YELLING -- HANDCUFFED -- Kicking. Punching -- They PUSH him into the VAN -- Viko SLAMS the door, turns to the UN van and nods...

C: VIKO
D: We have a warrant to search this premises. The owner of this bar Ivan Bladzic has been arrested and taken into custody for human trafficking.
N: The girls look at one another. Is this for real? The BARMAN steps forward... He looks like he's had a few drinks.
C: BARMAN
D: Fuck you!
N: Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear... Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction.
C: KATHY
D: You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now. TWB 92.
N: But the GIRLS don't move... Kathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees... Raya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One last shred left of the dream of escape... Kathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba. Then to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw...
C: BARMAN
D: These girls work here. They have all documents, passports! You can fuck off.
E: BROKEN ENGLISH
N: Two local cops GRAB him. Danik CUFFS him. The girls are astounded. Viko holds up passports.
C: VIKO
D: Fakes. Bad ones.
N: The barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending on Raya... her faith awakening.
C: KATHY
D: We want to get you out of here safely. That is my absolute priority.
N: The girls exchange a flurry of looks, speaking volumes... Should we trust her? Can we risk it?
C: KATHY
D: Get those blankets out of the vans. Let's get these girls out.
E: CONT'D To Viko
N: But the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with despair... After all she has been through, all the punishment, all the pain... Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced... And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When... Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears. He stares at Raya. Petrifying her. Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out of earshot of the others... TWB 93.

C: KATHY
D: You can all leave with me! Let's go.
E: CONT'D to Raya
N: Raya. With her heart breaking...
C: RAYA
D: No.
N: Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between Mike and Kathy... And she understands... Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall.
C: KATHY
D: Who the fuck are you? What have you done? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You fuck!
N: Mike pushes back...
C: MIKE
D: Get off me, you crazy bitch!

C: KATHY
D: I know this girl. I know her. We can't leave them here. We're supposed to--
C: VIKO
D: If they won't come, we can't force them. Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be returned and punished... Do you want blood on your hands?
N: The girls all return to their positions behind the bar, cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch... Kathy's eye. She glares at Mike Sears. Kathy watches across the room, devastated... As Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits to a back room.

N: Kathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild. Viko comes out the door, as it hits her like a blunt kick in the face: sheer helplessness... She TURNS - Fuck diplomacy, Fuck bureaucracy, Fuck protocol - and RUSHES back towards the bar. Viko stops her, grabs her... Kathy's eyes filling with tears she cannot cry -- Her heart breaking. Viko holds her tight, and pulls her away.

N: Halyna spits in his face. He smacks her. She lifts her hand to punch him, but he grabs it and pushes her out the door. ON THE STREET Halyna bends over, heaving. She runs at the door, banging on it. PEDESTRIANS stare. A lunatic's rage in Halyna's eyes. TWB 97.

N: Madeleine stops... seeing Kathy is overwhelmed.
C: MADELEINE
D: But there was something else Bill said... If this is coming from above... Kathy,you need to prove that they are dismissing you because you were uncovering wide- spread corruption within this mission. If you can prove that this is indeed coming from Washington, that the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire you. Then we're talking about a conspiracy.

D: Look, this is between you and me, but Dyncorp and the State Department... you know it's a dual thing, and this is the action they have taken, whether right or wrong... I'm being told to do this. TWB 108.
C: KATHY
D: So you're saying the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire me.

Locking the door behind them. They move DOWN THE HALL When Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal. IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into THE ELEVATOR Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag. An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns... TWB 109. Again slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined.
C: RICK JONES
D: I'm gonna tell you this in front of him and everybody else, you no longer have a UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You do not have a job with the Department of State.
