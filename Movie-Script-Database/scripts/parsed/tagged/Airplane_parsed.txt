D: You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
C: ELAINE
D: Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
C: STRIKER
D: You expect me to believe that?
N: In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is immediately run over by another electric cart.
C: ELAINE
D: It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

C: ELAINE
D: It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.

Longshoreman gives him a look and moves away cautiously. STRIKER (v.o.) I was afraid to approach her, but that night, fate was on my side. Elaine's dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to the grould. No one notices but Striker who eagerly fills in. They make a perfect disco couple. The other dancers make a circle around them. They begin with fancy disco steps, move on to flips and seemingly impossible acrobatics, finally ending with incredible stunts: Striker, jumping through flaming hoops and Elaine, hanging from a chandelier by her teeth and twirling.

When the wave recedes, they're still locked in the same embrace. They are covered with seaweed. Fish are flopping around in the sand.

D: Flight two-zero-niner to Denver radio. Climbing to cruise at forty-two thousand. Will report again over Lincoln. Over and out.
N: Joey has been paying very close attention to Murdock, and suddenly recognizes him.
C: JOEY
D: Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
C: MURDOCK
D: I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
N: He turns to Basta.
C: MURDOCK
D: Ah, Victor, why don't you get the coordinates on the altitude vector and find out the ratio of direct velocity over engine speed?
N: Victor is puzzled.
C: JOEY
D: You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
C: MURDOCK
D: I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
C: OVEUR
D: No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
C: MURDOCK
D: All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
N: He points to his nametag.
C: MURDOCK
D: I'm an airline pilot. Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
E: to Oveur
C: JOEY
D: I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

D: The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
N: Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers angrily.
C: MURDOCK
D: Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down the court for forty-eight minutes. Ah...Denver Control, this is Flight two- zero-niner continuing on a heading two- niner-niner...niner, ah...niner...niner.

N: Soft MUSIC begins.
C: ELAINE
D: Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

The chief is standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN who are making the jungle animal sounds. STRIKER (v.o.) They had never seen Americans before. When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands and the sounds stop. STRIKER (v.o.) At first, they didn't know what to think of us; but soon we gained their trust. The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake. Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased, Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker. STRIKER (v.o.) It really was a challenge during the year introducing them to our Western culture.

N: Striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree. STRIKER (v.o.) You must understand that these people had been completely isolated from civilization. Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He misses. STRIKER (v.o.) No one had ever outlined a physical fitness program for them and they had no athletic equipment. Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse dunk shot. STRIKER (v.o.) We also emphasized nutrition and taught them to watch their diets. Another native hits a long jump shot. STRIKER (v.o.) The exercise improved their physical fitness and condition. One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim. STRIKER (v.o.) My working with them seemed to reinforce our objectives of group cooperation and controlled-competitive activity. Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline. As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion.
C: STRIKER
D: I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
C: ELAINE
D: Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
C: STRIKER
D: A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
N: Elaine walks away, dejectedly. CAMERA STAYS with Striker as he pours Gator-Ade into a glass. STRIKER (v.o.) I guess it was at that moment that I first realized Elaine had doubts about our relationship. And that as much as anything else led to my drinking problem. Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

S: INT. COCKPIT - CO-PILOT'S SEAT - NIGHT
N: SOUND of rushing air as instantly inflatable balloon pilot takes shape in seat with hands on wheel. His uniform and cap are painted on, and he has an alert "leave the driving to us" expression on his face. The plane immediately regains level flight, and Elaine and Rumack sigh in relief.
C: DR. RUMACK
D: I'll get back to the passengers.
N: Rumack exits. McCROSKEY (v.o.) (over radio) Come in two-zero-niner. This is Chicago. Flight two-zero-niner, come in, please. Elaine picks up mike while still standing.
C: ELAINE
D: This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble. Over.
N: OVEUR (o.s.) Groan! McCROSKEY (v.o.) Elaine! Roger, Roger! I read you. This is Steve McCroskey at Chicago Air Control.
C: ELAINE
D: Hi, Steve!
N: McCROSKEY (v.o.) Now listen carefully. Is the automatic pilot on? Over.

S: INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT
N: McCROSKEY (into mike) All right, Elaine. Just hold on. We'll be back to you in a minute. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal dispatch is a beehive of activity. The Chief Dispatcher, STEVE McCROSKEY, is barking orders to AIR CONTROLLER #1. McCROSKEY Hold all takeoffs. I don't want another plane in the air. When the 508 reports, bring it straight in. Air Controller #1 exits quickly. McCroskey picks up phone. McCROSKEY Put out a general bulletin to suspend all meal service on flights out of Los Angeles. He hangs up phone and talks to AIR CONTROLLER #2. McCROSKEY Tell all dispatchers to remain at their posts. It's going to be a long night. Air Controller #2 exits. McCroskey notices he is out of coffee and turns to AIR CONTROLLER HINSHAW. McCROSKEY And how about some coffee, Johnny?
C: HINSHAW
D: No thanks.
N: AIR CONTROLLER #3 enters. McCROSKEY I want the weather on every landing field on this side of the Rockies, no matter what the size. Air Controller #3 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #4 enters. McCROSKEY Do you understand? Air Controller #4 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #5 enters. McCROSKEY Any place where there's a chance to land this plane. Air Controller #5 exits. SIAMESE TWINS enter. McCROSKEY Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a runway diagram. Terry, check down on the field for emergency equipment. Siamese Twins leave. In the b.g. we see them trying to walk in opposite directions. Air Controller #1 enters. AIR CONTROLLER #1 Chief, there's fog down to the deck everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no possible place they can land. They'll have to come through to Chicago. McCROSKEY Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. He lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and leans on his hands. McCROSKEY I want the best available man on this. A man who knows this plane inside and out and won't crack under pressure.

N: McCROSKEY Get me Rex Kramer!
S: EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

S: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
N: Elaine is in the pilot's seat and the inflated automatic pilot is in co-pilot's seat. McCROSKEY (v.o.) Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge. What speed does it indicate?
C: ELAINE
D: Three hundred twenty miles per hour.
N: INSERT - AIR SPEED GAUGE BACK TO SCENE We see, but Elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate. McCROSKEY (v.o.) Good. Now check your altitude. That's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator.
C: ELAINE
D: Thirty-five thousand feet.
N: INSERT - ALTIMATER Altitude is dropping. BACK TO SCENE
C: ELAINE
D: No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast! Why is it doing that?
N: By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile. Elaine notices it.
C: ELAINE
D: Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's deflating!
N: McCROSKEY (v.o.) All right, Elaine, don't worry. We have an auxiliary inflation system. Just follow my instructions.
C: ELAINE
D: Okay, but please hurry! We're dropping fast!

N: Rumack starts toward cockpit.
S: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
N: McCROSKEY (v.o.) Now, Elaine, don't panic. On the belt line of the automatie pilot there is a hollow tube. Can you see that?
C: ELAINE
D: Yes. Yes, I can see it.
N: McCROSKEY (v.o.) Good. Now that's the manual inflation nozzle. Pull it out and blow it up like a balloon. Elaine kneels over automatic pilot's crotch, puts tube in her mouth and blows. Automatic pilot inflates. Rumack bursts into cockpit. RUMACK'S POV Back of automatic pilot with Elaine kneeling over its crotch.

S: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
C: ELAINE
D: No. No one that I know of.

N: Passengers are listening to P.A. ELAINE (v.o.) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your stewardess speaking. We regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement might have caused. Randy drags unconscious pilot, Oveur, down center aisle. ELAINE (v.o.) This is due to periodic air pockets we encounter. There is no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on Â­board who knows how to fly a plane? Absolute pandemonium. Passengers are yelling, screaming, tearing their hair out and climbing around. A naked woman runs down the aisle. Sister Mary is choking a Krishna. Two passengers are dueling with swords. A Spanish-speaking lady waits for her husband to translate the announcement, then panics.
S: INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE
N: SOUND of car screeching to a stop. PAUL CAREY, twenty-four year-old, cleancut, naive-looking, navigator trainee enters and pushes doorbell. We HEAR the typical eight-note chime progression. The CHIMES then play the Air Force Fight song. A dog BARKS and MRS. KRAMER opens the door.

C: MRS. KRAMER
D: Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
C: CAREY
D: Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
E: holding off dog
C: MRS. KRAMER
D: Something about a plane with no pilot?
N: Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to remain polite.
C: CAREY
D: Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
C: MRS. KRAMER
D: Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
N: Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his Jaws.
C: CAREY
D: Well...the airline business...does have... its moments...
N: Shep pins Carey against the wall, ripping his sleeve.
C: CAREY
D: ...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
E: gasp
C: MRS. KRAMER
D: Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
N: We hear a THUD and loud growling.
C: MRS. KRAMER
D: Are you a pilot yourself?
N: Carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog, which is on top of him.
C: CAREY
D: I'm...in a...argh...navigator training program.
N: KRAMER enters, buttoning his coat.
C: KRAMER
D: It's unbelievable! How many times have I warned those people about food inspection?
N: Kramer is tying his tie in the mirror. In the corner of the mirror, Carey is being thrashed by the dog.

D: You see, the day we left the village it was raining, so we had to take a special jeep to the main road...
N: The Indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline. In b.g. Randy is talking to passengers.
C: STRIKER
D: In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down -- it had a bad axle...
N: The Indian lights a match to immolate himself. Randy approaches.
C: RANDY
D: Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
C: STRIKER
D: The cockpit? What is it?
C: RANDY
D: It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
N: The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome.
C: STRIKER
D: Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
C: RANDY
D: Would you go up, please?
N: He has a moment of indecision. The Indian encourages Striker with an adamant nod. Striker gets up to leave. The Indian, relieved, blows out the match.

D: I am serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
C: STRIKER
D: Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...all together!!!
C: RANDY/RUMACK
D: It's an entirely different kind of flying.
E: all together
C: STRIKER
D: Besides, I haven't touched any Â­kind of plane in six years.

N: Phone RINGS. AIR CONTROLLER #2 Chief? McCROSKEY We'll need a pre-landing flight check. Tell 'em I'm in the dispatch office and I want it here fast. AIR CONTROLLER #2 It's your wife. McCROSKEY (into phone) I want the kids in bed by nine. I want the dog fed, the yard watered, and the gate locked. And get a note to the milkman -- no more cheese! He slams dowm the phone. He leans his hands on the desk. McCROSKEY Where the hell is Kramer? On the wall behind him there is a picture of McCroskey leaning his hands on a desk.

D: Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot. Thousand to one. I know this guy.
C: CAREY
D: You do? Who is it?
N: We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.
C: KRAMER
D: His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him during the war. And that won't make my job any easier tonight.
N: REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION.
C: KRAMER
D: Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up to a point. But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. Maybe you know the kind.
N: Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel.
C: KRAMER
D: It takes a certain type to perform under pressure. Striker didn't have it.
N: By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback chasing and shooting at Kramer's car.
C: KRAMER
D: Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight.

D: All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.
N: Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair of sunglasses.
C: KRAMER
D: As you know, I flew with this man, Striker, during the war. He'll have enough on his mind without remembering those days when -- well, when things weren't so good.
N: McCROSKEY Well, right now things aren't so good. And while we're talking there are a hundred and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a decision.

D: Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long time ago...
N: A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer.

D: ...but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's gonna fold up.
N: McCROSKEY Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn and talk this guy down! You're going to have to let him get the feel of this airplane on the way; you'll have to talk him onto the approach; and so help me, you'll have to talk him right down to the ground!

S: EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
N: flying erratically.
S: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
N: KRAMER (v.o.) (matter of factly) Just remember, the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter. Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit. KRAMER (v.o.) Don't worry about that. It's perfectly normal. You must watch your airspeed closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag, but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below 154. Now there's one other thing. Have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying?
C: STRIKER
D: Yes! The stewardess is here with me!
N: Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at engineer's console. KRAMER (v.o.) Have her take the co-pilot's seat. Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the plane. He hands Elaine the mike.

D: After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
C: BERNICE
D: Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
C: MILTON
D: But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
C: BERNICE
D: Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
C: MILTON
D: I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
C: BERNICE
D: I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
C: MILTON
D: You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

I want to tell you something I've kept to myself for years. I was in the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was on duty late one night when a badly wounded pilot was brought in from a raid. He could barely talk, but he looked at me and he said, "Doc. The odds were against us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm glad we did. The captain made the right decision."

I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."

D: I'll take it, Elaine.
N: She turns to face him. A dramatic moment. Striker enters pilot seat and takes mike from Elaine's hand.

D: Listen to me, Kramer. Doctor Rumack says the sick people are in critical condition and every minute counts. We've got to land now!
N: KRAMER (v.o.) Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what a landing like this means. You more than anybody. I'm ordering you to stay up there!
