S: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY
N: Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight on him. The rest of the stage is dark. Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter of factly.
C: STEPHEN
D: I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution... A pause. Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
N: We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.
C: DIRECTOR
D: Hang on...let me open these up.... We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS
C: ROUTINE. DIRECTOR
D: Okay...
E: CONT'D
N: Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage. Stephen continues.
C: STEPHEN
D: I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in...
N: The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He keeps going.
C: STEPHEN
D: If I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me. To the Director.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: You got it?
E: CONT'D
N: His podium light comes back on. No answer from the Director, Stephen continues.
C: STEPHEN
D: If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not...
E: CONT'D
C: DIRECTOR
D: Okay got it, thanks.
C: STEPHEN
D: Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear.
C: STAGE MANAGER
D: You got it.
C: STEPHEN
D: Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.
C: STAGE MANAGER
D: No I know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under...
C: STEPHEN
D: Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours.
N: We see we're in an auditorium of a college. Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer.
C: BEN
D: I didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear...
C: STEPHEN
D: He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium.
N: They walk off...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - DAY
N: ROB BRAUN, a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building. Under this we hear Rachel Maddow reporting.
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: Well it all comes down to this...We are one week away from the Ohio primary... Camera now moves past ROB to another news truck where an MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go live. There is a monitor in front of him. The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW does the lead in.
E: O.C.
N: As RACHEL's audio continues we see the following images.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MIDDLE AMERICA
N: We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray, desolate. In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white- and-blue letters painted on the side. They read "OHIO FOR MORRIS".
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: Two democrats are left standing. Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is trailing Governor Morris from Pennsylvania.
E: O.S.
N: Moments later we roll past another farm with a large billboard staked into the ground beside the road: "PULLMAN - AMERICA'S FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th".
S: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET
N: We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold - knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood. Yard signs for both candidates line the street.
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: Governor Morris has mounted a sizable lead with 2047 delegates, winning New Hampshire, California, New York and Michigan...But Senator Pullman with 1302 delegates is still in the hunt having won Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and Missouri...
E: O.S.
S: EXT. CITY INTERSECTION
N: Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars: "HONK FOR MORRIS". A passing car lays on the horn and the supporters cheer.
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: A win in Ohio could turn it all around for the Arkansas Senator...
E: O.S.
N: CLOSE UP of a Pullman bumper sticker on an SUV at a stoplight, right next to a "My Child is an Honor Student" decal.
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: So one week from Tuesday the all important hundred and eighty one Ohio delegates could be the deciding factor.. EXT. HARDWARE STORE
E: O.S. CONT'D
N: A clerk placing a Morris sign in the store window. In the shop next door various TV's are in a window display. We see RACHEL MADDOW'S report on them.
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: And once again the old adage is true..."As goes Ohio, so goes the Nation." CUT TO:
E: O.S.
S: EXT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AFTERNOON
N: We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc. At a catering truck, MOLLY STEARNS, a 19 year old intern grabs a tray of coffees and a box of doughnuts. We stay on her as she runs across the street and through a door...
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - RAPID RESPONSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: MOLLY enters and we follow her through the campaign war room, it's the size of a coffin, jammed to the hilt with twenty- something staffers manning laptops. We're in the hustle and bustle of a live telecast. We see multiple angles of the telecast...
C: SENATOR PULLMAN
D: Would you call yourself a Christian?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: How would that matter?
C: SENATOR PULLMAN
D: "I have no idea what happens when we die, maybe nothing...maybe it was like before we were born." You did write this Governor...
E: READING
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Then let me try and clarify...I was raised Catholic, I am not a practicing Catholic...I have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President. I'll even vote for him.
N: The audience laughs.
C: SENATOR PULLMAN
D: Is that your idea of being specific?
N: MOLLY passes out coffee.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
N: We're now live inside the debate.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Let me be more specific. I am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, I'm not Jewish or Muslim...what I believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution. Meaning I will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. I believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. That's my religion. If you feel that I'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. If you feel I'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. Because I'm not going to change those to get elected.
C: SENATOR PULLMAN
D: I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Is this a Democratic primary or a general election?
N: People laugh.
C: SENATOR PULLMAN
D: Well Governor, whoever wins this contest will be running for President...and if you don't think that these questions won't be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land. I applaud your honesty Governor, I do...I'm simply pointing to what is obvious...we are running for President of the United States...not for student council president.
E: ON MONITOR
S: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
N: PAUL ZARA - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage. STEPHEN sidles up next to him. In the background we can see the candidates shaking hands. There is applause. PAUL is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between him and Governor Morris. Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage.
C: PAUL
D: A double?
C: STEPHEN
D: A double.
C: PAUL
D: Fucking national security. The GOVERNOR looks off stage to PAUL and STEPHEN for approval.
C: PAUL
D: Outta the park.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: Home run. We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate. TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy. He walks over to Stephen and Paul.
C: DUFFY
D: I'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before...
C: PAUL
D: Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before.
C: DUFFY
D: Must've been you that did the prep work. Paul's not that clever.
E: TO STEPHEN
C: PAUL
D: You always had the brains Duffy, but me - I always had the balls.
C: DUFFY
D: Looks like you got some brains now too. Be careful. I just might have to steal him from you. Duffy walks off to greet Senator Pullman as he makes his way to the wings. Paul and Stephen eye him as he goes.
E: nodding to Stephen
C: PAUL
D: What a prick.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CINCINNATI RAMADA INN - THE BAR - NIGHT
N: Stephen, Paul, Ida, and Ben are having drinks around a table. The mood is festive. There is a piano player playing, singing. PAUL has a roll-away suitcase beside him.
C: IDA
D: So Paul, tell me something I don't know...tell me what's gonna happen on the 15th.
C: PAUL
D: Ha-ha.
C: IDA
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: What do you think Stevie?
C: STEPHEN
D: It's ours for the taking.
C: PAUL
D: Ben?
C: BEN
D: We'll win.
C: PAUL
D: What do you think Ida?
C: IDA
D: I'm asking you.
C: PAUL
D: You tell me and I'll tell you.
C: IDA
D: If had to say, I'd say it'll be close, but you'll eke it out.
C: PAUL
D: Eke?
N: To STEPHEN.
C: PAUL
D: You see, she's trying to get under my skin.
E: CONT'D
C: IDA
D: So what's gonna happen?
C: PAUL
D: Us by nine.
C: IDA
D: Nine? There's no way you'll win by nine.
C: STEPHEN
D: At least. Maybe more.
C: IDA
D: So you're certain you're gonna win here?
E: To PAUL
C: PAUL
D: Certain? No. Confident? Yes.
C: IDA
D: You just said you'll win by nine.
C: PAUL
D: And I think we will, but I won't tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. Don't get me wrong. Six presidentials I've done and I've never felt this good. But am I gonna sit here and say "Yes -we will definitely win Ohio"? Not a chance. In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president. How many have won? Three.
E: MORE
C: PAUL
D: That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
E: CONT'D
C: IDA
D: So you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.
C: PAUL
D: Don't twist my words. What I'm saying is that I'm not going to promise we'll win. But he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second. He left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. And that Ida, is the state of the union. And on that note, I'm gonna take a shit. PAUL swigs down the rest of his drink and exits.
C: IDA
D: So Stephen...
C: STEPHEN
D: Yes Ida?
C: IDA
D: Stephen, Stephen, Stephen....
C: STEPHEN
D: Here it comes...hit me.
C: IDA
D: Paul's going to the airport?
C: STEPHEN
D: Yes?
C: IDA
D: Getting on a plane.
C: STEPHEN
D: Mmhmm.
C: IDA
D: Where is that plane going?
C: STEPHEN
D: Three guesses.
C: IDA
D: Not going back to headquarters.
C: STEPHEN
D: Correct.
C: IDA
D: He's not going to Texas?
C: STEPHEN
D: No need, we'll split Texas, it's a wash.
C: IDA
D: What if I said North Carolina?
C: STEPHEN
D: That's your guess?
C: IDA
D: He's going to North Carolina.
C: STEPHEN
D: I will neither confirm nor deny that statement.
C: IDA
D: I knew it. Now tell me why.
C: STEPHEN
D: That I cannot do.
C: IDA
D: I hate you.
C: STEPHEN
D: You love me.
C: IDA
D: I love Paul. You I hate.
C: STEPHEN
D: You only love him because he gives you all the scoops.
C: IDA
D: Sexual favors?
C: STEPHEN
D: You're engaged.
C: IDA
D: If it meant a good scoop my fiance would understand.
N: Beat.
C: IDA
D: You really buy into all this crap? All this take back the country nonsense?
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: Ida I'm not naive about this stuff. I've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty...I'm telling you this is the one.
C: IDA
D: You really have drunk the kool-aid.
C: STEPHEN
D: I have drunk it it's delicious. I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.
C: IDA
D: Or what? The world will fall apart? It won't matter...Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again. If your boy wins...You get a job in the white house...If he loses you're back at a consulting firm on K Street...That's it. You used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy. Morris is a politician...He's a nice guy...They're all nice guys.
E: MORE
C: IDA
D: He will let you down...sooner or later.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RAMADA INN SIDEWALK - LATER
N: IDA and PAUL walk to Ida's car.
C: PAUL
D: This is off off off the record.
C: IDA
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: Franklin Thompson.
C: IDA
D: Seriously?
C: PAUL
D: Off the record. The only people who know are the Governor, Stephen and me.
C: IDA
D: My lips are sealed.
C: PAUL
D: I have a meeting tomorrow at Thompson's house.
C: IDA
D: He's gonna endorse?
C: PAUL
D: After I'm done talking with him, what do you think?
C: IDA
D: That's huge.
C: PAUL
D: It's more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates...they all travel with him. That puts us over the top.
C: IDA
D: He's said publicly he's not gonna endorse anyone.
C: PAUL
D: That's what they all say until we get them alone in a room.
C: IDA
D: So this is for real?
C: PAUL
D: Yup. It's just about in the bag.
C: IDA
D: When are you gonna announce?
C: PAUL
D: Nope. That's all you get for now. CUT TO: EXT. MORRIS HEADQUARTERS - CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY
N: Establishing shot.
S: INT. MORRIS HEADQUARTERS - CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY
N: Ben walks around to all the staffers, he hands out new cell phones.
C: BEN
D: Okay so listen up...these are your new cell phones...Shelly has pre- programmed everyone's numbers in...thank you Shelly...no personal calls...if you lose them, Paul has authorized me to kill you. Ben walks into Stephen's office and hands him his new phone.
C: BEN
D: New phones...
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: I'll get it in a bit...
N: As Ben leaves, we see that Stephen is looking at early footage of Governor Morris. Another staffer and an editor are watching it with him. Outside the office we can see other staffers, through the glass partitions, running around in campaign mode. We see some of the footage.
C: GOV MORRIS
D: The economy...health care...I've got to believe we can do it. We have enemies...we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies, and see if there is something we can do about that besides using force. What we know from history is the answer to extremism is not extremism. Whoever is the next president, whoever steps up, has got a lot of work to do, but you have a little work to do yourself. Stephen hits pause.
E: ON MONITOR
C: STEPHEN
D: Fucking kill me...where did we get this?
C: EDITOR
D: Before he announced at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania...
C: STEPHEN
D: Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it -
C: EDITOR
D: It plays to his base, if-
C: STEPHEN
D: Are you fucking stoned...this is the same...the exact same piece the Republicans are gonna run against him in the general...we don't need to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville Chamberlain and I want to be your commander in chief.
C: EDITOR
D: If it's gonna come out-
C: STEPHEN
D: It's gonna come out but not paid for by us pal. Any truth on whether Pullman had investments in those diamond mines in Liberia?
E: To Staffer
N: STAFFER 1 We're still checking...it was a blog so who the fuck knows...
C: STEPHEN
D: Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win.
N: STAFFER 1 Okay.
C: STEPHEN
D: We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting.
C: EDITOR
D: Got it. The Editor and staffer exit.
N: Stephen turns to his computer and types as Molly walks in and hands him some papers.
C: MOLLY
D: Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting.
C: STEPHEN
D: Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this.
C: MOLLY
D: Anything interesting?
C: STEPHEN
D: Just some white paper I gotta pass out tonight.
C: MOLLY
D: White paper?
C: STEPHEN
D: Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite.
C: MOLLY
D: So like what sort of negative stuff?
C: STEPHEN
D: Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see.
C: MOLLY
D: Which paper?
C: STEPHEN
D: All of them.
C: MOLLY
D: So it's something big?
C: STEPHEN
D: I wish it were something bigger actually. Just some transportation numbers. I'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick.
C: MOLLY
D: Well that's what you're good at, right?
C: STEPHEN
D: I guess.
C: MOLLY
D: Did you get your phone?
E: Holding up her phone
C: STEPHEN
D: Just now.
E: Holds his up
C: MOLLY
D: It's exciting isn't it?
E: MOCK SERIOUS
N: He looks at her.
C: STEPHEN
D: You a Bearcat...?
C: MOLLY
D: A what?
C: STEPHEN
D: A Cincinnati Bearcat?
C: MOLLY
D: Oh no...I'm not from here...I worked with you in Iowa actually.
C: STEPHEN
D: Oh that's right...but you changed something.
E: Searching for a way out.
C: MOLLY
D: My hair?
C: STEPHEN
D: You changed your hair.
C: MOLLY
D: No..
E: ENJOYING THIS
C: STEPHEN
D: I must look like a total dumb ass right now.
C: MOLLY
D: Not at all...you're the big man on campus...I'm just a lowly intern.
C: STEPHEN
D: Come on it's not like that.
C: MOLLY
D: Sure it is...you get to stay at the Millennium, they put us into a motel on the other side of the river.
C: STEPHEN
D: You're right, I am big man on campus.
C: MOLLY
D: Now you're starting to see. She starts to leave.
C: MOLLY
D: We do have the better bar though.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: I heard that.
C: MOLLY
D: You ought to stop by one night and have a drink with the worker bees.
C: STEPHEN
D: Maybe I will...when's a good night?
C: MOLLY
D: Tonight's good...
C: STEPHEN
D: Really? Tuesday?
C: MOLLY
D: Yeah it's quiet.
C: STEPHEN
D: Quiet's good.
C: MOLLY
D: Well you have my number.
C: STEPHEN
D: I do?
C: MOLLY
D: Programmed right there in your phone.
C: STEPHEN
D: Oh...right...
E: He opens the phone
C: MOLLY
D: Under Mary.
C: STEPHEN
D: Yup...Mary.
E: Looking at the phone
N: Molly laughs. Then, as she exits:
C: MOLLY
D: Molly...my name's Molly... Stephen smiles to himself. CUT TO:
S: INT. SENATOR THOMPSON'S HOUSE - CHARLOTTE N.C. - DAY
N: We follow a housekeeper down the hallway and into the living room where we see Paul sitting with, Senator Thompson.
C: SENATOR THOMPSON
D: That's what I'm hearing...since Super Tuesday I'm a very popular guy. What are your polls telling you?
C: PAUL
D: That Pullman's negatives are high...mid forties. Senator we have an open seat in the White House and the Republicans don't have dick. They're disorganized and they can't find a nominee that isn't a world class fuck up. They look like Democrats. No Republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy. But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod they'll show up to vote against him.
C: SENATOR THOMPSON
D: And so you think they won't for your guy...you think Morris gets into the independents?
C: PAUL
D: I sure do. Senator...I'm a bit confused...we need your delegates...we need you...your fund raising. It was my understanding that...your endorsement a week before Ohio...would win this for us...
C: SENATOR THOMPSON
D: Estella...hand me that ice bucket.
E: Looks to his aide
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. MORRIS HEADQUARTERS - CINCINNATI - SAME DAY
N: We're in a staff meeting with the brain trust. Paul's gone but the rest are there...STEPHEN, BEN, GOVERNOR MORRIS. MOLLY is running in and out, she gets glances from all the guys.
C: STEPHEN
D: Paul knows...Paul agrees...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Ben, where's my op ed on national service? It's better for me to work off of that.
C: BEN
D: Got it right here.
E: He opens his laptop.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Get me a hard copy...I hate these fucking things...
C: STEPHEN
D: Print it out.
C: BEN
D: I'll get it printed. Molly, I'm printing out this op ed...can you grab it off the printer?
C: MOLLY
D: Be right back.
C: STEPHEN
D: Governor...if you want to change...or lets call it refresh...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Just give me a second...
C: STEPHEN
D: National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I don't give a shit about polling...I'm not going to play this game with you Stephen...and if this is your good cop bad cop act with Paul...
C: STEPHEN
D: Good cop, good cop.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I'm not changing it.
N: MOLLY returns and hands the Governor a copy.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Hang on.
E: CONT'D
N: He reads down until he finds what he's looking for.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Yeah I said it all here, "It's going to help people get an education...it's going to create national unity...it's going to teach young people a trade...and it's going to help get people out of debt from college loans. Tell me where that fails.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: All of that is exactly right...Governor if you're going to do it...then do it. Don't make it voluntary...mandatory.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: That'll poll well.
C: STEPHEN
D: Mandatory!...everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country. Military...peace corps...plant fucking trees, I don't care...and for that...their college education is paid for...period.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: We do all of that now, with this...
C: STEPHEN
D: No sir you don't...do it all...all the way. Mandatory.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Paul likes this?...you guys are my brain trust.
C: STEPHEN
D: And here's the beauty of it...everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it...create national pride...give all the kids an education.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: And all the others?
C: STEPHEN
D: Can't vote. Too young. This sits with them. Some start to smile.
C: STEPHEN
D: You can't lose.
E: CONT'D
N: MOLLY enters.
C: MOLLY
D: Stephen you have a call on three, your dad.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Okay, you and Ben work it into the stump speech - get me a hard copy and I'll write it in my own words.
C: STEPHEN
D: Remember, Governor... you have a six o'clock with Charlie Rose...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Why am I doing him?
C: STEPHEN
D: It's long form... he's flying in...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Is Paul going?
C: STEPHEN
D: No, he won't be back... Ben and I are taking you...
N: He exits.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STEPHEN'S OFFICE / INT. DUFFY'S OFFICE CONTINUOUS
N: STEPHEN picks up the receiver and pushes line three.
C: STEPHEN
D: ...Don't tell me anyone's died...
C: DUFFY
D: Hey Stephen...
C: STEPHEN
D: Who is this?
C: DUFFY
D: Tom Duffy...sorry about the dad bit...but I didn't think you'd want my name yelled out at a Morris campaign office. STEPHEN gets up and closes the door.
C: STEPHEN
D: What do you want?
C: DUFFY
D: You got a couple of minutes...I'd like to sit down with you.
C: STEPHEN
D: What for?
C: DUFFY
D: I think it's important.
C: STEPHEN
D: If it's important shouldn't you be calling Paul?
C: DUFFY
D: I'm calling you...This is all on the up and up...just give me five minutes.
C: STEPHEN
D: I can't be talking to you...
C: DUFFY
D: I hear you...but if you get five minutes...I'll be at the Heads First Sports Bar for the next couple of hours.
C: STEPHEN
D: I can't Tom.
C: DUFFY
D: There won't be anybody there...if you get a chance there's something I want to show you. DUFFY hangs up. STEPHEN sits for a few beats. He picks up his cell phone and dials...it goes straight to voice mail.
C: STEPHEN
D: Paul, listen, call me as soon as you can...it's important.
N: STEPHEN hangs up the phone and we stay with him.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. STEPHEN'S RENTAL CAR - OUTSIDE HEAD FIRST SPORTS
N: BAR - LATER STEPHEN sits in the car, he watches the door of the bar making sure no one is around.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HEAD FIRST SPORTS BAR - CINCINNATI - LATER
N: We're in a run-down bar in Cincinnati. The furniture is shabby - Formica tables, cheap metal framed chairs. The place is desolate except for TOM and STEPHEN who sit at the bar.
C: DUFFY
D: You're working for the wrong man.
C: STEPHEN
D: You're working for the wrong man.
C: DUFFY
D: Oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man. You've got something the other guys don't have.
C: STEPHEN
D: Yeah?
C: DUFFY
D: Yeah, what is it exactly? Charm isn't the right word. It's more than that. You exude something. You draw people in. All the reporters love you. Even the ones that hate you love you. You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. And you make it look effortless. We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. But from the outside, you make it look easy.
E: MORE
C: DUFFY
D: People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it. There's nothing more valuable in this business - the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love. You can guess what I'm gonna say next.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: No...I don't think I can.
C: DUFFY
D: I want you to work for us.
C: STEPHEN
D: You gotta be kidding me.
C: DUFFY
D: Not in the least.
N: Beat. You are going to lose Ohio.
C: STEPHEN
D: I am not.
C: DUFFY
D: You're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls...six percent of the Democrats polled.
C: STEPHEN
D: Eight.
C: DUFFY
D: Six...but that doesn't matter...Independents and Republicans can vote for the Democratic candidate.
C: STEPHEN
D: You think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal?
C: DUFFY
D: Fuck no they hate him...they think they can beat my guy...but they're worried about yours...so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz...Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a "Get out the vote campaign"...it's already started...every fucking conservative in Ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket...that's just one of the steps...Ohio is gone...the polls don't mean shit...tomorrow morning everyone will know...that's why I want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press... They look at each other.
C: DUFFY
D: And by the way...we've got Thompson in the bag.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us.
C: DUFFY
D: We promised him Secretary of State, Ohio is over...it's been over for weeks...and with Thompson's delegates...I'm thinking down the road now...that's why I want you...I'll bring you in straight at the top.
C: STEPHEN
D: I can't do it.
C: DUFFY
D: I'm not asking for an answer right this moment.
C: STEPHEN
D: I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris!
C: DUFFY
D: None of this is about the democratic process Steve, It's about getting your guy into office. Simple as that.
C: STEPHEN
D: This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull.
C: DUFFY
D: You're right, this is exactly what the Republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them. They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are. I've been in this business for twenty five years and I've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants.
C: STEPHEN
D: Paul's a friend.
C: DUFFY
D: Do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the President? Think about it...you have my number. Duffy gets up and leaves.

C: STEPHEN
D: Just get online and see if there's any chatter on the blogs...
E: TO BEN
C: BEN
D: What kind of chatter? There's always chatter.
C: STEPHEN
D: I don't know... just see what they're talking about.
C: BEN
D: Give me a second... He sets his laptop down and starts typing. The Governor, who's been talking the whole time, yells out through the door.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Stephen... you're still single, right?
C: STEPHEN
D: I'm married to the campaign, Governor.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Good answer. He's married to the campaign...
E: to the make-up girl
C: BEN
D: Wall Street Journal poll has our numbers holding steady and Pullman dropped a point.
E: looking at his computer

N: The room has been transformed into an interview space. ON AIR- CHARLIE ROSE and GOV. MORRIS mid-interview...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Is it a difficult decision? I would have to believe that it is... would I do it? No... but I can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: So you would appoint a judge to...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: ... I would consider it arrogant to judge someone until I've walked in their shoes.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: But you're against the death penalty?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Yes. Because of what it says about us as a society.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: Suppose Governor it was your wife...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: And she was murdered, what would I do.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: It gets more complicated when it's personal.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Sure...well if I could get to him I'd find a way to kill him.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: No, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: Then why not let society do that?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Because society has to be better than the individual. If I were to do that I would be wrong.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: And what about guns?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Isn't it time for a commercial. They laugh.
C: CHARLIE ROSE
D: This is public TV, we don't have commercials...

D: You don't work for the Democratic National Committee?
C: STEPHEN

C: CHRIS MATTHEWS
D: In fairness, this has been tried before...Operation Chaos, as Rush Limbaugh called it, where Republicans voted for a Democrat they thought they could beat in the general election. We asked Senator Pullman's campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome...
E: ON TV
N: Cut to a pre-tape with DUFFY.
C: DUFFY
D: Is it decisive?...Of Course not...look, we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the Senator will win Ohio...with Ohio Democrats...I can't really see Republicans showing up to vote for our candidate...having said that, we'll take all the support we can get.
E: O.S.

C: JACK STEARNS
D: I know you're looking for a reaction, but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race...and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall.
C: CHRIS MATHEWS
D: I understand Jack - but doesn't this kind of disruption take away from what you want to be pushing this year?
N: Back to STEPHEN
C: STEPHEN
D: Your dad is an asshole.

C: STEPHEN
D: It's not like I got drunk and this happened...I mean...I wanted to...I really like you...you're smart...but I just...I don't want there to be any expectations...
C: MOLLY

C: STEPHEN
D: Yup... Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground.
E: Nope
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I think the weather might determine that. If we get there.
N: Both men sit with their heads back on the headrests.

C: STEPHEN
D: I think we're solid.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Okay Paul.
C: STEPHEN
D: Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: But you wouldn't.
C: STEPHEN
D: I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work.
C: STEPHEN
D: Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: So at best you've got eight years...then you'll end up with a nice little consultant firm on Farragut North...eating at the Palm...pulling in seven hundred and fifty grand a year...pimping out Senators to Saudi Princes. They both smile.

N: We're in a large hall. GOVERNOR MORRIS is on stage, he stands in front of a huge American flag. Morris's wife CINDY is standing in the wings along with their seven year old daughter BETH. GOVERNOR MORRIS addresses the crowd.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Now, I've been married for eleven years, to the smartest person I know...and we have a normal marriage...which means when we disagree...she wins. What we don't ever disagree on is how we're going to leave this planet for our daughter. Are we gonna leave it better off, or worse? The richest people in this country don't pay their fare share. And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth. That scares everybody and they all run and they hide. For the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans, by our government! And I will run on that!
S: INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS

D: I met with Tom Duffy yesterday.
C: PAUL
D: What?
C: STEPHEN
D: You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you...
C: PAUL
D: Stop Stop let me get this straight. You met with Tom Duffy?
C: STEPHEN
D: Yes.
C: PAUL
D: What'd he want Stephen?
C: STEPHEN
D: -the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State.

D: Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true.
C: PAUL
D: It doesn't fucking matter what you thought. It matters what you did. It matters what you didn't do. If all this shit is true I made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place. And I gave away our game plan.
C: STEPHEN
D: Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point. But it doesn't make it right and I'm sorry.

C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I can't run from Ohio...they'll kill us.
C: PAUL
D: Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.
C: GOV. MORRIS

C: STEPHEN
D: Cabinet post.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Labor?
C: STEPHEN
D: State... This sits with them.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Are you fucking kidding me...I'm gonna give Secretary of State to a guy who wants to cut the top ten floors off the UN? Paul when we started this campaign I said I wasn't gonna make those kind of deals.
C: PAUL
D: Governor, if you lose Ohio, and they get Thompson's delegates...Then they get North Carolina...then they get the lead. A lead you can't beat. But if we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him a cabinet post, then we take North Carolina. His state. Then Pennsylvania. Your state. And then it's simple math Mike. Take his endorsement and the race is over.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Paul, I respect you...respect your opinion...but I'm never gonna do it...so I suggest we find a way for me to win Ohio.

N: We keep pushing in on PAUL until we can hear him talking to a reporter on the phone. - During this conversation he types on his laptop.
C: PAUL
D: No, No that's not what I'm saying...we were the underdog before we got into this and we continue to be the underdog...well the numbers...we knew the numbers would get closer the closer we got to Tuesday...I'm not lowering expectations...have you ever heard me say that we had Ohio locked?...

N: A BIT LATER A few hundred students sit around The GOVERNOR in a theater as he fields questions. MORRIS is cornered by a conservative student. STUDENT 1 Gay marriage?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: It's a silly argument. STUDENT 1 Not to fifty percent of Americans.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Over the age of fifty.
N: STUDENT 1 That's who votes...that's who shows up at the polls.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Well that's changing...and hopefully the way we frame the argument is...
N: At this point the camera travels backstage to find STEPHEN, BEN, PAUL and MOLLY working the phones and laptops.
C: PAUL
D: Keep an eye on the Governor.
E: TO STEPHEN
C: STEPHEN
D: Let me know how it's going out there.
E: TO BEN
C: STEPHEN
D: I'm on it.
E: CONT'D
N: BEN takes us back out, and under this we hear the GOVERNOR continue debating.. STUDENT 1 From...a religious...a
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: From a religious to a civil rights issue.
N: STUDENT 1 But one could argue a great difference between gender and race.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Not really. They used to ban interracial marriage...women couldn't vote...the list goes on... STUDENT 1 The argument of course-
N: We hear boos from students in the audience. At this point the camera finds MORRIS. Morris quiets the students.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Now wait she has a point to make....
N: STUDENT 1 The argument is that men and women, can in fact be separate but equal, races cannot.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: How so?
N: STUDENT 1 You have separate public bathrooms for men and women but it would be illegal to have separate bathrooms for two races.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Now. STUDENT 1 Yes now.
E: LAUGHING
N: Audience laughs.

S: INT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: We're tight on a TV. It's the taped broadcast of the previous town hall meeting. As the scene plays we pull back to see STEPHEN and MOLLY making love. We see pieces of body parts. Hands...a leg...hair being pulled...it's what we've grown used to seeing in a seventies love scene, all lit by the flickering of a television. The only score we hear is the sound of the TV.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: See we're framing the argument based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice, you choose to be gay, not that you were born that way like being born black. Because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your DNA, then gay marriage is and can only be a civil rights issue.
N: ANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone. STUDENT 2 Do you think candor is your appeal? Is that what you're running on as much as your platform...?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: We'll see. It'll drive them to the polls one way or the other.
N: STUDENT 2 I just heard a lot of Christian Coalition cars start up. We pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY. STEPHEN on top not moving. He looks down to the area where an erection would normally be at this time...then he looks back to Molly.

D: Hello...
N: Almost at the same time we hear another man's voice on the phone.
C: VOICE
D: Molly?
N: They both stop. No one speaks. Stephen is about to speak again when the caller hangs up. Stephen looks at the phone...he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an identical phone. His phone. He's picked up Molly's phone by mistake. He looks at the name of the incoming call...there is none...he looks at the caller ID number...he looks at the clock...2:30 AM.

C: MOLLY
D: Don't do that Stephen... Hang up!
E: Getting more urgent
N: Stephen, listens to the outgoing message, while he looks at Molly...her eyes starting to well up. We hear the buzzing of the message through the phone. Then we see Stephens reaction as it begins to dawn on him who he's listening to. He closes the phone without leaving a message. Beat.

C: STEPHEN
D: Then why is he calling you now?
C: MOLLY
D: I called him first.

D: For what?

D: I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1....
C: IDA
D: You're right -you've given me a lot. But let's get real here Steve. The only reason you ever treated me well was that I work for the Times. Not because I was your friend. You give me what I want, I write you better stories. Don't pretend it's any more than that. Why'd you meet with Duffy?
C: STEPHEN
D: Go fuck yourself.
N: STEPHEN starts walking away.

Nine times out of ten the fear candidate tends to be the most experienced...but in our presidential races the least experienced candidate almost always wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter versus Ford...Bush versus Gore...I like our chances with the new kid on the block, end quote. Thomas Fucking Duffy...he's gotta be having a stroke right now.

D: Probably. Yeah. Whoever she takes it to, they're gonna call me for a statement.

D: But why? Why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to the campaign.
C: PAUL
D: The campaign will survive.
C: STEPHEN
D: Then why would you do that to me?
C: PAUL
D: Makes it easier to let you go.
C: STEPHEN
D: What?
C: PAUL
D: Why'd you meet with Duffy?
C: STEPHEN
D: I made a mistake - a stupid mistake.
C: PAUL
D: No Stephen. You didn't make a mistake. You made a choice. You called me and left a message to call back...that it was important. But when I did...you said to forget about it. You chose not to tell me. Why did you make that choice?
C: STEPHEN
D: I didn't think it was important.
C: PAUL
D: Sure you did. But you went because you were curious, because you were flattered. Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me. Because you thought to yourself: maybe I can get something out of this. Because it made you feel big. First campaign I ran tiny little race in Kentucky -state senate seat. Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie. Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. There's no way we can compete. And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. Says, "I really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam. But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?" What do I do? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different. I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, "Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything I can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then I won't get in your way." So I say, "Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are, and I'd be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan." We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called? We won that race.
E: MORE
C: PAUL
D: And twenty years later I'm where I am now. There's only one thing I value in this world Steve, and that's loyalty. Without it you're nothing and you have no one. And in politics it's the only currency that you can count on. That's why I'm letting you go. Not because you're not good enough. But I value trust over skill. And I don't trust you anymore.
E: CONT'D Beat
C: STEPHEN
D: Well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the Governor does.

D: I know who leaked it.
C: DUFFY
D: Who?
C: STEPHEN
D: Paul.
C: DUFFY
D: You told Paul?
C: STEPHEN
D: Yeah. I told him we met. He leaked it.
C: DUFFY
D: You shouldn't have told him that.
C: STEPHEN
D: I felt like I should.
C: DUFFY
D: I've worked with Paul. He gets paranoid.
C: STEPHEN
D: Obviously.
C: DUFFY
D: So he fired you.
C: STEPHEN
D: I quit.
C: DUFFY
D: You're lying to me...come on...
C: STEPHEN
D: I quit! And I can give you everything on Morris. Everything.
E: MORE
C: STEPHEN
D: I can lay out his whole strategy for you.
E: CONT'D
C: DUFFY
D: I already know his strategy. Paul gave it all to Thompson.
C: STEPHEN
D: What if I had something else?
C: DUFFY
D: You'd do that to Morris? To Paul?
C: STEPHEN
D: Yeah.
C: DUFFY
D: Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve. I can't have someone who's unpredictable. Who's unstable.
C: STEPHEN
D: I'm not unstable.
E: CALMLY
C: DUFFY
D: If it had been a clean break -if you'd left Morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing. That we could control. But the way it'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us. Looks like we're picking up the scraps. Puts Morris in the drivers seat. I can't have that. We see a shot close on STEPHEN'S clinched fist holding the yellow copies from Molly's clinic visit down by his side. We pan up to his face.
C: STEPHEN
D: What if I had something big?
C: DUFFY
D: Like what?
C: STEPHEN
D: Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down.
C: DUFFY
D: What is it?
C: STEPHEN
D: Give me the job.
E: Shaking his head
C: DUFFY
D: It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Go take a nice long vacation.
N: Beat.
C: DUFFY
D: You're a smart guy Steve. Everything I said yesterday is true. But maybe politics isn't for you.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: Politics is my life.
C: DUFFY
D: Do yourself a favor. Get out now while you still can. Go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica - anything. Do what will make you happy. You stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical.
C: STEPHEN
D: Like you?
C: DUFFY
D: Yeah. Just like me.
C: STEPHEN
D: You knew I was gonna tell Paul.
C: DUFFY
D: I didn't know. I thought you might, but I didn't know.
C: STEPHEN
D: You knew if I told him he'd fire me.
C: DUFFY
D: Thing you gotta know about Paul- he's big on loyalty.
C: STEPHEN
D: Yeah I got a nice speech on that. You were never gonna hire me.
C: DUFFY
D: Put yourself in my shoes Steve. Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. What do you try to do? You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. This was a win-win situation for me. You work for us -great. Paul doesn't have you. Then again, if Paul fires you and I don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you. Either way I win. The moment I got you to sit down in that chair, I knew I'd won.
C: STEPHEN
D: This is my life you're talking about.
C: DUFFY
D: It's not easy for me to do this sort of thing Steve. Don't think I take any pleasure in it. I'm sorry for you. I really am. Take care of yourself.

N: STEPHEN pulls into the parking lot.
S: INT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT
N: STEPHEN climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his former co-workers. He gets to the fifth floor and walks down the hall towards Molly's room. As he turns the corner he sees a maid's cart in front of her room. The door is halfway open. As he starts walking towards her door, we see the HOTEL MANAGER come running out of Molly's room, he heads the opposite way towards the elevators...he's fumbling with his walkie-talkie. STEPHEN gets to her room and we see a JANITOR kneeling over Molly's lifeless body. Stephen steps into the room. He can barely move. He just stands there looking at the situation. The JANITOR is on the phone.
C: JANITOR
D: No ma'am she's not breathing...No nothing...
N: Stephen is looking at Molly...he looks around the room...he sees her prescription bottle empty on the bed next to her...he sees her clothes all around the room.
C: JANITOR
D: ...I don't know, fifteen minutes...how far away are they?
E: CONT'D
N: The JANITOR now turns and looks at STEPHEN
C: JANITOR
D: Do you know her?
E: CONT'D
N: STEPHEN nods his head yes.
C: JANITOR
D: She's gone.
E: CONT'D
N: We hear the sound of a distant ambulance. JANITOR goes back to the phone.
C: JANITOR
D: Hello...I'm sorry what? Yes I can hear them now... STEPHEN looks down on the bed and sees Molly's phone. He reaches down takes it and slides it in his pocket.
E: CONT'D
N: Close on STEPHENS face as he stares down at Molly. We hear the ambulance approaching the building
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER
N: Stephen comes running out the door. An ambulance has pulled up and EMT's are on their way in. Police are also pulling up. Stephen keeps walking - he gets in his car and sits there. Nothing. No emotion. Stephen pulls out his phone and listens to his messages.
C: PHONE
D: You have four new messages and four saved messages. First new message.
N: Beep.
C: MOLLY
D: Uhm...where are you?...it's Uhh... it's four something...they're gonna close in a few minutes...
E: O.S. Crying
N: Beep.

D: Stephen, it's Ben...listen ...what the fuck...did Paul lose his mind?...Jesus...what're you gonna do? Call me. Beep.
E: O.S.
C: MOLLY
D: Stephen I just heard from Ben...please don't do anything fucked up... Godamnit you motherfucker pick up the phone! Don't do it you fuck!
E: O.S. She's losing it.
N: Beep. We now hear Molly in a very different tone, calmer, maybe even drunk.
C: MOLLY
D: I'm not going away...

N: The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN and the other staffers, sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece. We now cut to CNN footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue.
C: JOHN KING
D: The coroner has stated, that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room, that this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs. The Cincinnati police chief, Darryl Mathews, has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks. Just a terrible terrible situation for the former Senator, now DNC Chairman, Jack Stearns and his family. Off the Governor's face we:

C: SENATOR THOMPSON
D: I want on the ticket...you need me on the ticket...and you need my delegates...you could use em before Tuesday. Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle...so I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat.

E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. PRESS ROOM - CINCINNATI - NEXT MORNING
N: We're at a press conference - The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN, and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone. The Governor is making a statement
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: The entire staff is in a state of shock. We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family...
E: MORE
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. Ida?
E: CONT'D
C: IDA
D: Is suicide ruled out?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: We have no reason to believe...
N: He looks to Paul.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I don't think we have any of that information yet. Obviously there will be a full investigation. Just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family.
E: CONT'D
N: REPORTER 5 Did you know her well Governor?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Not well. But I did know her, and what I saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack. REPORTER 6 How long has she interned with you Governor? The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic.
C: PAUL
D: She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check.
C: IDA
D: Will you continue with your schedule today? You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon.
C: PAUL
D: We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart.
N: As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen. STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops vibrating. Stephen turns and leaves.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - THAT NIGHT
N: STEPHEN approaches the restaurant - the lights are off. He peers through a window - we hear the door unlock. One of the Governor's SECRET SERVICE MEN opens the door. He motions Stephen in.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - CONTINUOUS
N: Stephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant - they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths. They cross towards the back to the kitchen door - STEPHEN enters.
S: INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: The kitchen is small and dimly lit. The Governor is standing behind the center island - hanging pans hide his face.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: It seems you have something you want to talk about.
C: STEPHEN
D: Does it seem that way?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: If you have something...or think you have something you want to get off your chest...
C: STEPHEN
D: What's say I do the talking and you do the listening.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Okay.
C: STEPHEN
D: As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign. Paul is out. I will be your senior campaign manager. I'll draft a statement, "we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc." You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: And why would I do that? Beat.
C: STEPHEN
D: Because you want to win. Because you broke the only rule in politics. You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: What do you think you have Stephen? A troubled young girl tells you a story.
C: STEPHEN
D: A troubled young pregnant girl...
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Is that what she told you?
C: STEPHEN
D: ...Who needed cash for an abortion.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: What did you do, give her money? Maybe she just wanted cash and you were the perfect guy to hit up.
C: STEPHEN
D: Is that your best play?
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: You need a job that bad Stephen? You walk in here with your dick in your hand...you've got nothing.
C: STEPHEN
D: So how did I get here? You're right Mike, there's nothing. No phone messages, no text, no e- mails, no photos or tapes, and yet I'm standing right here.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Well go home.
C: STEPHEN
D: She left a note. The Governor stands in silence.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: How would you know that?
C: STEPHEN
D: I cleaned up your mess. I took her phone and I found her note. They stare at each other in silence.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I thought it was an accident. THEN:
C: STEPHEN
D: You tell me, you were the last one she called. Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion...it also said she didn't want to hurt you.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Then why would she leave a note that could only do that?
C: STEPHEN
D: Because she's twenty.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: What do you want?
C: STEPHEN
D: Paul's gone today. I set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket. You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong. All the things we both believe in.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Well I don't believe in extortion...I don't believe in tying myself to you for the next eight years.
C: STEPHEN
D: Four years, let's not get ahead of ourselves. A long beat.
N: Finally the Governor says:
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: What were you doing in her room?
C: STEPHEN
D: Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: No. You were already fired, you were out. What were you doing in her room?
C: STEPHEN
D: I was fixing a situation...I got a call, someone from the hotel thought I could help and called me.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: You were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to come back and fix things? It was your voice on the phone the other night.
E: MORE
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: You were fucking her. What did you do Stephen?
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: I loaned her some money and gave her a ride.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: I bet you did.
N: Pause. AND THEN:
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: There's no note.
E: CONT'D
C: STEPHEN
D: Okay, there's no note.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Show it to me.
C: STEPHEN
D: You think I brought it here? That's how people get hurt.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Okay let's play this out. You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal...and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison. You were fucking her and she told you about her situation. There are no records or conversations between us. And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence. So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine. Your word. A fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor...There's no note.
C: STEPHEN
D: It's your call Governor. As the Governor weighs his options we-

N: PAUL walks out, starts down the street. As he passes the first corner, he sees the Governor's SUV and the Secret Service SUV both parked on the side of the road. Paul looks at the SUV... then walks up to the window. The window rolls down and the GOVERNOR leans his head out.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Paul you got a minute?
N: We stay outside the car for along time. We hear CHRIS MATHEWS under this shot. We see Paul get out of the SUV and the two SUVs drive off, leaving him standing there.

N: We See STEPHEN, shaving in the bathroom mirror, as he listens to the TV.

C: JACK STEARNS
D: You always hear people talking about events out of sequence...the order of things. There is no greater grief than a parent laying their child to rest...She was a little girl trying to make it in a very grown up world...a world were every mistake is magnified and she was smart and pretty and so so young.
N: He looks to the PRIEST next to him.
C: JACK STEARNS
D: Father, you ask us to accept God's plan, to not question his judgment, with all due respect, I don't accept this judgment. She made the world better, not just for me, but for everyone she touched.

C: STEPHEN
D: I'll keep that in mind. Are you here to talk to me?
C: PAUL
D: No. I'm friends with the family. I got her the internship...known her since she was born.
C: STEPHEN
D: I'm sorry.
C: PAUL
D: The Governor couldn't make the flight?
C: STEPHEN
D: He's meeting with Thompson.
C: PAUL
D: Look at you, all grown up with tits and all.
C: STEPHEN
D: I learned from the best.
C: PAUL
D: One day we'll grab a beer and you'll tell me what you had on the Governor that put me out.
C: STEPHEN
D: How do you know I didn't have something on you? They both smile.
C: PAUL
D: You better get going, you've got a campaign to run and I've got offices to go look at.

D: And the right man to lead this great nation of ours in these challenging times and the next President of the United States of America, Governor Mike Morris!...And I ask only one thing, that all of us stand shoulder to shoulder and arm in arm in a united Democratic party. Huge cheers.
C: SENATOR THOMPSON
D: And I strongly urge that the three hundred and fifty-six loyal delegates that I have carried as a badge of honor, throw their support to the Governor. Let's end this primary and get on to the business of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave!

S: INT. XAVIER HALLWAYS & RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: JILL comes through the door. We follow her through the hallways crowded with television cables and technicians. She makes her way in to a large reception room, where Stephen is watching Governor Morris give his speech. She hands him a coffee. We cut between The Governor and Stephen watching from the back.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Thank you Senator Thompson! Well the polls aren't quite closed, but I want to congratulate Senator Pullman...And his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio. The room explodes in laughter and applause.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Senator Thompson I am honored to stand here today with you. I am humbled by your kind words, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of Saudi Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! We are not a nation used to coming in second or third...

S: INT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY & STAGING ROOM
N: While the Governor's speech continues we stay close on Stephen as he walks through the crowd. We follow him into Governor Morris's staging area. Four monitors on a table show different network feeds. We watch Stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt. He ties his tie and puts his jacket on. From the monitors we hear reporters etc. We push in on one of the monitors where DUFFY is being interviewed. As we push in we see STEPHEN cross out of the room. BEN is watching, he looks back and smiles at STEPHEN.
C: DUFFY
D: No it's not decisive, we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say. It does look like we'll win Ohio...
C: RACHEL MADDOW
D: But you must concede that these three hundred and fifty-six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach. And with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for Morris.

D: I just filed a story that said you were off the campaign and Thompson was going to Pullman.
C: STEPHEN
D: You can't believe everything you read.
C: IDA
D: I want to give you an opportunity to comment on my next story. It says that you delivered Thompson...You got the three hundred and fifty-six delegates, you delivered the nomination. And all you asked in return was Paul's job. Any chance of you confirming that? They approach a security guard standing by a set of double doors.
C: STEPHEN
D: No press beyond this point...she's press. I'll read about it in the funny papers.

S: INT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - GYMNASIUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
N: A wide shot of the darkened gymnasium. Stephen sits on a stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light. We're now in tight - One PERSON is putting a mic on Stephen while the OTHER is applying make-up. No one speaks. The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear.
C: SOUND MAN
D: You should be able to hear them...do you hear them?
N: We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New York.
C: STEPHEN
D: Yeah I can hear them.
C: SOUND MAN
D: Good, quick mic check can you count to ten for me? Stephen counts to ten. Everyone stands behind the camera. The sound man with his headset on whispers..
C: SOUND MAN
D: They're coming to you in about forty five seconds.
E: CONT'D
N: We sit in silence staring at Stephens face. Ten seconds - nothing. Twenty seconds - nothing This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium - only a few people doing their individual jobs. Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell phones. The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset. The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments. A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance. They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't - but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all cost. We stay on Stephen's face. We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.
C: GOV. MORRIS
D: Senator Thompson I am proud that you have brought integrity back to this election. Because that's what this comes down to, integrity. Who we are. Because how we project ourselves to the rest of the world matters!...Dignity matters!...Integrity matters!...Our future depends on it! Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN.
C: SOUND MAN
D: Coming to you in five...four...three...two...
N: Through the earwig we hear an JOHN KING.
C: JOHN KING
D: We now have Governor Morris's new senior campaign advisor, Stephen Myers, coming to us from Xavier University where Senator Thompson has just endorsed Governor Morris, essentially ending this primary race. Stephen, can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded?
