T: FADE IN:
S: 1EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY 1
N: (LATE SPRING, 1957) OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. NEW ANGLE - TENT -- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade.
S: 2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY 2
N: JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley). Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year).
C: DOUG
D: Didn't get invited, huh?
C: JACEY
D: Go to hell.
C: DOUG
D: Who cares? I'm not going and I got invited.
C: JACEY
D: Who invited you?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 2. 2CONTINUED: 2
C: DOUG
D: Pam, I guess. I don't know. Didn't open the envelope. I mean, come on, every time an Abbott girl gets her period they have some party.
C: JACEY
D: Oh, shut up.
C: DOUG
D: Kotex parties, Kotex party hats, pin the Kotex on the...
C: JACEY
D: Shut up!
N: Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.
S: 4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER) 4
N: ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker. Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down the busy hall.
C: JACEY
D: I tried to call you last night but the line was busy.
C: ELEANOR
D: No it wasn't.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 3. 4CONTINUED: 4
C: JACEY
D: It was busy all night.
C: ELEANOR
D: Maybe you had the wrong number?
C: JACEY
D: Are you mad at me?
C: ELEANOR
D: No. Are you mad at me?
C: JACEY
D: No. Who said I was?
C: ELEANOR
D: I did.
C: JACEY
D: I just wanted to talk to you last night.
C: ELEANOR
D: We can talk tonight at the party.
C: JACEY
D: I wasn't invited.
C: ELEANOR
D: Yes, you were.
C: JACEY
D: No, I wasn't.
C: ELEANOR
D: Well, now you are. But if you're mad at me you don't have to come.
N: She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of Eleanor's smile.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)
N: ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping- pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950 Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway. The garage doors are open and the garage light is on. We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 3A/4.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)
N: Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too. Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:
C: JACEY
D: Oh, Christ!
S: INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)
N: HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School.)
C: JACEY
D: He has to wash it off, Mother. You cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off.
C: DOUG
D: It'll look worse if I wash it. It's India ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt.
C: JACEY
D: He looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it! He doesn't get how things work in this town. I thought you weren't even going to the party?
C: DOUG
D: Changed my mind.
C: HELEN
D: Doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
C: HELEN
D: You do understand that your sideburns don't look real?
N: Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he conceals his disappointment and nods: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 5. 7CONTINUED: 7
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
C: HELEN
D: That they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
E: swallows, then shrugs
N: She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.
C: HELEN
D: Well, darling, it seems he does understand. Why don't you just go on to the party and ignore Doug. Just have a good time and pretend you don't even...
N: Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon.
S: 8EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 8
N: The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent. Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac, caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.
S: 9INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT 9
N: Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand. Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor. 9CONTINUED: 9 They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy, waiting like predators for their chance to dance with Eleanor.
C: ELEANOR
D: I'm going out to the lake tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off her dad's new boat. Why don't you come?
C: JACEY
D: I have to work.
C: ELEANOR
D: Well, I guess you'll just have to write me a letter.
C: JACEY
D: What do you mean?
C: ELEANOR
D: You said you wanted to talk to me in private.
C: JACEY
D: I meant... just... we never get a chance to be together, alone, you know?
N: STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG
N: -- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
N: u DOUG Hi. She points at Doug's chest.
C: PAMELA
D: Like your tie.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 7. Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and points at her bust.
C: DOUG
D: Can I borrow a Kleenex?
C: PAMELA
D: Greaser.
C: DOUG
D: Got any smokes around here?
E: mouth full of food
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT
N: Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard. The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing "MONA LISA."
C: DOUG
D: So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich?
C: PAMELA
D: Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully.
C: DOUG
D: So how come Alice's marrying him?
C: PAMELA
D: Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with.
C: DOUG
D: Jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 8.
C: PAMELA
D: Look, Alice is the good daughter, Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. That's just the way it works. Which one are you?
C: DOUG
D: You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little.
C: LLOYD
D: Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham.
N: He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and AD-LIBBED toasts. The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT
N: The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of high society for tonight.
S: EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT
N: Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT
N: Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.
S: EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT
N: (MINUTES LATER) As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain.
C: DOUG
D: Three out of five?
C: JACEY
D: Two out of three. You serve.
N: Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce competitors. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 10.
S: EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY
N: Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.
C: JACEY
D: 'Morning.
C: LLOYD
D: Fill 'er up. Hi-test.
N: Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash, climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the trash can.
C: JACEY
D: That was a nice party last night.
C: LLOYD
D: You were there?
C: JACEY
D: Yes, sir. Eleanor invited me.
C: LLOYD
D: Did she? Didn't see you. You going to be an engineer like your dad was?
E: slight beat
C: JACEY
D: I want to be an architect.
C: LLOYD
D: Hmmm... I guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money.
C: JACEY
D: I care about making money.
N: Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash.
C: LLOYD
D: That full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production, did you know that? We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty thousand of those file cabinets this year. Hell, that drawer put Midwest Steel Desk on the map.
C: JACEY
D: Yes, sir. I know.
C: LLOYD
D: An architect, huh?
N: The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF, Jacey hangs up the nozzle, and replaces the gas cap. Lloyd pulls out his wallet.
C: LLOYD
D: You want some free advice?
C: JACEY
D: Sure.
C: LLOYD
D: Don't waste your life making other people rich. Keep the change.
N: He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.
S: A19 INT. BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY A19
N: The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over, holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor is fifteen, too.)
C: VICTOR
D: Jeez Louise! How'd you do that?
C: DOUG
D: Intestinal gas -- produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon. A mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. That's the secret ingredient.
C: VICTOR
D: What's so secret about it?
C: DOUG
D: Not everyone can produce methane. It's genetic, that means it's inherited. There's a lot of methane in my family.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 12. A19 CONTINUED: A19
C: VICTOR
D: You're full of shit.
C: DOUG
D: Look it up, it's all in the encyclopedia.
C: VICTOR
D: They don't got farts in the encyclopedia.
C: DOUG
D: Hey, they got 'vagina' in the dictionary, they got farts in the encyclopedia.
N: The ROAR of a PASSING SPEEDBOAT attracts Doug's interest.
C: VICTOR
D: Vagina is in the dictionary?
E: incredulous
C: DOUG
D: 'A canal leading from the uterus to the vulva'.
C: VICTOR
D: You sure read a lot, man. A canal?
E: slight beat
S: B19 EXT. BOATHOUSE DOCK (LAKE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY B19
N: Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a male water skier. (Another young man is driving the boat with two young women in bathing suits as passengers.) Victor comes out as the speedboat's wake rocks the old dock.
C: VICTOR
D: Assholes!
C: DOUG
D: It's Jacey -- that's him skiing. He must've skipped out on work.
S: EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON SPEEDBOAT
N: -- with Jacey skiing behind it. STEVE is at the helm. Eleanor and SANDY lounge in their bathing suits. As they pass a ski ramp Steve points to it. Jacey gives him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat around for the approach.
C: SANDY
D: No way! He's never done the ramp.
C: STEVE
D: He wants to do it.
N: Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open. Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over the wake. Eleanor leans over to Steve.
C: ELEANOR
D: You know you're going too fast?
C: STEVE
D: Yeah, I know.
E: grins
N: The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Jacey is soaking in the bathtub. Doug enters without knocking.
C: DOUG
D: Time to eat.
N: Doug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to...
C: DOUG
D: Jesus Christ!
N: Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother.
C: JACEY
D: Don't tell Mom.
C: DOUG
D: Oh, shit...
C: JACEY
D: Just don't tell Mom. All right?
E: cutting him off
C: DOUG
D: Yeah, okay, all right.
N: Jacey walks out of the bathroom.
S: EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER 1957)
N: Lloyd Abbott's 1957 Cadillac pulls up to the pumps. Lloyd is behind the wheel, Joan sits next to him, Eleanor and Pamela are in the back seat. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons...
S: INT. TEXACO STATION - JACEY
N: -- sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell. He hesitates as he sees the Abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them. He retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor.
C: ELEANOR
D: Hi.
E: O.S.
N: Jacey finds Eleanor standing in the garage doorway.
C: ELEANOR
D: Congratulations.
C: JACEY
D: For what?
C: ELEANOR
D: I heard you got accepted to Penn.
C: JACEY
D: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
C: ELEANOR
D: How'd you swing an Ivy League school like that?
C: JACEY
D: My grandfather went there. I had the grades, so...
C: ELEANOR
D: It stinks in here.
C: JACEY
D: I dropped something.
C: ELEANOR
D: Yeah, me.
C: JACEY
D: I just thought you and Steve...
C: ELEANOR
D: Well, that's what you thought. I think Steve is... I don't even know what I think about Steve, I never think about him. I just do things. And let other people figure them out. That's what parents are for. They're real good at doing all the thinking. Why should I? Alice is going to have a baby. She and Kilroy didn't waste any time. He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour. She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness. I've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. Wallpaper patterns -- that's all she talks about. She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. That's another thing I never think about... wallpaper. Well, I think this is called the silent treatment. I get enough of that from my father, I don't need it from you. Good luck at Penn.
E: slight beat another beat
N: She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat. They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then:
C: PAMELA
D: Come on, Eleanor -- Dad's waiting.
S: EXT. TEXACO STATION - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
N: The Abbotts drive away. Jacey stands in the garage in the b.g. He watches the Cadillac disappear into traffic. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 16.
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN HALEY - INSIDE CADILLAC
N: -- with Lloyd behind the wheel, Joan in the front passenger seat, and Eleanor and Pam in the back seat. Lloyd says to Eleanor:
C: LLOYD
D: Stay away from him.
C: ELEANOR
D: Who?
C: LLOYD
D: Jacey.
C: ELEANOR
D: Why?
C: LLOYD
D: Because I said so.
S: EXT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER)
N: A family-style restaurant in the center of town. It's a sweltering, hot July day. Heat shimmers off the sidewalk.
S: INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY
N: The decor is mock-Colonial. Victor and Doug (in their bus boy uniforms) are stocking a waitress station with silverware, coffee cups, and water glasses.
C: VICTOR
D: We should have a party out at the boathouse, man. That's what we should do.
C: DOUG
D: Sure.
C: VICTOR
D: You know, invite some girls.
C: DOUG
D: Right.
C: VICTOR
D: Get some beer, go swimming. Look up a few words in the dictionary.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 17.
C: DOUG
D: Yeah, like 'boring' or 'eunuch.'
C: VICTOR
D: Eunuch? What's that?
C: DOUG
D: It's Latin for bus boy.
N: WEBB CROSBY, the proprietor of the restaurant, steps over.
C: WEBB
D: Business is a little light today, too damn hot. Which one of you knuckle-heads wants to get off early?
N: DOUG & VICTOR (in unison) Me... I do.
C: WEBB
D: Call it in the air...
E: takes out a coin
S: EXT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
N: Doug bicycles away (he won the coin toss).
S: INT. HOLT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Doug sails through the back door. He gets a bowl out of the cupboard and fetches the ice cream scoop from a drawer.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
N: Doug enters with the bowl and ice cream scoop in hand. He lifts the lid of the freezer, reaches for a carton of ice cream and something startles him. He cocks his head to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid. He peers into the silvery, dim light and sees Jacey and Eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the back of the garage. She is on top of Jacey, riding him rhythmically. Eleanor is facing Doug. She reacts without alarm or shame when she notices Doug staring at her. She coolly returns his stare. Doug tries, but he's unable to avert his eyes. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 18. Eleanor only shifts her gaze when distracted by her orgasm, which triggers Jacey's -- as she recovers her composure she says:
C: ELEANOR
D: Hi, Doug.
N: Jacey bolts upright, throwing her off of him, and shouts:
C: JACEY
D: Get out!!!
N: Doug drops the bowl and scoop and charges out of the garage.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - DAY (SECONDS LATER)
N: Doug races away from the house on his bicycle -- pumping furiously and sweating profusely.
S: EXT. LAKE - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Doug dives into the lake in his underpants, then surfaces. The water has cooled his body, but not his mind.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - JACEY'S BEDROOM - DAY (EARLY FALL 1957)
N: Helen assists Jacey as he packs his bags in preparation for his departure to college the next day.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, we forgot an umbrella.
C: JACEY
D: I'll buy a new one in Philadelphia.
C: HELEN
D: And don't forget your sport coat.
C: JACEY
D: Yeah, I'll go pick it up.
C: HELEN
D: Take Doug with you.
C: JACEY
D: I'm just going to the cleaners.
C: HELEN
D: Take him along for the ride. Go have a root beer at the Dog'n'Suds.
C: JACEY
D: I gotta finish packing.
C: HELEN
D: I'll finish up. Doug's going to miss you.
C: JACEY
D: Baloney.
C: HELEN
D: I think he will.
C: JACEY
D: Not much.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, dammit, Jacey, please -- take your brother with you.
C: JACEY
D: Yes, ma'am.
S: EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Jacey (behind the wheel) and Doug drive into town in the Plymouth coupe. After a long silence:
C: JACEY
D: If Mom starts having problems with the car stalling just change the fuel filter. It gets clogged up when she lets the gas tank get too low.
C: DOUG
D: Okay.
C: JACEY
D: And every-once-in-a-while take her to the movies so she doesn't just sit around the house all the time reading.
C: DOUG
D: She likes to read.
C: JACEY
D: She reads too much.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 20.
C: DOUG
D: Okay, I'll take her to the movies.
C: JACEY
D: You want to go have a beer?
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: Root beer?
C: JACEY
D: No, a beer.
C: DOUG
D: A beer beer?
C: JACEY
D: Yeah.
C: DOUG
D: Where are we gonna get beer?
C: JACEY
D: The bait shop. If you go in alone and nobody else is in the store, Ernie'll sell you a couple of bottles.
S: EXT. DIRT ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY
N: The Plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two cornfields. Jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing on a bottle of beer. Doug urinates between two rows of corn.
C: DOUG
D: Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper?
N: Jacey gives Doug a quizzical look.
C: DOUG
D: You know, when I was in first grade. At school? In the boys' room? Remember I wouldn't let Mrs. Horton help me, so she went and got Mom out of her classroom, but I wouldn't let Mom help me either. I told her to go get you. Remember?
C: JACEY
D: Yeah, I remember.
N: Doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A semi-trailer drives past with "Midwest Steel Desk, Inc. -- Haley, Illinois" painted on its sides.
C: JACEY
D: We should own that company.
C: DOUG
D: What do you mean?
C: JACEY
D: Midwest Steel Desk. Dad's file cabinet drawer. Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad's patent after he died.
C: DOUG
D: Says who?
C: JACEY
D: It's true.
C: DOUG
D: Mom's not stupid.
C: JACEY
D: I didn't say she was stupid. Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why he owns the company.
C: DOUG
D: He owns the company 'cause he married the boss's daughter.
C: JACEY
D: He owns the company 'cause that patent saved the company's ass after the war, when all the war contracts dried up.
C: DOUG
D: Well, maybe Mom sold it 'cause we needed the money.
C: JACEY
D: What money? We never had any money. Money had nothing to do with it.
C: DOUG
D: Then why did she sell the patent?
C: JACEY
D: She just did, that's all that matters. And that's why we're driving this car and not that one.
N: Jacey gestures to '57 Thunderbird convertible speeding past them. He finishes off his beer, then:
C: JACEY
D: I guess you'll just have to be real careful zipping up your pants while I'm gone.
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
S: EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY
N: Helen stands on the curb waving good-bye as the Greyhound bus carrying Jacey away to Philadelphia departs. Doug hangs back, leaning against the Plymouth's fender.
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY (SPRING, 1958)
N: Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his book. She is seated across the table from him. The library is filled with students poring over their assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's probing eyes. Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table. He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between her parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi Doug!" Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too.
S: EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - LATER THAT DAY
N: Doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home from school. He sports a Band-aid on his chin. Pamela Abbott pulls up alongside Doug and tails him in her 1958 Dodge Custom Royal Lancer convertible (with the top down).
C: PAMELA
D: How's your chin?
C: DOUG
D: Drop dead.
C: PAMELA
D: You want a ride?
C: DOUG
D: Nope.
C: PAMELA
D: You can drive.
C: DOUG
D: I don't have my license yet.
C: PAMELA
D: I don't care.
S: EXT. ROAD - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
N: The convertible speeds along the two-lane blacktop with Doug behind the wheel and Pamela sitting next to him.
C: PAMELA
D: How come you never ask me out?
C: DOUG
D: What for?
C: PAMELA
D: For like a date, block-head.
C: DOUG
D: I see you all the time.
C: PAMELA
D: I don't mean hanging out.
C: DOUG
D: Come on.
C: PAMELA
D: You scared of me or something?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 24.
C: DOUG
D: Hell, no. I gotta job, I got school, I don't have time for dates and all that stuff.
C: PAMELA
D: Then forget it.
C: DOUG
D: It's not like we're... you know... like I'm your boyfriend or...
C: PAMELA
D: I said forget it, so forget it.
E: cutting him off
S: INT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Doug sits on the ping pong table gazing at the daybed as he smokes a cigarette. His reverie is broken by Helen's voice calling him:
C: HELEN
D: Doug? Dinner...!
E: V.O.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Helen and Doug are at the dinner table.
C: HELEN
D: I wish you wouldn't smoke in the garage, darling.
C: DOUG
D: I don't smoke in the garage.
C: HELEN
D: There's lots of old stuff out there, I don't want anything to catch on fire.
C: DOUG
D: I don't smoke, Mom.
C: HELEN
D: Well, just the same, I'd prefer it if you'd smoke in the backyard.
C: DOUG
D: Yes, ma'am. I gotta go, gonna be late.
E: slight beat
C: HELEN
D: Late where?
N: He rises from the table and fidgets with his napkin.
C: DOUG
D: I... have a date, kind of. It's Friday night, you know?
C: HELEN
D: Yes, I know. Well, have fun.
C: DOUG
D: You too.
N: Doug walks out of the dining room.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
N: Doug waits nervously for the doorbell to be answered. He's wearing a jacket and tie. Pamela opens the door and reacts with surprise.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Jesus... what do you want?
C: DOUG
D: What are you doing tonight? You want to go out?
C: PAMELA
D: I don't believe you. You're crazy. I'm baby-sitting. My folks went out to dinner with Peter and Alice and I got tricked into watching the baby.
C: DOUG
D: Oh. Where's Eleanor?
C: PAMELA
D: I thought you came over to ask me out?
C: DOUG
D: I did.
C: PAMELA
D: Good, 'cause Eleanor isn't here.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 26.
C: DOUG
D: Can I come in?
C: PAMELA
D: No.
C: DOUG
D: Why not?
C: PAMELA
D: Because, you know, my parents aren't here.
C: DOUG
D: Well... maybe some other time...
N: Alice's BABY starts CRYING O.S. and Pamela grimaces.
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, hell. Okay, but just for a little while.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - DEN - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: An episode of "Death Valley Days" with commercials for 29 Mule Team Borax AIRS on the deluxe console TV. Doug sits on the sofa smoking a cigarette. Pamela sits at the opposite end of the sofa.
C: PAMELA
D: You're not like Jacey.
C: DOUG
D: Why not?
C: PAMELA
D: He's so... so trig and polished.
C: DOUG
D: What's 'trig' mean?
C: PAMELA
D: You know... handsome, sexy, sophisticated. Pipe-smokers.
C: DOUG
D: Oh. I don't think Jacey smokes a pipe.
C: PAMELA
D: Well, you don't have to smoke a pipe to be trig.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 26A.
C: DOUG
D: Oh.
C: PAMELA
D: You think I'm... different than Eleanor?
C: DOUG
D: Sure.
C: PAMELA
D: Like... how?
C: DOUG
D: Like... you're smarter.
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah, real smart, that's why I'm baby-sitting and she's out having fun. Eleanor's smart.
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: So how come she flunked biology?
C: PAMELA
D: Well, you're no Albert Einstein.
C: DOUG
D: I got a three-point-two average.
C: PAMELA
D: Doesn't mean you know my sister.
C: DOUG
D: Oh yeah? You might be surprised.
C: PAMELA
D: About what? What? What?
C: DOUG
D: Why are we talking about Eleanor?
C: PAMELA
D: I didn't bring her up.
C: DOUG
D: Look, either you're mad at me 'cause you're mad at me -- or you're mad at me 'cause you like me. 'Cause that's how girls act. I don't know much, but I know that. So like which is it?
C: PAMELA
D: Both.
N: Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.
C: PAMELA
D: Doug...
N: Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her lips from his:
C: PAMELA
D: Do you love me, Doug? Do you?
N: He kisses her with such ardor that she interprets his answer to be yes, when in reality Doug is only trying to silence her. He pulls his hand out of her blouse and slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches back into the sofa:
C: PAMELA
D: Jesus...
N: He tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away.
C: PAMELA
D: Stop it... stop it!
N: She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa. Doug looks at her with breathless confusion. She turns away from him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the buttons for her tears. She begins to sob and runs out of the room.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - ENTRY HALL AND STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
N: ACTION Pamela dashes up the stairs. Doug comes out of the den looking for her. He is quite shaken:
C: DOUG
D: Pam? Hey... Oh, dammit...
E: under his breath
N: He slowly mounts the stairs, wary of invading Pamela's privacy anymore than he already has.
C: DOUG
D: Pam?
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: ACTION Doug finds Pamela weeping in the dark hallway, still fastening the buttons on her blouse.
C: DOUG
D: I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...
C: PAMELA
D: I'm not Eleanor... I can't go so fast.
N: They are both seized with fright as they hear the front DOOR OPEN below and Peter's angry voice:
C: PETER
D: Every time we go out you have to tell that same goddamn story!
E: O.S.
N: Pam pushes Doug down the hall away from the front stairs and whispers urgently:
C: PAMELA
D: Get out of here! Get out!
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - ENTRY HALL AND STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
N: ACTION Peter and Alice are taking off their coats.
C: ALICE
D: Accidentally brushing your teeth with Brylcreme is a funny story.
C: PETER
D: Will you shut up about the fucking Brylcreme!
C: ALICE
D: It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent.
C: PETER
D: Do you hear me, Alice?! Shut up!
N: Their BABY begins to CRY (O.S.) and they find Pamela standing at the top of the stairs.
C: PAMELA
D: The baby's crying.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK STAIRWAY AND KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: (MOMENTS LATER) Doug sneaks down the back stairs and enters the kitchen as Lloyd and Joan enter from the garage pulling off their coats. Doug ducks back into the stair landing unseen.
C: LLOYD
D: Just stay out of it, Joan.
C: JOAN
D: Alice meant no harm, I think...
C: LLOYD
D: It doesn't matter what you think, it's their business. Alice is a spoiled brat, but she's Peter's problem now. So just take one of your pills and go watch Jack Paar, see what he's crying about tonight.
E: cutting her off
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: Doug sticks his head out of the back stairwell and spots Peter pounding on a locked bedroom door.
C: PETER
D: I'm warning you, Alice! Open the damn door! Alice?! Dammit!
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - STAIRWELL - DOUG
N: Trapped in the stairwell. He hisses under his breath:
C: DOUG
D: Oh, shit! Let me out of here...
N: He notices a small window in the stairwell.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - WINDOW - NIGHT
N: Doug squeezes out of the small window, his legs dangling six feet above a large rose bush directly under him.
S: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAYS LATER
N: Doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. He slows as he nears Pamela at her locker. She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see. Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says:
C: ELEANOR
D: Hi, Doug!
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 31. The girls giggle, "Hi, Doug!" has become a running punchline to them. Doug is so undone by their laughter that he walks into an open door.
S: EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER, 1958)
N: Jacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver. He's become very much the Ivy League man. Doug waits for him beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts across the street a CAR full of young women, including Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey hops into the car and calls out to Doug:
C: JACEY
D: Hey, Doug! Get my suitcase!
N: The car pulls away and Doug irritably fetches Jacey's bag.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: The hood on the Plymouth is propped open. Doug assists Jacey as he replaces the fuel filter.
C: DOUG
D: How do you know when a girl's... ready?
C: JACEY
D: What do you mean, `ready'? Ready for what... sex?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
C: JACEY
D: They're all ready for sex.
C: DOUG
D: They are?
C: JACEY
D: They might not be willing but they're ready. Just have to make them think you're the only one around who has what they need.
C: DOUG
D: How do you do that?
C: JACEY
D: Find out what's making them itch and scratch it. If they're scared, be dependable. If they're bored, be exciting. If they're on the rebound, catch them.
C: DOUG
D: What if you're not very dependable or exciting, you know?
C: JACEY
D: Pretend you are.
C: DOUG
D: You mean, it's all just fake?
C: JACEY
D: The sex is real. They pretend they don't want it. You pretend that you care. Everybody gets what they want.
C: DOUG
D: But what if you really feel something for someone? Really care for them?
C: JACEY
D: I thought you were talking about getting laid?
C: DOUG
D: I guess. I don't know what I'm talking about.
C: JACEY
D: No shit.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATER (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT
N: The marquee reads: TONY CURTIS -- JANET LEIGH -- "THE PERFECT FURLOUGH" -- CINEMASCOPE -- AIR-CONDITIONED. It's Friday night -- a long queue has formed at the box office window, mostly teenagers, but some adults, too. Jacey cruises past the theater in the Plymouth, looking for... Eleanor. She chats with a group of friends standing in line. She sees Jacey, skips over, and gets into the car.
S: EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT
N: Lloyd Abbott opens a bottle of Coke that he just purchased from the vending machine. His (1958) Cadillac is being fueled at the gas pumps. As he returns to his car he sees Eleanor and Jacey drive by the station in the Plymouth.
S: EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - WOODS (HALEY) - NIGHT
N: Jacey and Eleanor are copulating on a blanket beneath a canopy of tall trees near the river. Jacey is on top, Eleanor has her legs clenched around his hips.
C: ELEANOR
D: Come on, come on, come on...
N: Her encouragement inspires their mutual orgasms.
S: EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Jacey and Eleanor approach the parked Plymouth. Jacey has the blanket rolled up under his arm. Suddenly they are captured by a pair of headlights. Lloyd Abbott climbs out of his parked (1958) Cadillac.
C: ELEANOR
D: Hi, Daddy.
C: LLOYD
D: What are you doing out here?
C: ELEANOR
D: Fucking Jacey.
N: Lloyd absorbs this information without surrendering his composure -- but Jacey cannot conceal his shock.
C: LLOYD
D: Get in the car.
C: ELEANOR
D: 'Night.
E: to Jacey
N: Jacey doesn't respond to the kiss Eleanor gives him, but when she places her hand on his crotch, he yanks her hand off. Eleanor walks over and gets into the car. Lloyd gazes at Jacey for a beat, then gets in the car and drives away. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 34.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - NEXT AFTERNOON
N: Doug is at the table doing homework. The DOORBELL RINGS. Doug starts to get up as Helen comes out of the kitchen.
C: HELEN
D: I'll get it.
S: INT./EXT. HOLT FRONT DOOR/FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION -
N: DAY Helen opens the screen door and finds a well-dressed woman standing in the yard with her face turned away.
C: HELEN
D: Hello?
N: The woman turns -- it is Joan Abbott. Helen is momentarily caught off balance by Joan's bristling presence.
C: HELEN
D: Joan. How are you?
C: JOAN
D: May I have a word with you, Helen?
C: HELEN
D: Of course, come in.
C: JOAN
D: No... no, I don't have time... thank you.
S: INT. HOLT DINING ROOM AND FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Doug spies on Joan and Helen and their curious exchange through a dining room window. Unable to hear their words he can only witness how their words are spoken.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S POV
N: Helen steps off the porch and approaches Joan, who is doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a certain distance from Helen and works her way to her Chrysler Town & Country station wagon parked at the curb. Joan grows more and more agitated as she talks.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - ENTRYWAY
N: Eager to hear what is being said, Doug dashes through the living room to the front door. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 35.
S: EXT. STREET - HOLT HOME - DAY
N: Joan has the driver's door to her station wagon open now. Helen is on the sidewalk. Her demeanor is measured, purposefully matter-of-fact.
C: HELEN
D: I don't think that's necessary.
C: JOAN
D: Well, if I were you I would talk to him and tell him...
C: HELEN
D: No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do that. If you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself.
E: cutting her off
C: JOAN
D: I just thought you would like to know what he's done.
C: HELEN
D: And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan?
N: Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away. Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.
C: HELEN
D: I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me.
C: DOUG
D: Okay.
C: HELEN
D: Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has... oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her astray?
N: Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 36.
C: DOUG
D: Well... jeez... I know that he's... that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean... Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him.
C: HELEN
D: I see. Go finish your homework.
E: long beat another beat
N: Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being.
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)
N: A drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license plates speeds away from town. Incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (WEEKS LATER)
N: Doug walks home from summer school. He pauses to watch the workmen erecting the party tent in the Abbott's front yard.
C: PAMELA
D: How come you're going to summer school?
E: O.S.
N: Doug turns to find Pam at the driveway gate.
C: DOUG
D: I got an incomplete in U.S. History.
C: PAMELA
D: How did you manage to do that?
C: DOUG
D: Mrs. Bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of Mamie Eisenhower.
C: PAMELA
D: Why do you do things like that?
E: laughs
C: DOUG
D: I wish I knew. I just can't seem to help it sometimes.
C: PAMELA
D: Are you coming to the party?
N: Doug shakes his head no.
C: PAMELA
D: It's my birthday, you know?
C: DOUG
D: Happy birthday.
C: PAMELA
D: Everybody's going to be here.
C: DOUG
D: I don't know. Maybe.
C: PAMELA
D: Just come, okay? Please.
S: EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - THAT NIGHT
N: Doug pulls the Plymouth up to the pumps. He's neatly dressed in a jacket and tie. Jacey comes out of the office and leans in the car window.
C: DOUG
D: Fill 'er up.
C: JACEY
D: Nice tie.
E: frowns
C: DOUG
D: Oh -- mind if I borrow it?
N: Jacey puts the nozzle in the car as Doug climbs out.
C: JACEY
D: I thought you didn't like those parties at the Abbott's?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 38.
C: DOUG
D: I don't.
C: JACEY
D: Then why are you going?
C: DOUG
D: Just doing someone a favor. How come you're not going?
C: JACEY
D: I'm persona non grata.
C: DOUG
D: What's that mean?
C: JACEY
D: You know what it means.
C: DOUG
D: What happened with you and Eleanor?
C: JACEY
D: Nothing. I just outlived my usefulness, that's all.
C: DOUG
D: How were you `useful' to her?
C: JACEY
D: Christ, use your imagination.
N: Doug has no reply to that.
C: JACEY
D: Eleanor was just looking for a way out. A way out of the whole Abbott world. And it turns out that it takes a lot to get away. It's not enough that you sleep around with boys from your world, you have to fuck boys from the wrong side of the tracks.
C: DOUG
D: What do you mean? Like guys from Fountain Park?
C: JACEY
D: No, I mean me. She was fucking me.
C: DOUG
D: We're not from the wrong side of the tracks.
N: Jacey hangs up the nozzle and screws the gas cap back on.
C: JACEY
D: I wouldn't go to that party if I were you.
C: DOUG
D: Well, you're not me. We're just as good as the Abbotts.
N: Doug hands Jacey a few dollars. Jacey heads for the office.
C: JACEY
D: You still don't know, do you?
C: DOUG
D: Know what?
S: INT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - OFFICE -
N: CONTINUOUS ACTION Doug follows Jacey inside as he rings up the sale.
C: DOUG
D: Know what?
C: JACEY
D: After Dad died... Mom... had an affair with Lloyd Abbott. That's how he got Dad's patent away from her.
C: DOUG
D: I don't believe you.
C: JACEY
D: Believe it or not. I don't care.
C: DOUG
D: You're full of shit.
C: JACEY
D: Then why don't you go ask Mom? Ask her what happened -- ask her why she doesn't have any friends -- ask her why she's never invited to the Abbott's -- ask her which side of the tracks we live on?
N: Jacey shoves the cash register drawer shut. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 40.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - NIGHT
N: The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight. The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him.
C: PAMELA
D: How long have you been here?
C: DOUG
D: A while.
C: PAMELA
D: Are you okay?
C: DOUG
D: I'm fine. Having fun?
C: PAMELA
D: Yes, I am. Come on, dance with me.
N: She pulls him towards the dance floor.
C: DOUG
D: You didn't tell me I had to dance.
C: PAMELA
D: Just one dance and we'll be even. I won't have to be mad at you anymore and you won't have to be so sorry.
C: DOUG
D: What am I supposed to be so sorry about?
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, you're not sorry?
C: DOUG
D: All right, yeah, I'm sorry.
C: PAMELA
D: Sorry about what?
C: DOUG
D: You always do this to me.
C: PAMELA
D: You said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. So maybe I'm not sure what you're sorry about?
C: DOUG
D: I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay?
C: PAMELA
D: You're sorry for feeling me up?
C: DOUG
D: Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it.
E: embarrassed
C: PAMELA
D: I accept your apology. Let's dance.
N: Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
N: Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause.
C: PAMELA
D: Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit?
N: The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 42.
C: DOUG
D: Home for the summer. It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor.
E: slight beat
C: PAMELA
D: You're not poor, are you?
C: DOUG
D: Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college.
N: Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.
C: DOUG
D: I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce.
C: PAMELA
D: They're just separated.
C: DOUG
D: What's the difference?
C: PAMELA
D: I don't know, you'll have to ask them.
C: DOUG
D: So, where's Eleanor tonight?
C: PAMELA
D: Eleanor's... just not here.
C: DOUG
D: Is she pregnant?
C: PAMELA
D: No! Who said that?
C: DOUG
D: I don't know, everybody in town is saying something different -- she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. So, which is it?
N: Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.
C: DOUG
D: Fuck off.
N: Ted is taken aback. Pamela's eyes fill with tears.
C: PAMELA
D: Why do you hate me so much?
C: TED
D: Excuse me, asshole, but...
N: Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela:
C: DOUG
D: I don't hate you.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the doorway.
C: JACEY
D: You asleep?
C: DOUG
D: Nope.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says:
C: DOUG
D: I'm gonna go to Penn like you.
N: Jacey snorts with incredulous laughter.
C: JACEY
D: You're gonna what?
C: DOUG
D: I'm going to the University of Pennsylvania. I think I'm going to be an architect, too.
C: JACEY
D: Like hell you are.
C: DOUG
D: Why not? Maybe we can be roommates in Philadelphia?
C: JACEY
D: You're nuts. You'll never get accepted to Penn. Besides, Mom couldn't afford it anyway.
C: DOUG
D: I'll get a scholarship.
C: JACEY
D: I had a four-point-0 grade average and I couldn't get a scholarship -- so, I say you got your head up your ass.
N: Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter. Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:
C: DOUG
D: 'Night.
S: INT. WOMEN'S APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY
N: (WINTER, 1958) Helen looks over the merchandise. Doug absent-mindedly trails after his mother as he studies a large brochure about the University of Pennsylvania.
C: DOUG
D: What's 'scenic design'?
C: HELEN
D: In what context?
C: DOUG
D: What a minute -- it's theatre.
C: HELEN
D: Mmmm?
C: DOUG
D: 'The Howard Lambert Scholarship in Scenic Design for the Theatre.' It's a full ride, four years. Pays everything almost. Hell, I could do that. Just have to figure out what scenic design is.
E: re: brochure
N: Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings. He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely:
C: DOUG
D: I'll wait for you outside, Ma.
S: EXT. LADIES APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - MOVIE
N: THEATER - SIDEWALK - DAY (MINUTES LATER) It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car. Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out onto the sidewalk.
C: HELEN
D: Hello, Muriel... Doris.
N: The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive off. Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie theater -- the marquee reads: KIM NOVAK -- JEFF CHANDLER -- JEANNE EAGELS):
C: HELEN
D: Why don't you drop me off at home and take the car and go out with your friends. Go have some fun.
C: DOUG
D: Why don't you?
C: HELEN
D: Why don't I what? Go hang out at the Dog'n'Suds?
C: DOUG
D: No, go out -- play bridge or whatever adults do for fun.
C: HELEN
D: I read for fun.
C: DOUG
D: You read too much.
C: HELEN
D: You sound like your brother.
C: DOUG
D: Come on -- let's go see a movie.
S: INT. MOVIE THEATER (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY
N: Doug and Helen share a bag of popcorn as they wait for the feature to begin.
C: HELEN
D: Came here on my very first date with Charlie. Saw Rosalie with Nelson Eddy and... not Jeanette MacDonald... oh... Eleanor Powell.
C: DOUG
D: Did Dad kiss you?
C: HELEN
D: No. I kissed him.
E: gives Doug a "look" slight beat
C: DOUG
D: All right, Mom.
E: grins
S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELD - GYMNASIUM - DAY
N: (SUMMER, 1959) The commencement exercises are being held in the sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium) announces the names of the graduates as he calls them forward to receive their diplomas.
C: PRINCIPAL
D: Pamela Louise Abbott...
N: Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms.
S: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY
N: Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings. As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on. Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard -- there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other.
C: LLOYD
D: Congratulations, Helen.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you. Congratulations to you, too. Where's Pam going to school?
C: LLOYD
D: Hmm... Christ, I forgot.
E: MORE
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 48.
C: LLOYD
D: Bryn Mawr. I should be able to remember that. It costs enough.
E: CONT'D
C: HELEN
D: She'll do well there -- a very bright girl.
C: LLOYD
D: And Doug -- he's going to...?
C: HELEN
D: He got a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania -- scenic design -- theater.
C: LLOYD
D: Same school as...
C: HELEN
D: Jacey.
E: filling in blank
C: LLOYD
D: Right. Well. Congratulations.
C: HELEN
D: Thank you, Lloyd.
N: They pass each other and head their separate ways. Their chance meeting has not gone unobserved: Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel. And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot.
S: INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
N: A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey, and Doug at their table. Helen and Doug are eating their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away. As Helen starts to open her purse Webb Crosby appears and picks up the bill.
C: WEBB
D: It's on the house.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, Webb, really -- that's not necessary.
C: WEBB
D: How many restaurants got an Ivy League busboy? That's worth a free meal. Charlie'd be real proud of these two highbrows.
C: HELEN
D: Yes, he would. He'd be extremely proud.
C: WEBB
D: You take good care of your little brother in Philadelphia, you hear me?
E: to Jacey
C: JACEY
D: Yes, sir.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: The Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat.
C: HELEN
D: What a wonderful night. What a wonderful day. My two Ivy League boys.
N: This is torture for Jacey. Doug looks out the window at the striped tent in the Abbott's front yard as they pass by. A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with parked cars and busy with late-coming guests. Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but his brother keeps his eyes on the road.
C: HELEN
D: I never understood that tent. I wonder if they own it? I'm surprised they don't just leave it up all year long.
E: MORE
C: HELEN
D: Lloyd's mother was a tough old bird. She sold eggs. They had a place way out on Ditch Road near County Line. That was ages ago. Poor Lloyd had to walk all that way in to school and then back everyday. Charlie used to call Lloyd 'Egg-head' and he didn't mean smart. I'm in the mood for ice cream.
E: CONT'D slight beat another beat
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - FRONT PORCH - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Jacey and Doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice cream. Helen rises from the porch swing and takes her empty bowl inside the house.
C: HELEN
D: I think I'll have one more scoop.
C: DOUG
D: Ping-pong?
C: JACEY
D: Too hot.
C: DOUG
D: You want to go out to the lake and get a couple beers?
C: JACEY
D: No, I don't want to go out to the... Goddammit. Goddammit! Look, I don't want you in Philadelphia. I don't need you around to remind everybody that I come from Hicksville, U.S.A. So if you're going to go to Philadelphia, you're on your own, dip shit. I don't need you riding my coat tails. Christ -- why don't you get your own life? Stop being my fucking shadow.
E: exhales
N: Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and goes to the front door.
C: DOUG
D: Screw you.
C: JACEY
D: You little prick!
N: Jacey hurls his BOWL at Doug -- it misses and SHATTERS on the wall.
C: DOUG
D: Missed me, peckerhead.
N: As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him -- they fall into the porch swing with such force that its chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the shrubs.
C: HELEN
D: Doug? Jacey? What was that?
E: O.S. inside house
N: Doug and Jacey scramble to their feet, their clothes are ripped and disheveled.
C: JACEY
D: You're dead, dip shit!
C: DOUG
D: You gotta catch me first, asshole!
N: Doug takes off with Jacey in hot pursuit. A few beats later, Helen steps out onto the front porch and discovers her sons and the porch swing missing.
C: HELEN
D: Jacey? Doug?
S: EXT. HOLT HOME AND STREET - NIGHT
N: Jacey races up a driveway -- Doug is nowhere to be seen.
C: JACEY
D: Come on, weasel dick! Come on out, you chicken shit!
N: A collection of GARBAGE CANS EXPLODE in all directions as Doug pops up from behind them and bolts down the driveway. Jacey chases after him, following him across the street. They pay no heed to Helen (in the b.g.) standing in their front yard, calling out to them:
C: HELEN
D: Douglas Lee! John Charles!
N: NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME Porch lights are turning on up and down the block and the neighborhood DOGS begin to HOWL as Doug leads Jacey between two houses. NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME Doug jumps up onto a tall wooden fence. He gets halfway over when Jacey leaps up and grabs him and the fence collapses, dumping them into a back yard vegetable garden. NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME Doug and Jacey wrestle and grapple in the muddy soil, cursing each other and crushing the rows of green crops. MRS. PORTER appears at her back door brandishing a broom.
C: MRS. PORTER
D: Git! Stop that! You two git!
N: She sails into combat with her broom swinging. But Doug and Jacey are unwilling to give up the fight -- they are finally separated by a strong blast of water. They sputter for breath and discover that Helen is holding the hose.
S: EXT. MRS. PORTER'S HOUSE - DAY (NEXT DAY)
N: Helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a large straw hat and reading a book. Doug and Jacey are repairing and painting the fence. Helen looks up from her book:
C: HELEN
D: That board doesn't look straight, Jacey. Come on, Doug, you've been painting the same spot for the last five minutes.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it, trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then, without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to volley.
S: EXT. ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY
N: The Plymouth drives along the two-lane blacktop past the fields of tall, green corn. Doug is driving, Helen sits beside him. She reacts to something in the distance:
C: HELEN
D: Isn't that Pamela Abbott?
N: In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.
C: HELEN
D: It is Pam. Pull over.
N: Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her.
C: HELEN
D: Hi, Pam. Do you need some help?
C: PAMELA
D: Hi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement.
C: HELEN
D: Well, maybe Doug can give you a hand?
N: Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth.
C: DOUG
D: Where's the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack?
C: PAMELA
D: What thing?
C: DOUG
D: The thing, the base that the jack fits into? This.
E: finds it in her open trunk
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, I thought that was just the 'spare-tire-holder-on-er.'
C: DOUG
D: Read your manual.
N: Pamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 54. Doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract it from the molten pavement.
C: HELEN
D: Pam, would you mind running Doug home? I'd like to get to the bank before they close.
C: DOUG
D: Mom...
E: protesting
C: PAMELA
D: Sure, Mrs. Holt, I'll drive him home. Thanks for stopping.
C: HELEN
D: Of course. Bye-bye.
N: Helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away. Doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack.
S: INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door. She calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill.
C: ALICE
D: Excuse me -- could I get change for a dollar?
N: The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up behind her.
C: JACEY
D: Can I help you?
C: ALICE
D: Yes, I need change for... Oh... you don't work here, do you?
E: turns to him
C: JACEY
D: No. I was just thinking about you. I was going to call you tonight.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 55.
C: ALICE
D: What? Why?
E: rattled
C: JACEY
D: There's a picnic out at River Point on Sunday -- I wanted to invite you.
C: ALICE
D: I couldn't.
C: JACEY
D: Bring Susan, kids love picnics.
C: ALICE
D: I need change for the parking meter.
E: re: the dollar bill
C: JACEY
D: Here.
N: Jacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change. Alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the coins.
C: ALICE
D: Oh, thanks.
C: JACEY
D: Do you have time for an ice tea?
C: ALICE
D: My mother's waiting by the car so I won't get a ticket.
C: JACEY
D: Maybe she'd like an ice tea, too?
C: ALICE
D: No.
C: JACEY
D: No harm asking.
C: ALICE
D: No. Don't do that.
C: JACEY
D: Why not?
C: ALICE
D: You know why.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 56.
C: JACEY
D: Then I'll make you a deal.
C: ALICE
D: I just came in to get some change.
C: JACEY
D: Come to the picnic on Sunday and I'll wait here and let you leave first, so your mother won't see me.
C: ALICE
D: I don't care if my mother sees you.
C: JACEY
D: Then you won't care if I ask her if she'd like to join us for an ice tea?
E: heads for the door
C: ALICE
D: No! Wait.
N: Jacey turns to her.
C: ALICE
D: I don't know if I can. I'll try. It just depends.
N: Alice goes out the door -- as she passes by Jacey he says:
C: JACEY
D: Sunday. River Point. Around noon.
N: Jacey watches through the window as Alice returns to the Town & Country station wagon and puts a few coins into the meter. Joan waits impatiently beside the car with Susan in hand. As the Abbott women walk down the sidewalk (away from the diner), Alice glances back and sees Jacey smiling at her from the diner window.
S: EXT. ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY
N: Pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to PAT BOONE sing "April Love" on the car RADIO. Doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire. Pamela climbs out and inspects his progress. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 56A. CONTINUED: (A1)
C: PAMELA
D: You think you'll finish sometime today? I'm getting sun stroke.
C: DOUG
D: Put the top up.
C: PAMELA
D: Stop acting like Jacey. What makes you think you're so... cool?
C: DOUG
D: Because -- I know all the answers on 'The $64,000 Question,' because I have X-ray vision and I can sing better than Pat Boone. And because I'm really a negro, but don't tell anyone around here, 'cause you know what would happen to me.
C: PAMELA
D: God, I can't even talk to you.
N: She starts to get back into the car, then turns to him:
C: PAMELA
D: Name one bad thing I've ever done to you.
C: DOUG
D: Why?
C: PAMELA
D: Go on, name one bad thing.
C: DOUG
D: What's the point?
C: PAMELA
D: You tell me, because I don't get it! Look, I'm not rich, my father is. And I didn't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! But unfortunately life is not a cafeteria!
C: DOUG
D: Life is not a cafeteria?
C: PAMELA
D: You know what I mean!
C: DOUG
D: Shit, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're rich?
C: PAMELA
D: Well, am I supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're so poor?
C: DOUG
D: No.
C: PAMELA
D: So then just stop it!
C: DOUG
D: Stop what?!
C: PAMELA
D: Stop treating me like an Abbott!
C: DOUG
D: Well, how am I supposed to treat you?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 58.
C: PAMELA
D: Like you used to. Like just plain Pam.
N: Doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize.
C: PAMELA
D: And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes.
N: Doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before.
C: PAMELA
D: What are you looking at?
C: DOUG
D: You.
S: EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - DAY (FOLLOWING SUNDAY)
N: Jacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler.
C: ALICE
D: Where is everyone?
E: O.S.
N: Jacey sits up and finds Alice standing behind him. She carries a picnic basket. Other than a few children skipping rock into the river they are alone.
C: JACEY
D: We are everyone.
C: ALICE
D: But you said...
C: JACEY
D: No, I didn't. I just said a picnic. I didn't say if anyone else was coming.
E: overlapping
N: Alice walks away. Jacey jumps up and runs after her.
C: JACEY
D: Where are you going?
C: ALICE
D: I'm sorry... I thought...
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 59.
C: JACEY
D: You didn't come here to see everybody else. You came here to see me. Didn't you? That's why you didn't bring Susan along.
E: blocking her way
C: ALICE
D: I'm married.
C: JACEY
D: I thought you were getting a divorce?
C: ALICE
D: I am, but it's not final yet. Besides, I'm two years older than you.
C: JACEY
D: Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler.
S: EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ANOTHER PART OF PARK -
N: LATER THAT DAY Jacey and Alice wander along a path on the riverbank.
C: ALICE
D: I knew he would hit me. Peter's a real hot-head. I knew if he hit me hard enough, hurt me enough, that even my father wouldn't stand for it. Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed. That did it. He punched me. Broke my front tooth.
C: JACEY
D: Bastard.
C: ALICE
D: So... what do you hear from Eleanor?
C: JACEY
D: I don't. Do you?
C: ALICE
D: No. Did you love her?
C: JACEY
D: We weren't in love, we were in heat.
N: Alice blushes.
C: JACEY
D: Did you love Peter?
C: ALICE
D: No.
C: JACEY
D: Then why did you marry him?
C: ALICE
D: Because...
S: EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT DAY
N: Jacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in behind the wheel (of her mother's Town & Country station wagon). He closes the door.
C: JACEY
D: Which tooth was it?
N: She points to a front tooth. He leans over to look at it.
C: ALICE
D: This one. I had it capped. You can't really tell, can you?
C: JACEY
D: No. It's a beautiful mouth.
C: ALICE
D: Are you going to kiss me?
C: JACEY
D: I don't want to scare you.
C: ALICE
D: I can't see you again, Jacey.
C: JACEY
D: Sure you can. There are ways.
C: ALICE
D: Oh, God... why you? Why am I telling all these things to you?
C: JACEY
D: Because there's no one else you can tell them to. Because I'm the only person you know who will admit to your face that your father's a bag of shit. The biggest bag of shit in this town. Better head home. Shouldn't be gone too long.
E: slight beat
N: Alice drives away. Jacey smiles -- he's won.
S: EXT. ROAD (OUTSIDE HALEY) - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: The Plymouth cruises back toward town. Jacey drinks a bottle of beer and happily contemplates the possibilities of a relationship with Alice. He approaches a billboard that reads: "MIDWEST STEEL DESK, INC. -- Welcomes You to Haley, Illinois." Jacey drains the last of the beer and hurls the empty bottle at the billboard as he drives past it.
S: EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - DAY (WEEKS LATER -
N: LATE AFTERNOON) Pam's convertible is parked in a weed-choked yard. Pam and Doug hurl rocks at the windows, trying to break what is left of the shattered windows on the weather-beaten, two-story farmhouse.
C: PAMELA
D: Who do you look like more, your father or your mother?
C: DOUG
D: Hell, I don't know.
C: PAMELA
D: Well, what did your father look like?
C: DOUG
D: Like a photograph. I never knew him. He died like a month before I was even born. Jacey probably looks more like him than I do. Jacey's named after him. That's how he got to be called 'Jacey,' after his initials, John Charles, J.C.
C: PAMELA
D: He died in a car wreck, right?
C: DOUG
D: You never heard about that?
C: PAMELA
D: About what?
C: DOUG
D: Well, it was sort of a car wreck. He drowned, or froze to death, or both, I don't know. He was trying to drive out to Mud Island.
C: PAMELA
D: Mud Island's in the middle of the lake.
C: DOUG
D: It was winter time, the lake was froze over.
C: PAMELA
D: Jesus, that's pretty stupid. Sorry.
E: catches herself
C: DOUG
D: It's all right, it is stupid. Real stupid. He did it on a bet. He bet someone twenty bucks that he could do it. He made it all the way out there, too. He went through the ice on his way back.
S: EXT. ABANDONED FARMHOUSE - ROOF - SUNSET
N: Doug and Pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof (they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic).
C: DOUG
D: I think my dad was like Jacey is. Some guys are just dare-devils. I bet Jacey once that he couldn't do a back-flip off the garage roof into a big pile of leaves. And he did it.
C: PAMELA
D: One time Eleanor and I snuck out and walked around the yard naked.
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: You did?
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah. It was sort of a dare, too. She dared me, I dared her, so we both did it.
C: DOUG
D: Was this day or night?
C: PAMELA
D: Night.
C: DOUG
D: Was there a full moon?
C: PAMELA
D: I don't remember.
C: DOUG
D: You walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree?
C: PAMELA
D: We just walked around the yard.
C: DOUG
D: Front yard or back yard?
C: PAMELA
D: Back yard.
C: DOUG
D: Oh.
C: PAMELA
D: Does it matter?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah. Back yard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things.
C: PAMELA
D: Okay.
C: DOUG
D: Okay.
N: Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty. The sunset provides a convenient excuse for their silence. But then Pam realizes he is staring at her.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
C: DOUG
D: You look pretty.
C: PAMELA
D: Really?
C: DOUG
D: Yup.
N: Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss.
S: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT
N: The marquee reads: "FRANK SINATRA -- EDW. G. ROBINSON -- 'A HOLE IN THE HEAD' -- CINEMASCOPE -- AIR CONDITIONED." Alice Abbott buys a ticket at the box office.
S: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
N: The movie has already begun. Alice enters the sparsely peopled theatre and pauses to allow her eyes to adjust to the darkness. A hand reaches out and takes her hand -- it is Jacey. He's seated beside the door. He rises and leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit.
S: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - BALCONY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
N: Jacey guides Alice to two seats deep in the shadows of the otherwise unoccupied balcony. They gaze at the screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his and they kiss passionately. Jacey slides his hand under her skirt. Alice presses herself against his hand and whispers: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 65/66.
C: ALICE
D: Don't tell... don't tell anyone what we're doing... don't tell anyone... no one can know, Jacey... no one...
S: INT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT
N: (WEEKS LATER) The station is closed and locked up for the night. Jacey and Alice are naked in the back seat of a car parked inside the dark service bay. It is a hot and humid night. They are slippery with sweat.

S: INT. HOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (WEEKS LATER)
N: Doug and Pamela lounge on opposite ends of the sofa with his bare feet pressed against hers in a gentle shoving match. They are watching an episode of "Sea Hunt" on the TELEVISION.

D: How long is your mom gone?
C: DOUG
D: Two weeks. She goes up every summer to see this friend she went to college with.
C: PAMELA
D: Eleanor lives in Chicago.
C: DOUG
D: She does?
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah. She's going to stewardess school.
C: DOUG
D: What do they teach you at stewardess school?
C: PAMELA
D: I don't know. How to wiggle your bottom.
C: DOUG
D: Maybe you should go there instead of Bryn Mawr?
N: She pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off his and clobbers him in the crotch. He moans and sits up.
C: DOUG
D: Oww! Damn!
C: PAMELA
D: Sorry.
C: DOUG
D: Watch it.
C: PAMELA
D: It was an accident. Don't be crabby.
N: She pulls him down on top of her. She kisses the tip of his nose then blows his bangs off his forehead.
C: DOUG
D: You want to... go upstairs?
C: PAMELA
D: No.
C: DOUG
D: I just thought maybe you were tired of just kissing?
C: PAMELA
D: I'm not tired of kissing. Are you?
C: DOUG
D: No, but touching is nice.
C: PAMELA
D: We are touching.
C: DOUG
D: I just... you know... would like to see what you look like without any clothes on.
C: PAMELA
D: Doug!
C: DOUG
D: Aren't you curious?
C: PAMELA
D: No, I know what I look like without any clothes on -- I look naked.
C: DOUG
D: Can I touch your breasts?
C: PAMELA
D: Jesus.
C: DOUG
D: Just on the outside?
C: PAMELA
D: No. You can kiss me. I like lips.
C: DOUG
D: You like lips?
C: PAMELA
D: I like your lips, block-head. I like being here like this. But I'm not taking my clothes off, 'cause if we do that, you know what we'll do. And I'm too... I don't want to be like my sisters. Not if I can help it.
N: They kiss but are almost instantly interrupted by the SLAM of the SCREEN DOOR. Doug looks up and does a surprised take as he sees Alice going up the stairs followed by Jacey.
C: DOUG
D: Shit...
C: PAMELA
D: Who is it?
C: DOUG
D: My brother. He just went upstairs with your sister.
C: PAMELA
D: With Eleanor?

N: Pamela rushes out of the house with her shoes in her hand. Doug chases after her in his bare feet.
C: DOUG
D: Hey... hold up!
C: PAMELA
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: DOUG
D: Hell, I didn't know. What does this got to do with us?
C: PAMELA
D: My God... what is she doing?
C: DOUG
D: Why is it okay for you to sneak around with me, but it's not all right for Alice to sneak around with Jacey?
C: PAMELA
D: Because I'm not Alice! And you're not Jacey! Alice is... is like my mom, they both get hurt so easy, they're like turtles without shells.
C: DOUG
D: Come on, take it easy.
C: PAMELA
D: You don't know my father. You don't know how he is about Jacey. He blames him for everything that happened with Eleanor.
C: DOUG
D: Eleanor fooled around with lots of guys, it's not Jacey's fault your dad kicked her out.
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, Jesus! He didn't kick her out, he put her in a nut house! He shipped her off to this clinic in Wisconsin.
C: DOUG
D: But... I thought you said she's in Chicago?
E: taken aback
C: PAMELA
D: She is now. They let her out a month ago.
C: DOUG
D: Oh, shit.
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah. Shit.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The Plymouth approaches -- Jacey turns off the headlights and KILLS the MOTOR and coasts to a stop in front of the house next door to the Abbotts'. Alice gets out of the car, Jacey hurries after her, following her into her front yard.
C: JACEY
D: Alice... wait!
C: ALICE
D: Go away.
C: JACEY
D: It's the truth, you know it is.
C: ALICE
D: No, no, it's all just... screwing.
C: JACEY
D: It's called making love.
C: ALICE
D: Don't.
C: JACEY
D: Don't what?
C: ALICE
D: Don't follow me.
N: He grabs her arm and stops her.
C: JACEY
D: What's wrong?
C: ALICE
D: I spend all day, every day, just waiting and waiting to be with you, waiting to forget everything, you make me forget... but then when I get dressed and I come home, you... just... leak out of me. Leak away. I go into the bathroom and I wash you off of me and I remember everything.
C: JACEY
D: Remember what?
C: LLOYD
D: Alice?! Is that you?
E: O.S.
N: Lloyd's voice paralyzes them.
C: LLOYD
D: Alice?
E: O.S.
N: Alice steps out of the shadows and finds Lloyd standing at the front door.
C: ALICE
D: Yes, Daddy...
C: LLOYD
D: Who are you talking to?
C: PAMELA
D: She's talking to me, Daddy.
E: O.S.
N: Pamela rises from a wrought iron bench in another part of the yard -- she strolls over to Alice.
C: PAMELA
D: Just girl talk.
C: LLOYD
D: You can talk inside. It's late.
N: Pamela and Alice go inside the house. Jacey exhales, he is ashen.

C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
C: DOUG
D: What's up?
C: PAMELA
D: I've been thinking -- maybe we shouldn't see each other right now.
C: DOUG
D: Oh, yeah? Why?
C: PAMELA
D: Well... if my father... I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and... well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too. You know?
C: DOUG
D: Christ, why do you have to take care of them?
C: PAMELA
D: No one else will.
E: shrugs
N: He struggles to hold his anger and frustration in check.
C: DOUG
D: Okay. Sure. See you around.

C: JACEY
D: No, thanks.
C: HELEN
D: Don't sit on the swing -- Doug just painted it.
C: JACEY
D: I know. I had to bring her here today. She couldn't see me tonight and there was nowhere else we could go.
E: slight beat
C: HELEN
D: I can appreciate that, Jacey, but...
C: JACEY
D: I love her, Mother. I'm going to marry her.
C: HELEN
D: Do her parents know about this?
C: JACEY
D: Of course not.
C: HELEN
D: Don't you think they should?
C: JACEY
D: I don't give a damn about them.
C: HELEN
D: Does Alice feel the same as you do?
C: JACEY
D: She loves me.
C: HELEN
D: Has she agreed to marry you?
C: JACEY
D: She will. She needs time. She's frightened. It's not easy for her.
C: HELEN
D: How does hiding it from her family make it any easier?
C: JACEY
D: We don't have any choice.
C: HELEN
D: Alice is a grown woman, she's a mother with a child of her own; if she really loves you then she should...
C: JACEY
D: All that matters is that I get her away from them before they find out.
E: cutting her off
C: HELEN
D: I can't be a party to that, Jacey.
C: JACEY
D: I don't need your help. I'm not asking for it.
C: HELEN
D: You'll have to find somewhere else to take Alice -- I can't have you bringing her here again. I'm sorry.
E: slight beat
N: She steps away from the screen door.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - ENTRY HALL AND STAIRCASE - NIGHT
N: Alice comes in the front door and goes up the stairs.

C: HELEN
D: Pamela, are you all right?
C: PAMELA
D: I need to talk to...
N: Jacey comes down the stairs, pulling on his bathrobe. Doug appears on the stairs behind him.
C: JACEY
D: What's wrong?
C: PAMELA
D: Alice took some pills, some of my mother's pills...
C: JACEY
D: Oh, Jesus, no...
C: PAMELA
D: She's all right, we took her to the hospital...
C: JACEY
D: I'll get dressed...
C: PAMELA
D: No!
C: JACEY
D: I have to see her.
C: PAMELA
D: No. That's why she sent me, she doesn't want you to come, she was afraid you would if you heard from someone else. She's all right.
E: MORE
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 77.
C: PAMELA

E: CONT'D
C: JACEY

S: EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - FRONT YARD - DAY (MOMENTS
N: LATER) Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam. Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak over the din of the LAWN MOWER.)
C: JACEY
D: How is she?
C: PAMELA
D: She's all right.
C: JACEY
D: Can I see her?
C: PAMELA
D: At the boathouse -- at the lake.
N: Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway. Doug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down the driveway and then up the street. Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam.
C: DOUG
D: What's going on?
N: She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes.
C: PAMELA
D: I had to... for Alice's sake.

C: JACEY
D: Come with me. Please, Alice, just come with me now, right now.
C: ALICE
D: I told you... I can't...
N: She walks OUT OF VIEW. Lloyd steps up behind Jacey and says softly but with piercing intensity:
C: LLOYD
D: Now, get out of here, you runt stud. And keep your poor-boy dick out of my daughters.
N: Jacey turns and stares at Lloyd -- then brushes past him on his way out the door.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - JACEY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY
N: Jacey haphazardly packs his suitcases. His emotions have been spent. Helen stands in the doorway. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 81.
C: HELEN
D: Why spend all night and half the day tomorrow waiting in Chicago for the Philadelphia bus? Why not just wait and take the morning bus to Chicago?
C: JACEY
D: Because... the sooner I get out of this fucking town the better.
C: HELEN
D: Suit yourself.
E: slight beat; stung
S: EXT./INT. ROAD/BUS (OUTSIDE HALEY) - EVENING (MAGIC
N: HOURSHORT TIME LATER) Jacey doesn't look out the window as the bus (on its way out of town) drives past the illuminated billboard that reads: "MIDWEST STEEL DESK, INC. -- Welcomes You to Haley, Illinois."
S: INT. HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Doug and Helen sit across from each other, neither one has much of an appetite. They eat in silence for a few moments, then:
C: DOUG
D: Dammit... why can't he just leave them alone?
C: HELEN
D: Who?
C: DOUG
D: The Abbotts. I don't know why... why couldn't he just forget 'em? Just pretend they didn't even exist?
C: HELEN
D: If the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would've had to invent them, one way or another. There are no ends of Abbotts in the world, if that's what you need.
E: MORE
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 82.
C: HELEN
D: And he just needs that somehow. Well, actually, I know how.
E: CONT'D
N: She rises and picks up her plate.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
N: Helen carries her plate to the sink. Doug follows her in.
C: DOUG
D: What do you mean, how do you know?
N: She sits at the kitchen table and sighs as if coming around to some central, hard truth.
C: HELEN
D: I was just a wreck when Charlie died.
E: MORE
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 83.
C: HELEN
D: Jacey was almost two and I was eight months pregnant with you and... well, some mornings I'd be crying before I even woke up. Then you were born. And Jacey just got lost in there. I didn't have anything for him. Mother took him over. He'd cry or call for me, and then I'd hear Mother answer him, and I'd go back to sleep. I should've taken us away from here, gone somewhere else.
E: CONT'D sighs bitterly
C: DOUG
D: Why?
C: HELEN
D: After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue.
C: DOUG
D: Christ...
E: stunned; almost ill
C: HELEN
D: I went to see Joan, I tried to talk to her, to put her mind at ease, but...
C: DOUG
D: Dammit, why didn't Lloyd tell her that nothing had happened?
C: HELEN
D: I'm sure he did, but men always say that, darling. Besides, Lloyd was always having affairs. He's that type of man.
C: DOUG
D: Ahhh, Jesus... but why? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Abbott?
C: HELEN
D: Because she's Joan Abbott. If you cross Joan you don't get invited to her parties -- and the Abbotts have the best parties in town. The only parties.
C: DOUG
D: I hate this town. I hate the Abbotts.
N: He slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over.
C: HELEN
D: I'm sorry, Doug, I shouldn't have told you.
C: DOUG
D: I already knew.
C: HELEN
D: People still talk about it?
C: DOUG
D: No, I've never heard anyone talk about it. Not to me.
C: HELEN
D: Then how did...?
C: DOUG
D: Jacey.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 85.
C: HELEN
D: Oh, Lord... he knows too?
C: DOUG

N: A vintage, third-floor, railroad flat -- sparsely furnished and neat as a pin. Jacey is hosting a party. A TONY BENNETT record ("When Somebody Breaks Your Heart") plays on the hi-fi. The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt. Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa). Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out of place is intact. Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in a tight cashmere sweater.
C: JACEY
D: Airplanes, bridges, skyscrapers, bras, all utilize the same fundamentals of structural design...
N: With his finger he traces the back strap of her bra beneath her sweater... INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 86.
C: JACEY
D: A stable foundation that resists compression...
N: His finger trails the shoulder strap of her bra...
C: JACEY
D: Carefully calculated suspension...
N: He draws his fingertip around the outside of her breast to the lower front of her bra...
C: JACEY
D: And cantilevered elements to provide support.
N: The Co-ed is bothered but none-the-less bewitched.
C: CO-ED
D: Ahh... you know, I'm engaged.
C: JACEY
D: So am I.
C: CO-ED
D: You are?
E: shocked
C: JACEY
D: I'm engaged in conversation with you.
N: Jacey smiles and then kisses her. Doug is spying on them from the safety of the crowd. Jacey winks at Doug. Doug shakes his head in wonder.
S: EXT. CAMPUS - SIDEWALK (UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,
N: PHILADELPHIA) - DAY (MONTHS LATERLATE FALL, 1959) Doug walks along the sidewalk towards the entrance of the theater carrying some rolled-up plans under his arm. He reacts as he sees:
C: DOUG
D: Hey! Hey! Pam!
N: Pamela Abbott walks across the quad. Pam is 19 years old now, her beauty in full bloom. Doug jogs over to her.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
C: DOUG
D: What are you up to?
C: PAMELA
D: I come down to use the library sometimes or go shopping.
C: DOUG
D: How's Bryn Mawr?
C: PAMELA
D: Very... Bryn. I got to catch the bus back.
C: DOUG
D: Just have to drop off these set designs -- you want to go get something to eat?
C: PAMELA
D: I can't. Sorry.
C: DOUG
D: Why not? It's been a long time.
C: PAMELA
D: You seem taller.
C: DOUG
D: And you seem... not so plain. So, dinner, okay?
E: re: her figure slight beat
C: PAMELA
D: I can't. I have to go to this party.
C: DOUG
D: What party?
N: The traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street.
C: PAMELA
D: Just a party I got roped into going. Maybe some other time, okay? I mean it, really.
C: DOUG
D: Just call -- I'm at Reed Hall.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 88.

C: MALE STUDENT
D: Hey, Holt! You got a visitor downstairs!
E: O.S.
S: INT. REED HALL - LOBBY - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
N: Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair.
C: DOUG
D: Did you miss the bus?
N: Pam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes:
C: DOUG
D: Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man... I better get you out of here before the Puritans tar-and-feather you. Can you walk?
N: Pam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door.
C: DOUG
D: Listen to me -- go out the front door, turn right, go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape. Okay? Just wait.
S: EXT. REED HALL - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
N: Pamela leans against the side of the building as the fire escape ladder descends to the pavement. Doug climbs down.
C: DOUG
D: Come on -- up we go. Pam?
N: Pam keels over and vomits.
S: INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra).
C: DOUG
D: What were you drinking, Sterno?
C: PAMELA
D: I'm cold...
C: DOUG
D: Hold on, we got to get your pants too. Can you stand up. ) No, you can't stand up. All right.
E: as she collapses on the bed
N: He undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her pants.
C: DOUG
D: Nope, nope, let's keep the panties on, okay? Pam? Can you hold on to your underpants? I'll hold on to your underpants.
E: she's out
N: He holds her panties in place while he struggles to get her pants over her hips.
S: INT. REED HALL - RESTROOM - NIGHT
N: Doug rinses out Pam's clothes in a sink.
S: INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
N: Pam's wet clothes have been draped over the radiator. Pam is passed out, tucked in under the covers. Doug sits on the edge of the bed gently cleaning her face with a damp washcloth.
S: INT. DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NEXT MORNING
N: Doug stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept with his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have been removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds that the bed is empty. She's gone.
S: EXT. BRYN MAWR - DORMITORY - TWO DAYS LATER
N: Pamela approaches her dorm carrying an armload of books. She starts up the steps then stops when she sees Doug.
C: DOUG
D: You're welcome.
C: PAMELA
D: I'm sorry, Doug.
C: DOUG
D: Shit. That's it? You're sorry?
C: PAMELA
D: Oh Jesus... did we?
E: suddenly alarmed
C: DOUG
D: Oh-Jesus-did-we what?
C: PAMELA
D: Did we... do it?
C: DOUG
D: What do you think?
C: PAMELA
D: I... don't... remember...
C: DOUG
D: Goddammit. Well, I know you might find this hard to believe, but I don't sleep with drunks.
N: He walks away. She calls after him.
C: PAMELA
D: Doug? Hey!
S: INT./EXT. DOUG'S DORM ROOM/FIRE ESCAPE - THAT NIGHT
N: Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He ignores her.
C: PAMELA
D: Doug! Open the window! Come on, I'm freezing. Doug...!
N: He gets out of bed, unlatches the window, then returns to the bed and his book. Pamela opens the window (with difficulty) and climbs in. She drapes her wet coat over the radiator and sits in the desk chair.
C: DOUG
D: If you feel like you're gonna puke use the wastebasket there.
C: PAMELA
D: I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I was embarrassed. I didn't know where I was when I woke up. I felt like I was dying, so, I just... I was going to call you.
N: Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.
C: PAMELA
D: I don't know... I was blotto. I mean, I was so happy to see you. Then I just got sad. I got sad. And stupid. It happens, you know?
N: Doug snaps his book shut.
C: DOUG
D: You want to hear something stupid?
C: PAMELA
D: What?
C: DOUG
D: When I was cleaning you up, wiping the puke off your face, I suddenly realized how much I miss you -- how much I love you. How's that for stupid?
N: Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.
C: DOUG
D: What are you crying for?
C: PAMELA
D: I love you. But it's too late.
C: DOUG
D: Why?
C: PAMELA
D: Everything's too screwed up.
N: Doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to console her.
C: DOUG
D: No, no, it's not too late. It's perfect timing. We're on our own now. No Jacey and Eleanor or Jacey and Alice. That's what stinks about being the youngest, we have to sweep up after everybody else. But now it's just us. It's our turn.
C: PAMELA
D: How can you be in love with me?
C: DOUG
D: How can you be in love with me?
C: PAMELA
D: 'Cause I've always have been. You... block-head.
N: He kisses her, then he gazes at her and strokes her hair.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
C: DOUG
D: You want to see something?
C: PAMELA
D: What?
C: DOUG
D: Come on.
S: EXT. THEATER - SIDEWALK (UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,
N: PHILADELPHIA) - NIGHT Doug and Pam hurry along the rain-swept sidewalk towards the theater.
S: INT. THEATER - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
N: The large theater is dark except for a single work light standing on the bare stage. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 93. Doug leads Pam by the hand down the aisle from the lobby.
C: PAMELA
D: What are we doing here?
C: DOUG
D: I want to show you something.
N: He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights.
C: DOUG
D: Just stand right there.
N: He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage. Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark.
C: PAMELA
D: Doug!
E: alarmed
C: DOUG
D: It's all right -- don't move! Stay put.
E: O.S.
N: There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft.
C: DOUG
D: Almost, almost... hold on.
E: O.S.
N: We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick- change routine.
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, Doug, it's beautiful.
C: DOUG
D: The senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. So, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. And -- anyway -- I'm the one whose design got picked.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 94.
C: PAMELA
D: What scene is it for? What play?
C: DOUG
D: Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt.
E: a tad embarrassed
C: PAMELA
D: You're really good at this.
C: DOUG
D: It's like building models when I was a kid. It's fun. It's... make-believe.
C: PAMELA
D: You know, they tore that old farmhouse down?
C: DOUG
D: Oh, no. Did they?
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah.
C: DOUG
D: They always tear down the wrong stuff.
C: PAMELA
D: Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so much.
C: DOUG
D: Missed you, too.
N: They kiss -- then Pamela pulls away. Doug studies her, then:
C: DOUG
D: You have a boyfriend, right?
C: PAMELA
D: No.
C: DOUG
D: Well, what? You worried what your old man would think?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 95.
C: PAMELA
D: He doesn't care what I do, as long as I don't do it in Haley.
C: DOUG
D: Then what's the problem?
C: PAMELA
D: I can't... do this.
C: DOUG
D: Why not? I mean... okay. We don't have to go so fast. Shit, I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh?
C: PAMELA
D: No, I did.
C: DOUG
D: How?
N: Pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle.
C: PAMELA
D: I'm on probation. They pulled a bed-check the night I was here. I have to be back in the dorm by ten. Gotta go.
C: DOUG
D: What about tomorrow? I could come up in the afternoon and...
C: PAMELA
D: No! It's just too late. It's all messed up. I can't seem to make things all right. The more I try the worse everything gets. I'm sorry.
N: Pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby.
C: DOUG
D: Pam! It's not too late!
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 96.
S: A148 INT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT A148
N: Pam enters the lobby. A female student CLERK (#1) displays a message as Pam passes by the front desk. CLERK #1 Pam -- some guy named Doug keeps calling for you. Pam ignores the Clerk and the message and goes upstairs.
S: EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - DAY
N: Pamela approaches her dorm. She stops as she sees Doug waiting beside the entrance. She turns and walks away.
S: A149 EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - NIGHT A149
N: Doug still waiting beside the entrance for some sign of Pam. He's tired, cold, and hungry. He grinds out his cigarette with his heel and walks away.
S: B149 EXT. JACEY'S APT. (PHILADELPHIA STREET) - DAY (SUNDAY) B149 INT. JACEY'S APARTMENT
N: Jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the Sunday newspaper. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa. Jacey scrutinizes his brooding younger brother.
C: JACEY
D: What's wrong with you?
C: DOUG
D: Nothing.
N: A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is distant, slightly off-balance.
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 97.
C: DOUG
D: How did you know I was here?
C: JACEY
D: You want another cup of...
E: O.S.
N: Jacey steps out of the kitchen and frowns when he sees Pam.
C: JACEY
D: I told you not to come by on Sundays.
C: PAMELA
D: I forgot.
N: The breath goes out of Doug as if he'd been struck in the stomach.
C: JACEY
D: Dammit, why didn't you call first?
C: PAMELA
D: Didn't have any nickels.
C: JACEY
D: Well, I didn't expect to see you again. You want to fuck? I mean, that's why you came over, right?
C: PAMELA
D: Sure.
E: slight beat
C: JACEY
D: Then take off your clothes.
N: Pamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if this -- he walks out the door.
S: EXT. JACEY'S APARTMENT (PHILADELPHIA) - SIDEWALK - DAY
N: Doug comes out of the apartment house and walks up the sidewalk. Tears begins to stream down his face. He begins to run and run as fast as he can.
S: INT. REED HALL (PHILADELPHIA) - LOBBY AND STAIRS -
N: THAT NIGHT Doug enters the dormitory and starts up the stairs. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 98.
C: JACEY
D: Doug...
E: O.S.
N: Doug turns and finds Jacey at the foot of the stairs.
C: DOUG
D: Fuck you.
N: Doug continues up the stairs -- Jacey pursues him.
C: JACEY
D: I didn't know.
C: DOUG
D: You didn't know what?!
C: JACEY
D: How you felt about Pam.
C: DOUG
D: Fuck you.
C: JACEY
D: I'm sorry.
C: DOUG
D: Apologize to her, you asshole!
C: JACEY
D: I did. I ran into her a few weeks ago at a party. She was drinking and I... it was easy. She felt guilty about telling her father about Alice and me. Actually, I made her feel guilty, I made her feel like she had betrayed Alice.
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you!
C: JACEY
D: I know. I mean, I do now.
C: DOUG
D: Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge?
C: JACEY
D: Nothing.
C: DOUG
D: Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott, right?
C: JACEY
D: Right.
N: Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood.
C: DOUG
D: I don't know you! I don't know who the fuck you are! You fuck everything. You fuck everything up! Why did you have to fuck Pam, too?!
N: Doug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps, clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood.
S: EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - DAY
N: Doug approaches Pam's dormitory.
S: INT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - LOBBY - DAY
N: Doug steps up to the female student CLERK (#2) at the front desk.
C: DOUG
D: Pamela Abbott, please. Tell her Doug is here.
N: CLERK #2 She's not here.
C: DOUG
D: I'll wait.
N: CLERK #2 But she left.
C: DOUG
D: What do you mean?
N: CLERK #2 She left... last night. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 100.
C: DOUG
D: Where did she go?
N: CLERK #2 I don't know.
C: DOUG
D: Well, did she go home?
N: CLERK #2 No one seems to know. She just took some clothes and left.
C: DOUG
D: Oh, God... no...
E: lost
N: His pain is so clear that it spurs the Clerk's sympathy. CLERK #2 Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but... well, I can give you her home address.
C: DOUG
D: Shit! Yeah, right... I mean... thanks. Thanks anyway. I know her home address.
E: explodes with irony slight beat
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (DECEMBER, 1959)
N: The Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits behind the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the street. He smokes a cigarette and stares at the house -- the pavement outside the driver's window is littered with butts.
S: EXT. SHOP (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY
N: Alice comes out on the street laden with packages and shopping bags. She's startled by Doug when he falls in beside her and follows her down the sidewalk.
C: DOUG
D: Where's Pam?
C: ALICE
D: I don't know.
C: DOUG
D: Is she with Eleanor?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 101.
C: ALICE
D: I don't know.
C: DOUG
D: In Chicago?
C: ALICE
D: I don't know.
C: DOUG
D: I couldn't find Eleanor's name in the Chicago phone book.
C: ALICE
D: Maybe it's unlisted.
C: DOUG
D: Well, do you know Eleanor's address?
C: ALICE
D: No. I don't know her address, I don't know her phone number. You'd have to ask my father for it. All right?
N: Alice turns and steps into another shop -- leaving Doug behind on the sidewalk.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CHRISTMAS, 1959)
N: PERRY COMO SINGS "The Little Drummer Boy" ON the TELEVISION. Doug rises from the sofa.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
N: Helen is peeling apples to make a pie. Doug enters and studies her for a beat.
C: DOUG
D: Are you okay?
C: HELEN
D: I'm fine.
C: DOUG
D: You look... tired.
C: HELEN
D: Just a cold.
C: DOUG
D: You sure?
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 102.
C: HELEN
D: I do wish Jacey had come home for Christmas. Maybe that's what's wrong with me.
C: DOUG
D: I guess that free-lance drafting job was too good for him to turn down.
C: HELEN
D: I don't think that's why he didn't come home. I wrote him a letter, you know. About Lloyd and me. Has he mentioned it to you?
C: DOUG
D: No.
N: Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey. He opens the refrigerator.
C: DOUG
D: When did you start drinking beer?
C: HELEN
D: Oh... I bought those for you. I had them in the basement; I kept forgetting to bring them up.
N: He does a bemused take on her.
C: HELEN
D: Good heavens, I know you drink beer.
N: Doug takes out two bottles of beer and opens them.
C: DOUG
D: Here. Have one with me.
C: HELEN
D: I bought those for you, honey.
C: DOUG
D: It's not good to drink alone, Mom.
C: HELEN
D: Don't be silly.
C: DOUG
D: Come on. Sit down. Have a beer.
N: He pulls out a chair for her. She reluctantly comes over and sits down. Doug sits and proposes a toast.
C: DOUG
D: Merry Christmas.
C: HELEN
D: Merry Christmas. It's beer.
E: takes a sip
C: DOUG
D: Let's drink 'em all.
N: Helen laughs girlishly.
C: HELEN
D: Charlie was always trying to get me to drink beer.
C: DOUG
D: Why do you always call him Charlie?
C: HELEN
D: That was his name.
C: DOUG
D: Why don't you ever say 'your father'?
C: HELEN
D: Sometimes I do, don't I? I don't know. When I think of him, I think of 'Charlie.'
C: DOUG
D: Did you ever... meet anybody else?
C: HELEN
D: You mean another man?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
C: HELEN
D: Well, everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are. I mean, single men don't stay in Haley if they have any starch. The only eligible man around was Drew Carter, but he smells like his dog.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 104. Her remark cracks Doug up -- Helen laughs, too.
C: HELEN
D: I wish I'd remembered the beers sooner. It's nice to see you smiling.
C: DOUG
D: Sorry.
C: HELEN
D: Don't be. Everyone has sad times.
N: Doug dissolves into tears. He lowers his head and shields his eyes with his hand. Helen leans over and strokes his hair. After a few moments, he rises and wipes away his tears with a dish towel.
C: HELEN
D: I'll tell you a secret. I did have a friend. A man in Chicago. I used to see him when I went up to Chicago to visit Bea during summer vacations.
C: DOUG
D: 'Used to see him' -- you don't see him anymore?
C: HELEN
D: No.
C: DOUG
D: Did you like him?
C: HELEN
D: He was a wonderful man. A little boring, but really, very wonderful.
C: DOUG
D: How long did this go on?
C: HELEN
D: About eight years or so, it was when you boys were still at home.
C: DOUG
D: That's a long time. Did you ever think about marrying him?
C: HELEN
D: He proposed. But, well, obviously, I said no.
C: DOUG
D: Why?
C: HELEN
D: Because I'm in love with... your father. With my memory of him. He was the one for me. Oh, I don't know... there's different kinds of love, darling. Some people you love no matter what. Other people you love if the situation is right. To me the best kind of love is the 'no matter what' kind. Well, I am a cheap drunk, aren't I?
E: slight beat
S: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAYS LATER
N: The bus cruises along the narrow ribbon of pavement. INSIDE BUS - ANGLE ON DOUG -- sitting by himself; there's not many passengers today. We hear the VOICES of rambunctious CHILDREN...
S: INT. HALEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
N: (LATE SPRING, 1960) The second-grade students are in the midst of an art project where they make a design by gluing various sorts of dried beans to colored paper -- but the beans are being thrown about the room and other beans have been spilled on the floor. Helen wearily attempts to rein in the unruly children:
C: HELEN
D: Too much noise, please. Let's finish up. Keep the glue on the paper. Sam, Lillian, Jack -- in your seats, please...
N: Helen suddenly loses her energy and interest in policing the children. Their hijinks continue as she steps out of the classroom. INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 106.
S: INT. HALEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
N: ACTION Helen steps over to a window and stares out -- lost in her own thoughts and oblivious to the NOISE from her classroom.
S: INT. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - THEATER - DAY (LATE
N: SPRING, 1960) Doug is on a cat-walk in the fly loft high over the stage floor. He strains as he drops 20 pound slabs of pig-iron onto a counterweight carriage, then he releases the line and flies a canvas backdrop up into the loft. He locks off the line, wipes his brow, turns, and finds Jacey standing behind him.
C: DOUG
D: What-the-hell do you want?
C: JACEY
D: Mom...
S: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL (PHILADELPHIA) - THAT NIGHT
N: Doug sits in an almost empty terminal waiting to catch a red-eye flight to Chicago. A group of just arrived stewardesses pass by chatting with a captain and other flight officers. Eleanor Abbott does a take on Doug, steps away from her co-workers, and doubles back to him.
C: ELEANOR
D: Hi, Doug!
N: Doug almost doesn't recognize her. She is twenty years old now and very grown-up, very stylish in her stewardess uniform. She smiles at him.
C: ELEANOR
D: How's your chin? Remember... the pencil?
E: as he doesn't respond
C: DOUG
D: Yeah. I have a little scar.
C: ELEANOR
D: You going home? Back to Hole-in- the-Ground, Illinois.
C: DOUG
D: My mother died.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 107.
C: ELEANOR
D: Oh God. Oh no. Oh, Doug, I'm sorry.
E: taken aback
C: DOUG
D: She had cancer. I just saw her Christmas. She was tired, but I thought she just had the flu or something. She didn't tell us. The hospital told Jacey when they called him.
C: ELEANOR
D: How is Jacey?
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: He had to stay to take his state board exams. He's coming back the day after tomorrow.
C: ELEANOR
D: He's an architect?
C: DOUG
D: If he passes his exams. He will.
C: ELEANOR
D: I'm so sorry, Doug.
C: DOUG
D: You know, I tried to find your phone number a couple of months ago.
C: ELEANOR
D: It's in my roommate's name, I've got to fix that.
C: DOUG
D: I was wondering if you knew where Pam was?
C: ELEANOR
D: No. I don't.
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: She left school.
C: ELEANOR
D: I know. My father called me.
E: MORE
C: ELEANOR
D: He was looking for her. I don't know where she is. I gotta run -- I'll miss my ride to the hotel.
E: CONT'D
C: DOUG
D: Tell Pam I love her.
N: Eleanor looks at him.
C: DOUG
D: Tell her... just tell her that.
N: Eleanor doesn't reply. She turns and walks away.
S: EXT. FUNERAL HOME (HALEY) - ALLEY - DAYS LATER
N: The distance between Jacey and Doug is telling, as is the difference in their behavior. Doug leans against a wall with his hands in his pockets, his eyes cast down on his shoes. Jacey roams the alley unable to stand still for grief. He lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of another.
C: JACEY
D: Why? Why didn't she tell us?
N: The FUNERAL DIRECTOR appears in the back door:
C: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
D: Gentlemen...
S: INT. FUNERAL HOME (HALEY) - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
N: Helen's closed casket is surrounded by floral tributes. Doug and Jacey enter from a door near the casket -- they pause in reaction to the crowded parlor, it overflows with mourners. Jacey explodes under his breath, so that only Doug can hear:
C: JACEY
D: Fucking hypocrites -- every one of 'em.
N: Jacey turns and walks out through the door they came in. Doug walks over to his seat in the front row -- he hesitates when he sees Lloyd Abbott standing in the back of the parlor.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - NEXT DAY
N: Doug sits at the table wrapping dishes in newspaper. Jacey comes in with a framed photograph of their grandmother.
C: JACEY
D: Do you want this picture of Grandma?
C: DOUG
D: You can have it.
C: JACEY
D: You sure?
C: DOUG
D: Yeah.
N: Jacey steps out of the dining room.
S: INT. HOLT HOME - HELEN'S BEDROOM - DAY (SHORT
N: TIME LATER) Jacey is packing Helen's things. Doug steps in the doorway.
C: DOUG
D: I'm starving. You want to go get something to eat?
N: Jacey is caught a bit off-guard by Doug's invitation, then:
C: JACEY
D: Sure.
S: INT. IRON SKILLET - NIGHT
N: Jacey and Doug are seated in a window booth. They eat in silence, then:
C: DOUG
D: You don't have to stick around. I can handle things here.
C: JACEY
D: What about school?
C: DOUG
D: I hate Penn. Always have. You were right.
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 110.
C: JACEY
D: About what?
C: DOUG
D: I should live my own life. Stop being your shadow. I'm not like you, Jacey -- I don't want to be like you.
C: JACEY
D: You going to stay here? In Haley?
C: DOUG
D: No. I was thinking New York. If I'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it.
C: JACEY
D: I'm sorry.
E: long beat
C: DOUG
D: I know you are. Did you have to get stitches?
E: slight beat
C: JACEY
D: Hmmm?
C: DOUG
D: Your eyebrow.
C: JACEY
D: My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches.
C: DOUG
D: Sorry.
N: Doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table.
C: DOUG
D: Found this in one of the boxes in the basement.
C: JACEY
D: What is it?
C: DOUG
D: A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad. Dad sold him the file drawer patent -- not Mom.
N: Jacey opens the envelope and studies the yellowed document.
C: JACEY
D: A car?
E: re: document
C: DOUG
D: Yup.
C: JACEY
D: Jesus Christ... he sold the patent for a used car?
C: DOUG
D: Used cars were the only kind of cars around. The war was on -- everything was mobilized. They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit. And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells.
C: JACEY
D: How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two?
C: DOUG
D: U.S. History -- high school. I should be an expert, I had to take the damn class twice. I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer?
C: JACEY
D: '1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is.'
E: reading aloud
C: DOUG
D: Wonder whatever happened to it?
C: JACEY
D: He parked it at the bottom of the lake.
S: EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY
N: Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat:
C: JACEY
D: Do me a favor. Don't stand here and wave good-bye... it makes me think of Mom.
E: fighting back tears
C: DOUG
D: Okay. See you.
N: Doug turns and walks away. Jacey climbs onto the bus.
S: EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY
N: Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth. He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts' front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up). Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well- dressed children and their parents are in attendance. Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott parties has begun.
S: EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
N: A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard. Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
N: Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes Doug, then:
C: LLOYD
D: What do you want?
C: DOUG
D: I want to talk to you.
S: INT. ABBOTT HOUSE - DEN - DAY
N: Doug follows Lloyd into the dark-paneled room.
C: LLOYD
D: Shut the door.
N: Doug closes the door. Lloyd lights a cigarette.
C: LLOYD
D: Smoke?
C: DOUG
D: No thanks.
C: LLOYD
D: Sit down.
C: DOUG
D: I don't want to.
C: LLOYD
D: Then don't. I'm sorry about your mother.
E: slight beat
C: DOUG
D: Sorry about what?
C: LLOYD
D: You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would've ever stood a chance with someone like her. That just goes to show you how stupid this town is -- that they'd believe she slept with me. That'd make Charlie laugh. Your old man was my best friend. He used to call me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody did. And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell with Helen Riley. Of course, that was all before I became Lloyd Abbott -- Mr. Abbott. That was back when I still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket. Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen. I used to spy on 'em -- yup, I did. Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house -- your house -- and watch 'em talk.

C: LLOYD
D: And talk. I never knew what to say to a girl. Never could just talk. Could dance, could listen to the radio. But I couldn't talk... except with your mother, except with Helen. I talked more to her after your dad died than I'd ever talked to any woman before then -- or since then. Jesus, I talked. Just like this. Just like right now. Just pouring out. Helen would listen and whatever I said, she'd never make me feel bad or ignorant or guilty. I mean... for Christ's sake, she never blamed me for what happened at the lake, for letting Charlie drive out on that ice. She never did anything but try to make me hurt less and I...
E: CONT'D
N: Lloyd is startled by Joan as she opens the door.
C: JOAN
D: Lloyd...?
C: LLOYD
D: Get out of here!
C: JOAN
D: It's time for Susie's birthday cake.
C: LLOYD
D: Goddammit, Joan, go way! Get the hell out of here! Leave me alone!
E: exploding
N: He hurls his GLASS at her and it SHATTERS on the door jamb. Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut in her face. He leans against the door and catches his breath.
C: LLOYD
D: I wanted sons -- isn't that funny? I wanted sons and I got three daughters. I wanted a woman I could talk to and I got a woman whose ears are stuffed full of money and Percodan. But I got the chicken shit off my shoes.
E: MORE
N: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 115.
C: LLOYD
D: My shoes are clean. I know that's what Jacey thinks. I could always tell by the way he looked at me -- even when he was a little boy -- like I owed him something. But, goddammit, he's wrong. That bet was your father's idea and I never meant your mother any harm. I would've done anything for her -- anything. I loved her. But the only thing she ever wanted from me was just for me to leave her alone.
E: CONT'D slight beat
N: He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug:
C: LLOYD
D: So, what do you want?
C: DOUG
D: I want to find Pam -- and you're going to tell me where she is.
S: EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT BUILDING (CHICAGO) - THAT
N: NIGHT Doug navigates the busy sidewalk to the entrance of the building. He checks the number over the door to the address on the scrap of paper in his hand.
S: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING DOORWAY - ELEANOR'S APARTMENT -
N: NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) Doug knocks on the door. Eleanor opens it, she's dressed for work in her stewardess uniform. She's obviously surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets him with a warm smile.
C: DOUG
D: Where is she?
S: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE DISPLAY WINDOW (CHICAGO) -
N: SIDEWALK - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER) Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate glass window with his index finger (printing the letters in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's POV); his message reads: "I love you." INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 116.
S: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE ENTRANCE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT
N: (MOMENTS LATER) Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk.
C: PAMELA
D: How can you...?
C: DOUG
D: How can I what?
C: PAMELA
D: Ever... forgive me?
C: DOUG
D: You always loved me no matter what I did, right?
C: PAMELA
D: Yeah.
C: DOUG
D: Maybe that's how I love you -- no matter what. That's the best kind of love, you know?
C: PAMELA
D: But... oh, Jesus... how do we start all over again?
N: Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and embraces her tenderly, holding her close.
C: DOUG
D: There. We're doing it.
C: PAMELA
D: Doing what?
E: through her tears
C: DOUG
D: Starting over. So, what are you doing tonight? You want to go out?
C: PAMELA
D: You're crazy.
C: DOUG
D: Some people never change.
N: He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then gives a short, but sweet, kiss. Then he smiles:
C: DOUG
D: Hi.
C: PAMELA
D: Hi.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
