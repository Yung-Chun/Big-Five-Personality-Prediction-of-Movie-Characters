N: LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues.
S: INT. STATION LOBBY
N: CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing trains, etc.

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues. MAN'S VOICE (over scene) Oh, excuse Me! CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy.
C: BRUNO
D: I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines.
E: smiling with sudden recognition
N: Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before.
C: BRUNO
D: Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?
E: snapping his finger
N: Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist.
C: BRUNO
D: I certainly admire people who do things. I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.
E: with open admiration smiling and introducing himself

E: wryly
C: BRUNO
D: It must be pretty exciting to be so important.
C: GUY
D: A tennis player isn't so important.
E: fidgeting slightly
C: BRUNO
D: People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything.
N: Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little embarrassed.
C: BRUNO
D: I suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles.
E: still insistent on being friendly
C: GUY
D: You are a tennis fan.
E: politely
N: Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.
C: BRUNO

E: sharply
C: BRUNO
D: There I go again. Too friendly. I meet someone I' like and open my yap too wide. I'm sorry... At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.
E: contritely
C: GUY
D: That's all right. Forget it. I guess I'm pretty jumpy.
N: Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.
C: BRUNO
D: There's a new cure for that. Scotch and plain water. A pair. Double. Only kind of doubles I play.
E: to waiter to Guy with a chuckle
C: GUY
D: You'll have to drink both of them.
C: BRUNO
D: And I can do it. When's the wedding?
E: grinning moving in
C: GUY
D: What?

C: BRUNO
D: I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation.
N: The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a glass to Guy. Guy takes it.
C: GUY
D: I guess I will.
E: as if he needs it
C: BRUNO
D: This is wonderful -- having your company all the way to New York.
E: happily
C: GUY
D: As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct. I'm stopping off. At Metcalf.
E: forced to explain
C: BRUNO
D: Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there for?
C: GUY
D: It's my home town.
C: BRUNO
D: Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked! Am I right?

S: INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)
N: Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table. Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.
C: BRUNO
D: Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in. He finally gave up. He thinks I'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait. You my friend, Guy?
E: bitterly wistfully
C: GUY
D: Sure. I'm your friend, Bruno.
C: BRUNO
D: No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm anything special. Only my mother. My father hates me.
E: a little woozy empties the bottle into his glass
N: Guy smiles this off as nonsense.
C: GUY
D: You must be imagining things.
C: BRUNO
D: And I hate him. He thinks I ought to catch the eight-five bus every morning, punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something. Him -- with all his money!
E: hitting the bottom of the bottle for the last drop
C: GUY
D: Well, what do you want to do?

N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 9.
C: GUY
D: Before, of course.
E: chuckling
C: BRUNO
D: I want to do everything. I got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?
E: leaning forward eagerly
C: GUY
D: Not lately.
C: BRUNO
D: I did. I flew in a jet plans too. Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill! Almost blow the sawdust out of my head. I'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon...
E: his hand traces a swift streak through the air, and he adds sound effects
C: GUY
D: What are you trying prove?
E: amused and curious
C: BRUNO
D: I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky. You're smart. Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?
C: GUY
D: Marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?
E: quickly
C: BRUNO
D: Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend, remember? I'd do anything for you.

E: CONT'D glancing at his watch
C: BRUNO
D: What'd you say her name was -- your wife's?
C: GUY
D: Miriam.
C: BRUNO
D: That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around a lot, I suppose?
C: GUY
D: Let's not talk about it any more.
C: BRUNO
D: Maybe she'll make more trouble for you.
E: almost hopefully
C: GUY
D: I don't think so.
C: BRUNO
D: You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?
C: GUY
D: Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we?
C: BRUNO
D: Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?
C: GUY
D: You've been reading too many of these.
E: indicating the detective novels
C: BRUNO
D: You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?
E: going right on
C: GUY
D: No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law.
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 11.
C: BRUNO
D: But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?
C: GUY
D: You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.
C: BRUNO
D: Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.
C: GUY
D: Why?
C: BRUNO
D: Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce -- Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan...
E: raises a finger and stops Guy's protest
C: GUY
D: I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.
C: BRUNO
D: It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders.
E: ignoring the remark
C: GUY
D: Swap murders?
N: Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 12.
C: BRUNO
D: Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours.
C: GUY
D: We're coming into my station.
E: with relief
C: BRUNO
D: For example, your wife, my father. Criss-cross.
C: GUY
D: What?
E: sharply
C: BRUNO
D: We do talk the same language -- don't we, Guy?
E: with a smile
C: GUY
D: Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the lunch.
E: preparing to leave
C: BRUNO
D: I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself.
E: beaming
N: He holds out his hand. Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.
C: GUY
D: Nice meeting you, Bruno.
C: BRUNO
D: You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like it?
E: detaining him at the door
C: GUY
D: Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay.
E: he salutes a quick goodbye and hurries away

N: Guy is walking up the main street. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 14.
S: EXT. MUSIC SHOP
N: Typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc. Activity of a couple of customers and salespeople inside. Guy comes along the street and goes into the shop.
S: INT. MUSIC SHOP
N: As Guy enters. There are the usual counters and shelves, pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store. MIRIAM is finishing with a customer at a counter. MR. HARGREAVES, the manager, is busy at the shelves. Another girl clerk is serving a customer. In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of popular music. A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front. Guy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with her woman customer, handing over a small package.
C: MIRIAM
D: Even change. Thank you, Madam. Well -- hello, Guy.
E: taking money from customer she looks up at Guy as the woman moves off
C: GUY
D: You're looking well, Miriam.
N: Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small.
C: MIRIAM
D: So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends.
C: GUY

C: GUY
D: My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?
C: MIRIAM
D: When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous.
E: coyly
C: GUY
D: I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam. Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range.
E: biting
C: MIRIAM
D: Let's talk in there.
E: indicating empty glass cubicle
N: Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room. Miriam has brought her purse along. They enter.
S: INT. CUBICLE
N: Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped together in the close quarters.
C: MIRIAM
D: Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy?
E: intimately
C: GUY
D: Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you're going to have another man's baby.
E: coldly

D: If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you.
E: taking the money greedily

D: What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it.
C: MIRIAM
D: I'm not getting a divorce.
E: tucking the bills away
C: GUY
D: Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year.
E: tense and angry
C: MIRIAM
D: It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.

D: So, it's really serious between you two? Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm coming to Washington.
C: GUY
D: What for?
C: MIRIAM
D: To have my baby and be with you.
C: GUY
D: Why me? It's not my baby.
C: MIRIAM
D: But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father.
C: GUY
D: You black conniving little liar!
E: furiously
N: A few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing.
C: MIRIAM
D: Keep your voice down.
C: GUY
D: What happened? Did he run out on you?
C: MIRIAM
D: No man runs out on me. Not even you.

C: MIRIAM
D: I could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe you?
E: demurely
N: Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed. MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage. Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.
C: GUY
D: ...That's what should happen to people like you. And if I...
C: HARGREAVES
D: Break it up, folks. This isn't the place for a family quarrel.
E: interrupts
C: GUY
D: Sorry. I'm leaving.
E: his eyes blazing
N: He starts to exit from the booth. Miriam grabs his arm and screams at him:
C: MIRIAM
D: You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can't throw me away like an old shoe. I'm coming to Washington to have my baby. Tell that to the senate!
E: yelling like a fishwife
N: Guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 19. The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner.
S: EXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION
N: Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides past him without noticing.
S: EXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS)
N: Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the telephone, speaks into it.
C: GUY
D: Long distance. I want Washington, D. C. The number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton.
E: a pause
N: Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it. He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to him.
C: GUY
D: Right.
E: continuing
N: Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.

N: Meantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of the train:

N: The scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving the final touches of a manicure. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands, and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite him at a little table in the Anthony living room. She is working with scissors, file and nail buffer. Mrs. Anthony is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors a tigress-like determination to protect her son, Bruno is in his robe and is unshaven. There is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy dark appointments of this room.
C: MRS. ANTHONY
D: Since you insisted on a manicure, dear, I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet. You're so restless lately.

N: They look at the painting. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 23. INSERT The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.
