S: INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY
N: A GIRL'S FACE fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty. Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively. She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting: institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive, scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then - A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her

N: HER CELLPHONE skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE. WIDEN TO REVEAL:

N: Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock. BACK TO: OUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display. INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY - u done?! BACK TO SCENE Our girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply.

C: PROCTOR
D: That's it, people! Wrap it up!
E: O.S.
N: There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred panicked asses twisting in their seats. Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text message from her friend: y don't u check the ride board? A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around her students rise and begin stampeding out. PROCTOR (O.S.) (cont'd) (shouting to be heard) Test results will be posted on the Philosophy Department's web site in two weeks... Enjoy your break and have a Happy New Year. She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the stairs when -

S: EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
N: Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty, the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie. Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, on her way to...
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY
N: She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye- catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads: RIDE BOARD. She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a handwritten message: NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23? Call 607-154-9835 A gust of wind riffles the notice. TITLE CARD ON BLACK: DECEMBER 23, 3:12 P.M.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes swirl in their sickbed glow. We follow her to... A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the only vehicle here for some time. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 4. An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions: books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc. She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake. He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.
C: GIRL
D: Do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance?
N: The sight of her quickly snaps him awake. He scrambles out.
C: GUY
D: There were still cars when I got here. I thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow?
E: still a little groggy
C: GIRL
D: What time is it?
C: GUY
D: Quarter past three.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 5.
C: GIRL
D: I'm two hours late?! Shit. Sorry. You should've just left without me. That's what I would've done. Hurry up and pop the trunk so I can stow my shit.
N: He does. She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity with more of his things: CLOTHES, a bag of GROCERIES, etc. GIRL (cont'd) (calling to him) Jesus, I'm just going home for Christmas. What are you doing? Pulling up stakes and movin' your Oakie family to Californey? She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.
C: GUY
D: I'm kinda getting kicked out of my apartment. I didn't have time to find someplace new before exams.
N: She takes out some of his things. Puts them on the ground. GUY (cont'd) Here, let me help you with that-
C: GIRL
D: Why don't you just get the engine started and put the heat on? I can handle this.
N: He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed. GIRL (cont'd) (smiling) Well? What are you waiting for? I thought you wanted to stay ahead of the snow? He hurries back to the driver's seat. Starts the engine. She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk. Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door handle. Stuck. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 6. Now it's her turn to look impatient. She jerks on the handle again, until he leans over to open the door from the inside.
C: GUY
D: Sorry... it sticks.
N: She rolls her eyes, climbs in.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY
N: She climbs in, tries to power her window all the way to the top. It keeps getting stuck, leaving a half-inch gap. She shoots him a look: "What the hell?"
C: GUY
D: That's as far as it goes. Sorry.
N: She rolls her eyes, never once interrupting her phone conversation. He puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour roadtrip.
S: EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT
N: As they drive off, reveal: a forgotten bag of GROCERIES, still sitting on the ground.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY
N: They leave campus. He eavesdrops as she rattles on.
C: GIRL
D: Where are you? No, we're just rolling out... ... Believe me, I tried, but I couldn't get a flight. It's my own fault for waiting `til the last minute...

S: INT./EXT. OLDSMOBILE - DUSK
N: She looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south on the interstate. The road is wet, though the snow hasn't yet started to stick.
C: GIRL
D: What, are you kidding? I'm bored to tears... No, we're still on the highway... how should I know, all highways look exactly alike.
E: laughs; on her cell
N: She looks up, catches him shooting irritated looks her way. GIRL (cont'd) What?
C: GUY
D: You going to be on that thing the whole-
N: He doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he was about to say. Focuses on the highway ahead. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 8.
C: GIRL
D: Uh oh, somebody's upset. I better call you back. Who do you think? Ride Board Guy. Okay, `bye.
E: on her cell pause
N: She hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps another digital picture of him. She puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at her. GIRL (cont'd) What?
C: GUY
D: This isn't cool. If I have to drive, you have to talk to me.
E: blurting
C: GIRL
D: What, I'm the in-flight entertainment?
C: GUY
D: That's how this ride-sharing thing works. Division of labor. We split everything fifty-fifty... Get it?
C: GIRL
D: I've got news for you, I don't get much more entertaining than when I'm on the phone.
N: He darkens, mutters under his breath:
C: GUY
D: This is turning out great.
E: sarcastic
C: GIRL
D: What's that mean?
C: GUY
D: Forget it.
N: They ride in silence for a moment. She tries to strike up a conversation, by way of extending an olive branch. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 9.
C: GIRL
D: So you're from Wilmington, huh?
C: GUY
D: Yeah.
C: GIRL
D: Where'd you go to school?
C: GUY
D: Um... Saint Vitus Academy.
E: falters for a second
C: GIRL
D: St. Vitus? You're making that up.
C: GUY
D: You're acquainted with every school in the area?
C: GIRL
D: Pretty much, yeah.
C: GUY
D: Including all the Catholic ones? Because that's where I went. Saint Vitus Academy for Catholic Boys.
C: GIRL
D: Okay, fine...
N: They drive for a few moments in silence.
C: GUY
D: We had a class together, you know.
C: GIRL
D: Huh?
C: GUY
D: Intro to Modern Philosophy.
N: He looks at her expectantly, as if she should remember him.
C: GIRL
D: What? There were about a million people in that class. It was like Woodstock. Did you ever see so many Eastern religion types? So, what's your major?
E: then
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 10.
C: GUY
D: Eastern religions.
N: She hoots with laughter. But he's not kidding. He seems surprised by her response. GUY (cont'd) You aren't majoring in philosophy?
C: GIRL
D: No. Why?
C: GUY
D: I don't know. I just assumed...
C: GIRL
D: Why would you assume anything about me? We just met.
C: GUY
D: I don't know... I guess you just... look like a philosophy major.
E: a little defensive
C: GIRL
D: Try engineering.
N: She enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face, lets him twist for a second before explaining: GIRL (cont'd) I only took Philosophy because I need a humanities credit. I heard it was an easy `A.' (then) Hey, that reminds me. What'd you put for the extra credit question on the final?
C: GUY
D: Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence.
C: GIRL
D: Which is basically reincarnation, right?
C: GUY
D: No, they're not really the same thing. Reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you
E: MORE
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 11. GUY (cont'd) live the same life over and over again. He looks out at the road, reciting Nietzsche from memory: GUY (cont'd) The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over, and you with it, a grain of dust. She looks at him as if he's nuts. A beat, then:
C: GIRL
D: He died of syphilis, you know.
N: He stares grimly at the road ahead, biting back a comment. GIRL (cont'd) High school and philosophy. Pretty much covers everything, don't you think? Guess that concludes the entertainment portion of today's flight. She turns on the radio, finds a station with Christmas music. TITLE CARD ON BLACK: 5:15 P.M.
S: EXT. INTERSTATE - EVENING
N: The Oldsmobile passes slower-moving VEHICLES and zooms by. Its interior light is on.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - EVENING
N: Her bare feet are propped on the dash, as she removes the old nail polish. Widen. She's turned the front seat into a nail salon. Cotton balls, emery boards, bottles of clear and colored varnish are strewn everywhere. She picks a bottle, opens it, begins painting her nails. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 12.
C: GIRL
D: Next gas station you see, do me a favor and pull over. I gotta pee.
E: concentrating
C: GUY
D: Okay, I'll keep my eyes peeled.
N: She looks up from her feet, giving him a funny look. GUY (cont'd) What?
C: GIRL
D: That phrase. `Keeping your eyes peeled.' It's kind of creepy, if you think about it.
E: resumes painting
C: GUY
D: Huh. Actually, yeah, it is sorta.
N: His eyes linger on her freshly painted toes on the dashboard. She catches him staring. He blushes, embarrassed. Says: GUY (cont'd) ... Speaking of peeling eyeballs. Did you know that's how they do that corrective eye surgery?
C: GIRL
D: They use a laser.
C: GUY
D: Well, yeah, they do... But there's definitely peeling involved too. I saw it on Discovery Health. If more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife.
C: GIRL
D: Laser.
C: GUY
D: Right, laser.
C: GIRL
D: I'm having corrective eye surgery over the break.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 13.
C: GUY
D: Oh.
N: An awkward beat.
C: GIRL
D: It's okay. I'm not really worried.
C: GUY
D: Why?
C: GIRL
D: I'm not worried?
C: GUY
D: You're getting it done...
C: GIRL
D: Because I hate wearing glasses.
C: GUY
D: But they look good on you.
N: She frowns.
C: GIRL
D: How do you know? I don't wear them outside my dorm.
N: He gets a cornered look.
C: GUY
D: You sure? You never... to class or anything? Because I could swear I-
C: GIRL
D: Never.
C: GUY
D: Huh. Weird. I wonder why I thought-
N: He breaks off, saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead. GUY (cont'd) Hey, look! Here's your gas station! She looks at him across the dark front seat, suspicious. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 14.
S: EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - NIGHT
N: A florescent oasis in the gathering dark. A tow truck and several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it. The Oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump.
S: EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - GAS PUMP / OLDSMOBILE - MINUTES
N: LATER He starts the pump. Notices her still seated in the car. He knocks on her window. She opens the door.
C: GUY
D: I thought you had to pee?
C: GIRL
D: I didn't expect us to find a bathroom so soon. My nails aren't dry.
C: GUY
D: Oh.
N: He looks over the roof of the car, sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot. GUY (cont'd) Well if you want, I can carry you.
C: GIRL
D: That's okay, they'll be dry in just a second.
C: GUY
D: Come on, I'm good at this...
C: GIRL
D: You are not carrying me inside.
N: He opens her door, pulls her legs around, and crouches down between them.
C: GUY
D: Hold on.
C: GIRL
D: What are you doing?! Wait -
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 15. Suddenly he's rising and she throws her arms instinctively around his neck. Unsettling as the deeply-weird moment is, she decides it's best to just humor him. But first - GIRL (cont'd) I need my purse. He crouches a little so she can reach to retrieve it.
S: INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - NIGHT
N: The door JINGLES as he enters, carrying her. His face is red from effort, hers from embarrassment.
C: GIRL
D: Thanks.
C: GUY
D: Sure.
N: He just stands there. She taps him on the shoulder.
C: GIRL
D: You can let me down now.
C: GUY
D: Okay.
N: He crouches so she can slide off. She gives him a look, slips on the pair of flip-flops she's brought with her, then heads off in search of the ladies bathroom. Meanwhile, our guy saunters up toward the front of the convenience store. He nods to the twitchy CLERK, 20s, engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter.
S: INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT
N: The toilet is gross, tiled a queasy green, graffiti-covered. Our girl finishes peeing, gets up from the toilet, uses her foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet. She washes her hands, holding them under the automatic dryer. Broken. She wipes her hands dry on her jeans. Is about to exit when she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 16. On impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse. Slips them on. Checks herself out in the mirror. Cool? Sexy? With her glasses on she notices something scratched into the dirty mirror. CLOSE ON MIRROR Where we see: "J.C.R. 12-24-88 R.I.P." She frowns, slips her glasses back in their case and moves to exit. But when she grips the doorknob she finds it LOCKED. She frowns. Rattles the doorknob a few times. A look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the doorknob harder. Did someone lock her in? Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand. She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts:
C: GIRL
D: HEY. HEY, I'M LOCKED IN HERE!
N: Nothing. She turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something. HER POV: A VENT above the sink, near the ceiling. BACK TO SCENE She puts a foot up into the sink, testing it to see if it can take her weight. Then climbs up and straightens on wobbly legs, until her face is near the filthy dust-clogged vent. GIRL (cont'd) (calling into vent) HEY. CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?! HEY! Her voice ECHOES weirdly. When the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl: LAUGHTER. As if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense. Pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 17. And finally succeeds in getting the door to open.
S: INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: As she exits she sees the CLERK and our guy talking quietly, as if they know one another. She hesitates for a second, spying on them around a display of chips. Suspicious. AT THE COUNTER: She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water.
C: GIRL
D: Didn't you hear me banging in there?
C: GUY
D: When?
E: startled; puzzled smile
C: GIRL
D: You think it's funny? Me locked in?
C: GUY
D: Locked in where?
C: GIRL
D: You're telling me you didn't just hear me banging on the door?
C: GUY
D: I don't know what you're-
C: GIRL
D: Forget it. Let's just get on the road.
E: cuts him off
N: He gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door. The clerk calls to him:
C: CLERK
D: Remember, highway's your best bet-
C: GUY
D: Don't worry about it man, I got it all covered.
E: dismissive
N: She frowns, following him to the exit. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 18.
C: GIRL
D: Are we lost or something?
C: GUY
D: No, I've made this drive a million times.
E: quickly
N: He holds the door for her, then follows her outside.
S: EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - CONTINUOUS
N: As they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty. He looks at the money, as if he's never seen U.S. currency before.
C: GUY
D: What's that for?
C: GIRL
D: My half of the gas.
C: GUY
D: Keep it.
C: GIRL
D: What do you mean? Isn't that how ride-sharing works? -- We split everything fifty-fifty?
C: GUY
D: I don't take money from friends.
N: Since when are they friends? They separate, walking around to their respective sides of the car. She tries the passenger door handle, only to find it stuck. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 19. She rolls her eyes, waits for him to open it from the inside.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: She stares out at the road ahead, lulled by the sound of the windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side. HER POV: A nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road. Which wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except- He suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit.
S: EXT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
N: The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to illegibility: Scenic Route 606. The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow. Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
N: She falls against him, bracing herself against the dash.
C: GIRL
D: What the hell are you doing!?
C: GUY
D: Scenic detour.
C: GIRL
D: No way! Get back on the highway.
E: panicking
C: GUY
D: Relax, I checked it out on the map. It looks interesting.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 20.
C: GIRL
D: I mean it, get back on the highway right now! This is not going to happen!
N: He looks a little pissed she's questioning his judgment.
C: GUY
D: Will you chill. It's a shortcut. We'll be back on the highway before you know it.
N: Hard to argue with a shortcut... Nonetheless, she glances back with a look of trepidation OUT THE BACK WINDOW at the highway receding into the distance.
S: EXT. SCENIC ROUTE 606 - NIGHT
N: The Oldsmobile cruises by, the only car on the two-lane scenic highway. As it leaves FRAME camera PANS to the dead grass on the roadside where it finds a sad little SHRINE half-buried in the snow: two homemade crosses, candle stumps, a rotting stuffed bear, deflated Mylar balloons. Scrawled on the crosses are: Sean Amanda Dec-24-03 Dec-24-03
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: She watches him suspiciously out of the corner of her eye. His face is eerie in the green light of the dashboard. He scans the radio dial for something other than static.
C: GUY
D: Not many radio stations out here.
C: GIRL
D: We're in a valley. FM radio waves travel in a straight line. They can't penetrate big obstacles like hills. Try AM.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 21.
C: GUY
D: Where were you when I was flunking freshman physics?
N: He switches over to AM. Finds a low-wattage mountain station broadcasting Bobby Helms' 1957 "Jingle Bell Rock." Then he drives in silence. Still stewing over her most recent digs.
C: GIRL
D: So... Does your family do the whole traditional Christmas thing?
C: GUY
D: No, my grandparents are Dutch, so I was raised on salted licorice and Sinterklaas...
C: GIRL
D: How's that different from the regular Santa Claus?
C: GUY
D: Instead of the North Pole, he lives in Spain. And instead of elves he's got an enforcer named Black Pete. Basically he's like your Santa, only scarier.
C: GIRL
D: Charming.
C: GUY
D: What's your Christmas like?
C: GIRL
D: My folks split my freshman year, so I spend the holidays racing between them. Two trees... two turkey dinners...two sets of presents to return for store credit. So normally I can deal, but this year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach. Which is like, what? Two hours away.
C: GUY
D: I don't know. The beach can be sort of nice in the winter. Romantic.
N: She gazes out the window at night overtaking the landscape. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 22.
C: GIRL
D: So were you a Rehobeth beach family or Stone Harbor?
C: GUY
D: Stone Harbor.
C: GIRL
D: We always went to Rehobeth. Year in and year out... Jesus, I've never been more bored in my life. I was always so jealous of my friends who spent summers at the Jersey shore.
C: GUY
D: Me too.
N: She turns from the window to look at him, scowling.
C: GIRL
D: Stone Harbor is the Jersey shore.
C: GUY
D: Hm? Oh, yeah, I know. What I meant was-
E: evasive
C: GIRL
D: You aren't from Delaware, are you?
C: GUY
D: Well, see, it's kind of complicated-
C: GIRL
D: Who are you?!
C: GUY
D: I'm exactly who I said I was, am, it's just-
C: GIRL
D: What the hell's going on here?
C: GUY
D: Nothing's going on-
C: GIRL
D: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?
C: GUY
D: Look, just calm down. I can explain-
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 23. HEADLIGHTS suddenly appear up ahead, blindingly bright. GUY (cont'd) What the hell? She turns to look ahead, momentarily forgetting their fight as the oncoming headlights cross the median into their lane.
C: GIRL
D: You think he doesn't see us?
C: GUY
D: How can he not?
S: EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT
N: From a high angle overlooking the road we watch the two cars racing toward one another, headed on a collision course.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
N: For the time being their fight has taken a back seat to the oncoming car playing chicken with them.
C: GIRL
D: Pull over and let this asshole by.
C: GUY
D: Over where? There's no shoulder.
N: He's right. On the passenger side the road abuts a steep wooded hillside. Opposite that it drops off into a ravine. They are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO: Brenda Lee's 1958 hit "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."
C: BRENDA LEE
D: Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, at the Christ-mas par-ty hop...
S: EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT
N: The distance between the SPEEDING CARS is closing rapidly.
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
N: The kids faces go white in the glare of the oncoming lights. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 24.

S: EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT
N: The OTHER CAR continues barrelling toward the OLDSMOBILE. The game of chicken fast approaching the point of no return.
C: BRENDA LEE
D: You will get a sen-ti-men-tal fee- ling when you hear... Voices singing "Let's be jolly, DECK the halls with boughs of holly"...
S: INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
N: Relief turns to dread as they realize the other car isn't slowing.
C: GIRL
D: He's not stopping!
C: GUY
D: Hold on!
N: He jerks the wheel hard, sending the Oldsmobile fishtailing out of control. The OTHER CAR skids over a small bridge and drops out of sight. They spin out in the opposite direction. Skid off the road and SLAM into a snowbank with a bone-shuddering CRASH.
C: BRENDA LEE
D: Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day. Everyone's dancing mer-ri-ly in the New. Old. Fash-ioned. Wa-a-ay!

S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: The Oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing the wrong way, its driver's side jammed into a snowbank. Snow boils in its headlights.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: The interior is dark. The girl has been thrown under the dash. It's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing. Finally she stirs, disoriented. She climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is. It takes her a beat to remember him. She looks over slowly. He's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel. His head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank. A link of blood trickles down the glass. Dead? She's not taking any chances. Without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet. Suddenly he stirs, groaning. She freezes. The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK. When he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell. Finds it. Then eases open the creaky passenger door. And launches herself into the frigid night.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: She hurries down the road away from the car. Breath clouding in the frigid air. Punches in numbers on her cell phone. INSERT CELLPHONE SCREEN -- WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 26. No SIGNAL BARS. She's starting to freak now. She hits the REDIAL button.

N: Suddenly, from behind --
C: GUY
D: What are you doing?
E: O.S.
N: She screams, spins around. He's standing right behind her, his face in silhouette.
C: GIRL
D: C-Calling 9-1-1. Or trying to.
C: GUY
D: Any luck?
C: GIRL
D: Can't... I can't get a signal here.
E: shakes head `no'
N: He receives this news with a strange calm. GIRL (cont'd) What about yours?
C: GUY
D: I don't have a cell.
C: GIRL
D: How can you not have a cell?
C: GUY
D: How're you doing? You all right?
E: ignoring her
C: GIRL
D: I... yeah, I'm okay. Nothing broken... What about you?
C: GUY
D: I don't know. Think I hit my head.
N: He puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on it. Like someone testing a melon for ripeness. Come to think of it, his speech is a little wooden. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 27. She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away. GUY (cont'd) What happened to the, uh, the guy?
C: GIRL
D: Who?
C: GUY
D: Asshole who ran us off the road.
N: She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now. She turns to look, puzzled. There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone.
C: GIRL
D: I don't know. I guess maybe he decided just to hit and run.
C: GUY
D: So where are his tire tracks?
N: She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow.
C: GIRL
D: In case you haven't noticed, it's coming down pretty hard.
C: GUY
D: Yeah, but you can still see our tracks.
E: points
N: The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus. She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be. GUY (cont'd) What the hell?! He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 28. ANGLE ON HER Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it. She looks back down the long dark road. Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile. Too risky. Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself. No tracks. Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints.
C: GIRL
D: This doesn't make any sense...
E: to herself
N: At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings. The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice. He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.
C: GUY
D: HELLO!
E: calling
N: She jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled. GUY (cont'd) (calling) ANYBODY OUT THERE!? ANYONE?! HEY! His voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and a weird otherworldly HUM. He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket.
C: GIRL
D: What now?
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 29.
C: GUY
D: I guess we see how bad we're stuck.
N: They trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow. GUY (cont'd) You steer, I'll push. He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door open so they can communicate. He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile. He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside. Little wooden crosses. Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606. Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him.
C: GIRL
D: Ready?
E: calling
N: He bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against the rear bumper.
C: GUY
D: Ready!
E: calling
N: The tail lights come on as she turns the ignition. He hears her crank the starter motor. Cranking... cranking... cranking... Finally turning over. She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing. The rear tires spin, throwing slush; but car won't budge. GUY (cont'd) (calling) Give it more gas! She floors it; the tires SCREAMING. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 30. He puts everything he's got into pushing, but it's no use. Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side. He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust. A beat later he pulls himself up, pounds on the trunk. GUY (cont'd) Stop! The tires stop spinning.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: She's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch-crunch-crunch of his approaching footsteps. In that moment she makes a decision. Scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard.
S: INT./EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
N: He arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the power locks all go THUNK. He's locked out.
C: GUY
D: Hey, open up.
N: He tugs at the handle a few times. Knocks on the window. GUY (cont'd) You wanna pop the locks? When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window. GUY (cont'd) You gonna unlock the door or what? She sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window. She keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone. No signal. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 31. GUY (cont'd) Hey, c'mon, it's freezing out here!
C: GIRL
D: Better get used to it, asshole.
N: He rattles the door handle, starting to get panicked now.
C: GUY
D: What the hell is wrong with you? What did I do?
N: But she's in full-blown paranoid mode now, near hysterics.
C: GIRL
D: You drove us here, that's what you did!! What the hell did you think you were doing!?
C: GUY
D: I thought I was driving you home.
C: GIRL
D: You're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere. Now what are we doing here? Why did you get off the highway?
C: GUY
D: I told you, this is a shortcut. Anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. This used to be called `Scenic 606' because there's an amazing view of the valley-
C: GIRL
D: One, you've never been anywhere near here before so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut, and two, there's an amazing view of shit BECAUSE IT'S PITCH BLACK OUT!
N: He stands there as she freaks out.
C: GUY
D: Let me get this straight. You think I intentionally arranged for us get stranded out here?! It was an
E: MORE
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 32. GUY (cont'd) accident! You saw the other car. You think he was in on it, too?
C: GIRL
D: Maybe! Maybe he's like your Black Pete or something! Why the hell did you tell me that story anyway?
E: raving
C: GUY
D: You're crazy...
C: GIRL
D: Anyway, I've got news for you... I got through to a friend's voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. I'm sure she's called the cops by now.
E: lying
C: GUY
D: Would you listen to yourself? What kind of psycho do you think I am?
C: GIRL
D: Exactly.
N: He straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head. She looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering. He doesn't look like an ax-murderer. She doesn't know what to do. There's a long beat. Finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to Plan B.
C: GUY
D: I'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. You've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. Though I really think you should consider coming with me.
C: GIRL
D: I bet you do.
C: GUY
D: Fine. Whatever. If you feel a draft and you want to patch this...
E: pissed
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 33. Sticking his fingertips through the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck passenger side window. GUY (cont'd) ... I keep duct tape in the back.
C: GIRL
D: I bet you do.
E: sarcastic
N: He looks in at her one last time, exits. She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore. Suddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side window. She jumps.
C: GUY
D: BUT IT'S MY CAR!!
N: He goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time. She cowers inside, scared to death. Finally he gives up, and with a final BANG to the roof, exits. He turns and heads back down the road. We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow. He stops. Leans his weight against a tree. Looks back at the car. Whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station. He straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: The stranded Oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white. The interior lights are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a Grimm's fairytale. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 34.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: She's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions, looking for the duct tape. Despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath. A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT plays on the car's radio.
C: RADIO PSA
D: ... The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard... Boxer shorts. Socks. Box of condoms. A copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. A cheap Radio Shack TELEPHONE wrapped in its cord. A CROW BAR, which she tosses up to the front seat.
N: RADIO PSA (cont'd) ... Carbon County residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches... Suddenly we see - A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW... But she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice. Finally she finds what she's looking for: silver DUCT TAPE. Also a PAIR OF SCISSORS. She holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself. She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape. Again, in the b.g. - MORE MOVEMENT outside the car... But she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside. RADIO PSA (cont'd) ... State and local officials are urging residents to remain indoors, (MORE) WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 35. RADIO PSA (cont'd) as wind chills plunge to fifteen below overnight... Finally - She glimpses MOVEMENT outside the passenger window. She gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard. She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear. After a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel. The windshield is fogged, so she wipes a peephole in the condensate. It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood. She reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column. Flicks on the headlights. A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road. She screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks. The stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with hunched shoulders. Snow swirling around him in the darkness. Who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm? Over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.
S: EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: She gets out of the car, clutching the SCISSORS in both hands like a dagger. She stands behind the protection of the open car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead. There's a weird HUMMING noise in the air she can't place.
C: GIRL
D: Hey!
N: No reaction from the stranger. GIRL (cont'd) Hello? Do you live around here? Again, nothing. Maybe he's deaf? She moves out from behind the safety of the car door and starts after the stranger, keeping her distance as she calls: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 36. GIRL (cont'd) We had an accident. My friend went for help. He'll be back any second. The stranger's dapper suit is more than dishevelled. It's soaking wet, caked in motor oil or some other dark slime. GIRL (cont'd) Kinda crappy night for a walk, don't you think? And there's something definitely "off about his shuffling. It's like he's crippled, or injured. In fact he seems to be CRYING. (Or is it moaning?) GIRL (cont'd) Hey, wait! But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES beyond. Soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and disappears into the gloom. GIRL (cont'd) What the hell - !? Spooked, she begins to back toward the stranded Oldsmobile. Backs into -
C: GUY
D: Hey.
N: She SCREAMS. GUY (cont'd) Jesus! Calm down. It's just me.
C: GIRL
D: Stay away from me!
N: She brandishes the SCISSORS. He puts up two hands defensively.
C: GUY
D: Whoa! Take it easy. What's wrong?
C: GIRL
D: You! Everything! The guy-
C: GUY
D: What guy?
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 37.
C: GIRL
D: I don't know, it was weird. I saw some guy walking down the road.
C: GUY
D: Where did he go?
C: GIRL
D: I don't know. Into the woods.
N: Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat.
C: GUY
D: Look. It's freezing out here. Let's just get in the car and you can tell me what happened...
C: GIRL
D: What are you doing back so soon? What about hiking to the gas station?
E: paranoid
C: GUY
D: It was closed. I was going to leave a note, but I didn't... You know. Have anything to write with.
N: She clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word.
C: GIRL
D: But those places are supposed to stay open 24/7! Why wasn't it open?
C: GUY
D: How the hell should I know?! Independent operator. Look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause I'm freezing my balls off standing out here.
C: GIRL
D: I'm not getting into the car with you, you psycho!!!
E: shrieks
N: He closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 38.
C: GUY
D: Fine. Whatever. I'm getting in. You're welcome to join me.
N: He turns and trudges back to the Oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. Leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering. She stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone. HOLD on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker. Not much of a choice.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER
N: He looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in. She pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it. Eyeing him warily. He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors-
C: GUY
D: Relax.
N: - and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining: GUY (cont'd) We need to conserve the battery. With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a bench seat. Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK. She frowns.
C: GIRL
D: That's not right. The clock...
C: GUY
D: Huh? No, it's not. It should read...
E: checks watch
N: He frowns, looking down at his watch. He holds it to his ear. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 39. GUY (cont'd) My watch stopped. Oh well... Guess we'll just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock. He tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat. Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.
C: GIRL
D: Hey.
C: GUY
D: What?
C: GIRL
D: You're bleeding.
N: He touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it.
C: GUY
D: It's nothing...
C: GIRL
D: It doesn't look like nothing.
C: GUY
D: Scalp wounds bleed a lot. Head wounds in general. That's why, if you're ever in a bar fight, the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose. It'll make his eyes fill with blood and snot, and buy you enough time to run away.
C: GIRL
D: That's really useful, thanks.
E: softening, amused
N: A tense silence fills the car. He closes his eyes and leans his head back, as if trying to catch a few Z's. GIRL (cont'd) So where are you from, really? WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 40.
C: GUY
D: Place called Glens Falls...
E: eyes closed
C: GIRL
D: That's not in Delaware.
C: GUY
D: No...
C: GIRL
D: That's, like, in the complete opposite direction!
C: GUY
D: Yes...
C: GIRL
D: That's like twenty minutes from school!
C: GUY
D: All right, all right, so I lied... Obviously.
C: GIRL
D: Why?
N: Eyes still closed, he answers in a flat uninflected voice.
C: GUY
D: I just thought you seemed cool. I don't have a line or a `game' or whatever the hell it's called. So when I saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours, I took it.
N: She ponders this for a beat, one piece still not clicking.
C: GIRL
D: But how did you know where I lived?
C: GUY
D: Asked around.

FLASHBACK ENDS:

N: She looks at him, the pieces all finally falling into place. He makes no effort to explain. Doesn't even open his eyes.
C: GUY
D: Forgive me for attempting a romantic gesture.
E: bitter
C: GIRL
D: Romantic? Try stalkerish.
C: GUY
D: Not if things worked out between us...I would've told you everything eventually, and then it wouldn't be stalkerish. It would just be this sweet funny story we'd have.
C: GIRL
D: We?!
N: He sits up sharply, temper boiling over, glaring at her. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 42.
C: GUY
D: Okay, you've made your point! I'm a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses. Can we drop this already? Christ. I'm starving. You hungry?
E: changing subject
N: He leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back. GUY (cont'd) Did you see a bag of groceries in the trunk? At mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of the gas station. Remembers:
C: GIRL
D: No. Oh, shit. I think I might've left it in the parking lot.
C: GUY
D: What?!

C: GUY
D: I think I remember losing pack of Big Red down the back seat cushions last week...
N: He thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef. DOWN THE BACK SEAT: His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions, among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint. BACK TO SCENE Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard. She GASPS. His face contorts in agony. Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt, holding a stick of gum. GUY (cont'd) Kidding. She looks at him in mute fury and disbelief. He shrugs, unwraps a stick of Big Red and pops it into his mouth.
C: GIRL
D: Asshole.
N: Suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the scissors. Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist, but his grip is too strong.

C: GUY
D: I need these.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - LATER
N: With the blade of the open scissors he divides a stale candy bar, divvying it up. He closes the scissors. Serves up the two halves of candy bar on napkins with a side of stale pretzel nibs.
C: GUY
D: I still can't believe you left all our food in a stupid parking lot.
C: GIRL
D: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'll write you a check for sixty bucks if it will make you get off my case. I don't know what else I can say.

N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 45.

D: What the hell are you talking about?
C: GUY
D: You should all come with a warning, like car mirrors: "Objects in belly shirts are flakier than they appear."
C: GIRL
D: You want to talk about fake? How about guys who pretend to be from Delaware to meet girls?
C: GUY
D: How about we just stop talking altogether.
C: GIRL
D: That's perfect. Because now that I'm not some Nietzche-spouting sexbot, suddenly I'm not worth knowing. And who's fault is that?
N: He doesn't answer, only withdraws into himself, sulking. All of a sudden the Oldsmobile gives a SHUDDER. And then the engine DIES.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: They leap out to investigate, dropping down on all fours to shine the flashlight under the chassis. HER POV: Under the car. The beam illuminates a yellow crater of melted snow beneath the car's undercarriage. BACK TO SCENE She reaches under to scoop up some of the yellow snow. Retrieves it so she can hold it under her nose and sniff.

D: Oh shit.

D: Fuel tank must've been ruptured in the accident.
C: GUY
D: Can you fix it?
C: GIRL
D: Not unless you have a welding rig in all that shit of yours. And even if you did, it wouldn't matter. We're out of gas.
C: GUY
D: But we still have the battery, right?
C: GIRL
D: As long as we use it sparingly, it should last the night. Question is, will we?
C: GUY
D: What do you mean?
N: She gives him a sober look, as the storm rages around them.
C: GIRL
D: No engine... no heat.
N: He looks at her, a look of grim determination on his face. He marches to the car, pops the trunk. Retrieves her suitcase.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: He dumps her suitcase in front. She climbs in after it. Slams the door.
C: GUY
D: Layers...
N: He rolls into the back, fishes his suitcase out of the mess. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 47. GUY (cont'd) Only thing that's gonna get us to sun-up. So put aside fashion sense and start layering everything you brought.
C: GIRL
D: But I didn't bring anything.
N: He raises an eyebrow, leans over the front seat to unzip her suitcase and see for himself. Christmas gifts, skimpy tees, panties and bras, a bikini.
C: GUY
D: Ah, Jesus.
C: GIRL
D: I'm sorry, but who could prepare for something like this?! I've got a complete winter wardrobe, it's just in Delaware... And no, that doesn't make me a flake!
E: defensive
N: He unzips his suitcase. Starts pulling out Ragg socks, long- sleeve pullovers, etc. He shoves a ball of clothes into her hands without a word.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: The kids have retreated to the front- and back seats for privacy while they change. Not an easy proposition in the cramped quarters. She strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible. Puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things. He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. It's obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her. Also that he took the backseat because it's more cramped than the front. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 48. Once they're finished dressing he reaches up, switches off the interior light. They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air. [Note: from this point on, their breath will always be visible in the car.] He hears her sigh, restless.
C: GUY
D: What's the matter?
C: GIRL
D: I'm freezing. I can't feel my toes.
C: GUY
D: Me neither.
N: Nothing much they can do about it. They fall silent again. GUY (cont'd) You know, there is a better way for two people to conserve body heat-
C: GIRL
D: Dream on.
N: But we see her smiling a little in the dark front seat. They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable. Finally she sits up.
C: GUY
D: What?
C: GIRL
D: Gotta pee.
N: She starts to climb over into the cramped front seat, intending to go outside. He winces when she puts a hand on his chest to steady herself as she climbs over him.
C: GUY
D: Why didn't you go before, when we were outside?
E: testy
C: GIRL
D: Because it's freezing out. We're talking about an arctic air mass out of Canada.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 49.
C: GUY
D: It's still freezing out-
C: GIRL
D: Yeah, but now I've got to go. Promise not to look.
N: She pops the door and exits.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: She climbs out into the bitter cold, hunched against the howling wind, and moves off as far as she dares from the car. She fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple layers, turns her back to the car, squats to pee. Her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye peeled to catch the guy peeking. Suddenly, out of the gloom appears - A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her. She GASPS. Tumbles back onto her ass. As she's struggling to pull up her pants - MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction. As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance, then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask. Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car.
C: GUY
D: What?! What happened?!
N: But it all happened so fast she doesn't believe her eyes. She gestures at the procession of DARK FIGURES disappearing ahead.
C: GIRL
D: - Did you see? - They were right here! -
E: still in shock
C: GUY
D: Why didn't you stop them?! Maybe they have a phone!
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 50. Our guy ducks back into the car, retrieves a flashlight from the glove compartment. He eases the door shut, carefully so it doesn't latch and accidentally lock them out. The he starts off running after the figures. Scared as she is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by herself.
S: EXT. ROUTE 606 - FURTHER DOWN ROAD / TOP OF A RAVINE - NIGHT
N: The two kids arrive at the place on the road -- top of a ravine disappearing thirty feet below -- where the dark figures seemed to be headed. Only to find NO ONE THERE.
C: GIRL
D: Where'd they go?!
C: GUY
D: There!
N: She looks where he's pointing with the flashlight- HER POV: On the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are SEVERAL TALL OLD MEN IN DARK COATS, dispersing through the woods. As if whatever somber occasion that brought them to the ravine has ended. GUY (cont'd) (calling) Hey! Wait! We need help here! Climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous, so the kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away where they can follow the DARK FIGURES into the:
S: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
N: They follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight through the trees, in pursuit of the OLD MAN in black coat and fedora. Our guy falls behind, winded. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 51.
C: GUY
D: Gotta - just a sec - catch my -
C: GIRL
D: Maybe we should go back to the car.
E: still unnerved
C: GUY
D: No! There must be a house or something. Keep going. I'll catch up.
C: GIRL
D: Okay.
E: reluctantly
N: She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing FAINTER, finally fading entirely. He's alone now. He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain. For an instant it seems like he's going to be sick. But then he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow. Blood. Though still winded, he pushes on.
S: EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT
N: A few minutes later he trudges into view. Looks around. No sign of our girl.
C: GUY
D: Hello? Hello?
N: He arrives at the top of the hill. Silhouetted against the night sky. Treeless. His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing. A RUINED BUILDING Windowless and long-abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in around a large stone chimney. He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves. His flashlight beam finds a SMALL IRON DOOR built into the side of the chimney. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 52. A FIREBOX. He kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open. Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox. Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS. He stuffs them inside the front of his jacket. Continues rummaging around in the firebox. As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side. He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides. He turns in a slow circle. His flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what look like branches - HUMAN HANDS frozen into claws, reaching from... A FROZEN BODY. It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose, clawlike fingers, eyes. He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight. The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him. And then another. And another... All OLD MEN. Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii. ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY. Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair. Eye to eye with him. He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes sprawling. Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies - And sees NOTHING: No beds. No old men... WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 52A. Just his footprints in the snow.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - THAT MOMENT
N: Our girl emerges from the trees, having decided to give up the chase and return to the safety of the car. Just as she's reaching for the door handle she GASPS - As a FIGURE suddenly appears out of the darkness. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 53. It's the black STRANGER from earlier, shuffling and mumbling. This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the words he's muttering:
C: STRANGER
D: ...please, officer, please don't...
C: GIRL
D: Wait!
N: Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road.
C: STRANGER
D: ...don't put me in the river...
N: Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly. His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING WIRE, as are his wrists.
C: GIRL
D: Oh my god! Who did this to you?!
E: shocked
C: STRANGER
D: ...please, officer, just take the booze and let me go...
N: She reaches toward him. The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY. She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT, almost as if she's grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she feels a terrible otherwordly cold... Frostbite. The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the first time he becomes aware of her. He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face. A scream builds in her throat at sight of him. The stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot. A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak. But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges. Something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 54. She watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like a blood-fattened leech. Forcing its way out through his lips to land at his feet with a wet PLOP. It lies there writhing in the fresh snow. A river eel. She SCREAMS.
S: EXT. WOODS - THAT MOMENT
N: POV of our guy running blindly through the woods, FLASHLIGHT BEAM throwing weird bouncing shadows across the trees, boots CRUNCHING in the snow, sound of his GASPING BREATHS... He stops, wracked with pain, and doubles over with hands on knees to catch his breath. In the silence he hears her SCREAM coming from ahead. He stands, and though still winded, starts running again.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: Our guy emerges from the woods still carrying the newspapers he found in time to find our girl white with shock and SCREAMING. He grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her.
C: GUY
D: It's okay! You're okay! It's okay!
N: Her screams give way to hyperventilating sobs.
C: GIRL
D: Where were you?
C: GUY
D: I was looking for those guys. I didn't see anyone-- --there's nobody up there. What's wrong, what's wrong? Did you see someone?
E: hesitating at the memory
C: GIRL
D: I...there was another guy...
N: She starts to tell him, then stops, not sure if she believes it herself. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 55. Suddenly he looks down, notices her blackened mitten on her right hand. The palm is blistered and raw. He takes her hand gingerly, examines it. She winces in pain.
C: GUY
D: What happened to you!? This looks like... oh jesus... like frostbite!
C: GIRL
D: I tried to... touch him...it burns.
N: He raises his eyes from her frostbite, looks at the dark silent stand of dense woods surrounding them. They exchange a look of knowing concern.
C: GUY
D: Let's get back in the car...
N: They start back in the direction of the stranded Oldsmobile. Pan down to the road, where something moves weakly under the fresh powdering of snow. The RIVER EEL, in its death throes.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - LATER
N: They climb back inside. He pulls the old newspapers out from inside his jacket, tosses them on the dashboard. She pulls the passenger door shut. The duct tape has come loose, allowing a cold draft in through the cracked window. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 56. She notices the NEWSPAPERS on the dash, grabs them.
C: GIRL
D: Where'd these come from?
C: GUY
D: There's the ruins of an old house or something back in the woods.
C: GIRL
D: Oh... Give me the duct tape...
N: He hands it to her, and she starts using the tape and old newspapers to seal out the draft. When she's finished, he starts to climb over into the back. GIRL (cont'd) (softly) Wait. She looks at him, too embarrassed to ask him to hold her. It takes him a beat to understand. Then he crawls over to her, and they spoon together in the front seat, finding their best fit. Any awkwardness quickly passes. They lie there, too frightened to sleep. TITLE CARD ON BLACK: 11:17 P.M.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: Our kids lie awake, him spooning her, listening to the RADIO quietly playing Christmas music: (segué into Brenda Lee's "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.")
C: GUY
D: Are you awake?
C: GIRL
D: Uh-huh. D-Don't want to sleep.
E: teeth chattering
C: GUY
D: Why?
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 56A.

D: Because I'm afraid I won't wake up. That's what they say happens. When
E: MORE
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 57. GIRL (cont'd) you freeze to death. It's like going to sleep...
C: GUY
D: There are worse ways to go.
N: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK -- Someone is outside, knocking on the Oldsmobile's window. They both jump, startled. He glances up into the rearview mirror, sees HEADLIGHTS behind them and a RED FLASHING LIGHT. GUY (cont'd) A cop! She cranks down the icy passenger side window, revealing the silhouette of a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN standing just outside: 40s, wearing a trim-fitting uniform and a stiff-brimmed trooper's hat.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Everything all right in there?
N: The kids speak over one another in their relief to see him.
C: GIRL
D: Thank God! You don't know how glad we are to see you...
C: GUY
D: ...you won't believe what's been happening...
N: The cop listens without comment, shining his flashlight over the car's interior.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Having car trouble, huh?
C: GIRL
D: Someone ran us off the road.
N: He shines the flashlight directly in our girl's eyes.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: There's no parking here.
C: GUY
D: What are you talking about? We're not parking here. Didn't you hear what she said? Someone ran us off-
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 58.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: ...Of course I might be willing to let you off with a warning this time... if we can come to some sort of arrangement...
C: GUY
D: What are you talking ab-
N: The girl, quicker to catch on than the guy, puts a hand on his arm.
C: GIRL
D: It's a shake-down. He's probably partners with the guy who ran us off the road. Wouldn't be surprised if he has a deal with the tow guy, too.
E: whispers
N: He turns to her, says in an angry whisper -
C: GUY
D: You think this whole thing was a scam? Jesus, he could've killed us!
N: But she's already digging cash out of her purse.
C: GIRL
D: How much cash do you have on you?
E: fierce whisper
N: He looks at her in disbelief. Sees that she's serious. He digs out his wallet, starts to climb over her to exit. She stops him. GIRL (cont'd) How many speeding tickets have you sweet-talked your way out of? He concedes her point silently. She plucks the money from his hand. Opens the door.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: She exits the stranded car into the frigid cold. The cop waits, facing away, in the spotlight-like glare of his IDLING PATROL CAR's headlights. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 59. She walks back toward him, finds him mopping the back of his neck with a handkerchief.
C: GIRL
D: This is all we have.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Some weather we're having...
C: GIRL
D: Yeah, it's really coming down. So what do you say? How `bout a little Christmas spirit here?
E: indicating the money
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: You know, this is one bad stretch of road. All kinds of trouble going on up here: Kids drag racing. Niggers hauling booze across the state lines. Lady drivers breaking down, no-one ever hears from them again...
E: still facing away
N: Her bravado begins to flag. This isn't the kind of police officer she's used to dealing with. She glances worriedly back in the direction of the Olds.
C: GIRL
D: We just want to get out of here, so if you could just-
N: She holds out the money, but he ignores it.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Let me tell you, I've seen a lot of fatalities on this road...
N: He takes off his hat so he can mop his brow. As he turns, she gets a first good look at his face: handsome but hard, with cruel snake charmer's eyes looking back at her... HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd) You're lucky I came along when I did. So why don't we get in my car... She's scared now. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 60. She looks past him to where the HIGHWAY PATROL car sits idling in a red plume of exhaust fumes.
C: GIRL
D: I think maybe I just want to go back-
E: backing away
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!
N: She startles as if slapped, too horrified to parse his meaning. She continues backing away until she's backed up against the trunk of the Olds.
C: GIRL
D: No...
N: The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop. She glances over her shoulder to see what he's looking at: A LIGHT on the hilltop, where the burned-out ruins stand. And weirder still, there's a FIGURE in silhouette standing nearby. Someone watching. The cop darkens, enraged by this unwanted audience. His face contorts, fury building in him until he trembles with it. He rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver, says to her in a low urgent voice:
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Get in the damn patrol car...
N: She starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him. The highway patrolman's boots CRUNCHING behind her. The patrol car's HEADLIGHTS are blinding. She moves towards them, squinting, as if moving down a tunnel of light.
C: GIRL
D: Please... just let us go...
E: terrified; beginning to cry
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 61.
C: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
D: Hurry up...we've got an audience...
C: GIRL
D: But we didn't do anything! Please! We won't tell anybody if you let us-
E: begging
C: GUY
D: Get away from her you bastard!
E: O.S.
N: Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR. He swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolman's head. The cop's head crumples inward. The cop's expression of FURY suddenly STUTTERS, like film slipping in the projector - As two worlds that should never intersect, do, violently - For an instant, the cop's face appears...charred. Like a human face projected onto a scorched and melting balloon. The image flickers - And on an ear-splitting HOWL we -

D: I don't know.
C: GIRL
D: But it did happen, right? Or not...
E: unsure
N: Our guy winces in pain. TILT DOWN to reveal: HIS HANDS Frostbitten, still clutching the crowbar. She tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 62. GIRL (cont'd) Oh Jesus. OK. Hold on. She pours water from a plastic bottle over his palms to try and break the seal between the fused skin and metal. GIRL (cont'd) OK, hold on, this is going to hurt.
C: GUY
D: Do it.
N: She fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free. It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached. His palms are bloody pulps. He fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him. The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes. His teeth chatter; he's teetering on the edge of shock. GUY (cont'd) How bad?
C: GIRL
D: Frostbite, second and third-degree.
C: GUY
D: How do you know? You take a first aid course or something?
C: GIRL
D: Ski camp, seventh grade... Don't make fun. What else do you have going on when you're thirteen?

C: GUY
D: I'm kinda not in the mood anymore.
E: weak
C: GIRL
D: We have to rewarm your hands. You have ice crystals in your blood. If we don't get circulation restored you could lose your fingers.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 63. She takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible presses them against the warm skin of her belly, rewarming them. They lie there in silence for a beat, faces inches apart. GIRL (cont'd) What just happened to us out there?
C: GUY
D: What do you mean? You were there.

E: casting for ideas
C: GUY
D: What book?

D: Something Book of the Dead.

E: hands on her belly
C: GIRL
D: I know. God, I'd give anything for some of those Carr's crackers right now...
N: Trying to take their minds off the grim situation. GIRL (cont'd) So what else was in the grocery bag I forgot?

D: And for dessert, anisette biscotti and a thermos of espresso.
C: GIRL
D: Ohhhh...
E: ecstacy
N: She closes her eyes, imagining the meal that might've been. GIRL (cont'd) That's pretty much the exact meal I'd order for my last day on earth. I swear to god, if we ever get out of here I'm going to have to get a restraining order against- If they ever get out of here. Her eyes brim, tears spilling down her cheeks. He tries to sound optimistic.

N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 66. She climbs into the front seat and searches through her purse for the prescription bottle. With the poor light and without her contacts she has trouble finding it. She takes out her glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.

D: I just-
N: She's about to climb back when something catches her eye. INSERT OLD NEWSPAPER -- The one used to patch the small gap in the passenger window. There's a faded PHOTOGRAPH of a group of ELDERLY PRIESTS gathered around a MANGLED `55 FORD CROWN VIC. We recognize one of them, glancing back over his shoulder at the camera, as the LEADER of the mysterious procession of DARK FIGURES from earlier.

Below the accident scene photo are HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK PORTRAITS of TWO TEENAGE BOYS with crewcuts and letter jackets bearing a distinctive team insignia "The Cougars." Across the top of the paper is a torn headline: "North Granville Youths Killed In Joy Riding Accident" and below it "Cougars Coach Mourns Loss."

N: Both kids are asleep in the back seat. She's dreaming, her eyes roving behind closed lids. All of a sudden she stirs, eyes fluttering open in the dark. Shivers. Woken by a cold draft. She shivers, sits up, disentangling herself from the guy snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat. She locates the source of the draft. The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape- newspaper patch has come loose. She shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in. She grabs the roll of duct tape, climbs up into the front. Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one. She smooths it in place, her teeth chattering between yawns. Just then the radio SNAPS on by itself.

D: Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, at the Christ-mas par-ty hop. She freezes.
N: Her eyes cut to the backlit radio dial as the song continues. BRENDA LEE (cont'd) Mistletoe hung where you can see, ev'ry couple tries to STOP - The radio SHUTS OFF mid-song. She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe. Her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in a weird staccato way that's more Morse Code than loose wire. After a few seconds it stops. The seconds creep by on the dashboard clock. She peeks over the front seat looking out the back window, wondering where his highway patrol car is.

A gust of supernaturally frigid cold blows in, like the icy breath of Old Man Winter himself. White frost spreads with time-lapse velocity from the air vents across the dashboard.

A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps- As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and he gasps- The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next. Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window. All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc. Then stop all at once. Even the radio SNAPS OFF. Dead silence for a beat. Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car. Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe. Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror- A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear window ledge. She SWINGS around, looks back at the window. But nothing's there. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 73. She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly. Beat. Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault. There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc. The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe. The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.
C: BRENDA LEE
D: Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day... Our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and growing until it's indistinguishable from the HOWLING wind outside.
N: The attack ends. The red police light in the rear window FADES. Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.
C: GIRL
D: What happened?
C: GUY
D: I think... he's gone. I guess when he couldn't get in he gave up. I told you these `88 Olds were built like tanks!
E: suddenly grinning
N: He turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at the rear window. GUY (cont'd) (nervous relief) HAH! Next time pick on someone driving a Hyundai- WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 74. She claps a hand over his mouth.
C: GIRL
D: Shhh! How do you know it's not a trick! He could still be out there waiting-
C: GUY
D: He's not! Listen!
N: They sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind.
C: GIRL
D: But what if he comes back..?
C: GUY
D: We just have to stay in the car until morning. Then we'll be safe. That can't be more than, like, a few more hours... Someone's bound to come along once the sun comes up... Someone human I mean. Think you can hold on until then?
C: GIRL
D: What if, you know. We have to pee?
E: shy
C: GUY
D: We can use the empty water bottles. From this point on, the back seat is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a plan?
N: Sounds like a plan. GUY (cont'd) Why don't you try to get some sleep? I'll take the next watch. She shakes her head, eyes full of fear. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 75.
C: GIRL
D: I don't want to sleep.
N: He nods, understanding. So they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning. TITLE CARD ON BLACK: 4:58 A.M.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: The snow is slacking off. The stranded Oldsmobile is now completely snowbound, a car-shaped hillock of white on the roadside.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: The interior of the car is eerily QUIET, cocooned in snow. The kids sit in silence in the front seat, fighting to stay awake. His face is pale, skull visible beneath the skin. She stares at the black, snow-covered windshield.
C: GIRL
D: I gotta pee...
C: GUY
D: Again?!
N: She climbs over into the back seat and crouches down, urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle. GUY (cont'd) (teasing) I swear, I never met anyone who had to go so much.
C: GIRL
D: Stop talking.
C: GUY
D: You should ask Santa to bring you a bigger bladder.
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 76.
C: GIRL
D: I'm serious! It's hard enough doing this in front of you.
C: GUY
D: What, are you one of those people who can't pee with the bathroom door open?
C: GIRL
D: No. But it's not something I usually do until much later in a relationship...
N: She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word "relationship" hangs in the air. Beat. Finished peeing, she twists the cap on the water bottle. Sets it on the floor with the other URINE-FILLED BOTTLES. Noticing ONE BOTTLE that doesn't look like the others. She climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine bottle, which is tinged with PINK. Blood. GIRL (cont'd) What the hell is this? Is this blood? No answer. GIRL (cont'd) How badly were you hurt in the crash?
C: GUY
D: No big deal. Just your average day in the NHL...
E: shrugs
N: But she sees through his tough-guy facade. He's frightened.

C: GIRL
D: Why didn't you tell me?
C: GUY
D: I didn't want to scare you-
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 77. Suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched. She looks on helplessly.
C: GIRL
D: We've got to get you some help now. You won't make it to morning. I'm going to try and hike back to the gas station-
C: GUY
D: How far do you think you'd get out there before running into Mr. Freeze?
C: GIRL
D: I'm not going to just sit here and watch you die!
N: They sit there a moment in silence. She digs out her cellphone and checks for a signal: NO SIGNAL BARS. GIRL (cont'd) (to herself) Damn it! We need a land line ... A long beat. Then she's struck by an idea. She switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield. Wipes at the foggy glass until she's got enough of a peephole to peek out.
C: GUY
D: What are you looking at?
C: GIRL
D: Telephone poles. They must have a junction box or something to test the lines ... There! See that one?
N: She indicates a TELEPHONE POLE twenty yards up from them. There's a SMALL GREY STEEL JUNCTION BOX near the top.
C: GUY
D: So?
N: She turns, leaning over the seatback to rummage among his junk in the back. She retrieves his old wall TELEPHONE, examines the jack at end of its cord. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 78.
C: GIRL
D: So maybe there's some way I can... I don't know... jack into it or something. Try and call for help.
C: GUY
D: You want to climb a telephone pole?
C: GIRL
D: Of course I don't want to! But it's got rungs. Can't be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym. Big fat repair guys do it all the time, right? Right?
N: Trying to convince herself.
C: GUY
D: But you're forgetting one thing...
C: GIRL
D: What?
C: GUY
D: He's out there.
N: They both go quiet. She sits there with the phone in her lap, brooding on this. Until something clicks.
C: GIRL
D: The song! That old Christmas song on the radio. It always comes on just before he shows up...
N: She switches on the RADIO. They hear Elvis Presley's 1957 "Blue Christmas" playing. GIRL (cont'd) Keep listening. If `Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' comes on, yell like hell. (trying to convince herself) Hopefully I'll have enough time to get back. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 79.

N: Looking down at the stranded Oldsmobile from the top of the telephone pole. The grey JUNCTION BOX in the foreground. The weird HUMMING is louder here.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: He watches her prep for her mission out into the bitter cold. She disconnects the TELEPHONE RECEIVER from it's base, wraps it in its chord, stows it for safekeeping under her sweater. She's ready.

D: I've been thinking...
E: weak
C: GIRL
D: What about?

D: Eternal recurrence. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

D: Repeating this life. Over and over. Exactly the same each time.
C: GIRL
D: Even the last twenty-four hours?
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 80. He shows a weak smile. Even the last twenty four hours. GIRL (cont'd) Yeah, but it's even nicer to think maybe we get a chance to fix all the things we screwed up the first time around, don't you think? They fall silent, both thinking about this.
C: GUY
D: Know what I'd do different? Next time I'd just to walk up to you after class... and say "Hey."
C: GIRL
D: You should. Definitely. Do that.
E: smiles
N: She uses her sweater cuff to make clean spot on his cheek. Kisses him tenderly. The kiss working it's way to his mouth, lingering a beat. Their lips part. He catches her arm as she reaches for the power window switch, holds tight.
C: GUY
D: Don't let me die out here-
E: urgently
N: She looks at him with fierce eyes full of determination. The look calms him, at least a little. She keys the ignition, lowers the passenger side window. The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold. She climbs out.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
N: Viewed from high atop the telephone pole she looks small and vulnerable as she climbs out of the Oldsmobile-shaped igloo. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 81.

N: An eerie HUSH has fallen, snow muffling sound except for the occasional forlorn wailing of the WIND through the trees. She sets out through deep powder toward the TELEPHONE POLE.

S: EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
N: The deep powder makes her trek difficult, and she's soon winded. Her breath plumes in the frigid arctic cold.

N: CLOSE ON THE BACKLIT RADIO DIAL as "Silent Night" concludes. In between STATIC we hear a pre-recorded PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.

E: O.S.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
N: Arriving at the base of the telephone pole, she peers up at the grey JUNCTION BOX high above. From here the top of the WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 82. telephone pole looks much higher than it did from the car. And the iron rungs look a lot narrower, too. She's losing her nerve. She glances back to check no police lights are coming. Steels herself. Then puts her foot on the first rung and hauls herself up.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
N: CLOSE ON THE RADIO, where, between increasingly long snatches of STATIC we can just discern Gene Autry's version of "Here Comes Santa Claus."
S: EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE
N: The rungs are icy, forcing her to climb slower than she would like. She keeps her eyes forward, never once looking down. When the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside. She's midway to the top when her foot SLIPS on an icy rung. She clutches the pole tightly, wind whistling in her ears. She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her near fall. Then looks up to gauge the distance left to the JUNCTION BOX. Keeps climbing. She reaches the last rung at the TOP OF THE TELEPHONE POLE. It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing. She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX. Locked.
C: GIRL
D: No!!!
N: She fumbles in her coat, takes out the SCISSORS, uses them to try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be frozen shut, not locked after all.) It finally yields, opening. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 83. Revealing a rat's nest of multicolored WIRES and PHONE JACKS. Hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with her bare hand retrieves the cord-wrapped RECEIVER from inside her sweater. In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS... Which drop all the way down to disappear in the snow below. She concentrates now on the receiver. But her fingers are so clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it. And the receiver FALLS too. Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord. Which she's managed to catch. She winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box. Hears a DIAL TONE. GIRL (cont'd) (stunned she did it) Oh my god! Teeth chattering she thumbs "0" for the operator. GIRL (cont'd) (as it rings) Please please please please please- On the third ring an OPERATOR answers.

C: GIRL
D: Hello? Hello?
N: The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone. When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD. No way of knowing if her message got through. It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
N: CLOSE ON THE RADIO playing nothing but STATIC now.
S: EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE
N: Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth. She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet. The snow does little to cushion her fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment. She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon- A WOMAN'S BARE FEET standing in the snow, veins visible through gravid skin. A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot. Our girl raises her eyes to see - A DEAD WOMAN It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of 1958. Her dress is in tattered ruins, coated in leaves and dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave. Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck. Our girl GASPS and scrambles to her feet, fleeing. Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with- TWO DEAD TEENAGE BOYS WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 85. The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958. Both wear blood-soaked letterman jackets bearing the DISTINCTIVE COUGAR INSIGNIA and stand in a post-accident haze. One's chest is concave, stove-in by the impact with the steering wheel. The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away. She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to the Oldsmobile. She runs the last few yards to the car where we can hear the eerie sound of STATIC emanating from the radio as she hurls herself -
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: Inside. Safe! She sits there, out of breath. She glances over quickly at our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel. She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again. She turns down the volume on the radio.
C: GIRL
D: - I did it - got through - but I don't know how much she understood - the operator I mean -
E: chattering teeth
N: He doesn't respond. GIRL (cont'd) - Just have to hope - maybe - they can trace the line - When this too gets no response from him she looks over, frowning. She scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him. Which is when WE SEE - HIS GHOST standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring. He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 86. GIRL (cont'd) Hang in there, can't be much longer... She reaches to jostle him awake. One touch confirms her worst fears. She reaches up to switch on the INTERIOR LIGHT, to get a better look at him. GIRL (cont'd) Oh god! Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it seems for a moment she's going to be sick. She covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror. Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him. GIRL (cont'd) No! Please! Don't leave me alone! Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. She shakes him harder. His inert body spills to one side, slumping against her. Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her. She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse. Cowers against the passenger door. The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
N: The door opens and she backs out, hauling the dead body after her. Her face is red, tear-streaked.
C: GIRL
D: Sorry... sorry... I'm sorry...
E: crying
N: She strains to move his dead weight. Her feet slip on the ice and she lets go of him, catching herself on the open door. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 87. She grabs the body under the armpits, hauls with all her strength. Drags him a few yards away from the Oldsmobile. His boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow. Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft THUNK. Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice. She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling. Sits there a beat, as- HEADLIGHTS appear on the dark horizon. We see them a split- second before she does... He's coming. When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register. Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action. She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the Oldsmobile - Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's STUCK. She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as - The HEADLIGHTS get brighter, bearing down, close enough now that we can hear the ROAR of the oncoming engine. She kicks the handle, tugs with all her might, rocking the car but not succeeding in getting the door open. As the headlights become BLINDING... Suddenly there's the sound of BRAKES being engaged, and the headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where she's standing in the middle of the road. She shields her eyes with an upraised hand. It's a SNOWPLOW. The SNOWPLOW DRIVER, 50s, sticks his head out the window.

N: Inside the overturned car the trapped HIGHWAY PATROLMAN struggles. His hat has fallen off and floats in the icy water flooding the car, threatening to short the radio. Which is playing the same song as Christmas Eve fifty-seven years earlier. "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree." Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament. We realize he's been drinking. As he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the direction of the snowplow driver and our girl.

Widen to reveal - A DOZEN ELDERLY PRIESTS in black winter coats and fedoras are standing all around them on the snowy embankment, faces grim. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 95.

The priests exchange a look, reaching some silent decision. The LEADER of the elderly priests comes forward. HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd) Hurry it up, I smell gas... The snowplow driver stands there, confused by what he's witnessing. The old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window past the trapped highway patrolman. Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord. The cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes the priests aren't going to help him. Are in fact condemning him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road. HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd) (struggling) Oh no you don't! You bastards have no right to sit in judgement of me. I know what you're thinking but I had nothing to do with that drunk girl's disappearance. I saw her home safely. Just ask the County investigators. And anything else you think you saw? All of it was lawfully done! He sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above. Another WHOOSH, blue flames spreading out from the fuel line. The cop smells smoke, a pleading note entering his voice now. HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd) Please, father... For the love of Christ have mercy on a poor sinner! There's a SMALL EXPLOSION, and the inside of the car starts filling with FLAMES and black smoke. The trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive, cursing. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 96. HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd) Goddamn you filthy bastards! You think you'll be rid of me!? You'll never be rid of me!! I'll be your worst nightmare!! I'll be - The rest is lost in a second larger EXPLOSION. Flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered here to bear mute witness. They watch the burning patrol car for a moment longer, then one by one climb the embankment.
T: CUT TO:
S: A103 EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT (1958) A103
N: Christmas, 1958. The crash scene we saw depicted in the news clipping. The wrecked `55 CROWN VIC. PRIESTS administering last rights two the two TEENS in letter jackets: one already dead, the other breathing his last breaths. BACK TO:
S: B103 EXT. BOTTOM OF RAVINE - AS BEFORE B103
N: Our girl and the rattled snowplow driver stand there in the silence and the flickering firelight from the burning car.
C: GIRL
D: Come on. We can go now. It's over.
N: The snowplow driver, stunned, speechless, can only stand there and nod. Suddenly - The COP launches himself out of the window of the overturned car at them. Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks, dragging his paralyzed lower body after them. The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in place, unable to move. She grabs him by the arm, pulls him away. GIRL (cont'd) MOVE!! WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 97. B103 CONTINUED: B103 He comes to his senses, staggers up the embankment after her. He loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling. As the cop seizes him around the legs, and starts crawling up the length of his body. We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he shrieks in agony. Until even his shriek is FROZEN IN HIS LUNGS. ANGLE ON OUR GIRL As she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the horror below. Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below. She whimpers, fingers clutching at anything. Finally she succeeds, manages to haul herself up the steep embankment, climbing with everything she's got left in her until she reaches the road.
S: EXT. TOP OF THE RAVINE / WRECKED SNOWPLOW - NIGHT
N: She hauls herself up from the gloomy abyss, wrenches the driver side door open and scrambles inside -
S: INT. WRECKED SNOWPLOW - CONTINUOUS
N: She pulls the door closed, twists the key in the ignition. Nothing.
C: GIRL
D: Come on, come on!
E: urgently
N: She tries again. And again. But the engine is dead. Just then she notices the "power" light glowing on the C.B. She ducks under the dashboard, retrieves the microphone, sits up again - The cop. Unscathed. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 98. Standing right outside the snowplow, restored to his former glory, grinning at her. Then the smile curdles. He reaches through the shattered window. Grabbing for her. She scrabbles just out of reach. Pins herself against the opposite door. Cornered. Suddenly -
C: GUY
D: Get away from her, you bastard!
N: And OUR GUY'S GHOST appears out of the gloom. He swings a CROWBAR into the cop's skull. And, just like before, there's a VIOLENT FLASH OF light and -
T: SMASH CUT TO:
S: INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
N: It's like someone pressed RESET. She's back inside the STRANDED OLDSMOBILE, seated beside the body of our guy. Her panicked breathing turns into hyperventilation as she realizes all efforts to escape the road are futile. Suddenly she spots something through the windshield that causes her breath to catch - OUR GUY'S GHOST heading down the road toward the trees. She gasps. Starts sobbing. Throws open the door and scrambles out.
S: EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - CONTINUOUS
N: The sky is showing the first signs of approaching dawn. She watches OUR GUY'S GHOST moving into the woods, back toward the direction from which they came. WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 99. She stands there, exhausted, spent. Suddenly - A familiar SONG begins to chime on her cellphone RINGTONE:
C: CELLPHONE
D: Ding-da-da DING, da-DING da-DING... Her eyes widen in terror. She fumbles out the cellphone. Stabs the "off" button with her thumb.
E: "Rockin Around the X-mas Tree..."
N: She instinctively starts back to the stranded Oldsmobile - Stops - Looks at the ghost. And in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow him. She takes off down the road. We follow as she hurries to catch up with our guy's ghost.
C: GIRL
D: Wait!
E: crying; breathless
N: She's close enough now to hear that he's MUMBLING something.
C: GUY'S GHOST
D: ...I would've told you everything eventually...
N: Exhausted, she's having trouble keeping up with him.
C: GIRL
D: I know.
C: GUY'S GHOST
D: ...then it wouldn't be stalkerish.
C: GIRL
D: I know!
E: out of breath
C: GUY'S GHOST
D: ... It would just be this sweet funny story we'd have...
N: WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 100. But it's no use. She stops trying to keep up and pauses briefly, devastated, catching her breath. Then she pushes on in the direction he went.
T: TIME DISSOLVE:
N: It's almost light out now, and SHE'S ALONE, staggering along the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows. It's like running in a dream, never fast enough to outdistance an unseen pursuer. But then she hears it - THE HIGHWAY. She can't believe she's made it back to civilization.
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - MORNING
N: The gas pumps are crowded with EMERGENCY VEHICLES and PERSONNEL. The morning calm is broken by the BEEP BEEP BEEP of trucks backing up, the BLEET of arriving ambulances, the constant CHATTER of two-way radios. OUR GIRL is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a blanket draped around her shoulders, allowing EMTs to treat her frostbite. She watches ATTENDANTS from the county morgue zip the bodies of our guy and the snowplow driver into BODYBAGS. Suddenly she remembers her cellphone, and takes it out. INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY -- It's the DIGITAL PICTURE OF OUR GUY when she first met him, asleep behind the wheel of the `88 Olds in student parking. BACK TO SCENE She closes her cellphone. The EMT helps her into the passenger seat of the ambulance. As the ambulance drives off we CRANE UP to see... WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 101. In the distance, the haunted road snaking through the white forest. END FILM ROLL CREDITS
