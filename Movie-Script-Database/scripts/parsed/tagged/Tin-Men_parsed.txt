S: EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY
N: BILL BABOWSKY ("BB"), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac. A SALESMAN follows on his heels.
C: SALESMAN
D: She's a beauty.
C: BB
D: Who?
E: looking at Salesman
C: SALESMAN
D: What?
C: BB
D: Who's the beauty?
C: SALESMAN
D: The car.
C: BB
D: I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I lost my concentration. Why do they call cars 'she'? They never say 'he'... always 'she.' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders. BB walks around the Cadillac.
C: BB
D: Very nice... very nice.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LINE OF ROW HOUSES - DAY
N: We hear YELLING.
S: INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY
N: NORA, a rather plain, but attractive woman in her early 30's, is yelling up the stairs.
C: NORA
D: You're a sick man! Sick! Do ya hear me?! Do ya hear me?!
N: Peeking around the bannister from the second floor is ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30's, handsome in a boyish way.
C: TILLEY
D: Who's sick?
C: NORA
D: Who do ya think I'm screaming at? How many of you are there up there? There's only you, and you're a sick human being.
C: TILLEY
D: Where's my white on white shirt? The nice one, you know.
E: quietly, coming down a few steps
C: NORA
D: It's like yelling through a wall to you. I'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is.
C: TILLEY
D: Yes, the one with the permanent stays. CUT TO:
S: EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY
N: BB is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the Salesman, going over the contract on the car.
C: BB
D: Now don't try to hustle me here ... you know what I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your 'special' deals... give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear?
C: SALESMAN
D: Now, how much are you willing to pay?
C: BB
D: There ya go... there ya go... you're doing it... you're doing one of those hustle numbers.
C: SALESMAN
D: I'm just trying to get an idea how much you're willing to pay.
C: BB
D: Four dollars... I want to pay four dollars a month.
C: SALESMAN
D: That's not an honest answer.
C: BB
D: What do ya want to hear? That I'd love to pay three hundred and fifty a month... is that what you want to hear? Tell me how much you want me to pay and I'll tell you how much I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on me... I don't like that. How much do I want to pay? I'd like to pay nothing! CUT TO:
S: EXT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Tilley's leaving the house with his tie undone around his white on white shirt. He carries his sports jacket, and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him.
C: NORA
D: You're being unreasonable. You don't even want to listen.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know what I did... I got no idea. If it's my fault, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I can do no better than that. A full unconditional apology. Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his car -- a Cadillac. He gets inside, STARTS the ENGINE and pulls away. Nora remains on the porch watching the car ... one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of duplicate houses. CUT TO:
S: EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY
N: BB and the Salesman are coming out of the office.
C: SALESMAN
D: If you even have the smallest problem, call me personally and I'll just shoot you straight into the service department.
C: BB
D: And I get a loaner if the car's got to stay?
C: SALESMAN
D: As we discussed, you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight.
C: BB
D: I get a loaner? The Salesman nods. CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY
N: He drives along, mumbling to himself.
C: TILLEY
D: She's gonna drive me to my grave... I'm headed to my grave... the woman's driving me insane... it's not supposed to happen this way. He starts moving his head -- stretching his neck from right to left.
C: TILLEY
D: It's not even eleven o'clock and my neck is stiffening up. He juts his jaw out.
C: TILLEY
D: My neck's tight... it's tight. CUT TO:
S: EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY
N: BB gets into the shiny, baby-blue Cadillac, puts it in reverse and starts to back out of the car lot.
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY
N: Tilley is doing neck exercises, rolling his head from left to right as he drives. He sees a red light ahead and starts to slow down, continuing to roll his head.
S: EXT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY
N: BB sees the light is red and starts to back into the street.
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY
N: Tilley rolls his head back as he slows to 15 miles an hour.
S: EXT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY
N: BB backs into the street thinking that Tilley's car is going to stop.
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY
N: Tilley is still rolling his head.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Tilley's Cadillac and BB's Cadillac CRASH into one another. The entire right rear of BB's shiny, baby-blue Cadillac is smashed. Both men are shocked and momen- tarily confused. After a beat, both Tilley and BB bolt from their cars. Tilley looks at his buckled hood. BB races up to Tilley's face.
C: BB
D: Are you a lunatic? Can't you see I'm trying to back out of this lot? There's a red light, you shoulda stopped.
C: TILLEY
D: Me? What are you, crazy? You just want to back into the middle of the street like that. A man's just driving along and you back into the middle of the street. What kind of driving is that? What kind of driving?
C: CONTINUED BB
D: There's a red light, I'm making a space for myself... that's what I'm doing, in order to get into the street... that's something ya do!
C: TILLEY
D: You came out of nowhere... you bolted out of no place... bolted out of nowhere.
C: BB
D: Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm bolting into the street! You schmuck! You schmuck! He moves toward Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away from me.
C: BB
D: Back away? You want me to back away? I'll back away. He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car.
C: TILLEY
D: You're a fucking lunatic! He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart.
C: BB
D: You're a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me... the man is crazy! People continue to pull them apart. MAN #1 Come on now, calm down, calm down. He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off BB. MAN #2 Take it easy... take it easy...
C: TILLEY
D: Get this guy! Will ya get this guy? Backs in front of me, and then kicks my headlight in... and I'm crazy. You lunatic! Tilley makes another jump for BB. Again, people try pulling them apart.
E: to people watching
C: BB
D: You're going to prison. Death! Death! They're going to give you death!
N: BB looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in side.
C: BB
D: Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and I've been hit. He turns back and looks at Tilley.
C: BB
D: I'm gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch... I'm gonna get even with you. This is no ordinary traffic accident.
C: TILLEY
D: You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to drive. You want to get even with somebody? You picked the wrong person to get even with. Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says they want to get even. I'm gonna get even! CUT TO:
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. SAM PICKLES, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly.
C: SAM
D: Did ya see 'Bonanza' last night? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over?
N: GIL, who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up.
C: GIL
D: Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa? MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at Sam with an investigative look.
C: MOUSE
D: Did he know this guy personally?
C: SAM
D: No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you.
C: MOUSE
D: You're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us?
C: SAM
D: Me? No, I'm not a bigot.
C: GIL
D: If you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it?
C: SAM
D: It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying.
C: MOUSE
D: Come on... you're a bigot, that's what you are.
C: SAM
D: Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house. CUT TO:
S: EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Tilley gets out of his car and enters the diner.
S: INT. DINER - DAY
N: He starts walking to the booth where the other tin men are. On his way he yells over to the waitress.
C: TILLEY
D: Florence, eggs and the toast, the way I like it. FLORENCE, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back to Tilley.
C: FLORENCE
D: Not too gooey. Coffee right away. She trails the last word. Sam is still talking about his problem with "Bonanza."
C: SAM
D: I just don't believe that 'Bonanza' is an accurate description of the West. I say no more. Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam. He indicates for Sam to give him more room.
C: TILLEY
D: Come on, give me a couple of more inches.
C: SAM
D: You want me to take my plate... I'll eat in the parking lot.
C: TILLEY
D: Come on, Sam, I'm having a terrible morning. You're not going to believe this, some guy just crashed into me... right in the middle of the street... then he attacks me. One of the loonies.
C: SAM
D: Did ya live?
E: biting into his toast
C: MOUSE
D: Did you get his name?
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, I got his name. The police came... God, I can't believe it... the guy's an idiot. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, here it is... some Polish name... Babowski... Bill Babowski ... fucking son of a bitch.
C: GIL
D: I know the guy... they call him
C: BB. TILLEY
D: You know the son of a bitch?
C: GIL
D: Yeah, he works with Bagel.
C: TILLEY
D: He sells aluminum siding? I don't believe it... of all the people that could run into me, it has to be a fucking tin man. How come I don't know him?
C: GIL
D: You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese ... you know, that group.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know the guy.
C: GIL
D: Don't you remember, he was up at the Corral one night when we were there... he's a good dancer. You must have seen him.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know the guy.
C: SAM
D: Gil, he doesn't know the guy.
C: GIL
D: I thought he knew him, Sam... I can't believe he doesn't know him.
C: SAM
D: He seems to be indicating that he doesn't know him.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know the guy!
C: GIL
D: He's a good dancer.
C: TILLEY
D: What do you want me to do, date him? What do I give a shit if he's a good dancer?
C: GIL
D: I thought you saw him. I was amazed, he does a Marengay... I tell you if I was a girl I'd be impressed.
C: SAM
D: You're not a girl and you're impressed! Florence comes over and puts down some coffee in front of Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: Is it fresh?
C: FLORENCE
D: Yes, it's fresh!
C: TILLEY
D: Just asking, Florence.
N: Florence starts to walk away.
C: FLORENCE
D: You're always just asking. Gil still talking about BB.
C: GIL
D: I'm telling you, you just can't believe how well this guy does the Marengay.
C: MOUSE
D: I can't wait to see it.
C: TILLEY
D: I'll tell you one thing, when I get a hold of this guy, I'll break both his legs and then he won't dance the Marengay too good. CUT TO:
S: 18 EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK IN A RUN-DOWN AREA OF TOWN - DAY18
N: We see BB pulling up to a building in his banged-up, brand new Cadillac. There are three or four nice Cadillacs parked outside of the run-down building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. OFFICE - DAY
N: The office is filled with second-hand furniture, mis- matched desks and a conglomeration of styles. In one corner of the room there are two or three GIRLS working the telephones -- canvassing -- talking to people on the phone to see if they're interested in a demonstration on the benefits of aluminum siding. They all speak in a very congenial tone of voice. GIRL #1 Good morning, I represent the Superior Aluminum Siding Company. We will have a representative in your neighborhood today. Would you be interested in seeing the benefits of our aluminum product? (MORE) GIRL #1 (CONT'D) (beat) Yes... well, we do aluminum siding which improves the appearance of your house, and improves the insulation... CAMERA MOVES TO ANOTHER GIRL. GIRL #2 ... Which improves the appearance of your house, and improves the insulation... CAMERA MOVES TO GIRL #3. GIRL #3 ... Superior Aluminum Siding Company. We will have a representative... CAMERA MOVES TO another corner of the room where we see 4 "tin men" salesmen sitting around one of the desks playing cards. MOE is beginning to tell a joke. He is a man in his 50's.
C: MOE
D: So the guy goes to the doctor for a physical... they do all those tests, all that stuff, blah, blah, blah... BB enters the scene and goes over and gets himself a cup of coffee.
C: MOE
D: ... Doctor says 'when we get all the information back, we'll give you a call.' Leaves the doctor. One day the telephone rings... the guy goes and picks it up.
C: CHEESE
D: The guy?
C: MOE
D: The guy!
E: immediately aggravated
C: CHEESE
D: Not the doctor?
C: MOE
D: That's right, the guy picks it up. He gets a phone call... it's the doctor on the line. Doctor says 'I've got some bad news and some worse news.' BB join the tin men to listen to Moe's joke.
C: MOE
D: Guy says 'Well, let me hear the bad news first.' 'The bad news is, you've got twenty-four hours to live.' The guy says 'What's the worse news?' Doctor says 'I forgot to call you yesterday.' They all laugh. LOONEY, a thin guy who twitches and blinks a lot, stands up.
C: LOONEY
D: It's good... I like it.
C: CHEESE
D: I never heard bad news and worse news... smart joke.
C: LOONEY
D: Yeah... I like it.
C: CARLY
D: It's dumb, but good. BB, who is not laughing, stands behind Cheese who throws 50 cents into the card game.
C: CHEESE
D: Up it fifty cents.
C: LOONEY
D: I call... I call. I'm in on this one... I call.
C: MOE
D: We get it, you're calling.
C: CARLY
D: I'm not sure.
C: BB
D: Stay with him.
C: CARLY
D: I don't know.
C: CHEESE
D: Carly, get out of the hand... I'm holding serious cards. Very serious cards.
C: BB
D: He's bluffing.
C: CHEESE
D: If I'm lying, I'm dying.
C: CARLY
D: I'm out.
C: BB
D: Ballsy move. Moe throws his hand in, too.
C: MOE
D: Did you get the new Cadillac?
E: to BB
C: BB
D: Yeah. It's already been hit.
C: MOE
D: What?
C: BB
D: Didn't have it five minutes, backing out of the place, and a guy comes out of nowhere and bangs into my car.
C: LOONEY
D: So, what ya got? Cheese throws his hand down.
C: CHEESE
D: Pair of sixes.
C: LOONEY
D: Jacks. Win.
C: CARLY
D: Shit! Pair of sixes.
C: MOE
D: How much damage?
E: about car
C: BB
D: I bet it's six hundred bucks.
C: LOONEY
D: Six hundred bucks? I'd get rid of the car. That much damage it won't be any good. You may have dented the frame.
C: BB
D: I didn't dent the frame.
C: LOONEY
D: When you hit the frame, the car doesn't ride right.
C: BB
D: He didn't hit the frame! I'll tell you this, I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around.
C: CHEESE
D: You're kidding me?
C: BB
D: Yeah... the guy's totally off the wall. He takes a sip of his coffee.
C: BB
D: I'm gonna get him... just for the fun of it. CUT TO:

N: Moe is with BB in the Cadillac. BB is driving. Moe is looking through some papers.
C: MOE
D: Now, let me see... we gotta be at the Hickey house at four. It's about three-twenty now... we've got some time on our hands. You want to get some coffee?
E: he looks at his watch
C: BB
D: No, I'm up to here with the coffee. He indicates his throat.
C: MOE
D: They got any good pool halls around here?
C: BB
D: I don't know. You know what would be fun to do..? Let's try the Life Magazine routine.
E: beat
C: MOE

S: EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY
N: Slightly run-down. We're looking THROUGH the LENS of a 35mm camera.

D: You know, I think we've got to come over about two feet. The SCREEN SHAKES as BB moves the camera. CUT TO:
E: O.S.
S: INT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY
N: A HOUSEWIFE is looking through the curtains, suspiciously. CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the window and we see Moe and BB moving the 35mm camera around on a tripod. We can faintly hear their talk.
C: BB
D: I think this is a better position... the light is hitting it, which is accentuating the effect we're going for. It's very good... very good.
C: MOE
D: This shows the flaws in the structure... CUT TO:
E: in a creative pose
S: EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY
N: BB and Moe at the camera and tripod.
C: BB
D: She's at the window.
E: under his breath, to Moe
C: MOE
D: Yeah.
C: BB
D: This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine. Terrific in Life Magazine! Come on outside, honey.
E: in a loud voice even louder under his breath
C: MOE
D: This should be our single biggest issue of Life Magazine. We see the Housewife coming out of her front door.
E: in loud voice
C: BB
D: Bingo! The Housewife approaches BB and Moe suspiciously.
E: quietly
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Excuse me. What are you doing?
C: MOE
D: Oh, I hope we're not disturbing you, ma'am. We're with Life Magazine... we'll be out of here in just a minute.
C: BB
D: Move the tripod another foot... another foot. Moe moves the tripod.
E: still looking through camera; to Moe
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: What do you mean, Life Magazine?
C: BB
D: Two minutes, ma'am, and we'll be out of here. We just need the picture for Life Magazine, and we'll be out of here.
E: looking up from camera
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Life Magazine? I don't understand.
C: BB
D: It's very simple. Ya know, we're doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding -- a 'before' and 'after' kind of presentation.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: A 'before' picture?
C: MOE
D: So they see your house, and another one done with aluminum siding... the other house looking so much more beautiful.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: In Life Magazine?
C: MOE
D: It's a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home.
C: BB
D: A wonderful issue... it's one of the finest pictorial things we've done here at Life... the ways you can improve your house. We're gonna be out of here in no time, ma'am.
E: he adjusts the camera
C: MOE
D: It's gonna look very good, BB.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: My house is going to be the 'before'? Can't mine be like the 'after'?
C: BB
D: No, no... we've got a house that looked like yours and it's been done in aluminum... it's very nice.
C: MOE
D: Yeah... really shows the contrast of what a house can look like.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: What does it cost?
C: BB
D: What? The aluminum siding? Oh... I don't know the figures offhand. Do you have any idea, Moe?
C: MOE
D: I think it's fairly reasonable.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Could my house be the 'after' in Life Magazine and you get another house for the 'before.'
C: BB
D: You mean have your house as the 'after' and find another house that looks like your house for the 'before'?
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: Is it possible?
C: BB
D: What do ya think, Moe? Would that be ethical?
C: MOE
D: Well, we didn't sign any agreement with the 'after' house. We'd have to move very quickly, ma'am... you know what I mean?
C: BB
D: You'd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they'd have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline... we've got a deadline, that's the problem.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: How quickly?
C: MOE
D: BB, what do you think? Can we slide the deadline, or what? Six or seven days?
C: BB
D: Pressing it. Do you think we could manage it, Moe?
C: MOE
D: It's pushing it, BB. What time would your husband be home, 'cos he'd have to go over the figures with the salesman... that's if there's a salesman available this evening.
E: to Housewife
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: He'll be home at seven.
C: BB
D: We might be able to work it.
C: HOUSEWIFE
D: That would be wonderful. CUT TO:

E: to Moe
C: HUSBAND
D: Thirty-seven hundred dollars!
C: CARLY
D: I tell you what... I've got an idea. Do you mind my guys working on a Saturday? 'Cos if my crew can work on Saturday next, that'll free my guys up on Monday. Yeah, that'll really help me out on another job. Anyway, if we can do that, I think I'll be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job. You see, I've got an overlapping situation on Monday... I don't want to go into it. What do ya think? We got a deal?

C: TILLEY
D: We haven't even got to discussing terms. There are so many friendly financial arrangements that would hardly be a bite into your weekly salary.
N: HUSBAND #2 No... not this time.
C: TILLEY
D: Well, as I said, you can always reach me... you've got my card, and when the time comes, let's talk. The Husband and wife stand to show Tilley to the door.

C: TILLEY
D: I thought I had 'em... I was this close. He demonstrates with his fingers.
C: SAM
D: The amount of time you spent there, I thought you were ready to send for me to close it up.

S: INT. PIMLICO HOTEL - BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: This is a piano bar with an intimate restaurant at one end. The PIANIST is playing "The Girl From Ipanema."
C: PIANIST
D: 'Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes each one she passes goes... "Ah!"' The last word of the verse -- "Ah" -- has great emphasis put on it and is lengthened considerably. The people sitting around the piano all join the pianist and say "Ah" in unison. CAMERA MOVES OVER TO a table where Mouse, Sam, Tilley, Gil and a few other tin men set. WING, the head of Gibraltar Aluminum, a tall, strong, imposing figure, holds court. The table is filled with papers, folders, etc., as if Wing's office desk had been trans- ported to the bar. He's reviewing a paper from a job that Mouse has done.
C: WING
D: Forty-six hundred dollars. This looks like a sound deal. They own their own house... we won't have any problem getting the financing for them. Real good, Mouse. He picks up his check book ledger and writes out a check.
C: WING
D: So, that's one thousand, one hundred and thirty-eight dollars. Finishes writing check and hands it to Mouse.
E: writing
C: MOUSE
D: Thanks, boss. Pleasure doing business with ya. Mouse takes the check and pockets it. Wing turns to Tilley and Sam.
C: WING
D: Now, what's your guys' story?
C: TILLEY

D: Tilley, I'm already carrying you for, what is it -- twenty-three hundred? Something like that?
C: TILLEY
D: No problem... just in a little slump here.
C: WING
D: Don't try to go walking on me.

D: What do you mean, walking? You think I'm gonna work somewhere else... you've been very good to me... very honorable.
C: SAM
D: He's always said that about you, Wing. Always said that about you... he has.
C: WING
D: I'll give you hundred and fifty.
C: TILLEY
D: Wing, I need a bit more than that... I got expenses.
C: WING
D: What's wrong with your wife? She doesn't work?
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, but how much is she gonna make working at the Social Security office? Wing writes out a check and gives it to Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: Come on, Wing, can't you do better than this... a man in my position in terms of this firm... I dunno...
C: WING
D: All right, I'll give you two hundred. Wing changes amount of check and hands it to Tilley.
C: MOUSE
D: Honey, can you get me some Marlboros and a 7 and 7?
E: yelling to cocktail waitress

D: And some scotch, straight up. Tilley pockets the check.

D: Now listen, guys, we got a problem here.
C: SAM
D: Did she hear me say scotch straight up?
E: to Mouse
C: WING
D: My sources tell me this Home Improvement Commission is for real... it's no jackpot. These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass, so any of the scams that you guys are pulling, they get wind of it, they take your license and it's goodbye to this business.
C: MOUSE
D: They take away your license? They take away your livelihood? What kind of people are these?
C: SAM
D: They have no respect for the working man.
C: TILLEY
D: Which scams are they talking about? They got a list?
C: WING
D: Any irregularities, you know, selling a house on the pretense that it's a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback... the Life Magazine hustle... you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can run.
C: SAM
D: Jesus! What a pain in the ass. Do you think this commission's gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind?

D: They've got snakes?
C: BB
D: I've heard they've got snakes that'll outrun a horse through the grass. They got a snake that bites you... you got eleven seconds to live. No thank you. I don't want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy. I'd like to go to a place where... hold it! He hits the brakes suddenly.
C: MOE
D: What's wrong? BB backs his car halfway up the street. He stops in the driveway of the Pimlico Hotel parking lot.

N: 34 CONTINUED: 35

E: to Mouse

D: It's too big a spread. We hear the sound of BREAKING GLASS. Tilley responds to the sound. He looks out of the glass doors and sees BB kicking in the headlight of his car. BB runs back towards his car.
C: TILLEY
D: It's that fucking lunatic again. He races out of the door of the hotel towards BB's car which pulls away and speeds down the street. Several of the tin men run after Tilley. He stands in the street watching the car disappear.

D: Can you believe this guy? Is he sane or what?
E: still looking after the car

C: NORA
D: What are you talking about... this match box?
C: TILLEY
D: It's got a lot of overhead to it. What do you do... spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen, that's all. So why do you need a living room and a dining room. He walks over to the back door and looks out.
C: TILLEY
D: Why do ya need a back yard?
C: NORA
D: You're not selling anything?
C: TILLEY
D: I'm in a slump.

C: NORA
D: Well, you will. You always do.
C: TILLEY
D: I'm not sure I like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck. When you have a place like this, that's a lot of overhead.
E: beat
C: NORA
D: What are you talking about? The monthly payments on your Cadillac are more than this whole house. Why don't you get yourself something cheaper, like a Chevy?
C: TILLEY
D: It doesn't instill confidence in my clients. Cadillac means that you're dealing with someone of importance. I thought I had a couple tonight... they just slipped away... slipped away. I'm gonna take a bath -- my neck's been tight since this morning.

D: I don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat.
C: NORA
D: Yes... it's nice to do that.
C: TILLEY
D: Why? I don't get it. It's better sitting at home and watching TV.
C: NORA
D: I think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun.
C: TILLEY
D: What's fun about it? Ants get into the food... there's bees. I don't get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun?
C: NORA
D: I just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun.
C: TILLEY
D: It doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. It's just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that together, don't we? No ants and no bees... much more comfortable.
C: NORA
D: It's not the same thing.
C: TILLEY
D: Scrub my back, will ya, Nora. Nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing Tilley's back.
C: TILLEY
D: Not too hard! Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to do anything with you. I'm just a little stymied by a picnic. If you want to go, send me a postcard. Nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom.

C: GIL
D: Hey, Tilley, don't go too wild...

D: Sure you wanna get into the tin game?
E: to Stanley
C: STANLEY
D: Money's good, I understand.
C: LOONEY
D: Lot of crazy people you're gonna run into when you're knocking on those doors. Hermits that don't see the outside world, Jehovah's Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same time you're trying to sell them tin. People that are just lonely and want to have conversations.
C: CARLY
D: Every time you step in that door, you've got to be fast on your feet.

D: Interesting.
C: MOE
D: What's the best way to qualify a mark?
E: quizzing Stanley
C: STANLEY
D: What?
C: MOE
D: How do you know if you can get the upper hand? How do you know if you're dealing with a guy who's in an inferior position to you, or superior position? How do you know? Moe puts Stanley on the defensive.
C: STANLEY
D: You just have to talk and feel your way.
C: MOE
D: Quick way... get a book of matches out of your pocket to light your cigarette... you drop the matches on the floor.
C: STANLEY
D: Yeah.
E: looks puzzled
C: MOE
D: Guy bends down to pick up the matches for you, you got a mark... you got this guy in your pocket. If he looks to you to pick it up, you've got a long, hard, tough sell on your hands. BB walks over to the guys, having just poured himself some coffee.
C: BB
D: You want to get in good with these people... you want to win their confidence? Good thing to try... get a five dollar bill, take it out when the guy's not looking, drop it on the ground. Guy looks back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, 'Mr. Blah blah, you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground.' Two things happen... he says, 'It's not mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos it's certainly not mine,' or the guy takes it. Right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy... you're in. You start chipping away... you start getting inside those people. Stanley is quite taken by their information. BB puts his cup down and grabs his coat.

D: Come on, Moe, let's split.

C: BB
D: This guy's looking to play tit for tat. That's not my game. I'm gonna play hardball. BB throws the glass down on the ground.

D: Well, then, believe it. There's no sense not to believe it, because you did it... so believe it. That's twenty more... you owe me sixty.
C: TILLEY
D: You think I can't add? He goes to rack to re-set. Mouse goes over and puts a nickel in the juke box. A RECORD slips into position, and Harry Belafonte's "Banana Boat Song" begins. Mouse, in unison with the record, sings, and is totally caught up in the song.

D: Found this on your desk while I was going over some papers. He hands the letter to Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: From the IRS. I never even remember seeing it. I must have left it with my other bills. I wonder what it is?
C: SAM
D: Maybe it's a refund check. Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.
C: TILLEY
D: Hum... says here that they haven't received my 1962 taxes. They seem to be saying that they didn't get my check for four thousand dollars.
C: SAM
D: What? It must be a clerical error.

D: I can't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me... to single me out.

E: MORE
C: TILLEY
D: I figured they could wait a few years... it's not like they need my money to build a bomber. You think they're waiting for my money before they dig a new road? Are they all sitting there saying, 'Well, it's time we went to see that guy on Pimlico Road... can't run this government without his four thousand dollars.' I figured they'd give me a little leeway. I'm going to pay them... I know I've got a debt... I just need a little leeway.

C: TILLEY
D: I can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business... how much I make... how much I spend... no way!

C: NORA
D: You know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken... just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. Makes a good meal, and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers.

D: Take a look at this, Sam. Tilley shows him the written contract. Written across the front of the contract in big, bold, black letters are the words: "THIS JOB IS FREE." Sam looks at Tilley.
C: SAM
D: Are you fucking crazy? You just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free?!

C: MAN
D: What's that?
C: SAM
D: He's been under a lot of pressure recently... he snapped... he had a nervous breakdown... it's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Let's be honest about it, nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding free.
C: MAN
D: I thought it was very generous, but sometimes the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
C: SAM
D: Let me tell you something, when I go and see his boss and show him this contract, he's out of this business... he'll lose his home ... his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street. He'll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids. Anyway, it's not your problem.
C: MAN
D: Why do they have to be thrown out onto the street?
C: SAM
D: You don't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job, do ya?

C: MAN

C: SAM
D: You don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you?
C: MAN
D: How so?
C: SAM
D: Let's look at it this way, what if I can sell you this job at a wholesale price... kind of lessens the burden. The big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out... at least they'll have a roof over their heads.
C: MAN
D: What kind of wholesale price are we talking about?
C: SAM
D: You got a cup of coffee?
C: WIFE
D: I'll get you a coffee... won't be a minute.

N: The place is crowded... jumping with activity. A local band is playing on a tiny stage. BB's on the floor dancing with a girl. He's doing some good moves, and it's obvious that he's a real crowd pleaser. Sitting at the bar are Looney, Stanley and Carly.
C: CARLY
D: The buzzard had a great gimmick. You know, when it came time to measure a job, he'd cut the yardstick and reglue it together ... he took out seven inches so his square footage would always be higher. That way he'd always make a few extra bucks on the job.
N: Stanley laughs and looks at Carly.
C: STANLEY
D: You're kidding?
C: CARLY
D: Yeah... he'd always put his hand over the break when he was measuring. Nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it is.

D: I never did that... I never did that... I was never very good in arts and crafts. I could never make the ruler come out right. The song ends.
E: laughs
C: ANGLE ON BB

N: ANGLE ON BAR Stanley is really enjoying the stories Carly and Looney are telling.
C: STANLEY
D: What else? Give me another story ... these stories are great!

D: Just a minute... I've got one. You know it's like the faster you can start spiking a job, the guy can't back out of the deal.
E: MORE
C: LOONEY
D: Shoe had some customers that he thought was fragile on coming for the buy. He'd say to the guy 'here let me show you how bad a shape your house is in,' and he'd rip off a piece of wood, maybe fifteen feet wide. The guy's house looks like shit so it makes it hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is missing. The Shoe's a fucking wonder. CUT TO:

C: MOE
D: It's hard to answer. Seems better than if she wasn't there.
E: beat
C: BB
D: Quite a recommendation... can't wait to do it. He laughs.
C: ANGLE ON DOOR
D: Tilley and Sam come through the door and walk over to the bar.
C: TILLEY
D: Scotch straight up?
E: to Sam
C: SAM
D: Yeah.
C: TILLEY
D: Scotch straight up and a rum and Coke for me. He looks around the room at the women.
E: to barman
C: TILLEY
D: Looks like there's good action here tonight.
C: SAM
D: What do you expect, it's half price night for divorced women. The place is hopping.
N: ANGLE ON BB AND MOE
C: BB
D: Look how much more complicated things are now. There used to be a time you met a girl, you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after. Now, see that one over there... ... that's Helen Armstrong... maiden name used to be Tudor. Get this, she dated Charlie Rider when I was in high school, seemed like they were together forever. They broke up, she started to go with Lenny Mardigian, they got married, she's Helen Mardigian. That goes on two years... three years, something like that.
E: he points to girl at a table MORE
C: BB
D: They divorce, dates Billy Small for a couple of years, lives with John Isaacs for a year, marries Tommy Selnini... that marriage goes in the toilet, but fast. Now she's dating Charlie Rider who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff who used to be Evelyn Gage before that. So much for relationships.
E: CONT'D beat; he looks at Moe and laughs
N: ANGLE ON SAM AND TILLEY AT BAR
C: SAM
D: I'm beginning to believe in God.
C: TILLEY
D: You were never one of those atheists, were you?
C: SAM
D: No, I'm not saying that, but I'm beginning to give God more thought.
C: TILLEY
D: So, what did you do? Have some kind of religious experience?
C: SAM
D: I tell ya... I took my wife for lunch yesterday... we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened.
C: TILLEY
D: You found God at the smorgasbord?
C: SAM
D: Yeah.
C: TILLEY
D: Sam, people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains, that kind of thing.
C: SAM
D: Maybe... but I had mine in a smorgasbord.
C: TILLEY
D: Sam, you're too much.
E: laughs
C: SAM
D: I went to get myself a salad and I started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much... that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, yeah... I get the point. So?
C: SAM
D: So I see celery, I see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower... and I think, all these things come out of the ground... they just grow out of the ground. They had corn -- out of the ground... radish -- out of the ground. You say to yourself, how can all these things come out of the ground? You know what I'm talking about? All these things are out of the ground.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah.
E: not understanding
C: SAM
D: I mean, how can that be? It just happened that way? And I'm not even getting into the fruits... I'm just dealing with vegetables right now. With all those things coming out of the earth, there must be a God.
C: TILLEY
D: I'm not getting the same religious effect that came over you. I don't know why, but I don't feel like running to a church to pray right this second.
E: looking at Sam
C: SAM
D: You gotta admit, it's amazing.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, yeah... I don't believe it. See the guy over there? He looks in the direction of BB.
E: he turns away and looks across the room
C: TILLEY
D: That's the son of a bitch who crsahed into my car. Sam looks over to BB.
N: ANGLE ON BB AND MOE BB's looking through the crowd and sees Tilley.
C: BB
D: I don't believe it! Mr. Banana Head is here.
C: MOE
D: What?
C: BB
D: That crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in. I don't fucking believe it! I'm gonna get him.
C: ANGLE ON TILLEY TILLEY
D: I'm gonna get him! Both BB and Tilley weave their way through the crowd to get to one another. In the confusion of all the people, they both go right past one another and then look around for one another. They see that they're in the opposite direction, and end up going towards one another again. Moe and Sam wander over to their guys.
C: BB
D: You got a lot of nerve banging into my car, and you've got a lot of fucking nerve smashing my windows in.
C: TILLEY
D: What're you talking about? Why would I want to break your windows?
C: BB
D: You didn't smash my windows in?
C: TILLEY
D: I'm a hard-working guy... I don't go around breaking windows. I've got better things to do.
C: BB
D: You didn't break my windows?! You didn't break my windows?! He pushes Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: Push me one more time and I'm gonna have to redefine your face. BB pushes him. Tilley starts to go for BB and they scuffle about. Moe and Sam try to pull the guys apart.
N: ANGLE ON LOONEY AND CARLY They move through the crowd to BB and Moe. The band keeps playing. Moe and Sam, with the help of Looney and Carly, pull Tilley and BB apart.
C: BB
D: Come on, let's go outside... let's settle this in the parking lot.
C: TILLEY
D: Oh, no! You're not gonna get near my car... you're not gonna kick in my headlights again... ... What am I talking about? I didn't even drive tonight. You wanna duke it? Let's go. They both head out the door. The other tin men follow, and others who have been paying attention to this alter- cation, also follow. CUT TO:
E: beat
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Tilley and BB come out of the club and start to look for a place in the lot where there's some room to fight. The crowd eagerly follows right on the heels of BB and Tilley. BB and Tilley both take off their sports jackets.
C: BB
D: What is this? What is this crowd here? We're charging admission?
E: seeing the people gathering around
C: TILLEY
D: Back away... give me some elbow room.
N: BB and Tilley both take up fighting stances and circle one another looking to take a shot. A police car pulls into the lot. The sound of the tires on the gravel catches Moe's attention and he sees it's the police.
C: MOE
D: Police! Tilley and BB immediately drop their guards and lean against a car. One cop gets out of the police car and heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the car. No one knows quite what to do since the policeman is so nearby.
E: quietly to BB and Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: You're a lucky man... the police showed.
E: casually leaning against the car; to BB
C: BB
D: We'll see who's the lucky one. He picks up his coat and leaves with Moe. CUT TO:
S: INT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE - TIGHT SHOT OF LARGE CAKE
N: with lit candles on it. The cake reads "FAREWELL ADA."
C: ANGLE ON CAKE
D: as it passes row upon row of SECRETARIES typing in the Social Security office.
N: All of a sudden everything goes black, the typewriters stop and all we can see are the lit candles. We hear a huge chorus from all of the Secretaries in the Social Security office:
C: SECRETARIES
D: Surprise!!! Lights go on again, and we see a group of GIRLS gathered around the cake placed on one of the desks. At the center of the group is ADA, in her late twenties, and very pregnant.
E: O.S.
C: ADA
D: I never expected this. What a lovely cake. GIRL #1 Blow out the candles then. Ada blows out the candles, missing a couple, and getting help from one of the other Girls. GIRL #2 Nine candles for nine months! Everyone laughs. GIRL #3 We'll miss you, Ada... you'd better bring that baby in to visit us. GIRL #1 Register him for his social security number.
N: A couple of girls hand around glasses of Coca-Cola. Nora stands in the midst of the girls, pleased for Ada. She yells out.
C: NORA
D: I love ya, Ada, and if you're smart you won't come back. The cake is being passed out, and people are talking -- it has become somewhat of a party atmosphere. Nora turns to her friend, NELLIE.
C: NORA
D: I've just decided... I'm going out with him.
C: NELLIE
D: You're kidding?
C: NORA
D: I have to. I just want to know what it's like to be with someone else. She sips her Coke.
C: NORA
D: Because if what I've got with Tilley is as good as it gets, I just... ... I gotta know.
E: she shrugs her shoulders
C: NELLIE
D: Well, how are you going to manage it?
C: NORA
D: Tilley doesn't get home until at least two in the morning.
C: NELLIE
D: I hope you know what you're doing ... you speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes, you could jeopardize your whole marriage.
C: NORA
D: Everything I've done in my life has been safe and practical, and where's that gotten me? Well, here's to who knows what. They touch their cups. CUT TO:
E: she lifts her paper cup
S: INT. BB'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
N: This is a two-story apartment in a renovated building. It has high ceilings and exposed brick. It is sparsely- furnished, but what there is is decent-looking. We see Nora and BB dancing closely in the shadows of the dark- ened room. A Frank Sinatra record is playing on the RECORD PLAYER in the b.g. -- it is "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING." A bottle of wine is on the coffee table. The remains of Chinese food in containers are alongside.
C: NORA
D: I'm still nervous.
C: BB
D: Well, I guess that's to be expected. You want me to take you home?
C: NORA
D: No, not right now.
N: They dance quietly for a moment.
C: BB
D: Every time I listen to Sinatra, I always remember when I used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40's... you know, a busboy job... Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club, and we used to take our dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna go and hear Sinatra?' Then we'd just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music. I think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown. Nora laughs.
C: NORA
D: I'd go with you and lean against the door. They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the RECORD STICKS on the words "that's the time"... "that's the time"... "that's the time"... BB slips off one of his loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it hits the side of the record table. The RECORD SLIPS a little and continues to play correctly.
C: NORA
D: You've got a pretty good aim.
E: she looks at BB
C: BB
D: I sure do. CUT TO:
S: INT. BB'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

N: TELEPHONE RINGS at the bar, the BARMAN picks it up.

E: into phone
N: The Barman calls over to Tilley who we see sitting at a table with some of the other tin men.
C: BARMAN
D: Hey, Tilley, somebody wants ya on the phone. Tilley gets up from the table and goes over to the phone.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, this is Tilley... CUT TO:

N: Tilley on phone.
C: TILLEY
D: Well, that's just fine by me... she's a pain in the ass... an albatross around my neck. You're welcome to her... keep her... and may you both rot in hell! Tilley slams the phone down. CUT TO:
S: INT. LIVING ROOM
N: BB puts the phone down -- looks puzzled.
C: BB
D: Is this a setup? That son of a bitch... I bet he set me up... I thought I got him, and he got me. That son of a bitch! CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Tilley pulls up in his car in front of his house. He runs up the front steps.
S: INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE
N: He opens the door, flips on the lights and looks around. He races upstairs and starts rifling through the closet and drawers, pulling out Nora's clothes -- her dresses, skirts, blouses, and coats -- and he opens the window wide and throws them out. He screams as he tosses underwear and the rest of her clothes.
C: TILLEY
D: I'm a free man! I'm a free man! He grabs Nora's shoes and throws them out onto the street. Then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of her toiletries in his arms, tosses them into a trash can. Takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom, opens it, throws in the trash can. He clears out her underwear drawers and empties them into the suitcase, closes the suitcase and then throws that out of the window. He's out of breath, exhausted and sweating. He goes down- stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink. He sees a pair of Nora's slippers under the kitchen table, he picks them up, opens the back door and tosses them outside. Locks the door. He stands there as if a motor is running inside of him. Walks out of the kitchen.
S: EXT. TILLEY'S HOUSE
N: He exits the house, gets into his car and drives away.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Tilley is driving. The same Sinatra record "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING" is playing on the car RADIO. Tilley does his now familiar neck exercises to relieve tension. He's hard to read... a mixture of happiness and sadness.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DINER - NIGHT
N: THROUGH the window of the diner we see Tilley sitting alone at a table drinking a cup of coffee. The Sinatra record "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING" plays over this.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Nora is getting out of her car in front of her house. She starts to walk toward the house and stops as she sees her clothing, shoes, etc. scattered all over the lawn. She tries to take in the scene -- coats are lying on hedges, underwear on the flower beds... she's shocked.
C: NORA
D: Oh, my God! She just stands there and tears run down her face.
E: quietly
C: LONG WIDE SHOT
D: of Nora's BACK TO the CAMERA, with all her possessions strewn over the front garden of her house. CUT TO:
S: EXT. BB'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
N: Nora is standing at the door with her suitcase in hand. BB is at the door.
C: NORA
D: He must have gone crazy... I don't know what happened to him... he must have found out I was with you... I don't know... I don't know what to do. She starts to cry. She goes to hug BB.
C: NORA
D: Can I stay with you for a day or two? BB puts his arms around Nora.
C: BB
D: Sure. CUT TO:
S: INT. POOL HALL - LONG SHOT - DAY
N: of a nearly empty pool hall. One guy plays alone in the far corner of the room. Tilley comes down the stairs of the pool hall and starts to walk toward the back rooms -- CAMERA FOLLOWS him. He opens the door and goes through.
S: INT. GIBRALTAR ALUMINUM SIDING COMPANY
N: CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW him INTO the offices of Gibraltar Aluminum Siding Company. We PASS BY THREE GIRLS on telephones -- they are solicit- ing jobs for the salesmen. CAMERA GOES FROM one Girl TO the other. GIRL #1 Hello, this is Gibraltar Aluminum Siding Company, we're taking a survey... GIRL #2 ... Would you be interested in our field representative giving you a home demonstration? GIRL #3 ... Home demonstration. We will have some factory representatives in your area today as it happens. A voice calls out.
C: VOICE
D: Tilley! Let me see you. Tilley walks over to the coffee machine.
E: O.S.
C: TILLEY
D: Wing, give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here. Tilley passes Sam on the way to the coffee machine. Sam is looking through the sports page of the newspaper, along with Mouse and Gil.
C: SAM
D: What about 'Super Highway' in the seventh... it's paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race. Gil looking at the newspaper.
C: GIL
D: 'Super Highway'...
C: TILLEY
D: Four in the fourth... twenty bucks.
C: SAM
D: Who's that?
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know... it just came to me -- number four in the fourth.
C: SAM
D: Number four in the fourth -- 'Rider's Revenge' -- 60 to 1, never been in the money. Nice pick, Tilley. Why don't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now.
E: looking at Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: 'Rider's Revenge'... I like that name. I've gotta go and see Wing. Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday, but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one. Tilley goes through the door into Wing's office.
E: a little pissed off
S: INT. WING'S OFFICE
N: His office is equally messy and thrown together as everything else in the Gibraltar offices. As Tilley closes the door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his cup, spills over the top and starts to burn his hand.
C: TILLEY
D: Ah! Ah! He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket.
C: TILLEY
D: What's up, Wing?
N: Wing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with papers.
C: WING
D: You lost a sale, Tilley. The Hudsons' loan didn't go through.
C: TILLEY
D: What do ya mean? They wouldn't clear the loan?
C: WING
D: This Mr. Hudson's some guy. He's got three outstanding shoplifting charges, failure to pay child support from a previous marriage ... guy's overdue on his mortgage, overdue on his car loan, and he was fired from his last job for misappropriation of funds.
C: TILLEY
D: What's wrong with this world? There are sick people out there! Thievin' son of a bitch like that takes up my time... cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with other people interested in my wares! There's no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country.
C: WING
D: They don't make our job easy, Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: Wing, it was such a beautiful thing... you shoulda seen how I worked. Like a magician... 'this job is free'! It was my best... my best! There's no fucking justice in this world... there ain't no justice. Tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk.
E: lamenting
C: WING
D: Did you see the paper?
C: TILLEY
D: What section?
C: WING
D: Take a look at this. He hands the newspaper to Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: 'Home Improvement Commission... Hearings begin today..." Is this McCarthyism? What are they gonna see? If there are any communists?
E: reading
C: WING
D: Just cool down the scams, okay, Tilley? Tilley shrugs his shoulders. CUT TO:
S: INT. CONVERTED TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: An area has been set up for hearings to take place. This seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub- stantial can be worked out. There are boxes and crates all over. There's a long table with a number of commis- sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way across the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the sound BOOMS -- ECHOING off the walls. A small gallery of people are watching the proceedings.
C: ANGLE ON JOHN MASTERS
D: who is presiding over the hearings. Even though he wears a tie and a vest, he is nonetheless very sloppily dressed. To his left and right are two other home improvement commissioners.
C: MASTERS
D: Now, when you made your initial sales pitch, did you indicate that you would be giving free storm windows with the job?
N: ANGLE ON MURRAY BANKS A typical aluminum sidings salesman, in his early 40's. He leans into the microphone.
C: MURRAY
D: Free storm windows?
C: MASTERS
D: Yes. That you would provide a free set of storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding.
C: MURRAY
D: No, sir. I wouldn't be able to make any money if I was giving away storm windows. My cost of a storm window is somewhere like...
C: MASTERS
D: The point being that you had no intention of giving away the storm windows.
E: cutting him off
N: ANGLE ON BB AND MOE Standing by the door at the back of the warehouse.
C: MURRAY
D: The storm windows, as I can recall, was not an issue. I mentioned that I thought the storm windows would cut down on their heating bill, and that they would obviously enhance the look of the house with the aluminum siding work we were going to do.
E: O.S.
C: MASTERS
D: So, you weren't dangling a free set of storm windows as a come-on to selling them the aluminum siding job? Because it says here, and I'm reading from a statement from Mr. Tabaleri...
E: O.S.
C: MOE
D: What do ya make of all this?
E: to BB
C: BB
D: It's the future, Moe... it's the future.
C: MASTERS
D: 'It was my understanding that the storm windows were included in the price of the sale.' CUT TO:
E: O.S.
S: EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Moe and BB are walking away from the warehouse toward BB's car... AWAY FROM CAMERA.
C: MOE
D: Where do you think they're getting this information from?
C: BB
D: I dunno... looks like any tin man gets in that hot seat, then he's had it.
C: MOE
D: Then they can take your license forever... it don't seem fair. They walk by a Volkswagen "beetle" car that's parked in front of BB's Cadillac. BB stops and looks at it.
C: BB
D: Boy, I tell ya, I bet you could sell a ton of these things.
C: MOE
D: That? Too silly-looking. BB looks at the car for a few more seconds, then goes to get into his car.
C: BB
D: Ever see a dealership?
C: MOE
D: No.
C: BB
D: Interesting. They get in the car and drive off. CUT TO:

S: INT. TURF CLUB AT RACE TRACK - ANGLE ON SAM AND TILLEY
N: - DAY Sitting at a table. Sam is studying the racing form, Tilley is studying the menu.
C: TILLEY
D: I keep racking my brain. I gotta find a way to really get even with this guy. It isn't enough to wreck his car... even breaking into his house and messing it up or something, that don't have enough impact. I mean, the man poked my wife! I gotta come up with something ingenious... something ingenious. Sam sees a WAITER approaching and indicates to Tilley to get off the subject. Waiter arrives at their table.
C: SAM
D: So, what do ya think?
E: to Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: I think I'll take some meatloaf.
C: WAITER
D: Meatloaf.
E: writes on check
C: TILLEY
D: No, I think I'll have some fish. No, no... fish doesn't fill you up. Meatloaf. He closes the menu.
C: WAITER
D: So, it's meatloaf?
C: SAM
D: What do you think, 'Sally's pride' in the second? Get me a Bloody Mary.
E: to Tilley to Waiter
C: WAITER
D: Anything other than the Bloody Mary?
E: to Sam
C: TILLEY
D: What number is Sally's Pride?
E: to Sam
C: SAM
D: Six. No, I don't like to eat until the third race. Waiter walks off.
E: to Waiter
C: TILLEY
D: Six... six... six... six. I'm thinking one. Whose one?
E: putting his hand to his forehead beat
C: SAM
D: Mr. Motor.
C: TILLEY
D: Then that's it, I'm going with one.
C: SAM
D: Tilley, this is insane. You're picking horses because you think you're clairvoyant or something.
C: TILLEY
D: Sam, I'm not doing too well by checking the stats, so why not. I put my hand to my forehead, I see a one -- Mr. Motor in the second... twenty bucks. They both look toward the track, the horses race to the finish line. Number nine streaks across the finish line.
C: SAM
D: Hallihan's Daughter.
C: TILLEY
D: I got it... I got it... He picks up the racing form.
E: laughing
C: TILLEY
D: Three to one... hundred and sixty smackers. Hand to the forehead! Hand to the forehead!
E: laughs
C: SAM
D: You're not exactly talking about a long shot. Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1. Tilley taps his forehead, with his eyes closed.
C: TILLEY
D: Third race, I see a six... I see a three. I don't think the verdict's in on that one yet. Tilley stands up and is going through his money and race tickets.
C: TILLEY
D: Wing paid a hundred on number five, he loses, I got hundred and forty... next race I'll lay down the bet. What you taking in this race?
E: beat
C: SAM
D: Thrifty's Delight -- number four -- 20 bucks.
C: TILLEY
D: You take Thrifty's Delight -- 20 bucks, I got 20 on Mr. Motor, Wing's got a hundred on Night Fire. What's the odds on Night Fire?
C: SAM
D: Twenty to one.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't see Night Fire winning. Fuck it, I'm not gonna even place the bet... I just made a hundred bucks.
C: SAM
D: What are you, crazy? What happens if he wins?
C: TILLEY
D: He's not gonna win... I feel it.
N: Tilley heads towards the betting booths. Wing enters near the booths, Tilley yells to him.
C: TILLEY
D: Hey, Wing, we're sitting just off the left of the entrance. I'm gonna lay down your bet right now. See you in a minute. You lost the first race, in case you don't know. CUT TO:

C: MOE
D: Who, Nora?
C: BB
D: Yeah, yeah... who else is it gonna be... 'who, Nora"!... who else is there? The whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me. It's one thing when they're with you for a night, but when they live with ya, it's stretching the point. They got a lot of things they bring with them... you go to the bathroom you see 'things' you never saw before.
E: beat
C: MOE
D: So, what's the todo?
C: BB
D: Well, they move your stuff around and it's not where it used to be... I'm not used to that.
C: MOE
D: You mean all this time you've never lived with a girl?
C: BB
D: What?! Did we just meet? How long we been partners? No, I've never lived with a girl!
C: MOE
D: Boy, oh boy! Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?
C: BB
D: Yes, I did. I came in last night, she was sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I never got out of bed on the left side... in my life, never from the left. I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this girl, Dorian. For a week we were together, but it wasn't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff. She didn't have things in my room.
E: beat; he looks out of the car window
N: BB gives a big sigh.
C: BB
D: All this 'cos I'm trying to get even with some guy. You know what? I think I got to see her and put an end to this. CUT TO:
E: beat
S: INT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
N: We see hundreds of secretaries typing away, and clerks sitting at desks. BB walks into the office, peeking his head around the corner, feeling a little uncomfortable. He starts to walk around trying to find Nora out of all the secretaries and clerks.
C: ANGLE ON NELLIE
D: Nora's friend. She looks up from the typewriter and sees BB. In his thick overcoat, huddled up, he seems a little lost, and it's obvious that he's looking for someone.
C: NELLIE
D: Is that him?
E: calling across to Nora at the next desk
C: NORA
D: Yes. Bill! BB turns towards Nora. Nora waves to him, happily, with a twinkle in her eye. BB feels conspicuous -- people are looking at him. He gives a little wave.
E: looks up and and BB wandering around she smiles and yells

C: TILLEY
D: You won, Wing... you won, it's just that you're not getting any money... it was a fluke. I swear, I don't know how it could have happened. A ten-year-old couldn't have made the mistake I made... I don't know, I swear.
C: WING
D: What the fuck is he talking about?
E: to Sam
C: TILLEY
D: If there was some way I could make it up, believe me, I would, because you know where I stand. There's a beat while Wing just looks at Tilley.
C: TILLEY
D: You know where I stand, Wing. If there was any way, believe me, I'd make it up. I'd give you thirty percent of what you didn't get because it was a fluke... I'm willing to make some kind of retribution.
C: WING
D: You just pocketed the God damned money... you just took my money and slipped it into your God damned pocket, didn't you?

C: WING
D: You work with him, Sam... for Christ sake... Wing is totally frustrated.
C: TILLEY
D: What do you mean, wrong? It was a fluke... it was an accident. I don't know what the hell went wrong. It was a one-in-a-million thing that happened to me when I went to place that bet. I'm trying to do what I can.

C: SAM
D: Yeah.
C: TILLEY
D: It's like some guy trying to sell me life insurance. You think I'm gonna take some money out of my pocket to give to some jerk so that somebody can take it when I'm dead? No, Sam, you gotta live for today. I'm gonna live as good as I can every day. You know what I'm saying?

E: laughing beat
C: BB
D: Who's your accountant, mister, 'cos I think you're down in the debit side.
C: TILLEY
D: Who's stuck with my wife. You or me? He laughs.
C: BB
D: You want me to believe that you were setting me up with your wife as some kind of decoy?
C: TILLEY
D: Decoy is the word! There's a long beat as the two guys eye one another. Then, almost in a soft apologetic manner, BB speaks.
C: BB
D: Okay then, you win. BB gets into his car.
C: TILLEY
D: I win? That guy would never let me win. He must be setting me up. The son of a bitch is setting me up, Sam.
E: to Sam
C: SAM
D: For crying out loud, why don't you just leave it at that... you win.

D: This is good, Stan... nice work. Stanley nods.
C: MASTERS
D: Fossey says it should go down very well with the city council. Could help us appropriate more funds. This goes a long way to establish our credibility in what we're trying to do. We hear a LOUD, SAWING noise and HAMMERING echoing through the warehouse throughout this scene.
C: STANLEY
D: There's a lot more where this came from.
C: MASTERS
D: You know what I think you should do now. Why don't you pull some files... some files that were completed, others that went unsold, and I'll have somebody run it down, talk to the customers and get some statements.

C: TILLEY
D: We've got to appear?
C: SAM
D: I think that's the gist of what they're saying. Gil looks over Tilley's shoulder at the letter. Mouse comes over.

What the hell's going on here? I'm just this guy. What's the big deal? They can't get along without me? The government can't operate unless they've got Tilley's money... the Commission's after my job! This shit's driving me insane! All the lying, thieving, stealing corporations in this world, and the IRS takes the time to come for me?

D: I don't know why they're so irrational... chicks. I dunno. I think it's because air gets inside 'em. She probably went back home, to her husband. Eleven-thirty... he wouldn't be home yet. This outght to cover it, Stanley. He puts the $10 bill down on the bar and walks out of the club. CUT TO:
E: beat looks at his watch takes out a $10 bill from his wallet
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Sam's Cadillac moving along a row of houses.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
N: Sam is driving the car, Tilley is in the passenger seat, very drunk.
C: TILLEY
D: They got no right. You know what I'm saying, Sam? They've got no right. Tilley takes a drink from a pint of whisky he has open.
C: SAM
D: They've got nothing concrete against us, because if it's just hearsay stuff, it's neither here nor there.
C: TILLEY
D: Where's my car? What happened to my car?
E: looking around
C: SAM
D: It's better I drop you off.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, it's better. CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Tilley is in the bathroom washing his face in the sink, trying to sober up. He lifts his head out of the water and bangs it on the faucet. He grabs his head in pain and then slides down the tiled wall to the floor.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: BB's Cadillac pulls up in front of Tilley's house. We see BB looking up and down the street, with his head out of the car window. He's very drunk.
C: BB
D: He ain't here. He gets out of the car and looks around the street some more. He stumbles up to a couple of parked cars, look- ing for Nora's car. He falls into some trash cans in front of the house. CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
N: Tilley is lying on the floor. His eyes open at the sound of the TRASH CANS FALLING. He struggles to his feet and walks through the bedroom. We hear the sound of MORE TRASH CANS RATTLING. Tilley goes to the bedroom window and looks out. He sees BB struggling to his feet, surrounded by trash cans and garbage.
C: TILLEY
D: I knew I could smell a rat! The son of a bitch is coming for me... the son of a bitch never wants to leave me alone! Tilley walks over to the night table, opens the drawer and pulls out a revolver. CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: BB making his way up the front stairs to Tilley's house.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Tilley makes his way down the stairs, and creeps to the front door.
C: TILLEY
D: You want to rob my God damn house? I'm gonna make it easy for you. Come and rob Tilley... come on... take everything he's got. CUT TO:
E: quietly unlocks the door and leaves it ajar
S: EXT. FRONT DOOR OF TILLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: BB knocks on the door. The door swings open. He waits a moment, unsure as to what to do.
T: CUT TO:
S: 11436 INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - OTHER SIDE OF FRONT DOOR 114
N: Tilley stands behind the door with the gun, waiting. BB steps inside the house.
C: BB
D: Hel... Before he can finish the word "Hello," Tilley hits him hard in the head with the butt of the gun. BB falls to the ground unconscious. CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLY'S HOUSE
N: BLACK SCREEN. Then a light goes on, and we see the in- side of a refrigerator. PULL BACK to reveal Tilley at the refrigerator in the kitchen of his home. He is putting eggs and rotten tomatoes from the refrigerator into a bowl. He looks at a piece of celery, but it's so wilted and has no strength for his purpose that he throws it down. He picks up other vegetables, but settles for the eggs and tomatoes. He closes the re- frigerator door and makes his way to the living room. We see BB lying on the floor, unconscious. Tilley sits down across from him with the bowl in his lap... he watches BB. BB starts to come to.
C: TILLEY
D: You're a sick man! You smash my car, you steal my wife, and now you come to rob me! You're one demented human being. BB tries to focus on Tilley.
E: to BB
C: TILLEY
D: I'm going to call the police and send you to jail... but I'm going to humiliate you first. Tilley throws an egg at BB and hits him in the head. BB is groggy and confused and still drunk.
C: BB
D: What're you doing?
C: TILLEY
D: What do ya want to break into my house for? This ain't the fucking Rockefeller mansion! There ain't thirty-eight television sets here.
E: MORE
C: TILLEY
D: They ain't saying 'Nelson, I think we've had a break-in... count the sets to see how many we've got left.' There ain't tons of jewelry hanging out of drawers... it ain't like I don't know which watch to put on, I got so many. I'm a working man, trying to make an honest living. What fucking morality you got, asshole?!! Tilley throws another egg at BB and hits him in the head again. Egg yolk drips down BB's face. He tries to get off the floor, but can't.
E: CONT'D
C: BB
D: You're the craziest human being on the face of this earth! Tilley, getting ready with another egg.
C: TILLEY
D: What else do you want from me? Huh? What else?! I've got enough problems with the I.R.S. busting my balls and the Home Improvement Commission bullshit to contend with. I don't need aggravation from you.
C: BB
D: Nobody does this to me and lives! Nobody!
E: still trying to get up; wiping his face
C: TILLEY
D: How do ya like your eggs? Over easy? Side of tomatoes? He throws a tomato.
E: throws an egg picks up a tomato
C: BB
D: You're going to rue the day you ran into my car. This ain't the end... this is just the beginning. Tilley throws another egg. CUT TO:
S: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
N: A POLICE OFFICER is interrogating Tilley behind the main desk of the police station. There's a lot of activity during this interaction... people coming and going.
C: TILLEY
D: A guy breaks into my house and I'm being charged with assault? It makes no sense...
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Let's get it down right. The guy broke into your house, you hit him in the head with a gun, went to the refrigerator, took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him.
E: with pencil and paper
C: TILLEY
D: I was defending myself... he was stealing from me.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: It doesn't sound like defense to me.
C: TILLEY
D: I wanted to humiliate the guy. Here I am, out busting my ass all day making a decent living, I come home, and some schmuck is trying to steal from me.
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: So you hit him with a gun, and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes?
C: TILLEY
D: If I had some soup I would have thrown soup at him... is there any law you can't throw eggs?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Mr. Babowski claims he didn't break into your house.
C: TILLEY
D: What did I do? Invite him in so that I could throw eggs at him?
C: POLICE OFFICER
D: Maybe Mr. Babowski intended to break into your house, but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into. Tilley shrugs his shoulders.
C: TILLEY
D: He's lucky that he didn't rob me last week, 'cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge... I could have thrown barley soup, pumpkin pie, candied yams... yeah, he got off light. CUT TO:
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Tilley and Sam exit the building. Seconds later BB and Bagel come out of the police station. Both pair of men head for their respective Cadillacs. BB has egg stains all over his suit.
C: BB
D: I can't believe it, the man throws eggs at me and now I'm gonna have breakfast with him.
E: to Bagel
C: BAGEL
D: His partner says maybe the two of you can sit down and come to some kind of settlement. CUT TO:
S: INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY
N: Tilley is sitting in the driver's seat and Sam is next to him.
C: TILLEY
D: What am I supposed to say to him? The man has been a pain in the ass since the day he rammed into my car.
C: SAM
D: Just air your differences and we'll put an end to this. CUT TO:
S: EXT. POLICE STATION - LONG SHOT OF POLICE STATION AND
C: TWO CADILLACS
D: as they start to pull out of the parking lot. CUT TO:
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
N: Tilley, Sam, BB and Bagel are sitting at a table together looking at menus.
C: BB
D: I tell you what... I'll drop the charges against you, and we can wipe the slate clean.
E: looks up from his menu
C: TILLEY
D: I appreciate it.
C: SAM
D: See how quickly you can clear it up?
C: TILLEY
D: But I don't understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he breaks into my house and I'm the one charged.
C: BB
D: I told you, I wasn't breaking into your house. I was looking for your wife.
C: TILLEY
D: All right... all right... I'm too tired... the slate's clean... the slate's clean. The WAITRESS approaches.
C: WAITRESS
D: What will you have?
C: TILLEY
D: Couple of eggs over, some hash browns, some toast -- toasted dark... butter on the side, large grapefruit juice and some coffee. The Waitress writes his order.
C: TILLEY
D: On second thought, instead of the eggs over, if I ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells? We can see that BB is getting a little irritable.
C: WAITRESS
D: We leave them in the shell.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it's hard to scoop the stuff out... it's not good... and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn't taste good.
C: BB
D: Why don't you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it... all right?
C: TILLEY
D: If I'm going to order, at least I ought to be content with my food.
C: BB
D: I'm getting a little hungry... I've got a headache as it is. Just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in.
C: TILLEY
D: Why do I need a guy telling me what I should or shouldn't eat?
E: looks to Sam
C: BB
D: This is not a four-star restaurant ... we're not having a gourmet meal... we're ordering breakfast, for Christ sake!
C: TILLEY
D: It so happens I haven't been to this restaurant before. I don't know how they do their eggs... if they're over easy and they're gooey, I'm not happy with it... and I'm not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell...
C: BB
D: Can I have some French toast and a cup of coffee? Bagel, what do you want?
E: to Waitress, cutting Tilley off to Bagel
C: TILLEY
D: Hey! I'm ordering here. At least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast.
C: BB
D: French toast and a cup of coffee.
E: to Waitress; ignoring Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: Sam, this guy gets on my nerves... from day one! I knew it then and I know it now. Tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave.
E: to Sam
C: BB
D: I'm back to pressing charges against you! Tilley turns and is face-to-face with BB.
C: TILLEY
D: You want to play that way? This game ain't over, mister... it ain't over...
N: BB stands up. The Waitress steps back and looks concerned.
C: BB
D: All right, you want to finish it now? You want to finish it right now? I'm ready... I'm ready now!
C: TILLEY
D: You're ready?! You're ready, that's what you're saying?! You're ready now?! I have to be intimidated... I have to be brought here to be intimidated...
C: BB
D: I can't stand it any longer. You're driving me out of my mind. BB lunges for Tilley across the table, Sam and Bagel try to intervene -- the Waitress doesn't know what to do.
C: BAGEL
D: Come on, guys... take it easy... take it easy.
C: TILLEY
D: Get the people with the straitjackets... this man is out of control. Tilley and BB pull at one another.
C: BB
D: We're gonna finish it... we're gonna finish it.
N: Bagel and Sam pull them apart.
C: SAM
D: Come on, let's get out of here. Sam ushers Tilley to the door.
E: to Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: I'm not finished with him, Sam. You heard me... I'm not finished with you, mister.
E: to BB
N: He storms out of the coffee shop with Sam. Bagel sits back, looking relieved. BB composes himself. The Waitress nervously stands by.
C: BB
D: So, I'm having French toast and coffee. Bagel? CUT TO:
E: to Waitress to Bagel
S: INT. HOSPITAL - MOE'S ROOM - DAY
N: Moe is in bed, still hooked up to tubes. His breathing is deliberate and he seems weak. The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS TO BB who is sitting by Moe's side.
C: BB
D: Moe, when you decided to marry May, how did you know?
C: MOE
D: Know what?
C: BB
D: How did ya know?
C: MOE
D: You mean to make up my mind to marry her?
C: BB
D: Yeah. How did ya know?
N: Moe shrugs his shoulders as if he doesn't know.
C: BB
D: This Nora is a pain in the ass, Moe... a pain in the ass. It's worse now than when she used to be around. Moe smiles.
E: suddenly angry
C: BB
D: You wanna hear something? The other night at the Corral Club, I turned down a dance.
C: MOE
D: You turned down a dance?
C: BB
D: What's the odds on that? You think you can come up with odds on that one?
C: MOE
D: Hundred to one BB don't dance... a hundred to one against. There's a beat.
C: MOE
D: I'm getting out of the business, BB... I've got nothing for all this.
C: BB
D: Lot of good times, Moe.
C: MOE
D: A lot of good times, but I can't live off the good times. You know, my brother-in-law has offered me a job at Hess Shoes. I think maybe I should do it. You get there in the morning, you come home at night... you get health benefits... I get to be assistant manager.
E: beat
C: BB
D: That's it, Moe? You're gonna spend the day measuring people's feet? 'You're an "E" fit... you're a "D" wide... you got a high arch... I'll show you something in an alligator... something with a wing tip...' How can you talk about that all day long? Moe, you're the best tin man there ever was. Nobody's a better closer.
E: beat
C: MOE
D: It's over, BB... it's over.
N: BB looks at Moe for a long beat. He's obviously greatly affected by this.
C: BB
D: So, May's happy about this Hess Shoe thing, heh?
C: MOE
D: To say the least. CUT TO:
S: INT. SAM'S CADILLAC - DAY
N: Sam is driving and Tilley is in the passenger seat.
C: SAM
D: You know, when I saw 'Bonanza' the other day, something occurred to me. There's those three guys living on the Ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. You never hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and say 'I had such a hard-on when I woke up this morning.' You know ... they never talk about broads ... nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say 'Hey, Hoss, I went into Virginia City and saw a girl with the greatest ass I ever saw in my life.' Ya just see 'em walking around the Ponderosa saying, 'Yes, Pa,' and 'Where's Little Joe?' Nothing about broads. I don't think I'm being too picky... at least once if they talked about getting horny. I don't care if you're living on the Ponderosa or right here in Baltimore, guys talk about getting laid. I'm beginning to think that show doesn't have too much realism. What do you think, Tilley?
E: beat
C: TILLEY
D: Sam, I can't concentrate on 'Bonanza' shit...
E: MORE
C: TILLEY
D: I've got too much on my brain, what with that asshole and the Home Improvement Commission, I don't want to have to worry about whether Little Joe got laid last night. Let's go and eat something.
E: CONT'D beat
C: SAM
D: Yeah, we'll go and have some lunch at the smorgasbord. CUT TO:
S: INT. THOR'S SMORGASBORD RESTAURANT - DAY
N: Tilley and Sam are in line at the buffet. Sam fills up his tray and moves off to the cashier. Tilley hangs behind staring at all the food. He looks up to the ceiling.
C: TILLEY
D: God, if you're responsible for all the stuff down here, maybe you got a moment's attention for me. Between the I.R.S., this Home Improvement Commission and Mr. Marengay, I got it up to here with this bullshit. To be frank with you, I'm in the toilet here. If you can see your way...
E: very quietly beat
N: A WOMAN with a tray starts to approach Tilley. Tilley turns to her.
C: TILLEY
D: Listen, I'm praying here... go around.
C: WOMAN
D: I wanted to get some of the salad.
C: TILLEY
D: It's out of order... go around. He signals for her to walk around him. The Woman looks at him and moves down the line.
C: TILLEY
D: Do what you can, all right? I appreciate it. Amen. Tilley helps himself to some salad. CUT TO:
E: looking up to ceiling
S: INT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING OFFICE - DAY
N: The usual office activity. BB is at a desk. He picks up the phone and dials.
C: BB
D: Nora Tilley, please. We hear a WOMAN'S VOICE on the other end of the phone.
C: WOMAN
D: What department is she with?
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: She's with Social Security.
C: WOMAN
D: Which department is Social Security?
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: I dunno... she's there somewhere ... yeah, on the third floor... she's got a desk towards the back.
C: WOMAN
D: Just a moment... checking.
E: V.O.
C: ANOTHER ANGLE
D: In the b.g. Stanley has gone over to a filing cabinet and is starting to look through the files. Cheese wanders over to him.
C: CHEESE
D: Stanley, can I help you look for something?
C: STANLEY
D: No, I'm just making myself busy.
C: CHEESE
D: Well, I wouldn't do that. Bagel don't like nobody looking at the files.
C: BACK TO BB
D: on phone. He's still holding for Nora. We hear a RING on the other end of the phone.
C: NORA
D: Mrs. Tilley.
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: Nora, this is BB. The PHONE goes DEAD. BB reluctantly puts the receiver down. CUT TO:
S: INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: The Home Improvement Commission is in session. Tilley and Sam sit at the defense table. Masters presides over the commission table where four or five other commis- sioners sit.
C: MASTERS
D: Didn't you approach Mr. Boloshevski August 18, 1961, while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected, as one of only 16 homes in the state of Maryland, for a free aluminum siding job?
E: into microphone to Tilley & Sam
C: TILLEY
D: What's the name again?
C: MASTERS
D: Boloshevski.
C: TILLEY
D: Doesn't ring a bell. Sam, does it ring a bell to you?
E: to Sam
C: SAM
D: It doesn't ring a bell to me either, sir.
E: leans into microphone
C: MASTERS
D: Didn't you suggest that for a nominal labor charge, he would receive over five thousand dollars' worth of aluminum siding?
C: TILLEY
D: That's an awful lot for nothing. Doesn't sound like good business to me.
C: MASTERS
D: Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately charged twenty-four hundred dollars for labor, which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job.
C: SAM
D: I don't get the point of this.
E: leans into the microphone
C: MASTERS
D: Twenty-four hundred dollars that you charged for labor, is the same as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done.
C: TILLEY
D: Maybe I'm missing the point here, but if he paid twenty-four hundred, which is the cost of the job, I can't see anything wrong with that. I don't know the guy, but I don't quite get the problem.
C: MASTERS
D: What we're getting at here... what we're trying to stress, is that the job was sold under false terms. The man didn't win any award... he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price. A clear case of deception was involved here.
C: TILLEY
D: What's he talking about? The man got the job for twenty-four hundred dollars, and that's what it costs in aluminum siding.
E: to Sam MORE
C: TILLEY
D: Um... I don't know... we have no recollection of this particular job, but I don't know if this is deception. Look, if you work in a clothing store, some guy tries on a suit, it looks like shit, but you tell him it looks wonderful. The guy's standing there looking like a sack of shit, the salesman says what a great suit and the man buys it. That's deception as far as I can see, but I don't understand the deceptiveness that you say we're responsible for... if I make myself clear.
E: CONT'D leans into microphone
C: SAM
D: I'd go along with that as well.
E: leaning into the microphone
C: MASTERS
D: What we're trying to establish are the principles that have been laid down as part of the Home Improvement code of ethics... that you cannot mislead someone intentionally, and I think that's the principle that applies to this.
C: TILLEY
D: Did somebody put a gun to this guy's head and make him spend twenty-four hundred dollars? I don't get the point here. I don't know the specifics of this case, not being privy to all the information, but all I can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair job. Another commissioner, BUD DELANEY, takes the microphone.
C: DELANEY
D: Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Rayburn of 156 Aberdeen Avenue, Essex?
E: to Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: I think you'd have to familiarize me.
E: looks to Sam and shrugs his shoulders; then into mike
C: DELANEY
D: The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record. They say, and I quote here, 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding.' Is that true?
E: looking up from paper
C: TILLEY
D: It sounds right.
C: DELANEY
D: Are you aware that, according to the Home Improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives?
C: TILLEY
D: We wanted to be a little more generous, that's all.
E: shrugs his shoulders
C: DELANEY
D: The couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs, as you had promised.
C: SAM
D: We didn't get any leads from them. Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be. It didn't generate the activity that we had hoped.
E: leaning into microphone
C: TILLEY
D: But should a referral turn up in the community, we'd be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead of the hundred and fifty.
E: interrupting
C: MASTERS
D: Excuse us for one moment. He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer. Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on. Masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners. They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the microphone.
E: leaning into microphone
C: MASTERS
D: Thank you very much, gentlemen. Should there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to reserve that right.
C: TILLEY
D: Glad we could be of some service. Tilley and Sam get up from the table and walk out of the building. CUT TO:
E: leans into microphone
S: EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Tilley and Sam are walking toward Tilley's car.
C: TILLEY
D: We beat 'em, Sam... we beat 'em! What a piece of cake! No problem! They ain't got nothing on us... clean as a whistle... we're clean as a whistle!
E: rubbing his hands, gleefully
C: SAM
D: I need a drink. I hate inquisitions. CUT TO:
S: EXT. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Heavy RAIN is falling. Nora, with an umbrella, walks quickly across the parking lot. Suddenly BB slips under the umbrella with her.
C: NORA
D: I don't want to see you anymore. She pulls away from BB and continues walking. BB walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain.
E: reacting sharply
C: BB
D: I gotta talk to you.
C: NORA
D: I don't want to listen.
C: BB
D: Give me a chance to explain. You owe me that much. Nora still walking toward her car in the downpour.
C: NORA
D: I don't owe you anything. BB lets her walk away. After a beat, he yells out.
C: BB
D: It was a lousy thing to do, okay? It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband... but the fact is that I never would have met you otherwise. Nora stops and turns to look at BB.
C: BB
D: It was lousy... it was a disgusting, terrible thing... but a lot of good came out of it.
E: more quietly
C: NORA
D: What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing?
C: BB
D: I'm not always a nice guy, I admit that. I got a lot of training in deceit... it's an occupational hazard. They stand looking at one another in the rain.
C: NORA
D: I'd like to know what it is about me that I have to fall for tin men. What kind of character flaw do I have?
C: BB
D: I didn't want to have to come here. I wish that I didn't have to ever see you again. I've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. I was going through life, sailing along, pretty good... doing okay, and I tried to get even with some crazy guy... and I'm here.
C: NORA
D: The wet becomes you. Gets rid of some of the slickness.
C: BB
D: I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of this, but if this stuff's got to happen, I guess I've got no choice. I wanna... ya know... ... I wanna be with ya! Okay, I said that... I said it, okay?! I wanna be with ya! It pisses the hell out of me, and I'm gonna tell you that to your face, but I want to be with you because... I miss you and I'd like to live with you... I'd like to marry you... and that's that! Nora eyes him carefully. The rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on BB's head. After a long moment.
E: he gets angry
C: NORA
D: I was hoping for something a little more romantic... but, okay. A slight smile comes to BB's face. CUT TO:
S: INT. PIMLICO HOTEL - BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Tilley and Sam are sitting at the bar nursing a couple of drinks. In the b.g., the pianist is playing "Last Night When We Were Young," and a few people are sitting around the piano joining in with the song.
C: SAM
D: Ya know, Tilley, we been working together for over a year.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah, must be about that.
C: SAM
D: I've been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck. Ya know what I mean? I mean, maybe the two of us ain't the right combination.
C: TILLEY
D: I'm just getting used to ya, Sam.
C: SAM
D: Let's face it, we're not exactly setting the world on fire.
C: TILLEY
D: It's a slump... it's a slump, Sam.
C: SAM
D: Maybe it's a slump, but like baseball, some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again.
C: TILLEY
D: You're not serious about this, are you, Sam?
C: SAM
D: Yeah.
C: TILLEY
D: You're serious? You wanna get another partner? You don't think I'm gonna pull out of this?
C: SAM
D: I know you're gonna... I know you're gonna.
C: TILLEY
D: So?
C: SAM
D: Look, we beat the Commission today ... you know, we got a little bit of a victory. We split right now and maybe we can add to that... you know what I'm saying?
C: TILLEY
D: I know... I know. Change in the lineup. Okay, maybe it'll help... maybe it'll help. You got any ideas for a new partner?
E: he drinks his whiskey
C: SAM
D: Well, I had a conversation with Solly Shavitz, so... maybe I'll go with him. Mouse is gonna need a new partner because Dennis is going into used cars.
E: beat

D: I don't get it... the broad smashes into his car and he takes her dancing. Some kind of dating ritual that I'm not familiar with.
C: STANLEY
D: BB's a pretty good tin man, huh?
C: LOONEY
D: Pretty good? Whew! Man's what legends are made of. Started selling pots and pans door to door at sixteen. Nothing he can't sell.
N: ANGLE ON BB AND NORA The song ends and BB walks Nora back to the table they were sitting at.
C: BB
D: You're gonna come back and stay the night?

N: CAMERA PANS to see Nora's car pulling up in front of the house. Nora turns off the car lights and exits the car. She starts up the front walk and stops.
C: NORA
D: What happened?
C: TILLEY
D: The I.R.S... they need my furniture. They got some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished.
C: NORA
D: They're taking the furniture?
C: TILLEY
D: The furniture, the whole house. They locked it up... they confiscated it.
C: NORA
D: What do you expect? You expect to get some preferential treatment ... you're some special case? You've got to pay your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes! Tilley shrugs.
E: yelling up to him on the porch
C: NORA
D: How many arguments did we used to have about filing your taxes?
C: TILLEY
D: We had a lot of arguments. Nora starts toward him. Tilley sits on the steps.
C: NORA
D: There's a responsibility that you've got to have. It's a long way from high school, Tilley.
E: as she sits beside him
C: TILLEY
D: I was doing pretty good there for a while... doing pretty good. Had my house, had a wife, a Cadillac... I still got my Cadillac.
C: NORA
D: Where are you gonna sleep?

D: I'll stay at Sam's for a couple of days until I get set up. What're you doing here, anyway?
E: beat
C: NORA
D: There's just a couple of things you didn't throw out of the house ... a couple of things I didn't find in the drawer.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know... I did a pretty good house cleaning number on you.
C: NORA
D: Listen, about the divorce. Do you want to file, or should I file?
C: TILLEY
D: I got to be frank with you, this guy is nuts.
C: NORA
D: He told me all about it... all about how you threw eggs at him.
C: TILLEY
D: He told you it was about eggs? The guy tried to break into my house. He tried to steal things from me.
C: NORA
D: He was trying to find me. We had an argument.
C: TILLEY
D: I think you'd be making a big mistake if you married him.
C: NORA
D: It's not for you to make decisions for me.

E: cutting him off

D: But this guy is as bad a choice as you could make. Bad choice.
E: interrupting her
C: NORA
D: You're a good one to give advice... you're sitting on the steps, locked out of your house because you can't pay your taxes, and you're going to give me advice on life?
C: TILLEY
D: I'm not giving you a divorce, and that's it. I'm looking out for your welfare. No divorce. Nora looks at him, starts to say something, then stands up and walks down the steps of the house toward her car.
C: TILLEY
D: It's for your own benefit, and you'll thank me for it. Nora turns toward Tilley and suddenly snaps.
E: yelling to her
C: NORA
D: My benefit! You don't give a damn about me! You don't give a damn who I marry. The reason you don't want me to marry is because he's the one taking your wife, and you've got your own problems with him.
E: MORE
C: NORA
D: You don't care about me... it's the same bullshit you're doing. That's what it always is with you, Tilley. It's always you! The I.R.S. took your house... your furniture! You don't say anything about my things in the house. I've got things in the house I worked damn hard for, and things that belonged to my family... the headboard that was given to me by Aunt Josephine, it's got to be at least a hundred years old... and the hand-embroidered footstool...
E: CONT'D
C: TILLEY
D: What footstool?
C: NORA
D: The hand-embroidered footstool over by the TV.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't remember seeing that.
C: NORA
D: It's been there forever... it was my granny's.
C: TILLEY
D: It's been there forever? I've never seen it.
C: NORA
D: You've never seen it!? You've never seen it!? You put your feet on it to watch TV... the hand-embroidered footstool.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't know what you're talking about. I never put my feet up to watch TV.
C: NORA
D: That's the way you are, Tilley, it doesn't mean anything to you. You don't care if they take it all away. It's all you, Tilley! That's the way it's always been.
N: She stands there for a moment, then turns back to her car, gets in, slams the door and drives off. Tilley stands on the front steps with a puzzled look on his face.

C: BB
D: You know something, Stanley, I can always smell a guy who's not made of tin. He walks over to Stanley.
C: BB
D: It's against the law to steal files. I could call and have you arrested and sent to jail, right now.
C: STANLEY
D: I'll put everything back, nobody's the wiser.
C: BB
D: You work for the Commission, is that it? Stan nods "yes."
C: BB
D: Doesn't the Commission have enough information? They got to send out guys like you to spy?
C: STANLEY
D: Well, we just started out, and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot of credibility in the community. BB walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second, grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. Stanley crashes into the filing cabinet.
C: BB
D: You know what your big problem is, Stanley? You're lazy. If you want to find out stuff, then you dig... you get on the phone... you canvas... 'We're from the Home Improvement Commission...' Go find your leads... that's what we do all the time. You're just lazy, Stanley. If we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence. Instead, you snoop around... steal files. What is this? Undercover time? You think you're breaking up some big drug ring? Is this the Mafia you've infiltrated? All you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake! You want some files? He walks over to the filing cabinet, flips through some files and pulls out three files. Stanley has gotten up from the floor. BB throws the files down on the desk.
E: beat

D: Why are you doing this?

D: If it's not gonna be you, it's gonna be somebody else... and if it's not tonight, it's gonna be another time. Stanley exits the office. BB picks up the files that Stanley had taken out of the filing cabinet, and starts to put them back. Then he slams the filing drawers closed very hard. CUT TO:

C: BB
D: Can I talk to you in private, or do I have to talk to you over fourteen pool tables? Tilley moves down the hall toward BB.
C: BB
D: We've got enough that's going down between the two of us, but the fact of the matter is that I love your wife, and I want to marry her.
C: TILLEY
D: I don't care who she marries, but I don't want her marrying you!

D: You ought to hear yourself. You know that? You ought to listen to the way you talk. You come in here, you want to take my wife ... you want to isolate this situation... you want to be rational. I've got no tolerance for you, mister. You know what I'm saying?

E: after a beat

D: I enjoy the game.

N: TIGHT SHOT OF CUE BALL hitting the balls on the break. A seven ball drops into the pocket. CAMERA PANS TO BB who has a smile on his face at the successful break he just made. He quickly moves around the table, lines up a shot and sinks the ball. Tilley looks a little concerned. BB moves around the table quickly, confidently. He lines up another shot. He carefully strokes the pool cue between his fingers, hits the ball, and sinks the shot. He moves around the table -- he has a particularly complicated shot.
C: BB
D: Combination... side pocket. The tin men react. BB hits the ball and sinks it.
C: BB
D: That's four.
N: He quickly surveys the table and sees his next shot. He hits the ball, it goes toward the pocket, but bounces back slightly, missing the pocket. Tilley quickly goes to work. He sinks his first shot... his second. He makes a difficult shot.
C: TILLEY
D: Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Tilley keeps moving around the table, sinking one ball after the other. He's enthusiastic, excited and confi- dent. He sinks another ball, and another. He sinks every ball, then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de grace.

D: You make this one here, and you win.
E: trying to shake Tilley
C: TILLEY
D: Don't I know it... don't I know it! He shoots. The eight ball heads for the pocket and doesn't make it. It hangs up on the felt about two feet from the pocket.
C: BB
D: Bad break. BB quickly goes to work... sinks every one of his balls. He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots, and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket.
C: TILLEY
D: Tough break. Tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball.
C: TILLEY
D: You lose.
C: BB
D: Yeah... that puts an end to one of our differences. Now, concerning you...
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah?
C: BB
D: I'm gonna beat the crap out of you. You want it here or do you want it outside?
C: TILLEY
D: Outside. BB turns his back on Tilley to move toward the door. Tilley swings with all his might and hits BB in the back of the head. BB almost falls to the ground. Tilley goes to hit him again. BB hits him in the face, knocking him back. Tilley falls back... BB starts to move toward him. The tin men move in.
C: TILLEY
D: Stay out of this... this is between the two of us. BB gets to his feet... the two guys eye one another, moving. BB quickly moves with incredible cat-like speed with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on Tilley. He slips on one of the pool cues and falls to the ground.
N: ANGLE ON DOOR TO OFFICE Wing is standing watching the fight. He looks disgusted ... shakes his head. BACK TO TILLEY AND BB Tilley moves toward BB. BB hits him hard in the stomach again. Tilley keeps coming at BB. He rams him and knocks him to the ground. Tilley pushes BB's head onto the ground, trying to hit it against the floor. BB gets a hand free and hits Tilley hard in the side of the head. The tin men have seen enough and jump in and pull Tilley and BB apart. AD LIBS: "That's enough, you guys" ... "Come on, break it up." BB and Tilley stand up. BB brushes his suit down with his hand.

C: NORA
D: How can you be so... how can you not understand how wrong that is? I can't understand that mentality! Shoot pool for me! It's insane. BB dips his toast into his eggs.
E: angry
C: BB
D: Tilley is not the most rational man in this world. I tried to talk to him... he wouldn't listen. So, what are my options? You know what I'm saying? What are my options?
C: NORA
D: I can't believe you had to shoot pool! Don't you understand that ... don't you understand how crazy that is? You're sitting there... you're eating your eggs as if it's normal business in life here! Like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books.
C: BB
D: All right, I'm sorry. Beat.
C: NORA
D: What happened?
C: BB
D: I lost. He dips more toast into his eggs and eats.
C: NORA
D: You lost?
C: BB
D: I blew the eight ball.
C: NORA
D: You lost?
C: BB
D: Yeah.
C: NORA
D: What does that mean?
C: BB
D: It means I'm supposed to give you up, and I'm never supposed to see you again.
C: NORA
D: Will you stop eating the eggs for a minute! How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs?! What does this mean, Bill?
C: BB
D: Well, I'm supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement, but I'm not that honorable a guy. He smiles, takes a quick sip of his coffee.
C: BB
D: I gotta go.
C: NORA
D: Why are you running off so fast here?
C: BB
D: I told you, I got some business downtown. He gives her a kiss. Starts to go, turns back, gives her another kiss, more passionate this time.
C: BB
D: I'll see you later. He goes down the hall to walk out the front door.
S: EXT. BB'S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - DAY
N: Nora walks behind him, stands and watches him go out the door and down the front steps. He gets into his car and drives off. Nora stands at the door watching the car drive away.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
N: Tilley pulls his Cadillac into a parking space just a little up the street from the tobacco warehouse which houses the Home Improvement Commission. He gets out of his car, locks the door and starts down the street. BB's car drives past Tilley. CAMERA FOLLOWS BB's car as he pulls into a parking space close to the Commission building.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Corridor off the main hearing room. The hearing is not yet in session. Tilley sits on a bench against a wall. He glances up, his eyes drop and then he looks ACROSS CAMERA. CAMERA PANS TO the opposite side of the corri- dor where BB sits on another bench against a wall. BB glances off at Tilley and then drops his eyes. CAMERA PANS BACK TO Tilley. A few beats go by. Both men are uncomfortable with one another's presence.
C: TILLEY
D: You gotta testify, huh?
E: finally, to BB
C: BB
D: You?
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah.
C: BB
D: You got a lawyer?
C: TILLEY
D: Nah. I already testified once. I beat 'em before, I'll beat 'em again. You got a high-priced mouthpiece to speak for ya?
E: beat
C: BB
D: I don't need one. I don't expect to win.
C: TILLEY
D: How so?
C: BB
D: I gave them some pretty incriminating evidence.
C: TILLEY
D: You gave them evidence?
C: BB
D: The only way I could think to get out of this business. He smiles.
C: TILLEY
D: Hey, that's good... that's good, yeah. There's activity in the hallway.
E: points, laughing
C: VOICE
D: The hearing for the Home Improvement Commission is now in session. Tilley stands.
E: O.S.
C: TILLEY
D: So... how's Nora?
E: to BB
C: BB
D: She's doin' all right. A MAN comes out of the hearing room.
C: MAN
D: Ernest Tilley?
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah... here. Take good care of her. CUT TO:
E: turns to BB
S: INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - LONG SHOT OF HEARING ROOM - DAY
N: of the Home Improvement Commission. Five or six commissioners are behind a long table, led by John Masters, there is a gallery of observers, and Tilley sits at the defense table across from the commissioners.
C: MASTERS
D: Are you aware that that's a violation of sections 258 and 261?
E: into microphone
C: TILLEY
D: I'm not aware of the section numbers. Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch, that's all. BB is watching the proceedings. CAMERA HOLDS ON him.
C: MASTERS
D: Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'?
E: O.S.
C: ON TILLEY
D: who is falling apart.
C: TILLEY
D: As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers.
C: MASTERS
D: It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle. The point that we'd like to stress, is that you misled these people. Told them the job was free. Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars. That is misleading and deceptive sales practice.
E: beat
C: TILLEY
D: It was temporary insanity. I don't know... it just came over me ... it might have been something I ate. I don't know... it was crazy, I'm the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do. Believe me...
C: MASTERS
D: We have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on December 11, 1962. You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place.
E: cutting him off
C: TILLEY
D: What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations.
C: ON BB
D: who is watching the proceedings intently.
C: MASTERS
D: It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state.
E: O.S.
C: CAMERA ON MASTERS MASTERS
D: It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding...
C: CAMERA ON TILLEY
D: He's not very happy.
C: MASTERS
D: ... Which will prohibit you from practicing in the state of Maryland.
E: O.S.
C: TILLEY
D: Are you sure? Maybe the guys want to think this over.
C: BACK TO MASTERS MASTERS
D: Thank you, Mr. Tilley. You may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out.
C: TILLEY
D: gets up from the table and goes to the back of the room to exit the building. He stops at a desk just inside the door where the clerk is sitting. Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out a small document, and throws it down on the desk. He exits the building. CUT TO:
S: INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Same as before, except now we see Stanley enter and sit amongst the observers.
C: ANGLE ON MASTERS MASTERS
D: Will Mr. William Babowski please come forward. BB walks over to the defense table and sits down.
C: MASTERS
D: You have the right to have a lawyer present if you so wish.
C: BB
D: I do not wish. CUT TO:
S: EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: Tilley walks down the street toward his car. Suddenly he realizes that there's an empty space and his car is gone. Tilley's a little confused, thinking that perhaps he parked elsewhere. A YOUNG BLACK KID walks up to Tilley.
C: KID
D: Did you have a car parked here? A Cadillac?
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah. What about it?
C: KID
D: A man told me to say they took it.
C: TILLEY
D: Who took it?
C: KID
D: Man said, the tax man. Gave me a dollar to tell you so. Tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where his car had been.
C: TILLEY
D: Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low can you get? How low can you get? He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear. He mumbles to himself.
C: TILLEY
D: They're lowlife. How can people come and take a man's car?... His Cadillac? CUT TO:
S: INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: The hearing is continuing with BB at the defense table, and Stanley watching.
C: MASTERS
D: I think with the number of violations on your record, Mr. Babowski, this commission has no recourse but to revoke your state license.
C: CAMERA ON STANLEY MASTERS
D: Would you please drop off your license with the clerk of the commission on your way out.
E: O.S.
C: BB BB
D: Thank you. BB gets up and walks to the back of the room. He stops at the same desk as Tilley, but instead of going into his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches into his suit pocket, pulls out a license document and tosses it onto the table. Then he heads out the door. CUT TO:
E: leaning into the microphone
S: EXT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: BB walks down the street, making for his car. He sees Tilley still standing in the vacant parking space. Tilley sees BB. BB stops.
C: BB
D: Sorry about your license.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah. You in there?
C: BB
D: Yeah. They got my license as well.
C: TILLEY
D: Sorry to hear it.
C: BB
D: What are you doing standing there?
C: TILLEY
D: This is where my car used to be.
C: BB
D: Stolen?
C: TILLEY
D: I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits! Thieving sons of bitches! BB looks at Tilley for a beat.
C: BB
D: You need a ride uptown?
C: TILLEY
D: I could use one.
C: BB
D: Come on. They cross the street and go toward BB's Cadillac. BB gets in the driver's side, Tilley gets in the passenger side, and the car pulls out. CUT TO:
S: INT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY
N: BB's driving and Tilley's in the passenger seat.
C: TILLEY
D: Some bullshit commission, huh? Tell me, where's it written it the Constitution that says you can't hustle for money? Where's it written? It ain't like I went into an alley and hit a guy over the head with a brick and stole his money... not like I broke into somebody's house and stole his stuff. All I'm doing is selling... where's the crime in that?
E: beat
C: BB
D: I don't know what the world's coming to.
C: TILLEY
D: You're telling me. I don't know what the world's coming to.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. BB'S CADILLAC - LITTLE LATER
N: BB's still driving and Tilley's in the passenger seat.
C: BB
D: You know what our big crime is? We're nickel and dime guys. We're small time hustlers. They got us because we're hustling nickels and dimes.
C: TILLEY
D: Nickels and dimes. You got a good point there, BB. You're right on the money with that kind of thinking. BB stops the car at a stop sign. Something catches BB's eye. THROUGH the windshield we see a Volkswagen "beetle" going from right to left.
C: ANGLE ON BB
D: as he watches the car.
C: BB
D: Gotta find a new business to get into.
C: TILLEY
D: New? Very hard to find something new to get into. BB puts his foot on the gas and starts to drive.
C: BB
D: Maybe... maybe not.
C: TILLEY
D: Better put on my thinking cap... not easy to think of something new. CUT TO:
S: EXT. STREET - LONG TELEPHOTO SHOT OF CITY - DAY
N: showing stacks of houses as the Cadillac drives away. A MacDonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane on the horizon line. It's almost as if it's a rainbow across the far side of town, and the Cadillac will drive through it.
C: BB
D: Believe me, we'll find something. It's just a matter of time.
E: V.O.
C: TILLEY
D: Yeah... matter of time. Beat.
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: You know, I hear the new Cadillac's gonna be out in a couple of months.
E: V.O.
C: TILLEY
D: You're kidding?
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: Yeah... they're changing the body. I hear it's a beaut.
E: V.O.
C: TILLEY
D: Maybe I should put in my order now.
E: V.O.
C: BB
D: What're you talking about? You ain't got a pot to piss in.
E: V.O.
C: TILLEY
D: Give me the pot... I'll fill it. FADE TO BLACK.
E: V.O.
N: THE END
