T: FADE IN:
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
N: To establish. A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads, "GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!" A JANITOR opens the glass and starts removing the letters.
S: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
N: POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling. TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note: female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.) PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers. He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Well, it's been another great year here at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus' haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you. SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly enjoying the small compliment.
C: SANDY
D: I ain't afraid of no ghost. The other teachers laugh.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Or the wild success of...
C: VOICE
D: Wally, can I just say one quick thing? Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students and adults alike -- like students.
E: O.C.
C: AMY
D: Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over. So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm? That's it. Back to you, Wally. A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Thanks, Amy, . Or the wild success of the book drive for the women's prison sponsored by Ms. Savicki's class? A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.
E: then, back to his notes
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: But now as the summer is upon us, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Elizabeth, can you come up here? ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: You've only been with us for one short year, but know that you'll always be a part of the JAMS family. Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile. The Teachers lightly applaud.
E: CONT'D
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: And we got you a little something. Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and. pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Almost forty dollars. Thank you!
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Why don't you say a couple words?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this type of thing so I'll make it quick. I know I've only been here a year, but there's so much I'm going to miss...
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.
C: ELIZABETH
D: My students, probably most of all.I'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher. Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last days of seventh grade. A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she signs it.
E: V.0.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box. SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her, running toward their summer vacation.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And I wish that I had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding, I had my hands full. From the little I do know about you, I know that our students are in good hands. Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes.
E: V.0.
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
N: Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a thicket on the outskirts of the school property.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And I can't believe it's all over. This year flew by. And even though I'll never teach again professionally, I've realized that I don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example. Elizabeth comes up behind them.
E: V.0.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of the burnouts hands her the joint.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in, pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE, and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's box out the window and extends her hand, giving the school THE FINGER.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Woo-hoo! A couple students look at her strangely.
E: O.S.
C: ANGLE ON
D: The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook. He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"
C: DIM-LOOKING KID
D: You are... Illit... Illit... Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly hits him. She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"
E: struggling to read
C: JANITOR
D: Slow down!
N: CHYRON: BAD TEACHER
S: EXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT
N: A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate reads "HERS."
S: INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
N: A bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive. Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip. ELIZABETH (CALLING) Baby Doll?
C: MARK
D: Coming! MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear. He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth. Thankfully for him, he has money.
E: O.S.
N: MARK (CONT'D) (ANXIOUS) Hey! That was a quick party. Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands him a glass.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah. You should have seen it. What a joke. She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Here's to me never having to work again. And I owe it all to you, Lover. Elizabeth takes a big sip.
E: CONT'D
N: ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (FLIRTATIOUS) So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris, and then I booked us a suite at the Drake, and I thought we could finish the night in "anal alley." Hmm? Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --
S: INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in. Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet, behind the door.
C: MARK
D: See? Nothing. Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES. Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands, revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.
N: ELIZABETH (TO MARK) Motherfucker!
C: ELIZABETH
D: How could you do this to me?! I'm sorry.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm talking serious blood diamonds. Sheila SNEEZES again. Bless you.
N: ELIZABETH (TO SHEILA) Get out of my house, bitch!
C: MARK
D: Don't talk to her like that.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Excuse me? I love her. Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's large breasts.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You love her? She's a hooker.
C: MARK SHEILA
D: She's not a hooker. I dance. Elizabeth takes a deep breath.
N: ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (SWEET) Listen, Marky, you made a mistake. You're human. I'm human. And this time it was you. Maybe six months from now, you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but probably. Sheila SNEEZES again.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shut the fuck up. And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us.
E: CONT'D then, to Mark, sweet
C: MARK
D: I'm not. And you know why? Because Sheila loves me -- and not just for my money. Sheila squeezes his shoulder.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night.
C: MARK
D: What are you talking about?! Both your parents are CPAs.
C: ELIZABETH
D: My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you.
C: MARK
D: It's over, Elizabeth.
C: ELIZABETH
D: For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married. Because I love you.
E: beat, sweet
C: MARK
D: I'm gonna need the ring back. She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows.
E: rolls his eyes
C: ELIZABETH
D: You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!
C: MARK
D: Elizabeth. The ring.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm not even listening to you anymore. She starts to open the door. He closes it. The ring!
E: not turning around
C: ELIZABETH
D: Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease. Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS behind her.
E: CONT'D
N: CHYRON: 3 MONTHS LATER
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license plate reads "HERS."
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Elizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a person has never looked less happy to be anywhere. FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You've gotta be shitting me.
E: under her breath
N: TURN TO REVEAL
C: AMY'S CLASSROOM
D: The room has been decorated to within an inch of its life. Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame," or "Women Who Dared." A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been placed on each student's desk. Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying to hang a large "INTEGRITY" poster. She looks over, sees Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up.
C: AMY
D: Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Amy Squirrel.
C: AMY
D: I know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but I just want to say that I'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Okay.
C: AMY
D: And I know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and I just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at -- Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands.
C: AMY
D: Where's your beautiful ring?
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: My fiance and I broke it off. I found him in bed with someone else. Oh my gosh!
C: ELIZABETH
D: It was another man.
N: AMY (INCREDULOUS) Shut the front door! (motioning for a hug) Somebody needs a hug.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Somebody doesn't.
C: AMY
D: Hm. Another time then. Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk.
N: ELIZABETH (RE APPLE) These washed?
C: AMY
D: Of course. I'd never serve a student unwashed fruit. CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple.
N: ELIZABETH (MOUTHFUL) I thought the teachers got the apples.
C: AMY
D: Well, I think the students teach me at least as'much as I teach them.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Stupid. Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash and exits. It hits the rim and lands on the floor. Okey-dokey.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: It's like an asylum -- nothing on the walls. Elizabeth reads from a stack of US Weekly's and circles pictures of CELEBRITY BREASTS. LYNN, late 30s, the kind of woman who spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in.
C: LYNN
D: Oh sorry, am I interrupting?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Um -- kinda.
C: LYNN
D: Do you want to grab some lunch?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm in the middle of something, Lynn. My treat.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Fine.
S: EXT. KFC - DAY
N: Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.
C: LYNN
D: You have that thing going around, huh?
N: ELIZABETH
C: LYNN
D: Are you excited for tomorrow?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is tomorrow Saturday?
C: LYNN
D: No, it's the first day of school.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Wait, I thought I had a week to get my class together.
C: LYNN
D: Yeah, that was last week.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Fuck my ass.
E: under her breath
C: LYNN
D: If you hate teaching so much, why don't you just get another job?
C: ELIZABETH
D: And do what? Sell perfume at the mall? Work at a day care center? You know, when I first got into teaching, I thought I was doing it for all the right reasons: short hours, summers off, no accountability.
E: slurps her big gulp
C: LYNN
D: I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.
C: ELIZABETH
D: From now on, my full-time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me --
C: LYNN
D: Oh god, I pray for that --
C: ELIZABETH
D: And that makes a shit ton of money and doesn't ask too many questions. I spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the Bulls practice. Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to settle down. And they all wear condoms. And then they take the condoms with them. That's how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant. Like it's so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom.
E: licking her fingers
C: LYNN
D: You're gonna find someone great.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean, I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I get my new tits, I'll probably be a --
C: LYNN
D: You don't want to do that. You're already so pretty.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a chance against all those Barbies dolls out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may she rest in peace. Lynn checks her watch.
C: LYNN
D: We should finish up. Wally's doing that big orientation for teachers in the auditorium.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, I'm not going to that.
C: LYNN
D: But it's mandatory.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Ooohhh...
E: "I'm so scared"
C: LYNN
D: Yeah, I probably won't go either. I don't know I might. I'll probably go, but just sit in the back. Maybe leave early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it by ear. Or just stay till the end. Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.
C: LYNN
D: This was fun.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay.
C: LYNN
D: Sorry.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's okay. You can get me next time.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Not much character, not many furnishings. Elizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US Weekly. She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit. The front door opens and her roommate, KIRK, early 30s, boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp, walks quickly past Elizabeth.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits? He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it. Go bigger. Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Cool, yeah. She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Fuck my ass.
E: CONT'D under her breath
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off. She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: First day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before long, the hallway is empty.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING
N: In one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue. GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt with block letters that read "GYMNASTICS," stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away.
C: CHASE
D: The photographer was, like, sooo nice. He made me feel sooo comfortable.
N: (THEN) I might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week. GARRETT (RIVETED) Oh my. Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as surprised as they are that he spoke.
C: CHASE
D: Stalk much? Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK JERSEY, turns to Garrett.
N: TRISTAN (FAKE SNEEZING) Faggot. GARRETT (EARNEST) Bless you.
C: TRISTAN
D: What'd you say to me? Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat. The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large Tupperware tray.
C: SASHA
D: Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet you. My mother baked these for you.
E: handing over tupperware
C: ELIZABETH
D: Just leave them on the desk. Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there. After a moment, Elizabeth looks up.
E: not looking up
C: ELIZABETH
D: You need something?
E: CONT'D
N: - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver?" Show of hands. No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow. Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two KIDS in the front of the class.
E: CONT'D off their blank stares
C: ELIZABETH
D: You and you, go grab the TV and roll it up front. And you, go shut off the lights. The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha shuts off the LIGHTS.
E: CONT'D pointing to Sasha
C: SASHA
D: We're watching a movie on the first day?
N: CHASE (TO ELIZABETH) I think it's awesome. You rock.
C: GARRETT
D: I agree with Chase. Elizabeth pops in the DVD. "Stand and Deliver," starring Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Ugh. Oatmeal raisin? She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her desk. Sasha looks on, sadly.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Lunch is in full swing. Each clique has staked its own territory. Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among them, are on lunch duty.
C: ANGLE ON
D: GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan, the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett.
C: TRISTAN
D: Incoming! Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder. Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to Tristan and writes him up. Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth.
C: AMY
D: Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.
N: ELIZABETH
C: AMY
D: Did you see what just happened?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with the cole slaw.
C: AMY
D: You weren't at the orientation the other day, but we're doing something new this year. It's very exciting. We're splitting the cafeteria into quadrants. Elizabeth yawns.
C: AMY
D: So, anyways, in order for the quadrant system to work, it's vital that each teacher maintain order within their quadrant. Because it's really tough for me as head lunch monitor -- or another teacher -- to leave their quadrant to discipline a kid in another quadrant. I know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy to sit with-you after school and explain all of the new guidelines.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Tell you what. Why don't you send me a memo, and if I have any questions, I'll come to you.
C: AMY
D: Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan, Stan.
N: AMY (CONT'D) (TO ELIZABETH) Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that you were showing a movie this morning?
C: ELIZABETH
D: How do I know what you heard?
C: AMY
D: Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to tell you how to run your class, but maybe it might be fun to do some ice-breakers. Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String Game." Or start doing practice questions for the state test. It's never too soon to start.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?
C: AMY
D: Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I was really hoping that we could be more than across-the-hall-mates.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't know what you've heard, but I don't munch box.
C: AMY
D: No, of course not. I don't even know what that is. I just meant friends.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Like getting manicures and going shopping on Sundays? Shit like that?
C: AMY
D: Yes! Yes! And helping each other out. Looking out for one another.
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm gonna get going. Cover for me? Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off.
N: AMY (NERVOUS) But you can't leave. Lunch doesn't end for another... (looks at clock) (MORE)
C: AMY
D: Seven minutes. Who's going to watch your quadrant?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER
N: Empty. Elizabeth looks around and spots the "INTEGRITY" poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way. Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She turns on her heels. Fresh fish. ELIZABETH (VERY FRIENDLY) Hi there. You look a little lost.
C: SCOTT
D: Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'll do you one better. I'll take you there.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh, you don't have to do that.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure.
C: SCOTT
D: Thanks! I feel like I've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes.
N: (EXTENDS HAND) Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language Arts. Welcome, welcome. They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices Scott's VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre?
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Good eye!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby.
C: SCOTT
D: It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for .a year, but my grandfather designed it, so...
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh? Your grandfather designs watches?
C: SCOTT
D: The family business. My mom's maiden name is Jaeger.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shut up!
C: SCOTT
D: My parents had a minor meltdown when I decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher. But they've been cool about it. Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall.
C: SCOTT
D: Integrity.
E: CONT'D
N: ELIZABETH
C: SCOTT
D: .. The poster. "Integrity." What a great message for the kids.
E: pointing to poster
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them.
C: GARRETT
D: Hey, Ms. Halsey!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles.
C: SCOTT
D: Man, I can't wait for the day that I have my own classroom.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town?
C: SCOTT
D: I'm not married.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother.
C: SCOTT
D: That's horrible!
N: (NOTICING) Ooh, 124! This is me.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte. Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
N: SCOTT (HALF-JOKING) Only if a teacher gets sick. Great meeting you, Elizabeth Halsey. He heads into the room. Elizabeth cocks her head, checking out his ass as the door closes. ELIZABETH (TO HERSELF) Very nice meeting you.
C: CLOSE ON
D: A PAIR OF PERFECT FAKE BREASTS. A hand cups them from underneath. Pull back to reveal DR. VOGEL, 40s, and his receptionist, DANNI, probably in her 40s, with her shirt off. Elizabeth watches, rapt.
C: DR. VOGEL
D: As you can see, the weight is evenly distributed and there's minimal scarring.
N: DANNI (TAH DAH) Dr. Vogel.
C: DR. VOGEL
D: "Best Hands in Chicago."
E: holding out his hands
N: ELIZABETH
C: DR. VOGEL
D: Absolutely. Take them for a spin. Elizabeth reaches out, squeezes Danni's breasts.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Wow. And the nipples are just... I love them. I'll take two. They all laugh. Elizabeth notices Dr. Vogel'.s watch.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Maurice Lacroix. That's a great watch.
E: CONT'D
N: ELIZABETH (CURIOUS) And how's that going?
C: DR. VOGEL
D: She's my rock.
N: (THEN) Alright, thanks, Danni. Danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits.
C: DR. VOGEL
D: So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought to size?
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: I was thinking, you know, maybe a D.
C: DR. VOGEL
D: IJh huh, uh huh. I ,would say, though, with your frame, you might consider something smaller. A large B, maybe a C cup. You'd be surprised how significant those would look.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's, really turn some heads.
C: DR. VOGEL
D: You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's not a cure-all. I just want to make sure you have realistic expectations.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with monster fake tits. So now I need monster fake tits so that I won't lose my next fiance. Those are my expectations. Is that realistic enough for you?
C: DR. VOGEL
D: Very good then.
S: INT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY
N: Elizabeth leans over the counter and grabs a mint from a small bowl. Danni sits behind her desk wearing a headset.
C: DANNI
D: So you'll be off your feet for about two weeks... what works for you?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Let's do December 19th. Start of winter break.
C: DANNI
D: The 19th it is. So the total is $9300 for the surgery plus one night stay at our facility. How would you like to pay? Elizabeth laughs. Danni laughs.
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's absurd. What if I don't spend the night at your facility?
C: DANNI
D: The night's included in the price. Did you not read our literature?
C: ELIZABETH
D: No. A MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR walks by.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hi... Listen, I'm a teacher, not a drug dealer.
E: CONT'D flirtatious, to doctor then, back to Danni
C: DANNI
D: We accept all major credit cards.
C: ELIZABETH
D: My credit situation is complicated.
C: DANNI
D: I'm sorry, but if you can't pay, I can't schedule the appointment.
N: (LEANING IN) You know, there are less expensive options. Have you looked into South America?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'll be back. Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth, her cell phone cradled to her ear, pulls a LEAN CUISINE out of a freezer STOCKED with them. ELIZABETH (ON PHONE) Look, I just really need some money. It's, for a surgery I need. Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife and turns on the microwave. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (ON PHONE) Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my breasts, dad. (BEAT) Sorry. Happy belated birthday. So, can you wire me some money or not?
S: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy. She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the back tire of a late-model CAMRY.
E: on phone, whispering
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm dying and I need money for surgery. Really? Nothing? Don't you get social security or something? Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash.
E: CONT'D on phone, whispering
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - LATER
N: Elizabeth is still on the phone. CLOSE ON her computer screen. Her checking account balance: $45.66.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement. Do you know how embarrassing that was?!
E: into phone, losing patience
N: (BEAT) Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me. Lover? You there? Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Fucking Troll! Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom.
E: CONT'D
C: KIRK
D: Did you call my name?
C: ELIZABETH
D: No. I said 'fucking troll.'
C: KIRK
D: Oh, I thought you said Kirk. He turns and heads back in to his room.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey, you got ten grand?
C: KIRK
D: Nope. Kirk closes his door. After a beat, he opens it.
C: KIRK
D: Also, I might be a little short on the rent this month. Like, a lot short.
E: CONT'D
N: He closes his door. The microwave BEEPS. Dinner's ready.
S: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
N: Elizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner by a vending machine. Amy grades papers on a ratty- looking couch. She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn.
C: LYNN
D: I don't know. That's a lot of money.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I know. And I hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you. This has its desired effect on Lynn.
C: LYNN
D: Maybe I could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me?
C: ELIZABETH
D: That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that. But it looks great on you.
E: then, catching herself
C: LYNN
D: Thanks. What about Mark?
C: ELIZABETH
D: What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over.
C: AMY
D: 'Scuse,me. Just gonna scooch in here. She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't bother selecting an item. This was clearly her "in." She turns to Elizabeth and Lynn.
C: AMY
D: Sooo... I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I just want to say, that you shouldn't change a thing. You should be happy with the way you are. That's true.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Huh. Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are? Amy stammers.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Lynn, you teach them. What do you think?
E: CONT'D
N: LYNN (CONSIDERING) I've never asked them.
C: AMY
D: I would never --
C: ELIZABETH
D: We don't all have your tits, Squirrel. So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation.
C: AMY
D: I guess that's what you get for trying to help... Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and takes back her change without getting a drink. Amy heads back to the couch.
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's right. Walk away. - There he is! Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up. There he is!
E: then, noticing
C: AMY
D: Well, look what the cat dragged in!
C: SCOTT
D: I wish it was under better circumstances. Stu Riley's car was vandalized last night. Right in his driveway.
C: AMY
D: Gang members, probably.
N: SCOTT (QUIET RESIGNATION) The public school system failed them. Elizabeth and Amy nod vigorously.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: An empty hallway.
C: JOE CLARK
D: So forget about the way it used to be. This is not a damn democracy! We are in a state of emergency and my word is law! There's only one boss around here, and that's me. The HNIC.
E: V.0.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: The class is watching "Lean on Me," with Morgan Freeman as a tough-as-nails principal in an inner-city school. Amy's "Integrity" Poster now hangs above the TV. MR. O'MALLEY (ON TV) HNIC?
C: MS. LEVIAS
D: Head Nigger In Charge. The bell RINGS.
E: ON TV
C: ELIZABETH
D: We'll pick this up again tomorrow. The students shuffle out. Garrett hustles after Chase.
C: GARRETT
D: Quite a film, huh? Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends. Sasha lingers by Elizabeth's desk.
C: ELIZABETH
D: What.
E: without looking up
C: SASHA
D: I'm a student leader for the D.C. trip --
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shocker.
C: SASHA
D: And we're having our car wash this weekend. If you're around, maybe we could wash your car.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I've got some Mexicans who already do it for nothing.
C: SASHA
D: It's for a good cause. This year, we're trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a Duck Tour! She hands Elizabeth a flyer. Elizabeth glances at it.
N: SASHA (CONT'D) (SHRUGS) Last year's seventh grade raised $6000. ELIZABETH (SUDDENLY INTERESTED) $6000?
S: INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY
N: Elizabeth walks past the SCHOOL SECRETARY toward the Principal's office.
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: You can't go in there. He's with a student. Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters.
S: INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: The office is decorated with a DOLPHIN motif. Figurines, a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin. Dolphin calendars. This guy loves dolphins. Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you could try using deodorant, anti-. perspirant, maybe some cologne. I know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray.
N: ARKADY (BROKEN ENGLISH) Bodish spray. Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Blugh! Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his finger -- "one minute." Elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: So why don't you think about that and I'll let your teachers know that you're working on it? Arkady nods and quickly exits.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with anyone.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: We were just finishing up. Elizabeth, I actually meant to talk to you. Did I hear that you were showing movies all last week?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot, of ways, movies are the new books.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Huh. Elizabeth tries a different tact. She picks up a dolphin- shaped clock from the desk.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Me too! And if you like that, you'll love this.
N: Principal Snur pulls out an "Adopt-A-Dolphin" certificate.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: He lives in the Cayman Islands.
E: CONT`D
C: ELIZABETH
D: What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from a kindred spirit.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: So what else is new?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: What a nice surprise.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Amy's been running it the last two years...
C: ELIZABETH
D: She just does so much. It might be nice to give her a little rest. Especially that early on a Saturday.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: I'm so happy that you're dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the JAMS family.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It just feels so good to help.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Amy stands in the door where Elizabeth was just standing. Principal Snur is behind his desk.
C: AMY
D: Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade carwash? That's bonkers!
N: Amy immediately regrets saying "bonkers."
C: AMY
D: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack.
E: CONT'D
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: I just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up.
C: AMY
D: We raised over $6000 last year. That's a record. Is this really the best time to start experimenting?
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Amy, I see you taking on a.lot of responsibility, what with directing "Annie" and all your work with D.A.R.E. I'd just hate to see you get overwhelmed like you did in 2004. She stares at him -- clearly, this is a touchy subject.
C: AMY
D: Of course. Well, I should skedaddle. Looks like someone needs to plan a Saturday morning bike ride. She turns on her heels and walks out.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Elizabeth is asleep. Her ALARM goes off. It's 5:45 AM. She opens her eyes, sees the time, considers for a beat, then hits SNOOZE. She closes her eyes. - After a beat, the ALARM goes off again. She hits SNOOZE. Quick Cuts. Elizabeth hits the snooze button EVERY NINE MINUTES until 8:45. She stares at the clock.
S: EXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - MORNING
N: Garrett stands at the school entrance, holding a giant cardboard sign that reads "CAR WASH" as a few CARS pull in. Chase, and the other popular girls, are dressed in seventh-grade sexy -- they've tied off their shirts. The BOYS run around spraying each other, but mostly spraying Garrett. Garrett laughs, mistakenly thinking that he's part of the fun.
C: GARRETT
D: Oh, I'm gonna get you guys! A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters. Tristan, the bully, cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge at Garrett.
N: TRISTAN (NOTICING SOMETHING) Whoa. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Tristan's gaze. ELIZABETH steps out of her car. She's wearing HIGH HEELS, DAISY DUKES and a BIKINI TOP. She looks both spectacular and ridiculous. A couple of PARENTS look over at Elizabeth, in shock.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Sorry I'm late.
E: calling to Parents
C: MOTHER
D: I'm going to say something about her outfit. The MOTHERS vigorously nod in agreement. A DAD pipes in.
E: to other PARENTS
C: DAD
D: Well, if it helps raise money... The other DADS vigorously nod in agreement.
E: staring hard at Elizabeth
C: BEGIN CAR WASH MONTAGE:
D: --Elizabeth holds the "Carwash" sign. A LINE of CARS forms. An OLDER MAN in an immaculately clean CADILLAC, rolls down his window and hands her money. --Elizabeth washes in SLO MO, shakes out her hair as she gets WET. The BOYS and their FATHERS stare at her. --The GIRLS try to mimic Elizabeth's seductive behavior. Their MOTHERS run over and pull them away. --The Older Man in the Cadillac comes back to have his car re-washed.
N: END MONTAGE
S: EXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - LATER
N: The carwash is wrapping up. Elizabeth counts money at a makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal lockbox. She glances around and then shoves a large clump of cash into her DAISY DUKES.
C: VOICE
D: What are you doing? Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a TRUCK, clearly spying.
E: O.S.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy.
C: SASHA
D: Are you stealing our money?
C: ELIZABETH
D: How dare you?! I'm here early on a Saturday for you guys. And for the record, nobody likes a tattle tale.
C: SASHA
D: I haven't tattled. Yet.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and flunk your ass. How will that look on your resume?
N: SASHA (TEARS UP) I didn't say I would say anything.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta finish counting this money. Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her.
C: ELIZABETH
D: See you Monday! Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves back.
E: CONT'D
C: ANGLE ON
D: ANY, across the street, watching through binoculars. She's straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a sheen of recently-applied suntan lotion. She takes a sip from her Camelbak, and pedals away.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON a fish bowl with a crude sign that reads "New Tits." Elizabeth drops in fistfuls of crumpled cash and then writes in a notebook: $1300.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: Amy walks down the hall. She sees Principal Snur slip into the bathroom. Amy walks up to the MEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM door and waits. The BELL RINGS.
C: AMY
D: Shishkebobs. She hesitates a beat and then enters.
S: INT. J.A.M.S. - MEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY
N: Wally is in a stall reading a brochure for a DOLPHIN TOUR. PRINCIPAL:SNUR (TO HIMSELF) Amazing.
C: AMY
D: Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy Squirrel. He instinctively covers himself with the brochure.
E: O.S.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Amy? What are you doing? Get out!
T: INTERCUT WITH:
N: Amy standing inside. She scrunches her nose at the smell.
C: AMY
D: This'll just take a sec. I thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff.
N: PRINCIPAL SNUR (THRU STALL) Can we talk about this later?
C: AMY
D: "Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly."
E: quoting some adage
N: Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success. And Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the kids had a great time.
C: AMY
D: I don't want to speak out of school, but I happened to be pedalling by and saw her get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And remember, we barely know anything about her. She was a real lone wolf last year.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash?
C: AMY
D: Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever she did worked. And next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing, you better be damn sure. We're done here. Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED.
C: AMY
D: Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super day, you two. Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION from the other stall, followed by a sigh.
N: MALE TEACHER (O.S.) (IN STALL) Christ... I thought she was never going to leave.
S: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
N: Sandy, the math teacher with the ponytail, sits at the table grading papers. Another TEACHER dozes in the corner.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's?
E: entering, very friendly
N: Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. "Is she talking to me?" Guilty.
C: ELIZABETH
D: How's Period 5?
C: SANDY
D: Great, thanks for asking. We got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig, which is nice because it's earned. It's time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Awesome!
N: (THEN) Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge? Sure thing. Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug.
C: SANDY
D: You should come to one of our shows. He hands her the yogurt.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, I can't. Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee.
C: SANDY
D: I didn't even tell you the dates.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Elizabeth's class is seated. They're staring at her, waiting for her to begin.
C: CHASE
D: Are we starting "School Ties" today? Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a
N: NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. The camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture of a topless AFRICAN TRIBESWOMAN with large breasts. After a beat, Elizabeth looks up.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Alright, today, we're starting "School Ties." Classic. You, shut off the lights. Elizabeth goes to the DVD player. There's a knock at the door and the SCHOOL SECRETARY walks in holding a box. She hands it to a confused Elizabeth.
E: then, pointing to a Student
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: Here it is. Good luck.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Here what is?
C: SCHOOL SECRETARY
D: It's the pre-test for the state standardized test. It was in the memo.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, yes. In the memo. The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box. Tristan and.a couple kids start making farting noises with their hands.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) Alright, look, we all know these tests are gay -- Elizabeth turns to a student who COULD BE GAY.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hey. Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where the kids dutifully take Scan-trons and test booklets.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH.
D: According to this memo, I'm supposed to give you forty-five minutes per section. Blah blah blah. Clear your desks, pencils out and -- begin! Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison.
E: CONT'D then, reading
N: Elizabeth takes the TV and swivels it to face her desk. She turns on the movie, turns down the volume (just a little bit) and reclines.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
N: Chase and another popular girl strut across the cafeteria, arm in arm. A THIRD POPULAR GIRL, saving a table, waves them over. Chase and her friend walk right past the girl like she doesn't exist and take a seat with a bunch of other girls. ELIZABETH (O.S.) (MARVELLING) Little bitches.
C: TURN TO REVEAL
D: Elizabeth and Lynn on lunch duty. The girl at the table starts BAWLING. Amy, also on duty, races over to console her.
C: ELIZABETH
D: What a phony.
E: CONT'D
C: LYNN
D: Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too.
N: (THEN) So what's going on with your boobs?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm never gonna get married. I'm gonna die broke. I should just blow my brains out. There he is! Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids. He gives them a big wave.
E: then, lighting up
C: LYNN
D: I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I want to sit on his face.
C: SCOTT
D: Hey, guys.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You're really making a habit out of this.
C: SCOTT
D: Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math department, I guess he got that stomach bug that's been going around and I got the call.
C: LYNN
D: I heard he pooped himself in first period. A kid had to walk him to the nurse.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk? Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here?" look.
C: LYNN
D: Scott, do you want anything?
C: SCOTT
D: I'm good, thanks for asking. Lynn walks off.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So, Scott -- Lynn comes back.
C: LYNN
D: Sorry, what kind of milk do you want? Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I don't know. Surprise me.
C: LYNN
D: Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%. Lynn walks off again.
C: ELIZABETH
D: She's funny. Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to console the girl. Elizabeth turns back to Scott.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to hear about your experiences in the Peace Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.
E: CONT'D
C: SCOTT
D: Isn't it Back-to-School Night?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, Silly, I meant after.
E: news to her
C: SCOTT
D: Cool! Let's get a group together.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us. Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.
C: SCOTT
D: Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered. You're one of the nicest people I've met here. But... I'm actually seeing someone.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh?
C: SCOTT
D: Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Because she's ugly?
C: SCOTT
D: No. She's beautiful. She's great. She really cares about the kids. It's just... when you're dating a co-worker...
N: ELIZABETH (REALIZING) Squirrel? Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott, signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse. She quietly seethes.
C: SCOTT
D: Anyways, thanks again for asking me out. I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck on that group date. See ya! Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a four cartons of milk.
C: LYNN
D: Here you go. I got you one of each.
N: Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them in the trash and storms off.
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT
N: At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT
N: Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS. They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for a beat too long.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points to her.
C: SASHA'S MOTHER
D: Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each other at the carwash. I'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies. What about the state test? Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't Question My Authority."
C: ELIZABETH
D: That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do. And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say.
E: as the parents take this in
N: (THEN) Help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back. Class dismissed. They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER. Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by a sharply dressed PARENT. PARENT #1 Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. (EXTENDING HAND) I'm Chris' dad. From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who Chris is.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud.
C: CHRIS' DAD
D: Oh, what a relief. I just wish his grades would reflect it.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If I know Chris, he'll get there.
C: CHRIS' DAD
D: Listen, I know you have a full plate, but if you could keep an eye on Chris, my wife and I would really appreciate it. Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand, sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks back up at Chris' dad.
N: CHRIS' DAD (CONT'D) (WINKING) For supplies. Or whatever.
T: JUMP CUT TO:
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Elizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're eating Oreos and sipping water.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. The parents beam.
C: ELIZABETH
D: A student like that would benefit so much from some extra attention.
E: CONT'D
C: CHASE'S MOM
D: You think we should hire a tutor? I told you.
E: then, to Chase's Dad
N: ELIZABETH (CONSPIRATORIAL) I'd be happy to do it myself. It's just hard in a class of twenty-five.
C: CHASE'S MOM
D: Oh, to be a teacher.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's just so hard, on my salary, having to pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on me with his twin sister... and, unlike a lot of these other teachers, all I truly care about is helping your child learn. And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a full grade higher -- or your money back. Chase's mom takes out her check book.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Make it out to "cash."
E: CONT'D
T: JUMP-.CUT TO:
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER
N: Parents are leaving the class, ad-libbing "thank.you's." Another SET OF PARENTS surreptitiously hand Elizabeth some cash. A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behind.
C: MELODY
D: Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Melody. Garrett's mom.
N: ELIZABETH (EYEING BERET) Nice to meet you... Garrett's a great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud.
C: MELODY
D: Oh, you're referring to his poetry. Thank you.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You must be so proud.
C: MELODY
D: I am. So so so so so proud. So proud.
C: ELIZABETH
D: A kid like that, if I could just give some more one on one time, he would just blossom.
C: MELODY
D: I'm so happy to hear you say that. would really benefit from that.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Unfortunately, in a class of twenty- five...
C: MELODY
D: Ugh. Class sizes are ridiculous.
C: ELIZABETH
D: And with the amount they pay teachers...
C: MELODY
D: Thank god you love what you do.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you could help out by giving me a little -- you know -- somethin somethin. Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back at her blankly.
C: ELIZABETH
D: It's just, it's really tough to teach the way that I want to teach when there's so little money. I mean, look at this place.
E: CONT'D
C: MELODY
D: You know what I'm going to do for you? Melody opens her pocketbook. Elizabeth smiles.
C: MELODY
D: I am going to start a letter-writing campaign to the school board, to my congressman, to the mayor -- and keep writing until you get what you deserve.
E: CONT'D
N: She opens her date book and writes herself a note.
C: MELODY
D: And I'm writing myself a reminder! Melody pulls Elizabeth into a warm hug.
E: CONT'D
C: MELODY
D: You are a saint. Melody exits. Elizabeth is left in the classroom by herself.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: So long, Crazy. As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear the opening beats of COOLIO'S "GANGSTER'S PARADISE."
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY
N: The SONG continues. Elizabeth pokes her head in. The office is empty. She walks in, grabs the "Lost and Found" box and exits.
S: INT. THRIFT STORE - DAY
N: The SONG continues. Elizabeth stands across from a HIPPIE-LOOKING GIRL. The pile of "Lost and Found" clothes are laid out on the counter. The Hippie Girl hands Elizabeth some cash.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: The SONG continues as Elizabeth throws more money in her "New Tits" jar and enters a new amount into her notebook. The new balance: $1473.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

N: The SONG continues as Amy, in her empty classroom, stands against the adjoining wall, her ear pressed to it.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY
N: The SONG continues. The class is still watching "Dangerous Minds." There's some NOISE in the hall. Elizabeth PAUSES the movie, STOPPING the song. She leans into the hall.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Enough with the commotion! The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES the movie. The SONG comes back on.
S: INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
N: The SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with friends. Elizabeth pushes through the center.
S: EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY
N: The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales. KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS. Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha, bundled in her winter coat, waving.
C: ELIZABETH
D: What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth doesn't.
E: through the window
C: SASHA
D: Is that marijuana?
C: ELIZABETH
D: It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business.
C: SASHA
D: Oh, okay. Feel better.
N: (THEN) My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here. Sasha pulls out a tupperware container.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Are those oatmeal raisin?
E: peering through window
C: SASHA
D: Sugar. Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress.
E: CONT'D
C: SASHA
D: I don't want to run for congress. I want to be president.
C: ELIZABETH
D: See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it.
E: CONT'D
C: SASHA
D: If I think about it, will I get extra credit?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Hopeless. Watch your feet.

N: Elizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets out of bed.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce packets. She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once. Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck. She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove, and tries lighting it from there. No luck.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Seriously?
S: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - AFTERNOON
N: Elizabeth walks up to the door. It's locked. She shakes the door.

E: CONT'D
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: It's Christmas.
C: ELIZABETH

C: HOMELESS GUY
D: Merry Christmas!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Whatever. Hey, you got a lighter?
E: then, stops
C: HOMELESS GUY
D: I don't smoke. It's bad for you. Elizabeth walks back to her car, empty-handed. A MINI- VAN passes. Stops. Reverses.. The window rolls down. It's Garrett and his Mom.
C: GARRETT
D: Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett!
C: MELODY
D: Merry Christmas, Ms. Halsey!
N: ELIZABETH
C: MELODY
D: Having a nice Christmas?

S: INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Cozy and unpretentious. Filled with crafts. Elizabeth sits next to Melody and across from Garrett, who's wearing his "Gymnastics" sweatshirt, and his TWO AUNTS, both divorced. Elizabeth tears through a plate of Christmas cuisine.
C: MELODY
D: This is a real treat for Garrett. He doesn't have a lot of friends come by the house.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I find that hard to believe.
N: (CHECKS WATCH) Listen, I hate to eat and run, but I've gotta head over to the shelter.
C: GARRETT
D: I thought we could play board games!
N: AUNT #1 A shelter. That is so inspiring.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, I love helping bums.
C: MELODY
D: Oh, but you have to wait for dessert. We have a real treat.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If it's cheesecake, I'll stay.
C: MELODY
D: It's even better than cheesecake!
N: (THEN) Garrett, why don't you run and get some of your new poetry?
C: GARRETT
D: Oh god, no one wants to hear it. Oh god, I'm so embarrassed!
E: feigning. embarrassment
C: MELODY
D: Don't be shy, Marbles. Garrett runs out of the room.
C: ELIZABETH
D: If you're not really serving dessert, I'm gonna have to get going.
C: MELODY
D: One poem? If you like it, maybe you can read it to your homeless friends.
S: INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Garrett stands in front of Elizabeth and his family. He opens his journal, clears his throat, and begins.
C: GARRETT
D: This is called "The Chase," by Garrett Tiara.
N: (READING) XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/ Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great? / About her smile / That I would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending. Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps, then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off.
C: ELIZABETH
D: She sits back down.
C: GARRETT
D: We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve... Ba-lance... Thank you. He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks to Elizabeth for a reaction.
E: really reaching for it
C: ELIZABETH
D: Junior likes to rhyme.
C: MELODY
D: Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a hand with dessert -- give them a chance to talk about the poem. The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth.
C: ELIZABETH
D: So your poem's about that girl?
C: GARRETT
D: Chase, yeah. You got the subtext.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Can I give you some advice?
C: GARRETT
D: Please.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions.
C: GARRETT
D: But I like Chase.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful.
C: GARRETT
D: What do you know? You don't-even know our names.
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know.
N: GARRETT (EMOTIONAL) This sweatshirt was my dad's. It's all he left when he left.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it.
C: GARRETT
D: Fuck you. Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder.
E: quiet, steely
C: ELIZABETH
D: Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door.
C: GARRETT
D: Happy New Year. Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over? She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves.
S: INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY
N: The students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth. She looks haggard. She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup and takes a long swig. The kids look at each other, like "what is she doing?" Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Shut up.
S: INT. WOMEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY
N: Elizabeth is-checking her makeup in the mirror. Lynn enters. Her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it.

C: LYNN
D: You should hear some of their originals. She turns to the bartender.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Two more. You want anything?
E: then, to Lynn
C: LYNN

C: LYNN
D: For the state test.
E: off Elizabeth's look
N: (MORE)

N: (THEN) Let's dance! Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy. DRUMMER (COUNTING OFF) 1, 2, 3, 4... SANDY (SINGING "SMOOTH") Man it's a hot one / like seven inches from the midday sun...

N: Elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his backpack into class. ELIZABETH (TO GARRETT) Let's go, Sylvia Plath. Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe.. Elizabeth winces and glares at Garrett. The rest of the class enters, stops, noticing WORK PACKETS on each of their desks. CHASE (LOOKING AROUND) Where's the TV? ELIZABETH (ALL BUSINESS) Everyone, take your seats. Shawn turns to Spencer.
C: SHAWN
D: What do you think's going on? Spencer shrugs.

N: ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (SURPRISINGLY SUPPORTIVE) Come on, you guys know this. This is as close to real teaching as we've seen from Elizabeth. Sasha raises her hand. We see that she already has two gold star stickers on her forehead.

E: CONT'D rolls her eyes
N: Chase raises her hand. ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

E: CONT'D grabs yogurt from fridge
C: AMY
D: Yeah, it's been quite a change.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Well, I should get going. Nice seeing all of you. Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth squeezes Scott's shoulder as she exits. Amy notices.

The Police Officers continue the search. They lead the dogs up against lockers and knock on class doors. Amy and Principal Snur watch from the end of the hallway. PRINCIPAL SNUR (TO AMY) You better be right about this -- or I'm going to be getting a lot of panicked calls from parents.

C: ELIZABETH (CONT'D
D: Keep reading. Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk, obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS. Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her way through the second and then the third, the chewing becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder. Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by Principal Snur and Amy.
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This will only take a second. Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes her mouth, breathes normally.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Sorry. I had something caught in my throat. The German Shepherd continues barking.
N: POLICE OFFICER #1 What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy? The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth, almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.

E: grasping at straws, to Garrett
C: PRINCIPAL SNUR
D: Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call off this witch-hunt.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll excuse me, my class has a state test to prepare for. Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit. Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once, the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.

D: Then what's up?
C: ELIZABETH
D: I need some date rape drugs.
C: TUCKER
D: Two things. Number one: who do you think I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah, I'm in an awesome frat, but that really hurts. And two: they're not "date rape" drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for weightlifting. It helps build mass, okay? Why do you even want it?
E: hurt, defensive
N: ELIZABETH (DEADPAN) For lifting. (THEN) I have money and I'm in a rush. She takes out a wad of cash.
C: TUCKER
D: That's all you needed to say. No need to get all histrionic on me. Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small bottle containing a clear liquid.
C: TUCKER
D: One capful makes you feel really good. Two capfuls will knock her out for a couple hours. You don't want to take any more than two. Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and then gives her a big, warm hug.
E: CONT'D
C: TUCKER
D: Listen, I know you and my brother aren't together anymore, but I still think of you as a sister, okay?

S: INT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - NIGHT
N: A portly, unkempt man in a cheap suit, CARL HALABI, nervously walks through the hotel bar. He sees the back of a WOMAN with a RED PERM.
C: CARL
D: Marjorie? "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH, wearing the "Little Orphan Annie" wig. She's sipping a cocktail.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You must be Carl. His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such an attractive woman. Elizabeth stands and extends her hand. Carl notices Elizabeth's very short skirt.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. Elizabeth motions for him to sit down.
E: CONT'D
N: CARL (NERVOUS) You find the place alright? Good drive?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Great drive. I love downstate Illinois.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat with you all night.
C: CARL
D: Yeah...
C: ELIZABETH
D: But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so I'll get right down to it.
N: (THEN) I've spoken to various, um, black citizens who are alleging that your tests are biased towards white people and Orientals.
C: CARL
D: You can't use my name, okay?
E: shakes head in frustration
C: ELIZABETH
D: No problem.
C: CARL
D: Like I told you on the phone, every couple of years, we get calls from all over the state with these cockamamie charges. You should hear what they call me. And I'm not a racist. I voted for Obama. That, you can quote me on.
E: motioning for her to write
C: ELIZABETH
D: Oh, right. Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting down notes.
C: CARL
D: Look, Marjorie, I know my tests aren't perfect. But what's the alternative? I'm all for free thinking and creativity, but how do you formulate an education budget without hard numbers from one of my tests?
C: ELIZABETH
D: You don't need to convince me. But you know what would help, Carl? For me to see one of this year's tests.
C: CARL
D: No problem at all. Elizabeth lights up.
C: CARL
D: I'll send you one the day after the schools administer them.
E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on a bit of a deadline.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I totally get it. Enough business for one night.
N: (THEN) I'm gonna have another drink before I hit the road. What's your poison?

C: ELIZABETH
D: What turns you on, Carl?
E: CONT'D
C: CARL
D: Everything.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously.

D: Even better.
S: INT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - NIGHT

D: So this is the desk.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine.

E: CONT'D
C: ELIZABETH
D: Do you have any music?
E: CONT'D

C: ELIZABETH
D: A toast. To new friends.
C: CARL
D: To new lovers. CLINK. Carl downs his glass.
N: CARL (CONT'D) (NERVOUS) I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room.
C: CARL
D: K, first door on your right. Don't be long. Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk.

C: CARL
D: Marblorie!
C: ELIZABETH
D: Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out, STILL STANDING. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She pulls out a folder.
E: as to a child
N: 2009 ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST
C: ELIZABETH
D: And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf. She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN: "You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie."

Elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides all of the exams into the trash. She pulls out a match and lights the exams on fire.

C: ELIZABETH
D: Something big. Maybe two big things. Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug.
C: AMY
D: Hey! Ism so proud of you. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that you -- you! -- would get the bonus, I would've said to whomever it was, 'you must be joshing me.' And now, here we are. Here we are.

E: presses, turns to Chase
C: SASHA
D: That was from the whole class.
C: GARRETT
D: Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a different card.
N: (CONTINUING) And then, a year later, when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer, you wrote me another card. What happened to us? Remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I never did and I never will. I know we're really young, but remember Romeo and Juliet were only 13. A lot of people don't know that. So there it is. My heart on a sleeve. (goes into rhyming verse) Don't let me leave / Always believe / A beat. Chase stares at Garrett.

S: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Amy, the phone cradled to her ear, leans back on her couch. She's wearing splotches of calamine lotion over her rash and her hair is pulled back. A TURTLE plods across her kitchen table. AMY (WHEELS SPINNING) Oh my gosh. We just might have a Mary Kay Letourneau situation on our hands. Amy scratches the turtle's neck as it continues across the table.

C: AMY
D: I know. The woman's a criminal mastermind.
C: SCOTT
D: This is such a mess.

D: Poetry?
N: PROSTITUTE #1 Cause that's how she fuck. PROSTITUTE #2 I fuck like that. Lyrical. Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend. Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming up by a trash can fire.
N: HOMELESS MAN #1 Won't get a cab in this neighborhood. A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the passenger window and leans out.

I'm sure they're back at the hotel. Probably just a mix-up. The bus pulls up to the curb and stops. Scott steps off first, clearly confused by the crowd and TV cameras. Immediately, a reporter thrusts a mic into his face.
C: REPORTER
D: What can you. tell us about the alleged romance between Elizabeth Halsey and a 13 year old student?
N: SCOTT (CONFUSED) What? The students step off and the Parents swarm them. PARENT #1 Oh baby, are you okay? Did she touch you? Sasha's parents engulf her in a hug.

N: What?
C: ELIZABETH
D: Just go out and sleep with as many girls, as you possibly can. Get her out of your head.
C: GARRETT
D: They'll probably reject me, too.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Yeah, probably. But life's about how you deal with rejection. You can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time. And I figure a kid like you with not much going for him -- if he were to choose the latter -- might end up becoming a pretty strong man.
N: GARRETT (TOUCHED) Thanks.
C: ELIZABETH
D: Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably shitting a brick.
C: GARRETT
D: I can't go back there. All the kids will laugh at me.
C: ELIZABETH
D: You seriously think they haven't been laughing already?

C: KIRK
D: Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own. As Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district.

D: How do we make this go away?
C: KIRK
