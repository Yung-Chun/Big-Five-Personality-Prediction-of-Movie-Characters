T: FADE IN
S: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
N: On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES appear with every FIRING. On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose: WAR MONTAGE Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of: Cannon firing in all directions. Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling. FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC: Mortar fire, explosions, smoke. A machine gunner fires. A soldier falls. Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. More machine gunning. More soldiers go down. A massive gun fires. SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen. Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles. A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes. A bomb drops from an airplane. Aerial view of an exploding building. Anti-aircraft guns at work. Planes in the air. A machine gun fires skyward. Planes circle, filling the air. A single bi-plane. The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks into a grin. Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see: Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them. An enemy plane arrives. The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns. Bill and Francis' plane spins away. Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to Francis' amusement. The planes circle in the air. The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail as Cary watches. The enemy pilot returns fire. The two planes tango in mid-air. Shep FIRES. The enemy pilot grins and FIRES. Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane. Cary warns Shep they've been hit. From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke. The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of control. Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him. Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of the red hot controls. The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward. Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry. Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. Francis, though, doesn't look happy. Shep twists in his seat and looks around. Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit. SHEP (o.s.) Level off, Cary! Level off! Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick. From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by. The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop. Smoke. Flames. Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to clamber out.
C: CARY
D: Shep! Shep, are you all right?
C: SHEP
D: Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
C: CARY
D: Here, give me your arm! I'll get you out of here! Hang on there, Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella.
N: Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious. Flames consume the plane.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
C: A TEMPERATURE CHART
D: for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle continues to RUMBLE.
C: ANOTHER CHART
D: swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked NORMAL.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.
C: SHEP AND CARY
D: stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.
C: THE CLOCK
D: slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- Armistice Day.
C: SHEP AND CARY
D: sit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.
C: CARY
D: Well, the old guerre is finie.
C: SHEP
D: That's right.
C: CARY
D: What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
C: SHEP
D: Get tight.
C: CARY
D: And then what?
E: turns to him
N: Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious.
C: SHEP
D: Stay tight.
N: Cary grins wryly.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER
N: A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have passed through close behind them. Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.
C: DOCTOR
D: Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. You two leaving us, eh? In a way, I'm sorry to release you two. I have no choice in the matter.
E: rises, joins them
N: Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye.
C: SHEP
D: What am I going to do, Major, about my-- oh, this rotten business?
N: The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely.
C: DOCTOR
D: Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Lieutenant?
C: SHEP
D: Mm hm.
C: DOCTOR
D: What the French call a tic. T-I-C, tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
N: Shep puts his glasses back on.
C: SHEP
D: Yes, sir.
C: DOCTOR
D: I'm afraid time'll have to take care of that. Time and normal living.
N: Shep's lips tighten skeptically.
C: DOCTOR
D: You two are returning to the United States, I presume?
N: Shep glances at Cary.
C: CARY
D: Ah, we haven't decided.
C: DOCTOR
D: I'd take the first boat home. Well, here you go.
N: The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him.
C: DOCTOR
D: Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.
N: The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket.
C: DOCTOR
D: Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch them and loosen them up. In time, you'll regain their full use.
C: CARY
D: Thank you, sir.
N: The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder.
C: DOCTOR
D: Bye, Lieutenant.
N: Cary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor.
C: DOCTOR
D: Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
N: Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide.
C: DOCTOR
D: Well, there they go. Out to face life. And their whole training was in preparation for death.
E: shakes his head
N: He moves off as we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
N: Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and head into the hospital.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS
N: The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.
C: AIDE
D: Why can't they go on with flying? You know, the air mails or something?
C: DOCTOR
D: I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction.
N: The aide looks at him, quizzically.
C: DOCTOR
D: They fell, you know -- six thousand meters. Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement. Shattered both of them. Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle.
E: shakes his head, sadly
C: AIDE
D: Spent bullets.
C: DOCTOR
D: Spent bullets. That's it. They're like projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy. They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory. And now they've fallen back to earth. Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
E: nods gestures with cigarette
N: We slowly PULL BACK from the two men.
C: AIDE
D: Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right.
C: DOCTOR
D: Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they? What can you expect of them? I hate to think what may become of them.
E: shakes his head
N: We have pulled back far enough and now we
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTER
N: Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs and wave.
C: BILL
D: Hello, Cary!
E: Texas accent
C: FRANCIS
D: Hi, Cary!
N: At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them.
C: CARY
D: Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
C: SHEP
D: Hello, Bill! Francis!
N: Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them.
C: CARY
D: Well, I see you got yours.
E: friendly
C: BILL
D: Yup. We crashed.
E: pleasantly
N: Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off.
C: BILL
D: Hey! Where you going?
E: calls down, puzzled
N: Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like kids.
C: CARY
D: Paris!
N: BILL (o.s.) Paris?! From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat at them.
C: BILL
D: See you in Paris!
C: FRANCIS
D: Yeah.
E: waves his cigarette
N: Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT
N: A superimposed text reads: PARIS -- 1919. Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT
N: Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes. Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But: Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye twitching. Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged leader. Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk. Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and forced exuberance.
C: CARY
D: How 'bout a cocktail?
C: SHEP
D: Not a bad idea at that.
N: As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.
T: BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:
C: A GLOWING SIGN
D: made of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CLARIDGE'S - NIGHT
N: Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor. Employees in white jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CLARIDGE'S BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOT
N: The place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, greeted by an employee who takes their hats. ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and she seems to be in a world all to herself. Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses. After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:
C: NIKKI
D: still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
C: THE GLASS
D: in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set of men's false teeth.
N: We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.
C: CARY
D: I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what IS that you're drinking?
C: NIKKI
D: Teeth.
C: CARY
D: Teeth?
N: After another look, Cary turns to his friends.
C: CARY
D: Hey, it's teeth!
N: BILL (o.s.) Teeth?! Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in amazement at the teeth. Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention.
C: SHEP
D: Teeth!
C: NIKKI
D: That's right.
C: BILL
D: Yup. It's a full set -- upper and lower.
E: enthusiastic
C: CARY
D: It's a nice expression.
E: to Nikki
C: SHEP
D: Hey, how come you're with those teeth?
C: NIKKI
D: I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute.
C: CARY
D: Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for?
C: NIKKI
D: Said he wanted to biff somebody.
C: BILL
D: Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!
E: excited
C: NIKKI
D: Just around to the right.
C: BILL
D: Come on, men! We're liable to see a fight.
N: As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.
C: CARY
D: Would you like to come along?
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind the man's teeth.
E: as if it were obvious
N: They glance down at the teeth.
C: CARY
D: Oh, of course.
N: Cary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling.
T: FLASH CUT - A MAN'S FACE
N: as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists.
T: FLASH CUT - THE MAN'S BODY
N: dropping unconscious to the floor.
C: OUR FOUR HEROES
D: enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body. Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:
E: one of his favorite gestures
C: BILL
D: Well. THAT'S all fixed.
N: Bill straightens his bow-tie. Already the group seeks a new distraction.
C: CARY
D: Let's go back.
N: They head back to the bar.
C: THE BAR
D: Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of searching, Cary spots her at the bar.
C: CARY
D: Oh, there she is.
N: All four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company.
C: BILL
D: Well, we missed it.
C: NIKKI
D: Did something happen?
C: BILL
D: Well, they carried a guy out. Say! What's become of the teeth?
E: sees her empty glass
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, the man came and got his teeth.
C: CARY
D: Well, what did he say?
C: NIKKI
D: He said thank you for holding his teeth.
C: CARY
D: What did he look like?
C: NIKKI
D: I think he fell in an airplane in the war -- and got his teeth knocked out.
C: CARY
D: Well, why do you think he was in the war?
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.
C: CARY
D: What makes you think he was a flyer?
C: NIKKI
D: His eyes.
C: CARY
D: His eyes? You can tell a flyer better by his ears.
E: dry, to the others
N: The men chuckle.
C: SHEP
D: Well, what do you say we have a drink?
C: BILL
D: Fine!
C: FRANCIS
D: Sure, here's some space.
N: Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to Nikki. Shep greets the bartender:
C: SHEP
D: Hello, Jean!
C: JEAN
D: Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert. Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [?]
C: FRANCIS
D: Martini!
C: BILL
D: Martini!
C: CARY
D: Martini!
C: SHEP
D: Martiniiii!
C: NIKKI
D: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
C: JEAN
D: Certainment, Mademoiselle. Quatre Martinis pour messieurs! Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle Nikki!
E: calls off
N: The men are all excited to find out her name. Francis uses a pretzel as a monocle to eye Nikki.
C: FRANCIS
D: Nikki?!
C: BILL
D: Nikki?!
C: CARY
D: Nikki?!
N: For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
C: SHEP
D: Can you imagine that, fellas? Her name is Nikki!
C: CARY
D: Her name is Nikki. She holds men's teeth. She sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.
E: considers the situation
C: BILL
D: Boys, she's gonna be a lot of trouble.
E: significantly
N: Drinks are served. A moment of silence as they imbibe. Nikki's hand shakes as she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. She laughs, embarrassed.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, my, my!
N: Shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs.
C: SHEP
D: Poor sweet! She can't even hold her glass!
N: Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, he has to use two hands.
E: casually
N: Nikki chuckles. A dark look crosses Cary's face as he looks at her and puts down his drink. Seeing this, Bill and Francis exchange worried glances. Cary abruptly rises and leaves the bar. Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep who is suddenly grim and annoyed.
C: SHEP
D: Course he can't hold his glass. His hands are burned.
C: NIKKI
D: Burned?
C: SHEP
D: You have no right to spill YOUR drinks. He can't help himself.
C: NIKKI
D: Burned? How burned?
C: SHEP
D: He brought a plane down on fire.
C: NIKKI
D: An airplane? In the war?
N: Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains:
C: SHEP
D: He held the stick. But his hands began to slip. Then he held it inside his arms. He was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive.
C: NIKKI
D: Did he bring him down safe?
C: SHEP
D: Well...
N: Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass.
C: SHEP
D: Brought him down.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, so that's why--?
C: SHEP
D: Yes! That's why he can't hold a glass.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, I'm so ashamed.
C: SHEP
D: Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. His nerves are tricky. You should never call attention to his hands.
C: AT A TABLE
D: Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable FRINK -- enters and greets him casually.
C: FRINK
D: Hi, Cary.
C: CARY
D: Oh, hello, Frink.
E: unhappily
N: Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for Francis and Bill.
C: FRINK
D: Hello, Francis. Bill.
N: Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused.
C: FRINK
D: Shep. Drunk again?
C: SHEP
D: Say, don't you know any OTHER opening remarks? It's about all we've heard from you for a year.
C: FRINK
D: Hi! Jean!
E: signals the bartender
N: Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for Frink's order in French.
C: FRINK
D: Un sidecar.
C: JEAN
D: Sidecar ... [?]
N: Jean moves off. Frink regards the others.
C: FRINK
D: Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work?
C: SHEP
D: Work? What kind of work?
C: FRINK
D: Oh, anything useful.
C: BILL
D: What could we do? Sell washing machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend old furniture or somethin'? Heh!
C: FRINK
D: Go back to flying. Fly the air mails.
C: BILL
D: Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.
C: FRANCIS
D: Maybe a small kite.
N: Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles.
C: FRINK
D: Well, there must be something you can do.
C: SHEP
D: We've got to tend to our drinking. We don't get much opportunity.
C: FRINK
D: Lots of things going on outside. Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around.
C: BILL
D: Say! Is that STILL going on?
C: SHEP
D: Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
E: laughs
N: During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and whispers to Shep.
C: FRINK
D: Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? Who's your swell friend?
C: SHEP
D: Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found scattered around.
N: Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:
C: SHEP
D: Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes away.
E: off Frink
N: Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. She raises her lorgnette for a better look at:
C: CARY
D: who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.
C: NIKKI
D: is pleased to see Cary.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh! He didn't go.
N: She rises to join him.
C: CARY
D: startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands...
N: She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor hands.
N: Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. Stunned, Nikki watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh!
N: But Shep intercepts her. Upset, she whimpers.
C: SHEP
D: If you aren't the WORST! First, you insult his hands and make him mad. Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious. Come on back here. Come on.
E: more in disbelief than anger
N: He clasps her hand and leads her to:
C: THE BAR
D: Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained face.
C: SHEP
D: Well, that's torn it. He'll never come back now.
C: NIKKI
D: Then we'll have to find him.
C: SHEP
D: What for?
C: NIKKI
D: To explain how sorry I am.
C: SHEP
D: We-ell. You don't have to get so emotional about it.
E: amused at her distress
C: NIKKI
D: Who's getting emotional?
C: SHEP
D: You are. You're coming all apart. Here. Take a drink of this. Make you laugh and play.
E: hands her a glass
N: Nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. Meanwhile, Bill leans in.
C: BILL
D: Say, what's she crying about?
E: to Shep
C: SHEP
D: She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning.
C: BILL
D: Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.
E: to Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: No.
E: agrees, sadly
C: ANOTHER VIEW
D: Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
C: SHEP
D: Let's go.
N: Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, toward the exit. Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go. Bill calls after Shep:
C: BILL
D: Hey! Where're you goin'?!
C: SHEP
D: Oh, out.
C: BILL
D: Out where?!
E: rises
N: SHEP (o.s.) Out to get a drink. Bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles.
C: BILL
D: Don't you suppose you could arrange that here?!
C: SHEP
D: Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
C: BILL
D: Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go somewheres else to get a drink.
E: without missing a beat
N: Francis and Bill head out the door. After a moment, Frink follows behind.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AVENUE DES CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: A taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk table.
C: BILL
D: Hey! There he is!
N: The others look.
C: SHEP
D: Where?
C: BILL
D: Come on!
N: The group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for:
C: THE SIDEWALK TABLE
D: where Cary sits reading a newspaper.
N: SHEP (o.s.) Cary! Cary looks up. He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. The others crowd around him.
C: BILL
D: Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?
C: CARY
D: Hello. Won't you sit down?
E: genuinely polite
C: BILL
D: Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think we'd do? Stand around?
N: They all take seats around the little table. During this, Frink brings a chair for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own. When he tries to use it to sit next to her, Bill commandeers it for himself.
C: BILL
D: Thank you.
E: with a wave, to Frink
N: A waiter joins them as they settle in.
C: SHEP
D: Hello, Cary.
C: CARY
D: Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have to drink?
C: FRANCIS
D: Martini!
C: BILL
D: Martini!
C: SHEP
D: Martini!
C: FRINK
D: Martini!
C: WAITER
D: Quatre Martinis?
C: NIKKI
D: Uh, could I have champagne, please?
C: WAITER
D: Champagne? Oui.
N: The waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look.
C: BILL
D: Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
C: NIKKI
D: That's what I started on. It upsets me if I change over to anything else.
E: explains, to Bill to Cary
C: CARY
D: There's a lot of things wrong with this one. What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway?
E: to Bill to Nikki
C: SHEP
D: Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there?
C: FRANCIS
D: There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.
C: NIKKI
D: Can't read signs.
C: SHEP
D: Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.
C: BILL
D: Do you think she's good-lookin' enough?
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but--
C: CARY
D: But what?
C: NIKKI
D: But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon.
N: Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying to start a fire.
C: BILL
D: Then there's her drinking.
C: NIKKI
D: What's the matter with my drinking?
C: BILL
D: You're a sissy drinker.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, maybe I can improve.
N: Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth.
C: BILL
D: Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 'em is turned sideways.
C: NIKKI
D: You mean this one?
E: points
C: BILL
D: That's it.
C: CARY
D: Why don't you have it turned around?
C: NIKKI
D: I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.
C: CARY
D: Well, in what respect does it kind of help?
C: NIKKI
D: Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don't let anyone kiss me -- hard.
N: The men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne.
C: CARY
D: Well, we'll let that pass.
N: Bill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
C: NIKKI
D: Where's he gone?
C: CARY
D: Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
C: BILL
D: Now, about your nose.
C: NIKKI
D: What about my nose?
C: BILL
D: It isn't straight. It kind of turns up at the end.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped by a swing.
C: CARY
D: How'd you happen to get bumped?
C: NIKKI
D: I just walked through the gate. I was only seven.
C: CARY
D: Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?
C: NIKKI
D: I can't see very far.
C: CARY
D: Did it hurt?
C: NIKKI
D: It made me dizzy all day.
C: CARY
D: Well, I guess we can't hold that against her.
C: BILL
D: We all make mistakes.
C: CARY
D: That's right. Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel.
N: Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful.
C: NIKKI
D: All the same, he'd look funny the other way -- even in a painting.
N: They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
C: NIKKI
D: Where's he gone?
C: BILL
D: He went off to shave a horse.
C: CARY
D: Have you got a husband or anything?
C: NIKKI
D: No husband.
C: CARY
D: A mother?
C: NIKKI
D: Mother, yes. But we haven't met in quite a long time.
C: CARY
D: Why not in a long time?
C: NIKKI
D: Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah. Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah. So I changed it to Jane. And that's how it all began.
N: An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:
C: FRANCIS
D: the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.
C: AT THE TABLE
D: Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask:
C: BILL
D: He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
C: NIKKI
D: Who is he, anyway?
C: CARY
D: Francis used to fly with us in the 94th. The best shot in the squadron. Brought down twelve planes. Used to call him "Sudden Death." He lost interest after his teammate got killed. He's lonesome is all.
C: NIKKI
D: I like him.
C: CARY
D: He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.
C: NIKKI
D: What kind of chimes?
C: CARY
D: Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and Whittington.
C: NIKKI
D: I'll take vanilla.
N: Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis.
C: BILL
D: I think he's a washout.
C: SHEP
D: Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American--
C: NIKKI
D: All-American what?
E: interrupts
C: SHEP
D: Halfback.
C: FRINK
D: Where?
C: CARY
D: Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill -- the Alabama Flash?
N: Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.
C: NIKKI
D: I think it's a forgery.
E: skeptical
N: Bill's face falls. He looks at Nikki.
C: BILL
D: Say! What do you want me to do? Tackle a horse?
N: She nods. Shep is amused.
C: SHEP
D: Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
C: BILL
D: All right, all right, I'll tackle a horse.
E: with a dismissive wave
N: Shep looks down the street.
C: SHEP
D: Here comes one now.
N: They all look to see:
C: A HORSE-DRAWN CAB
D: rolling down the street in their direction.
C: AT THE TABLE
D: Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.
C: BILL
D: Look out, horse!
C: THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB
D: rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.
C: ON THE SIDEWALK
D: Cary, horrified, stands and yells:
C: CARY
D: Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
N: Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, Bill!
E: distraught
C: AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB
D: Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.
C: CARY
D: Hey! What's the idea -- runnin' down my friend like that? Here!
N: Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in French but takes the cash.
C: WIDER VIEW
D: of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
C: CARY
D: Never mind. Look where you're going in the future now. You just watch out where you're going!
C: ANOTHER VIEW
D: Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
C: CARY
D: Now listen, come on out here, you old fool. Whoa, whoa.
E: admonishes Bill to the shying horse
C: BILL
D: Nice horsie.
C: CARY
D: Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You old fool! You know what you'll do? You'll kill yourself one of these days. Now, come on, get out of here. Now, listen--
E: to Bill
N: Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk.
C: CARY
D: You all right now, brother?
E: to the driver
N: The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.
C: CARY
D: All right. Now, you just keep your horse, see? You got your money.
N: The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse. BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his seat. They all sit down under the following:
C: CARY
D: Hey, listen, Bill, you're All- American, see? You're TWO All- Americans! The lady's convinced you're the whole team. You don't have to tackle any more horses. How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
C: BILL
D: Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
E: pleased with himself
N: Nikki abruptly rises.
C: SHEP
D: Hey! Where are you going?
C: NIKKI
D: Would you all excuse me for a moment?
C: CARY
D: Well, where are you going?
C: NIKKI
D: To take a Chinese singing lesson.
E: a grave announcement
N: Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an olive in the air and cheers:
C: FRANCIS
D: Hooray!
N: The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs:
C: MEN
D: Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
C: NIKKI
D: walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room.
C: BACK AT THE TABLE
D: Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile.
C: BILL
D: Hey. What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is?
N: Cary glances in Nikki's direction and tells Bill confidentially:
C: CARY
D: I think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records.
N: Bill thinks about this and nods.
C: INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
D: As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a wall, blocking her way.
C: FRINK
D: Say, Nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves. These crazy fools are liable to do anything.
C: NIKKI
D: Do you think so?
E: hopeful
C: FRINK
D: Since the war, they don't care what happens.
C: NIKKI
D: And do you?
C: FRINK
D: I'll say so. I've got more important things to think of.
C: NIKKI
D: What more important things?
C: FRINK
D: Well, my work.
C: NIKKI
D: What kind of work?
C: FRINK
D: I'm the foreign correspondent for a New York newspaper syndicate.
C: NIKKI
D: How nice for you!
E: genuinely
N: Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table. Frink watches her go, a dark look on his face. BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits.
C: FRANCIS
D: Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records?
N: Nikki lowers her eyes.
C: NIKKI
D: People shouldn't leave their records lying about.
E: a bit defensively
C: CARY
D: What did I tell you?
E: to Francis
C: NIKKI
D: Take me dancing?
E: abruptly brightens
C: BILL
D: What place you wanna go?
C: NIKKI
D: What places you got?
C: CARY
D: Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too early. We've got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal Tabarin.
C: NIKKI
D: I'll take vanilla.
N: Cary gives her a look. Bill clears his throat.
C: BILL
D: Somebody pay for the drinks!
N: Bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm.
C: BILL
D: We're off in a "billizzard" of horse-radish!
N: Whatever that means. The men rise and retrieve their hats.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: A festive Parisian night spot. Dance MUSIC plays while a floor show, lit by moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her lorgnette. The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls to form a line and do some precision high-kicking. The music continues but the dance apparently ends and the lights come up. Impressed, Nikki is breathless.
C: NIKKI
D: My, my! Isn't this nice?!
N: Nearby, the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low balcony. Cary and Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to the others (Frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "Kiss-Me-Quick" who appears in this scene only; Shep and Nikki).
C: BILL
D: Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya something funny.
N: Cary and Francis look doubtful about this. Bill sits at the table.
C: BILL
D: I was only four years old once.
C: FRANCIS
D: What'd he say?
E: to Cary
C: CARY
D: Said he was only four years old once.
C: FRANCIS
D: Amazing.
C: BILL
D: And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
C: FRANCIS
D: What'd he say?
E: to Cary
C: CARY
D: Said his aunt had on a very low-neck dress.
C: FRANCIS
D: Can't believe it.
C: BILL
D: And she sat right across the table in front of me. And I said, "Auntie -- I can see your knees!"
N: Nobody laughs or even changes expression.
C: CARY
D: I wonder what's doing in Portugal tonight.
E: pointedly, after an awkward pause
N: Bill is disappointed at the response.
C: BILL
D: Maybe I'd better do my match trick.
C: NIKKI
D: If you do match tricks, I'll recite.
C: CARY
D: Recite what?
C: NIKKI
D: Poetry.
C: CARY
D: Whose poetry?
C: NIKKI
D: My poetry.
C: CARY
D: You write poetry?
C: NIKKI
D: I'll send you a photograph of my poetry.
N: Cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and Nikki. He gestures at the bottle as he sits back down.
C: CARY
D: Say, I wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that.
N: Everybody cracks up -- except Nikki, who looks a little hurt. An empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT
N: By now, a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the floor. CLOSE SHOT - FRINK'S HAND strays to Nikki's legs and up her dress.
C: WIDER
D: Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink.
C: NIKKI
D: Just what ARE your plans?
C: WIDER STILL
D: The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and stare darkly at Frink.
C: SHEP
D: You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki. He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good time.
N: Frink nervously adjusts his necktie. Cary glares at him.
C: CARY
D: Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy. Have I made myself clear?
N: Frink, pretending chagrin, looks at Nikki.
C: FRINK
D: All right. My mistake. I'm sorry.
C: CARY
D: You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He's just a licentious old man.
C: NIKKI
D: It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
C: CARY
D: Do you want to go home, Nikki? I'll take you home. Where do you live?
E: rises
C: NIKKI
D: Hotel Carlton.
N: The others, except for Frink, begin to rise, too. Shep pays the waiter.
C: BILL
D: I'll take her home, too.
C: FRANCIS
D: So will I!
C: SHEP
D: We'll match to see who takes her home!
C: BILL
D: Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her home.
C: CARY
D: I saw her first.
C: BILL
D: It makes no difference. She belongs to us all now!
N: Nikki laughs as they all depart. Frink rises wearily to follow them out.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOTEL CARLTON - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says, "Wheeee!" Others say, "Ssshhh!" They cross to the front desk.
C: AT THE FRONT DESK
D: The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk. Nikki is about to wake him when Bill bounds forward.
C: BILL
D: Sh! Let him sleep. What's your number?
E: quietly, to Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: Eighty-eight.
E: whispers
N: Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. Once they've gone, Bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands -- with a little noise -- on the other side, without waking the clerk. He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, then fetches Nikki's key from its cubbyhole. Bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then silently slides off the desk to the floor. Watching the sleeping clerk warily, Bill tiptoes away. At the last possible moment, Bill purposefully WHACKS the signal bell with his hand, making it RING noisily. The clerk awakens with a start and grabs a nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view.
C: IN THE HOTEL ELEVATOR
D: Amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur". Last one in is Bill who shuts the door and the metal safety gate behind him.
C: BILL
D: Here we are. Goin' up!
C: CARY
D: Who's gonna pilot this craft?
C: BILL
D: I'll take her off. Where's the throttle?
N: Bill looks for the controls as Cary turns playfully to the others.
C: CARY
D: Got your safety belts buckled?
N: SHEP & OTHERS Mm hmm. Bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold.
C: BILL
D: Here it is. Contact?
C: SHEP
D: Contact!
N: Bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft.
C: BILL
D: We're off!
N: Most everybody cheers. They watch with great interest as the floors pass by rapidly.
C: FRANCIS
D: Shut her off!
C: CARY
D: Hold her nose! She's headed for the hangar!
C: SHEP
D: Hey, stop it, will ya?
E: nervous
C: NIKKI
D: We've gone an' passed my floor.
C: BILL
D: Gone an' passed your floor? I'll fix that.
N: Bill brakes the car and starts it back down the shaft.
C: SHEP
D: Put her tail down!
C: CARY
D: Bail out, boys! She's gonna crash!
C: FRANCIS
D: Wheeeee!
C: FRINK
D: Stop it! Stop it!
E: nervous
C: NIKKI
D: We've gone an' passed my floor again.
C: BILL
D: Say! How do you stop this thing?
N: Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and everyone loses their footing, nearly falling down. Part of the light fixture above them breaks loose and crashes down on Frink's head, much to everyone's amusement -- they laugh as Frink clutches his head, annoyed.
C: FRINK
D: That's right, laugh.
C: CARY
D: We should've brought our parachutes!
C: BILL
D: Get a good hold, Millie. We're off again.
N: Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of Bill's jacket and pulls him away.
C: SHEP
D: Nothing doing! Let Cary take the controls. You'll run us through the roof.
N: Bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt.
C: BILL
D: All right, all right.
C: CARY
D: All set?
C: SHEP
D: Let her go!
N: The car starts up the shaft again.
C: NIKKI
D: Hurray!
N: SHEP & FRANCIS Hurray!
C: CARY
D: There we are.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - FIFTH FLOOR - MINUTES LATER - LONG TRAVELING SHOT
N: The elevator door opens. Cary leads the way as everyone else spills out happily into the hall. Shep puts a congratulatory arm around Cary.
C: SHEP
D: Say! That's a pilot for ya.
C: BILL
D: You deserve a medal.
N: Bill pins Nikki's room key to Cary's vest pocket. Smiling, Cary holds it up proudly to Nikki.
C: BILL
D: All right, come on, men.
N: They head down the hallway in a drunken, disorganized fashion. Shep walks an imaginary tightrope, wobbling spectacularly. Cary, bringing up the rear, shuts the elevator door and escorts Nikki.
C: FRANCIS
D: I need a rest, I need a rest.
N: Francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but Bill immediately hauls him up:
C: BILL
D: Come on, come on.
N: Bill, whistling and pretending to ice skate, leads the group down the hall. Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway. Bill backtracks to help Frink escort Francis. This allows Cary and Nikki to take the lead. Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary.
C: NIKKI
D: Right here.
C: CARY
D: Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!
N: The group cheers. Cary unlocks the door. The group enters Nikki's hotel room.
S: INT. NIKKI'S HOTEL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Laughing, the group files into the darkened room and spreads out.
C: SHEP
D: Wheeeee!
N: Nikki switches on the lights. Bill marvels at the luxurious suite.
C: BILL
D: Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--! Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment!
C: SHEP
D: And a gramophone!
N: Delighted, Shep starts to crank up the gramophone.
C: CARY
D: Yeah! And chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything.
E: unimpressed
C: FRANCIS
D: So THIS is where Nikki lives!
N: Amused and pleased by their reaction, Nikki heads for her bedroom.
C: NIKKI
D: Yes, this is where Nikki lives.
N: Shep picks up a book and admires it grandly.
C: SHEP
D: And she's got a book!
N: The gramophone comes to life and MUSIC plays from a record. Nikki passes into the bedroom and switches on a light.
C: FRANCIS
D: Got all the comforts of home.
N: Frink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill pointedly intercepts him. Disappointed, Frink looks past him into Nikki's bedroom and Bill follows his gaze to see:
C: PERFUME BOTTLES
D: on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them.
C: BILL
D: Hey! Look at all the bottles!
N: Bill enters and inspects the table closely.
C: NIKKI'S BEDROOM
D: as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter.
C: BILL
D: Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's bottles!
N: Cary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and reads the label.
C: BILL
D: Ylang! Ylang!
C: CARY
D: Hey, don't be handlin' her things. Put 'em down.
N: But Bill goes right on, delighted. The others crowd around the table.
C: BILL
D: Chichi!
C: CARY
D: Leave 'em alone.
C: BILL
D: Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale! Jinko!
C: SHEP
D: Hey, you big bombardier--
C: BILL
D: Chiki chiki!
N: During this, Francis has casually inspected a curtained walk-in closet near the table. He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines.
C: FRANCIS
D: Say, I never saw so many shoes.
N: The others gather to peer into the closet. Frink loses interest immediately but whistles at the sight of Nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. He moves to it eagerly. Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as Frink picks up her silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. Bill pointedly takes the gown out of Frink's hand. Tight-lipped, Frink stares at him. Suddenly, Bill points to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table.
C: BILL
D: Look!
N: Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table.
C: BILL
D: She never winds her clock! It says eleven and I've never been anywheres at eleven.
E: picks up the clock
N: Nikki removes her earrings as Frink walks off and Cary takes a seat at the foot of the bed.
C: CARY
D: What time are you anywhere?
E: dry, to Bill
N: Bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear, listening.
C: BILL
D: Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock in my life. Hey, listen. Besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks, she never winds her clock! Think I'll go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste.
E: to Cary, ignoring Nikki
N: Bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to Nikki.
C: BILL
D: Is it all right?
C: NIKKI
D: Help yourself.
N: Bill disappears into the bathroom, leaving Nikki and Cary sitting on the bed. Nikki peers at Cary through her lorgnette.
C: NIKKI
D: Hello.
E: friendly, sympathetic
C: CARY
D: Hello, yourself.
E: grins
N: The phonograph MUSIC ends just as Bill's voice calls from the bathroom. BILL (o.s.) (excited) TURTLES! Cary turns toward the bathroom.
C: CARY
D: Turtles?
N: SHEP (o.s.) Turtles? Shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom. Cary rises from the bed to follow. Nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement. HIGH ANGLE SHOT - TWO TURTLES swimming in shallow water at the bottom of a bathtub. A couple of decorative lily pads lie next to the drain. The turtles' shells are inlayed with brilliants.
C: BATHROOM
D: Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him. Bill points out his discovery to the others.
C: BILL
D: Turtles!
C: OTHERS
D: Turtles?!
C: SHEP
D: It IS turtles!
E: thrilled
N: Francis picks up a turtle and shows it to Cary.
C: FRANCIS
D: Hey! Look, Cary! It's turtles!
N: Cary examines the turtle for a moment, placing a finger on it.
C: CARY
D: Nice work, boys. It's turtles.
E: with a nod
N: Cary and Francis inspect the turtle.
C: BATHROOM DOORWAY
D: Nikki enters and addresses the men.
C: NIKKI
D: And now do you suppose you could all excuse me?
N: Cary joins her.
C: NIKKI
D: On account of I'd like to go to bed.
C: CARY
D: Sure we'll excuse you. I'll clear everybody out of here. Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to go to bed.
E: to the others
C: AT THE BATHTUB
D: The other men, still lined up at the tub enjoying the turtles, are disappointed.
C: BILL
D: Go to bed?
C: SHEP
D: Awww! Bed?
N: They rise reluctantly. Bill shakes water off his hand.
C: BILL
D: Yup, all right.
N: They file out of the bathroom.
C: SHEP
D: So long, turtles.
E: waves to the turtles
C: BILL
D: Good night, turtles.
C: FRANCIS
D: Night, turtles.
N: Frink follows the others humorlessly, without a word to the turtles. TRACKING SHOT - THROUGH THE SUITE The entire group exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into the sitting room.
C: BILL
D: Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to sleep?
C: NIKKI
D: Mm hm.
E: nods
C: SHEP
D: Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!
C: BILL
D: Well, good night.
E: with a wave, to Nikki
N: As Bill enters the sitting room, he looks around and hurries away toward something he sees off screen. Shep and Francis follow.
C: SHEP
D: Nighty-night, Nikki.
E: with a wave
N: Francis says nothing.
C: FRINK
D: Good night, Nikki.
N: Frink is the last out the bedroom door, though Cary stays behind to linger a moment with Nikki.
C: SITTING ROOM
D: Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep.
C: BILL
D: Ah!
E: satisfied
N: Shep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him. Frink watches Francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it.
C: AT THE BEDROOM DOOR
D: Nikki and Cary stand close, exchanging warm goodnights.
C: NIKKI
D: Good night, Cary.
E: dead serious
C: CARY
D: Good night, Nikki.
E: playful
N: Cary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into the bedroom and shut the door. He turns from the door to see: LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM Four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: Bill and Shep on the sofa, Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table. Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and yawning as only a narcoleptic can.
C: BILL
D: Say! I like this place.
C: FRANCIS
D: Say, I like this place, too.
C: SHEP
D: I think it's swell.
C: CARY
D: peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips.
N: FRINK (o.s.) It suits me.
C: CARY
D: You fellas think you're gonna PARK here?
N: BILL (o.s.) Sure! FRANCIS (o.s.) Sure. Cary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see:
C: NIKKI
D: opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some towels.
C: NIKKI
D: Will somebody please scrub my back?
E: innocently
N: LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM Excited again, Bill jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process.
C: BILL
D: Will somebody scrub your back?! Look out, boys!
N: The men struggle to their feet and follow him to:
C: NIKKI
D: holds the bottle in her hand. The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker than the others and commandeers it with authority.
C: BILL
D: I got it, I got it, I got it.
N: From over Nikki's nearly bare back, we watch Bill whistling jauntily as he shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel.
C: CARY
D: now seated, watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it.
C: BILL AND NIKKI
D: Bill examines Nikki's back with delight.
C: BILL
D: Mmmmmm mm!
E: impressed
N: His eyes pop. For Nikki, though, this is an asexual activity.
C: NIKKI
D: Scrub hard.
N: Bill places her head on his left shoulder and prepares to scrub with his right.
C: BILL
D: Did anyone ever see such a back in their life?
N: He scrubs a little.
C: BILL
D: Did anyone ever HEAR of such a thing?
N: More scrubbing -- his tongue sticks out of his mouth as he studies his work.
C: SHEP, FRINK AND FRANCIS
D: watch all this with envy and interest.
N: BILL (o.s.) Just look at that back. Just look at that thing, won't you?
C: BILL AND NIKKI
D: Bill keeps scrubbing, adopting the air of a professional back scrubber.
C: NIKKI
D: Harder.
N: He lifts her hair to inspect her neck.
C: BILL
D: My, my!
N: He scrubs her neck.
C: BILL
D: I could go on doin' this a long time.
N: More scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: To Nikki's bewilderment, Bill pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince. She places her head on his shoulder again. More scrubbing. TRACKING SHOT - SITTING ROOM We start on Cary, who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching Bill and Nikki with amusement. After a pause:
C: CARY
D: Nikki? Are you rich?
C: NIKKI
D: Well, practically. Beulah is rich.
C: CARY
D: Well, just how rich IS your mother?
C: NIKKI
D: Leave a lady a few secrets, can't you?
N: By now, we've pulled back far enough to take in the whole group. Bill finishes his scrubbing and Nikki adjusts her robe.
C: NIKKI
D: Thank you, William. That was EVER so cool and nice. Good night.
E: takes bottle and towels from him
C: BILL
D: Good night.
C: NIKKI
D: Good night.
E: to the others
C: THE MEN
D: Good night, Nikki.
N: They watch her move off. We hear the bedroom door close. Bill realizes something, snaps his fingers, claps his hands and starts off.
C: BILL
D: Come on, fellas!
N: He rushes off. Shep, Francis and Frink rise and follow. Cary merely collects his hat and cane and heads for the front door. SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW Bill and Shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of Nikki's closed bedroom door. Francis brings his rug and pillow.
C: CARY
D: watches them, amused, from the front door.
C: CARY
D: You're gonna stay here, huh?
N: SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW The men settle in for the night.
C: BILL
D: That's right! She might need some more help!
E: to Cary
N: Bill waves good night and collapses on the sofa. Frink, glancing at Cary, brings his chair and sits in it. Francis lies on the floor. Shep fluffs pillows on the sofa, etc.
C: CARY
D: turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front door and exits the darkened room, closing the door behind him.
T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: INT. CARLTON BAR - NEXT MORNING
N: The drinking hole in Nikki's hotel. A French woman noisily arranges dirty drinking glasses as Bill, Francis and Shep enter -- horribly hungover, moaning and yawning -- and line up at the bar. A bartender greets them to take their order.
C: BARTENDER
D: Messieurs.
C: SHEP
D: Morning.
C: FRANCIS
D: Morning.
C: BILL
D: Um, prairie oyster.
C: SHEP
D: Prairie oyster.
N: Shep has to nudge Francis with an elbow.
C: FRANCIS
D: Prairie oyster.
C: BARTENDER
D: Prairie oyster for three.
N: Bartender moves off. Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses. CARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men:
C: SHEP
D: Say, we'd better get back to our hotel.
C: FRANCIS
D: There's no Nikki at our hotel.
C: BILL
D: That's right.
C: SHEP
D: And the bar doesn't open so early.
C: BILL
D: Say! Why don't we move in here?
C: FRANCIS
D: Sure. Let's stay here.
C: BILL
D: But - what about Cary?
C: FRANCIS
D: What about Cary?
E: to Shep
C: SHEP
D: What ABOUT Cary?
E: to Francis
N: Francis shakes his head, he has no idea.
C: BILL
D: We can move him in, too.
N: Francis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.
C: SHEP
D: Not a bad idea!
N: Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." The three men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.
C: BILL
D: Well, come on, men. Let's go.
E: cheerfully
T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATER THAT DAY
N: Phonograph music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel's specialist in Chinois Pedicure, paints Nikki's toenails. We PAN UP to discover Nikki wearing a robe, sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the door.
C: NIKKI
D: Entrez!
E: wearily
C: THE FRONT DOOR
D: opens and Bill, looking dapper, enters.
C: BILL
D: Hi, Nik!
N: Then, Shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of flowers.
C: SHEP
D: Hello, Nikki!
N: Next, Francis enters, sleepily.
C: FRANCIS
D: Hello.
E: in mid-yawn
N: Finally, Cary, who closes the door behind him.
C: CARY
D: Good morning, Nikki.
N: The men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober. Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot in the room. He lies down and shuts his eyes. NIKKI (o.s.) Hello, Bill. Hello, Shep. Hello, Cary. Hello, Francis.
C: FRANCIS
D: Morning, Nikki.
E: from the sofa
C: NIKKI
D: I didn't expect to see you all so early.
N: Shep puts the flowers in a vase.
C: BILL
D: We camped on your doorsteps last night. And this morning we all moved in.
N: Cary leans over her affectionately.
C: CARY
D: Despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you. We've decided to adopt you.
N: Bill and Shep kneel next to Nikki. Bill notices the toenail painting.
C: BILL
D: Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at Nikki! What are you having done to yourself, gal?
C: SHEP
D: Whatcha having your toes painted for, Nikki?
N: Cary stands behind Nikki as she looks down at her toes.
C: NIKKI
D: I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
E: looks at Bill and Shep
N: Cary smiles. Nikki, Bill and Shep share a laugh. The Asian woman goes right on painting as Bill and Shep study Nikki's legs. During this, Nikki hands her cigarette to Cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window.
C: BILL
D: Why, look at Nikki's legs, would you? That there is practically the loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in all my born days.
C: NIKKI
D: Like my legs?
N: Cary stares out the window at a rainy day.
C: SHEP
D: Look at those legs, Cary. My, they nearly match.
N: Cary turns from the window.
C: SHEP
D: Did you ever see such a swell set of legs?
C: CARY
D: Well, what do you want me to do about it? Burst into tears?
C: SHEP
D: Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to burst into tears?
C: NIKKI
D: On account of my legs? Oh! I think that would be sweet.
E: looks at her legs turns to Cary, heartfelt
N: Cary manages a slight grin. As he does, there's a knock at the door. Everyone hollers, "Entrez!" Shep runs to the door and opens it.
C: SHEP
D: Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!
N: The others cheer happily. Two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with already poured drinks. Shep hands a glass to Nikki.
C: SHEP
D: Here, Nikki, drink this.
C: CARY
D: Make you laugh and play.
C: NIKKI
D: That's what I want to do, laugh and play.
N: Shep hands Bill a glass. Francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. He polishes off one and then the other. He leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off. Cary, Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -- all have drinks. The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. Bill proposes a toast.
C: BILL
D: Here's to Nikki's dainty legs. As smooth and hairless as an egg.
C: SHEP
D: Wheee!
C: CARY
D: Hurray!
C: NIKKI
D: 'Ray!
N: They drink. Another knock at the door. They all yell, "Entrez!" The door opens to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other men with Nikki. The others are not happy to see him, either.
C: CARY
D: Well! Here comes that licentious old man. Who invited him?
N: Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he enters.
C: FRINK
D: Still drinking?
E: sneering
C: CARY
D: How can you tell?
E: shakes his head mockingly
N: Cary watches Frink approach Nikki.
C: FRINK
D: Morning, Nikki.
N: After a pause, Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize him. Then she peers at him through her lorgnette.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, it's you. Won't you sit down?
E: after a pause, reluctantly polite
C: FRINK
D: Thank you.
N: Frink moves off to find a chair. Shep sets down his drink and follows him. Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him.
C: SHEP
D: Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.
C: FRINK
D: Oh, no?
C: SHEP
D: No. What do you wanna hang around for?
C: FRINK
D: Well, what do YOU hang around for?
C: SHEP
D: Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some posies. I'll bet you didn't bring Nikki any posies.
C: FRINK
D: I-- Well--
N: During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to Frink.
C: BILL
D: Have a drink?
C: FRINK
D: No, thanks.
C: SHEP
D: Cure the shakes.
C: FRINK
D: I haven't got the shakes.
C: CARY
D: Let's see. Hold out your hands.
N: Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up.
C: CARY
D: No, turn them over.
N: Frink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, impressed.
C: CARY
D: Say, that's pretty good.
N: Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.
C: CARY
D: Let's see if you can hold this.
N: Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full glass with ease.
C: CARY
D: Say, that's great.
N: Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration.
C: CARY
D: Steady as a rock!
N: Frink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them. Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her.
C: CARY
D: Well, I guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while.
N: Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.
C: FRINK
D: Hey. Take these off.
N: But the others simply ignore him.
C: CARY
D: Now, let's see. Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?
C: BILL
D: We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
C: CARY
D: That's right. We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, too.
N: The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises.
C: WOMAN
D: Finis.
N: The men cheer, "Yay!" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs.
C: SHEP
D: Let's inspect the job.
N: But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too close.
N: Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it.
C: CARY
D: Well, what's the matter with your toes?
N: Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.
C: NIKKI
D: Well... when I was a little girl...
N: A worried look crosses Cary's face.
C: NIKKI
D: ... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... And they were WAY too short. ...
N: Shep and Bill listen soberly.
C: NIKKI
D: ... And I had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back. ... Down the road. ... And it was hot and dusty.
C: BILL
D: Oh, take her away! She's breakin' my heart!
E: hand to his face sobs
C: NIKKI
D: And when I got home ... my toes were spoiled.
C: CARY
D: Oh, dear, oh, dear.
E: on the verge of tears
C: SHEP
D: That's such a sad story. Let's all have a drink, quick!
N: Their eyes pop. The men jump up eagerly and run off. Nikki, thoroughly nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around a tray and start imbibing. Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses that are still balanced on his hands. For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet. She walks over to the drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary.
C: NIKKI
D: And now would you all excuse me? On account of I'm gonna put on a dress.
C: CARY
D: Well, why not?
N: Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. The men continue to stand around the tray, drinking. In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa. Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps off the sofa. The others stare at him.
C: SHEP
D: My, my. What's HE getting so excited about?
N: Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his pocket.
C: FRINK
D: You guys think you're so darn smart.
N: Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this. Cary consults his pocket watch.
C: CARY
D: Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off.
N: Bill waves goodbye. Cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for the front door.
C: CARY
D: See ya later.
N: Cary exits as Nikki's voice drifts in from: THE OPEN BEDROOM DOORWAY NIKKI (o.s.) What are the plans for the day? Shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door.
C: SHEP
D: Well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer.
N: NIKKI (o.s.) How about Cary?
C: SHEP
D: Went to get his hat and coat. He's going to Père Lachaise.
N: NIKKI (o.s.) Père Lachaise? What's Père Lachaise?
C: SHEP
D: A cemetery. How 'bout you coming with us?
N: NIKKI (o.s.) No. I'm going with Cary.
C: SHEP
D: You've been invited?
E: concerned
N: Nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out.
C: NIKKI
D: Do you think Cary might object?
C: SHEP
D: Well, I have an idea he'd like to be alone.
C: NIKKI
D: Why alone?
C: SHEP
D: Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's as brittle as a breadstick. One silly crack from you and he might break up in sections.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, then, I don't think he should be left alone. Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
E: thinks about this beat
C: SHEP
D: What are we all doing in Paris?
C: NIKKI
D: I know. But why doesn't he go home?
C: SHEP
D: Well, he's not ready to go home. What could he do if he went home? Have people cry over his hands?
C: NIKKI
D: Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this. He's such a sweet soul.
C: SHEP
D: One of the best.
C: NIKKI
D: Isn't he just sort of wasting himself?
C: SHEP
D: On the contrary. He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.
N: Lost in thought, Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows her to:
C: THE FRONT DOOR
D: Shep stops Nikki from leaving. She's a little downcast as he admonishes her:
C: SHEP
D: Now, listen. If you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say. Don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him. And, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear?
E: with a chuckle
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of such a thing?
E: earnest
N: Nikki opens the front door and exits into:
C: THE HALLWAY
D: where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki calling to him. She runs to join him.
C: NIKKI
D: Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you.
N: Without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look down at her shoes.
C: NIKKI
D: Oooh! Ooh, wait for Nikki!
E: to Cary
N: She leaves him and runs back to:
C: THE FRONT DOOR
D: of her suite where Shep still stands. He watches with surprise as Nikki runs in.
C: NIKKI
D: Wait for Nikki!
E: calls back to Cary
N: Puzzled, Shep follows Nikki who rushes to:
C: HER BEDROOM CLOSET
D: Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes. Shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of red ones.
C: SHEP
D: What are you changing your shoes for?
C: NIKKI
D: On account of I can walk faster in red shoes.
N: Shep watches her hop and scurry off.
T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: EXT. AVENUE CASIMIR-PERIER - LATER THAT DAY
N: Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk café -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez ici."), looks at the rain.
C: CARY
D: Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.
E: to Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: Could we sit down here, do you suppose?
C: CARY
D: I think so. Would you like something to drink?
N: They move toward the café. As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.
C: NIKKI
D: What should I drink now, do you suppose?
N: Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table.
C: CARY
D: Deux picon citrons.
E: to the waiter
N: The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following:
C: NIKKI
D: Picon citrons?
C: CARY
D: Very refreshing. Make you laugh and play.
C: NIKKI
D: That's what you always promise. Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?
E: amused suddenly serious
C: CARY
D: Don't we all?
C: NIKKI
D: Not like Shep.
C: CARY
D: Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.
C: NIKKI
D: But isn't there some kind of treatment or something?
C: CARY
D: Shep could never stand a long course of treatment. Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. So he stays tight.
N: The waiter arrives with the drinks. As he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki. The waiter leaves and they drink.
C: NIKKI
D: Seems such a pity. How did he get the tic?
C: CARY
D: In the war.
C: NIKKI
D: I know. But how?
C: CARY
D: Well, it's not very romantic.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, don't tell me if you don't want to.
C: CARY
D: Well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit.
C: NIKKI
D: Yes?
C: CARY
D: Lice under his bandages.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh.
C: CARY
D: He had the devil of a time. He nearly lost his mind. So you'll have to excuse him a little.
C: NIKKI
D: I'm so sorry for Shep.
C: CARY
D: Well, don't let him know it.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?
C: CARY
D: Not ever. Not in his dark glasses anyway.
C: NIKKI
D: Can't something be done for him?
C: CARY
D: He'll have to be - reborn.
C: NIKKI
D: How's he going to end?
C: CARY
D: Well, how are you going to end? How am I going to end? How is ANYONE going to end? How's your picon citron go?
C: NIKKI
D: It goes fine. But doesn't ANYTHING make any difference to you?
C: CARY
D: Not now. A long time ago, perhaps, when I was a little boy.
C: NIKKI
D: Tell me, where were you little?
C: CARY
D: In Minnesota. On a farm.
C: NIKKI
D: Were you happy then, Cary?
C: CARY
D: I think so.
C: NIKKI
D: Tell me, what WAS there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota?
C: CARY
D: Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom. The smell of burning leaves in the fall. The sound of horses' hoofs on the road. Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice? Or explore old trunks in an attic? Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind? See a gypsy caravan?
E: lost in thought looks at Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: So THAT'S why you were happy. On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?
E: enthralled
C: CARY
D: That's right.
N: Nikki exhales, drinks, looks at Cary and shakes her head.
C: NIKKI
D: But aren't you going back? Not ever?
C: CARY
D: Would you like another picon citron before you go? The rain is lifting.
N: Nikki finishes the last of her drink.
C: NIKKI
D: No. I'm ready now.
N: Cary leaves some money, Nikki gathers her things. They rise and walk off.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. CEMETERY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON
N: Cary and Nikki stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around. The rain has stopped. They are the only living people in the ancient cemetery.
C: NIKKI
D: Who all is buried here?
C: CARY
D: Oh, poets, painters, philosophers--
C: NIKKI
D: Cocoanut?
C: CARY
D: No cocoanut. Poets, painters, philosophers, musicians.
N: They've paused. Cary looks around, points with his cane.
C: CARY
D: There's Chopin.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, I practiced him.
N: He gives her a look and they move on.
C: CARY
D: And there's Balzac. And there's Héloïse and Abélard.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, tell me about Abélise and Éloard.
C: CARY
D: No, Nikki. Not Abélise and Éloard. Héloïse and Abélard.
C: NIKKI
D: I'm sorry. I really didn't do it on purpose. It was on account of the picon citron. Tell me about Héloïse and Abélard.
C: CARY
D: Well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side.
C: NIKKI
D: Why are they buried side by side?
N: They stop.
C: CARY
D: They were the world's most famous lovers. There's the tomb.
E: looks off, points with his cane
N: They approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate. Cary removes his hat, Nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette.
C: NIKKI
D: Tell me about the world's most famous lovers.
C: CARY
D: Well, Abélard was a scholastic philosopher--
C: NIKKI
D: Whatever that is.
C: CARY
D: Whatever that is. He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called Héloïse. And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of-- Well, betrayal. Not, however, unmixed with real love. He carried her off to Brittany.
C: NIKKI
D: Tell me more.
C: CARY
D: Well, her uncle was furious. He blamed Abélard for the whole thing. He conceived a terrible revenge.
C: NIKKI
D: I'm afraid for Abélard.
E: uneasy
C: CARY
D: He broke into Abélard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, dear.
C: CARY
D: The lovers were forced to live their lives apart. But when they died, they were buried here side by side. There's a story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb.
E: peers down at the ground
C: NIKKI
D: Heart-shaped stones?
C: CARY
D: And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other. And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of Héloïse and Abélard, no harm can come to your true love.
E: looks at Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: How perfectly beautiful.
C: CARY
D: Isn't that a quaint legend?
N: They crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off their gloves under the following:
C: NIKKI
D: Do you think I might find a heart- shaped stone? You help me, Cary.
C: CARY
D: All right, Nikki. Only we have to leave soon. They close up the place.
E: looks off
C: NIKKI
D: Just as soon as we find our stones.
N: They reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the tomb. After a moment, Nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her hand.
C: NIKKI
D: I found one! Where's yours?
N: Cary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her.
C: NIKKI AND CARY'S HANDS
D: as the couple sits near the tomb. They show each other the stones in their upturned hands. Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it in Cary's stiff, weathered hand. Then she transfers his stone to her hand.
C: NIKKI
D: And, now, you take mine. And I'll take yours.
N: They close their hands over the stones as we PULL BACK to a WIDER VIEW of Nikki and Cary smiling at one another.
C: NIKKI
D: Isn't that the way the story goes?
C: CARY
D: That's right, Nikki.
C: NIKKI
D: And, now, no harm can come to our true love.
C: CARY
D: And, now, we'll have to go.
E: amused
N: He starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm.
C: NIKKI
D: You were so nice to let me come with you. I spoiled your whole day. You were going to do something else, weren't you?
C: CARY
D: Doesn't matter.
E: looks away
C: NIKKI
D: Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you come here today?
C: CARY
D: To pay my respects to an old comrade.
E: not looking at her
C: NIKKI
D: Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't pay any attention to me, Cary. I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.
E: begins to weep softly
N: He stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary. I'm all right. I just want to cry for a minute. On account of you're so nice. You're so clean, Cary. And your teeth are so white. You're so civilized. You don't care about anything any more, nor anybody. Nothing makes any difference to you. Nothing can touch you. Why, you're lost. You're ALL lost. You and Shep and the rest of you. Oh, I want to do something for you. I want to help you. Let me wash your bracelet, Cary. Why, see? The silver's all tarnished. The silver's all tarnished. I'll take it with me and scrub it when I get home. I'll polish it with my nail-brush.
E: puts a hand on his shoulder realizes takes his hand looks at his wrist points removes his bracelet
N: Nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse. Thoroughly unnerved by this emotional outburst, Cary looks around.
C: CARY
D: It's getting dark.
N: Cary rises, deeply uncomfortable. Nikki tries to make amends.
C: NIKKI
D: Well ... Anyway, we found a name for my turtles!
E: rises, cheerily
N: Cary turns and looks at her, amazed.
C: CARY
D: Héloïse and Abélard? A name for your turtles? So that's what you were looking for. I might have known how it would end.
N: He looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. His thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground.

S: INT. NIKKI'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
N: Nikki sits, soberly polishing Cary's bracelet with her nail brush. Shep enters, drink in hand.
C: SHEP
D: Hi, Nik.
N: She looks at Shep forlornly.
C: NIKKI
D: Hello.
E: sadly
N: Shep walks over and confronts her.
C: SHEP
D: Cary's in a state. Says he's going away. Can't stand it any longer and all that sort of thing. What happened between you two, anyway?
E: sits on the bed
C: NIKKI
D: Cary seemed so sad and everything -- on account of I'd taken up his whole afternoon. So little Nikki said, all merry and bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a name for my turtles."
E: sighs
C: SHEP
D: A name for the turtles?
N: Shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed, his head dangling over the edge.
C: SHEP
D: That's funny!
N: Shep keeps laughing, twists around on the bed and sits up again.
C: SHEP
D: Name for the turtles! That's so funny, all right!
N: Shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as Nikki joins him on the bed.
C: SHEP
D: Why do you always HAVE to be funny at the wrong time? Didn't I tell you Cary was brittle? How did he respond to THAT line?
C: NIKKI
D: Pulled down the iron curtain.
E: morosely
N: Shep cracks up again. Worried, Nikki tugs at his sleeve.
C: NIKKI
D: Did he say he was going away?
C: SHEP
D: Yup. Gotta get away from it all.
E: through his laughter
C: NIKKI
D: Then, you've got to go to him right now!
N: Nikki rises and urgently pulls Shep, helpless with laughter, to his feet.
C: NIKKI
D: And explain that I didn't mean it! Tell him how it was and everything!
C: SHEP
D: Listen--
C: NIKKI
D: No, go on. You go right now before it's too late!
N: She pushes him toward the door.
C: SHEP
D: But Nikki--!
C: NIKKI
D: You go right straight to Cary.
N: They exit.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CARY'S ROOM - LATER
N: Cary removes clothes from a rack as a now serious Shep, drink in hand, stands nearby trying to reason with him.
C: SHEP
D: Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to behave like an old Easter egg. You're breaking Nikki's heart. She doesn't know any better.
C: CARY
D: She doesn't know any better? Well, whether she does or not, I'm going a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki and her turtles.
C: SHEP
D: Whew! You sure are in an uproar. What YOU need is a drink!
N: Cary packs a weathered suitcase.
C: CARY
D: I need more than a drink. I need a lot of geography between me and that girl.
C: SHEP
D: Where do you want to go?
C: CARY
D: Anywheres. So long as it's a long way from Nikki. You know -- that girl does things to me. I've got to get away.
E: pauses, looks at Shep back to packing
C: SHEP
D: Well, I wonder what's happening in Portugal tonight.
N: Cary stops packing and gives Shep a look.
C: CARY
D: Say ... I wonder what IS happening in Portugal tonight.
E: thinks it over
N: Shep stares at Cary, astonished, and moves off. Cary sets his packed suitcase upright.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATE THAT NIGHT
N: Bill and Shep set a large steamer trunk upright.
C: BILL AND SHEP
D: Heave ho!
N: Bill opens the trunk.
C: BILL
D: Ah! There you go.
N: Nikki appears, carrying a suitcase.
C: NIKKI
D: If Cary's going to Portugal, why can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't we got any rights?
C: BILL
D: Sure we got rights!
N: Getting organized for their own impromptu Portuguese expedition, Bill, Francis and Shep fill the trunk with Nikki's things as Frink leans on it, smoking a cigarette and eyeing Nikki coolly.
C: SHEP
D: Cary better not think he can screw up in Portugal and leave old Shep behind.
C: FRINK
D: Say, when's he leaving?
C: SHEP
D: Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud Express.
C: NIKKI
D: Don't we have to have passports and things?
C: SHEP
D: Sure we gotta have passports!
N: Bill joins Nikki.
C: BILL
D: What kind passports you like?
C: NIKKI
D: What kind passports you got?
C: BILL
D: We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry passports.
C: NIKKI
D: I'll take vanilla.
E: grandly
N: She brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by Frink.
C: FRINK
D: Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on the train.
C: NIKKI
D: You're goin', too?
C: FRINK
D: Why not? I might, uh, pick up a couple of features for my paper - in Portugal.
E: with a sly smile
N: Frink walks out the door. Nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with carrying items the trunk. Shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the group crowds together. Chaotic overlapping dialogue:
C: SHEP
D: Nikki, do you want --?
C: NIKKI
D: Did you put all my shoes in?
C: BILL
D: You bet. There they are--
C: SHEP
D: I don't know how you're going to get all these dresses in, Nikki.
N: From the trunk, we
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - NEXT MORNING
N: A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.
C: NIKKI
D: Don't we have to go like anything? The train leaves in twenty minutes.
N: Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki:
C: BILL
D: Are you SURE you have everything?
C: NIKKI
D: I - I think so.
E: misses the irony
N: Francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile.
C: FRANCIS
D: Hardly seems enough.
E: dryly
N: Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, my turtles! My turtles!
C: THE TURTLES
D: are plucked from the tub and placed in ...
N: ... A BASKET by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis.
C: BILL
D: Here you are, Francis! You're the custodian of the turtles! Now don't fall down on the job.
N: Bill walks off. Francis calls after him, worried:
C: FRANCIS
D: Hey! I never tended turtles before.
N: Nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand.
C: NIKKI
D: Now, all you have to do -
N: She gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet hand.
C: NIKKI
D: - is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this.
C: FRANCIS
D: Oh, yeah. I see.
N: Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's ribbon. Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling the turtles.
C: IN THE BEDROOM
D: Five bellhops march in and, under the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed to carry off the luggage, chattering in French.
C: NIKKI
D: Well, we're off. Be careful of that one.
E: to a bellhop, about the trunk
N: Burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite. Bill, suitcase in hand, follows them out, beckoning to Francis behind him.
C: BILL
D: Uh, come on, Francis! Take those turtles!
N: Francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by Shep and Nikki.
T: FADE OUT FADE IN
S: EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATER THAT MORNING
N: A whistle BLOWS. Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill walk down the platform, parallel to the train. Bill claps his hands exuberantly.
C: BILL
D: There she is, boys! The Sud Express!
C: SHEP
D: Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run away and leave us behind?
N: Bill laughs. Nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette.
C: NIKKI
D: Do you suppose he's really gonna be here?
C: BILL
D: Sure he'll be here. He's never missed a train in his life.
C: FRANCIS
D: Say, do you suppose the turtles'll be all right with that porter?
N: Bill gives Francis a supportive pat on the back.
C: BILL
D: Aw, sure they'll be all right. All you got to do is - - sprinkle 'em!
E: gestures with his hand
N: Francis nods soberly. Bill laughs. Nikki points, excited.
C: NIKKI
D: There he is!
C: FARTHER DOWN THE PLATFORM
D: Cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train.
N: BILL (o.s.) Say, Cary! On the train steps, Cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather around him, grinning.
C: NIKKI
D: Hello, Cary.
C: CARY
D: Well, hello. What are you all doing down here?
E: surprised
C: BILL
D: We just came down to see you off is all.
C: CARY
D: Well, that's darn decent of you.
C: FRANCIS
D: Ya got a nice seat?
C: CARY
D: Yeah, right by a window.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, how nice for you!
C: BILL
D: Come on! Show us your seat by the window!
E: with childlike desire
C: SHEP
D: Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE that seat by the window.
E: cheerful, insistent
N: Climbing the steps, Bill and Shep crowd a confused Cary and force him into the train. Following the others, Francis helps Nikki up the steps.
C: FRANCIS
D: Come on, Nikki.
N: They all board the train and head for:
S: INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
N: The group crowds into the small compartment.
C: BILL
D: My, my, what a swell train.
C: SHEP
D: Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say, I wonder if a chap can get a drink on this train.
C: BILL
D: Sure! I don't see why not. Push the button.
N: Bill pushes a button for the porter.
C: CARY
D: Well, I'm afraid you won't have time for a drink. We're gonna start in a minute. You'll have to get off.
E: flustered
N: Everyone but Cary grabs a seat. Astonished, Cary stares at each as they speak:
C: BILL
D: Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this train!
C: FRANCIS
D: This is a Train de Luxe.
C: SHEP
D: Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, Nikki?
C: NIKKI
D: Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.
N: The whistle BLOWS. Cary panics.
C: CARY
D: Hey! He's blowing the whistle. Hey, we're gonna start.
E: grabs Shep's shoulder
C: SHEP
D: Well, let her start.
N: The trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey.
C: BILL
D: Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?!
C: FRANCIS
D: Who cares?!
C: SHEP
D: Who cares?!
C: NIKKI
D: Who cares?!
N: Frink enters casually.
C: FRINK
D: Hello, everybody.
N: Cary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others.
C: CARY
D: And you, too?
C: FRINK
D: That's right.
N: The group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin.
C: CARY
D: That's right. Who cares?
N: Cary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all:
C: NIKKI
D: Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to write!
N: Shep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this.

C: THE TRAIN'S WHEELS
D: racing down the track.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING
N: The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor.
C: BILL
D: Hi, men! Look what I found.
N: With a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "Hooray!" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. Various bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger.
C: SHEP
D: Come in.
C: FRANCIS
D: Sit down.
C: CARY
D: Have a drink.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Ah, thank you, no, not I.
N: Bill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. The basket of turtles hangs from above.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: I - I say, are you all going to Portugal?
C: SHEP
D: Yup. We're going down there to investigate conditions.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Investigate conditions?
C: BILL
D: Drinking conditions, mostly.
C: SHEP
D: By the way, what ARE conditions?
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Don't you know what conditions are?
C: SHEP
D: No. Never saw one in my life.
C: BILL
D: The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Ahh, indeed.
E: chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles
C: BILL
D: My beer's full of cinders.
C: CARY
D: Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs.
N: The men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready.
C: CARY
D: Nikki? The man says your compartment's ready.
N: Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway.
C: NIKKI
D: I'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed.
C: SHEP
D: Going to bed? Who ever heard of such a thing?
N: Bill rises to confer with her at the door.
C: BILL
D: Can we help you undress?
C: NIKKI
D: No, thank you, William.
N: The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange.
C: FRANCIS
D: Take off your shoes?
C: SHEP
D: Undo your hair?
C: BILL
D: Scrub your back or something?
C: NIKKI
D: No, I can manage quite well by myself. Good night, everybody.
N: The men say, "Good night." Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory eye, is the most polite:
C: FRINK
D: Good night, Nikki.
N: Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor. The old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar.
C: CARY
D: Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop? She wouldn't let them help her undress.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Can't understand it at all.
C: CARY
D: You know, she's not very pretty. But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Indeed?
C: CARY
D: She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS speaking out of turn. Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Mm, seems to need a few repairs.
N: During the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, then notices Francis dozing off. Frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure.
C: SHEP
D: She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes.
C: BILL
D: You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen! You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head!
C: SHEP
D: I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.
C: CARY
D: In whose green hat?
C: SHEP
D: In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat.
N: Francis' pocket watch CHIMES. He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door. Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: "Whoa!" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others.
C: CARY
D: Hold on there! Where you goin'?
C: SHEP
D: You're not going anywhere. You're on a train.
C: FRANCIS
D: Sorry.
C: SHEP
D: You go back to your turtles, hear? You've been neglecting your assignment.
N: Francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. Curious, the old gentleman rises to join him. Francis explains as he works:
C: FRANCIS
D: I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Sprinkle the turtles?
C: FRANCIS
D: Sure.
N: The old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding.
C: FRANCIS
D: Cool 'em off.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Hm?
C: FRANCIS
D: Turtles get feverish on trains.
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Ahh! Uh huh.
N: A woman's SCREAM drifts in from the corridor.
C: NIKKI'S VOICE
D: Cary!
C: FRANCIS
D: What's that?
C: GENTLEMAN
D: Hm?
N: The men hear Nikki SCREAMING.
C: CARY
D: Nikki!
N: Francis, Cary, Bill and Shep -- in that order -- scramble out the door, leaving the old gentleman behind.
C: NIKKI'S VOICE
D: Cary! Bill! Shep!
N: The men rush down the corridor to:
S: INT. NIKKI'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
N: Frink grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she struggles to free herself from his grasp.
C: NIKKI
D: Cary!
N: Energized by Nikki's peril, Francis bursts in and pulls Frink away from her.
C: FRANCIS
D: Say!
N: Nikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers herself as Frink pushes Francis hard into a nearby wall, knocking him to the floor.
C: FRINK
D: Get out of here!
N: Frink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees a dazed Francis slumped against the wall, clutching his head. Cary grabs Frink's shoulder and spins him around.
C: CARY
D: Say, what's the idea?
C: FRINK
D: What's the idea? Well, what business is that of yours?
N: By now, Bill and Shep have entered and joined the tense confrontation.
C: CARY
D: Nikki, you all right? What is this tough trying to do to you anyway?
C: NIKKI
D: Well, I was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me.
C: CARY
D: Frink, you'd better get out of here right away before something happens to you.
C: FRINK
D: What right have you to tell me to get out of here? This isn't your compartment, is it?
C: CARY
D: Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it. If you don't clear out of here right now, you're liable to get hurt.
C: FRINK
D: All right. Suppose you put me out.
C: BILL
D: Put him out? I'll snap his spine and throw him off the train!
E: savagely
N: Cary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds Bill back.
C: CARY
D: Hold everything, Bill!
N: Distraught, Nikki sinks down on a chair.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like this?
N: Frink turns to her in protest.
C: FRINK
D: I'm not gonna let these silly drunks tell ME where to get off.
C: SHEP
D: Silly drunks?!
C: CARY
D: Silly drunks, did you say?
C: FRINK
D: Yes. And that goes for the whole bunch of you.
C: BILL
D: Let me have him.
C: CARY
D: Wait a minute. I'll take care of him.
E: to Bill
C: FRINK
D: You will, eh?
N: Frink starts to strong-arm Cary. Cary punches Frink in the jaw, knocking him onto the bed.
C: SHEP
D: Socko!
N: As Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed, half-conscious, Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, dear!
N: Cary, fist still tightly clenched, stands over the dazed Frink as Bill brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight.
C: BILL
D: Mm! Now, ain't that nice? Have you ever seen anything so cute?
N: Francis exits uncertainly.
C: CARY
D: Will you be all right now, Nikki?
C: NIKKI
D: Uh huh.
E: unsure
C: CARY
D: Grab hold of that fella and drag him out of here.
E: to Bill and Shep
N: Cary exits. Bill and Shep haul Frink to his feet.
C: BILL
D: Come to papa.
N: Nikki watches Bill and Shep lead Frink out the door.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
N: Francis sits by the window, rubbing his head. Cary arrives and sits down next to him. Cary takes Francis' water bottle and hands it to him.
C: CARY
D: Here, Francis. Do your stuff.
N: Bill and Shep carry Frink in and dump him on the seat opposite Francis. Bill walks off, wiping his hands happily. The others are grim, furious at Frink for his actions. Shep watches a disgusted Francis soak his hand and sprinkle Frink as if he were one of Nikki's turtles. Frink snaps out of his daze.
C: CARY
D: Frink, don't you know better than to try a stunt like that?
C: FRINK
D: Oh, I - I lost my head over the girl is all. I'm sorry. I apologize.
C: CARY
D: Well, you apologize to Nikki in the morning. And don't you ever get out of line again. The next time, it might be different.
N: Francis pointedly sprinkles Frink one last time. They give each other a dark look. Francis fingers the neck of the water bottle as if he were going to use it to smash Frink in the face. As they glare ominously at one another, we

D: Cocktail shaker in the hands of an expert who shakes it rhythmically as appropriate Latin MUSIC begins. This DISSOLVES TO a kaleidoscopic VIEW of our protagonists enjoying the night life: Nikki's image dominates at the center, surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. Everyone drinks, except Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at Nikki.
N: DISSOLVE TO Nikki and her war birds (minus Frink) seated at a bar in an otherwise empty club late at night, wearing goofy party hats. They swallow a last drink and start to leave -- laughing, talking, merrily blowing little party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen bartender as they go. Someone says, "Good night." We TRACK IN for a closer look at the bar, covered with many empty glasses. And the music and the montage end.

S: INT. CARY AND SHEP'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: Cary, wearing a robe, sees Shep still asleep in bed. Cary puts on a party hat, sits on the edge of his own bed opposite Shep's, picks up a party horn and blows into it, hard. The horn SQUEALS horribly. Shep wakes with a start and sits up in bed, completely unnerved. Cary laughs at him and, with his clenched hands, picks up a bottle.

C: SHEP
D: What month, I mean?
C: CARY
D: You mean to say you don't know what month this is?
C: SHEP
D: I knew once but I forgot.
C: CARY
D: Well, it's June. The merry month of June.
C: SHEP
D: June? Say, maybe I better get up.
N: Cary looks at Shep, amused.
C: SHEP
D: What town are we in?
C: CARY
D: You're in Lisbon, Portugal.
C: SHEP
D: Lisbon. That's where I thought it was. I just wanted to check up is all.
C: CARY
D: Say, what's the matter with you, Shep? Don't you really know where you are or what day it is?
E: a little concerned
C: SHEP
D: I kind of lose track of things.
C: CARY
D: Say, this is getting serious.
N: Cary lets the goofy hat fall off his head into his hand and sets it aside.
C: SHEP
D: Serious? Is anything serious any more?
C: CARY
D: Well, it's serious when you don't know where you're at. What's gonna become of you?
N: By now, Shep has polished off his drink. He sets down the empty glass.
C: SHEP
D: Oh, I'll be all right when I've had a couple of drinks. Say, what town did you say this was?
C: CARY
D: I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
N: Shep, excited, gets out from under the bedcovers.
C: SHEP
D: Bull-fight? Are we going to a bull-fight?
E: like a little kid
C: CARY
D: Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.
C: SHEP
D: Is that guy Frink coming along?
C: CARY
D: 'Fraid so.
C: SHEP
D: Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy?
C: CARY
D: Somebody'll have to shoot him.
N: Shep rises and walks off.
C: SHEP
D: Not a bad idea at that.
N: Cary watches him go and blows his party horn, wryly.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ARENA - DAY
N: A bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull- fight posters that read: CORRIDA DE TOUROS A crowd files in under an arched entranceway. Our little group enters, dressed for a day at the fights.
C: BILL
D: Praca de Touros!
N: And, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: PRACA DE TOUROS
C: BILL
D: I wonder if there's a bar inside or anything.
N: A friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and joins them.
C: PEDRO
D: Sure, there IS a bar.
C: SHEP
D: Let's find the bar. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
C: PEDRO
D: Right this way.
N: Pedro leads and they happily follow.
T: DISSOLVE TO
S: INT. THE BAR - MINUTES LATER
N: Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, extremely drunken old man is the only other customer.
C: BILL
D: Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya? Isn't that a beautiful thing?
C: CARY
D: What are you all gonna have?
C: SHEP
D: Beer is what I want.
C: BILL
D: Beer.
C: FRINK
D: Beer.
C: FRANCIS
D: Beer.
C: PEDRO
D: Cinco cervejas.
E: orders
C: BARTENDER
D: Cinco cervejas.
N: Nikki and Cary stand together at the bar.
C: NIKKI
D: I don't like beer.
C: CARY
D: Make you leap like a tuna.
C: NIKKI
D: Don't wanna leap like a tuna.
C: CARY
D: Make you bark like a fox.
C: NIKKI
D: Don't wanna bark like a fox.
C: CARY
D: Make you laugh and play.
C: NIKKI
D: That's what I wanna do! Laugh and play!
C: CARY
D: Hey! Vermouth!
E: to the bartender
N: Bill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose.
C: BILL
D: Well, men, fire and fall back!
N: As Bill drinks, the old man's shadow wobbles forward. Bill hears the sound of liquid SPATTERING. He stops drinking and looks puzzled. A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe. Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's foot.
C: BILL
D: Hey! What's the idea?
N: The others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused.
C: BILL
D: Well, I hope I don't catch a cold in my left ear.
N: Band MUSIC plays. Cary looks up, concerned.
C: CARY
D: Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss the parade!
N: The group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ARENA - MINUTES LATER
N: The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters the ring. Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row. When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, shaking his hand.
C: BILL
D: Well! My old pal!
N: The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting.
C: IN THE RING
D: The parade ends. A matador throws his montera into the crowd.
E: his black woolen hat
C: IN THE FRONT ROW
D: Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray!" Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki.
C: CARY
D: Nikki, here's a present for you.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, a hat!
C: PEDRO
D: Oh, señor, no, no, no -- you must not keep the hat. You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight.
C: CARY
D: What kind of present?
C: PEDRO
D: Well, eh - a little jewelry. Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the--
C: CARY
D: Vanilla?
C: PEDRO
D: Yes! Vanilla!
N: A trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited.
C: BILL
D: Look! Here he comes!
C: IN THE RING
D: A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each time.
C: IN THE FRONT ROW
D: Bill sits next to Pedro.
C: PEDRO
D: Nice work! Good work.
C: BILL
D: What's so good about it?
C: PEDRO
D: He works close to the bull.
C: BILL
D: Is that so dangerous?
C: PEDRO
D: Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting is very dangerous. It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring.
N: Bill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query.
C: CARY
D: Is it true the bull is blind when he charges?
C: PEDRO
D: He sees only the cape -- perhaps.
C: IN THE RING
D: Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.
C: IN THE FRONT ROW
D: Bill is unimpressed.
C: BILL
D: Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. You know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter.
C: PEDRO
D: You should have started at twelve years of old.
C: BILL
D: I bet I could start right now.
C: CARY
D: Sit still and behave yourself.
E: puts a hand on Bill's shoulder
C: PEDRO
D: Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
C: BILL
D: You think we haven't got the nerve or something?
C: PEDRO
D: Why, listen, bull-fighting is just for us, the Latins.
C: BILL
D: He thinks we're a-scared!
C: NIKKI
D: He tackled a horse once.
E: helpfully
C: PEDRO
D: Tackle a horse?
E: stares at Bill
N: Full of himself, Bill nods.
C: PEDRO
D: Is not the same!
E: turns away; flatly
N: Everyone suddenly stares in shock as:
C: IN THE RING
D: the bull knocks down the matador. Others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild, out of control.
C: IN THE FRONT ROW
D: Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.
C: WILD BULL MONTAGE
D: The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate.
N: The crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the matador's cap that Cary had caught. Toreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden barrier that circles the inside of the arena. Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below him.
C: BILL
D: Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
N: The toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you try it?" The other toreros laugh. Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the railing. He jumps down into the ring.
C: CARY'S VOICE
D: Hey!
N: Cary rises, stunned.
C: CARY
D: Bill! Come back here!
N: But it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as he stalks after the bull. The bull turns and sees him. Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman. Shep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away. The bull begins to charge. Cary climbs over the railing. The bull charges. TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin. The bull is on him. The bull roars. Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. The bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain. CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd. Four toreros rush in. They surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless. Cary runs across the ring. More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away. In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as ... toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body. Cary joins them.
C: CARY
D: Bill!
N: But Bill is unconscious. A torero says something to Cary in Portuguese. Cary and the others lift Bill.
C: CARY
D: Take it easy! Take it easy!
N: They carry Bill off.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ARENA INFIRMARY - MINUTES LATER
N: A group of toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to reveal Cary standing over a bloodied Bill and holding his hand as medical personnel prepare to operate. Bill lies flat on a table and smiles, amused with himself.
C: BILL
D: Cary? I slipped.
C: CARY
D: Too bad. You were doing fine.
C: BILL
D: Wasn't I, though? Heh. It's a cinch. Bull-fighting? Just as easy--
N: Bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor off screen.
C: BILL
D: Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you doing?
N: To distract him, Cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops Bill's brow which glistens with sweat.
C: BILL
D: You know why I slipped, Cary?
C: CARY
D: No, Bill. Why?
C: BILL
D: On account of that beer in my shoe.
N: Bill breaks off and raises himself up again.
C: BILL
D: Hey, Doc!
N: Cary gently eases Bill's head back down.
C: BILL
D: Cary, that bull certainly was hostile.
N: Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again) and Nikki into the room. The doctor, in surgical gear, puts on gloves and looks annoyed by the intrusion.
C: SHEP
D: You hurt, Bill?
C: NIKKI
D: You all right, Bill?
C: BILL
D: Sure. I'm all right. I was a big success.
N: The doctor has some sharp words for Pedro who acknowledges this and approaches the others:
C: PEDRO
D: He wants that we should go right away.
N: Pedro exits.
C: BILL
D: I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new blue shorts. I'll be a big success in the hospital.
N: Nikki places a hand on his head.
C: NIKKI
D: I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And THEN you'll be a big success.
N: She turns away, trying not to cry. Shep follows her as they leave.
C: SHEP
D: So long, Bill.
C: BILL
D: So long.
N: Shep follows Nikki out.
C: CARY
D: Goodbye, Bill.
N: Bill reaches up and pats Cary on the shoulder. Cary looks at the doctor, then at Bill, before retreating to the door. He turns to look back at Bill who grins at him.
C: BILL
D: See ya later - Cary.
N: Cary can't return the smile. He turns and goes, closing the door behind him. Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the wall behind him. Bill's smile fades.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. ARENA - MOMENTS LATER
N: Cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps.
C: FRANCIS
D: How is he?
C: CARY
D: They've just put him to sleep.
N: Nikki, emotionally fragile, hands Cary his hat.
C: CARY
D: Why, thank you, Nikki. There's nothing you can do. You'd better go back to the hotel. Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.
E: to Francis
N: As Frink and Francis exit with Nikki, Pedro approaches Cary with a couple of journalists.
C: PEDRO
D: Señor, the reporters want to know why your friend descend into the bull ring.
N: Cary looks off and thinks for a moment.
C: CARY
D: Tell them -- that it seemed like a good idea - at the time.
N: Pedro stares at Cary in astonishment. Cary joins Shep and the two of them stand with their backs to the others as we
T: FADE OUT
S: EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
N: The amusement park at Port Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with appropriate MUSIC. At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down. Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their drinks. They hear: GUNSHOTS. They look over to see: A little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various colorful targets and win prizes.
C: CARY
D: Sounds like old times.
C: SHEP
D: Let's go and shoot.
C: CARY
D: Not a bad idea. What say, Annie Oakley? Like to fire off a gun at something?
E: to Nikki
C: NIKKI
D: No objection.
C: SHEP
D: We'll be right back. Hold everything.
E: to their bartender
N: The group starts over to:
C: THE SHOOTING GALLERY
D: where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.
C: SHEP
D: First one to miss pays for the drinks.
C: CARY
D: What'll we shoot at?
C: NIKKI
D: Shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens.
C: SHEP
D: All right. Look out, pussycat.
N: Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe behind them. Shep's eyes pop with surprise.
C: SHEP
D: Well, that's what I was aiming at, a clay pipe. Whole thing's been misrepresented to me.
E: stares in amazement
N: Cary laughs at him.
C: NIKKI
D: Cary, let's see you shoot something.
N: Cary takes careful aim.
C: CARY
D: Look out, ball!
N: He FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water.
C: NIKKI
D: What'd YOU aim at?
C: CARY
D: Well, let's see you shoot something.
N: Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of- view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.
C: CARY
D: Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
C: NIKKI
D: How do you hold it still?
C: CARY
D: Listen, Nikki, on your right shoulder. Now, put your hand out there and hold up-- No, don't cover up the site. No, no, no, that's right. Now just hold it evenly--
N: Rapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole row of pipes with split-second firing. The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to encourage Nikki.
C: CARY
D: You can do better than that. Show him up.
N: She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks up a pistol and imitates her.
C: FRINK
D: What are you waving at, Nikki?
N: Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing Frink's wrist with both hands.
C: CARY
D: Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you know better than that?
E: angry
N: Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki.
C: FRINK
D: What's the idea?
C: CARY
D: Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
C: FRINK
D: Take your hands off me.
C: CARY
D: Put down that gun!
C: FRINK
D: Let go of my wrist!
N: Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off with a BANG. Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's been hit. Cary pursues and confronts Frink.
C: CARY
D: Put down that gun!
N: Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at Cary. His face is tense, savage.
C: FRINK
D: Listen, you keep your hands off me! I've had enough from you! You try any more of your rough stuff on me--!
N: A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
C: CARY
D: Oh, so that's how it is. I thought we taught you how to behave.
N: Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.
C: FRINK
D: You taught ME how to behave?! Listen, you'd better behave now or you'll get hurt!
C: CARY
D: I don't think so. I'll give you three to put down that gun. It'll be just too bad if you don't.
E: calmly
C: FRINK
D: Too bad for who?!
N: Frink cocks the hammer.
C: CARY
D: One ...
N: Cary moves slowly toward Frink.
C: FRINK
D: Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I tell ya! I'll shoot!
C: CARY
D: Two ...
N: Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart.
C: FRINK
D: I'll shoot! I'll shoot!
N: GUNSHOTS. Cary flinches. Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. He starts to fall. Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink. Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done.
C: CARY'S VOICE
D: Francis?
N: Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.
C: CARY
D: Francis?
N: Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the gallery. Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary and shakes his hand.
C: FRANCIS
D: Goodbye, Cary.
N: Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look on his face.
C: FRANCIS
D: Shep. Nikki.
N: They realize he is saying a final goodbye. The crowd presses in as Francis glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off. As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building. Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery.
C: CARY
D: We've got to get out of here. Come on, Shep. Come on.
N: They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is now:
C: BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
D: on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing to glance backward. He sees ...
N: ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ... ... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness. Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.
C: CARY
D: That's the last of Francis, I'm afraid. We'll never see him again.
C: NIKKI
D: Did you notice his eyes? That's the first time I ever saw Francis really happy. What'll happen to him, do you suppose?
C: CARY
D: Don't worry about, Francis. He'll take care of himself. Let's get out of here. Let's walk.
N: Shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy.
C: SHEP
D: No. Don't want to walk. Let's take a cab.
N: Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. Nikki rests a sympathetic hand on Shep.
T: DISSOLVE TO
N: THE BACK SEAT OF THE TAXI CAB - MOMENTS LATER As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded carnival, the MUSIC continues. Cary and Shep sit on either side of Nikki. Cary is as edgy as Shep is subdued.
C: CARY
D: Did you see the way Francis poured lead into that fellow?
C: SHEP
D: Fast work.
C: CARY
D: Fast? Chain lightning!
C: SHEP
D: Nice shooting.
C: CARY
D: Those slugs went right past my ear. If I'd've moved an inch, I would've caught one of them myself.
C: SHEP
D: "Sudden Death," all right.
N: Nikki takes out a cigarette.
C: CARY
D: What's the matter with you, Shep? I've never known you so quiet before.
C: SHEP
D: That's right. I am kind of quiet.
C: NIKKI
D: Not smoking?
E: holds her unlit cigarette
C: SHEP
D: No.
C: NIKKI
D: Your lighter working?
C: SHEP
D: Good ol', Nikki -- never has any matches.
C: NIKKI
D: No.
N: As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter, a strange look crosses his face.
C: SHEP
D: Sure you want a light?
C: NIKKI
D: That's what I want, a light.
N: Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his white shirt. Nikki stares down at the blood in horror.
C: NIKKI
D: Shep. Shep!
N: Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite.
C: CARY
D: What is it?
C: NIKKI
D: Shep's hurt!
N: Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face.
C: SHEP
D: It's a forgery.
N: Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.
C: NIKKI
D: Do something for him, Cary! Oh, Shepard!
C: CARY
D: He's been shot!
C: NIKKI
D: What can we do, Cary?! What can we do?!
C: CARY
D: Shep, why didn't you say you were hurt?
C: SHEP
D: Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.
C: CARY
D: Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. You'll be all right. We'll get you to a hospital.
N: Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street.
C: SHEP
D: No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres. Let's sit here for a while. The-- Hurts, the jolting.
N: Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver.
C: CARY
D: Stop! Stop!
N: In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening intently.
C: SHEP
D: That's better. You know, Cary, I feel - just like we're falling -- long time ago. Do you remember? Spinning ... spinning ... spinning. Only you brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good old Cary. Best flyer in the service.
E: sighs
N: Nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.
C: NIKKI
D: Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
C: CARY
D: We're gonna make a safe landing again, Shep.
E: reassuring
C: SHEP
D: Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's gonna crash. Say, but we're spinning fast. Level off. Cary, level off.
E: beat
N: Shep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder.
C: NIKKI'S VOICE
D: Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
N: Cary can't look at him. Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's.
C: CARY
D: Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!
N: Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself to cry.

N: ROAR down a railroad track.
T: DISSOLVE TO
S: INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record -- Toselli's "Serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted Europe at the close of the Great War. As the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. Then she turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.
C: NIKKI
D: What are you writing, Cary?
C: CARY
D: A letter. A letter to Shep's mother.
C: NIKKI
D: Mind if I read it?
C: CARY
D: Certainly not.
N: Nikki reads the letter silently. A long pause.
C: NIKKI
D: Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most beautiful letter I've ever read.
N: Nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.
C: NIKKI
D: Please forgive me for crying, Cary. I can't help it. You don't mind if I cry just a minute, do you?
C: CARY
D: No, Nikki.
N: Cary puts aside the letter.
C: NIKKI
D: Can't you cry, Cary?
C: CARY
D: No.
C: NIKKI
D: But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?
C: CARY
D: Long, long time ago. Before the war.
C: NIKKI
D: And you can't cry now? Not even for Shep?
C: CARY
D: Shep Lambert spent his life in the war. He had nothing more to give. He had died once. And he was ready to die again.
C: NIKKI
D: This time he was played out with music. That was the way he wanted it.
C: CARY
D: And Bill Talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts. Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel and - be a big success again.
C: NIKKI
D: And Francis?
C: CARY
D: Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping. Till the end. It doesn't matter now. Without them, nothing matters. We only had each other. Comradeship was all we had left. And now that's gone, too.
C: NIKKI
D: And you, Cary? You? You're alone now.
C: CARY
D: That's right. I'm alone now.
C: NIKKI
D: I don't want you to be alone, Cary. Let me stay with you. Let me be with you.
N: He takes her hand, looks at her affectionately.
C: CARY
D: Why, Nikki. You're sweet.
N: He kisses her hand. A strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone. Cary looks at her in surprise.
C: CARY
D: Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't forget.
N: She lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him.
C: NIKKI
D: No harm can come to our true love.
C: CARY
D: No harm can come to our true love? Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear to me. I want to help you. Can't I do something for you, too? What do you want? What can I get you?
E: amused, skeptical genuinely
C: NIKKI
D: Well, I've always wanted a pair of Spanish earrings.
N: He gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she buries her head lovingly in his shoulder. He kisses her hand again.
T: CUT TO
C: THE TRAIN
D: in a dark, bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track.
T: DISSOLVE TO
N: THE END
