N: More security men appear, one of them knocks Jimmy out. A whole fight breaks out, Ray gets knocked out. Chris beats off several security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and a baton to the face. Chris wakes up on a table under a light. BAD GUY 1 (Sees the tag around Chris' neck) Special forces? I'll take that. Chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again. BAD GUY 2 What are you doin? BAD GUY 1 (Has a scalpel in his hand) Special forces... special treatment. He rips open Chris' shirt. BAD GUY 2 This guy knows Hamilton! A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.

He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind it.
C: JAY
D: Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh?
N: Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear with sirens going. He pulls over.
C: SHERIFF WATKINS
D: You should NOT have come looking for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW!
S: INT. POLICE STATION ROOM
C: LAWYER
D: I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris.
C: CHRIS
D: But I'd have to plead guilty.
C: LAWYER
D: Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture.
N: We see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris.
C: WORKER
D: He started bustin up the machines...
C: GIRL
D: There was a gunshot..
C: WORKER
D: Went crazy...
C: GIRL
D: Complete psychopath.
C: CHRIS
D: They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
C: LAWYER
D: Well I still say you should take it.
C: CHRIS
D: I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.
S: INT. COURTROOM
C: CASINO GUARD
D: Our job is to keep order. But there was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him. He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property.
C: WORKER
D: He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: You said he broke your arm.
C: WORKER
D: Yea that's correct, my right forearm. Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.
N: CASINO GUARD 2 You know, toss out a coupla drunks now and then. Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort of violence.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: Did he give you any kind of advanced warning? A chance to defend yourself. CASINO GUARD 2 We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was on a mission. Besides, he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what I could see.
T: PROSECUTOR
N: So from what you saw, it seemed like he had some kinda purpose? CASINO GUARD 2 I think he had a point to prove yeah.
C: WORKER
D: I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in and started swingin.
C: GIRL
D: I was tryin to get outta there.
C: JUDGE
D: Mr Crow, you may present your client's case.
C: CHRIS
D: You're fired.
E: To his lawyer
C: CHRIS
D: Your honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
C: JUDGE
D: Order, order. Mr Vaughn, if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel you realise that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis.
C: CHRIS
D: Yes I do.
C: JUDGE
D: Very well Mr Vaughn.
C: CHRIS
D: I don't deny anything that was said here today.
C: JUDGE
D: Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
C: CHRIS
D: I'm not guilty of anything. Except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
C: OPPOSITION
D: Objection. He's trying to introduce prior events your honor.
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point.
C: CHRIS
D: I grew up in this town. People used to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
C: JUDGE
D: Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to civic speeches.
C: CHRIS
D: And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids.
C: OPPOSITION
D: Objection.
C: JUDGE
D: Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to being held in contempt.
C: CHRIS
D: I was justified in what I did, and if you acquit me of these charges I'm gonna run for sheriff. And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
C: JUDGE
D: Order, order. Mr Vaughn you are now charged with contempt.
C: CHRIS
D: And I will make sure that THIS never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
E: He opens his shirt revealing huge scarring
C: JUDGE
D: I order the jury to ignore what they have just seen. Mr Vaughn take your seat. Order! Order!
C: JUDGE
D: Mr Forman, has the jury reached a verdict?
C: FORMAN
D: We have your honor.
C: JUDGE
D: Will the defendant please rise.
C: FORMAN
D: We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not guilty.
N: The crowd breaks into cheer. Chris takes a tag from his piece of cedar wood which is laying on the evidence table.
C: CHRIS
D: This is mine.

C: CHRIS
D: License and registration.
N: Jay hands it over.
C: JAY
D: What's the problem sheriff?
C: CHRIS
D: You. And the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino.
C: JAY
D: Oh. Only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction. You took care of that.
C: CHRIS
D: Yea that's right and I plan on taking care of everything else too.
C: JAY
D: If you can, try to think this through. A casino is a license to print money. Why would I jeopardise that by selling drugs?
C: CHRIS
D: Cause you owned the town Jay. It's changed now.
C: JAY
D: Really? See the only thing that I think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge. But underneath that badge is the same guy that couldn't make it playing college football, apparently couldn't make it in the army and not gonna make it as a cop.
C: CHRIS
D: Is that right?
C: JAY
D: Yea, and if you push too hard you're gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 40. License please.
N: Chris hands it over.
C: JAY
D: Thanks sheriff.
C: CHRIS
D: Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's your last warning.
C: JAY
