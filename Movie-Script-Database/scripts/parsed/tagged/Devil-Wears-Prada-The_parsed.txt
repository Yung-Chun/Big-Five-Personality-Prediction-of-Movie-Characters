T: FADE IN
N: STEAM ON A MIRROR ...wiped off by ANDY SACHS, 20's, pretty but not glamorous, smart but green, hair up in a towel, brushing her teeth. We
T: intercut ANDY getting ready and...
N: ... we see three or four other GIRLS getting ready too. 1A A drawer filled with about forty lipsticks slides into 1A frame... One of the GIRLS carefully applies shiny lip gloss with a brush... ANDY puts on cherry Chapstick... 1B&C A lacy thong floats through the air... one of the GIRLS pulls 1B&C it up her glossy legs... A comfy cotton pair of Jockey bikinis is tugged out of a pile... ANDY pulls them on... 1D A gorgeous pair of slingback heels. One of the GIRLS pulls 1D the shoes on while her model handsome boyfriend reclines on crisp white sheets, watching her. 1E A pair of comfortable wedges... ANDY dresses while NATE, 1E rumpled, unshowered, wearing an old Alice in Chains t-shirt, watches her, reclining in mismatched bed-in-a-bag sheets... 1F&G A series of quick cuts... ANDY eats a full breakfast -- eggs, 1F&G bacon, bagel... One of the GIRLS carefully counts out seven almonds and pours a huge cup of black coffee... 1H&I ANDY straightens a pile of newspaper clips from the Daily 1H&I Northwestern with the byline ANDREA SACHS and proudly tucks them into her hideous college-graduation-present briefcase... One of the GIRLS takes Listerine breath strips, keys and a Gucci moneyclip and shoves everything in a tiny Fendi clutch.
S: EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY
N: The GIRLS, looking flawless, fold their legs into taxis and town cars as ANDY trots down the street and into the subway.
S: INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY -- DAY
N: ANDY strides into an office building, confident. A GUARD stops her. Indicates she sign his clipboard. She signs in.
C: ANDY
D: What floor is Elias-Clarke? Human Resources.
N: Beat. The GUARD just looks at her. What? The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: GUARD
D: Honey, you want West 57th.
S: EXT. 57TH STREET -- DAY
N: ANDY runs, but she's moving against the pedestrian tide. We widen out to see ANDY, bucking the flow like a salmon going upstream. She gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street... ...and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY
N: ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke. Streaming into the building are the polished GIRLS we saw in the opening... their heels click-clack on the concrete... They are the CLACKERS of Elias-Clarke. ANDY runs in.
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE ELEVATOR -- DAY
N: ANDY is a shrub in a CLACKER forest. One turns to another. CLACKER #1 You look awesome today. I can't wear cropped pants. I look like a whale. CLACKER #2 Oh, please. I look terrible. I almost called in fat today. ANDY looks at them, then down at herself. If they're fat, what am I? Ding! Elevator opens and ANDY exits.
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are covers from the Elias-Clarke magazines -- a news magazine, a cooking magazine, a fitness magazine... and Runway. ANDY is unloading clips from her horrible briefcase.
C: ANDY
D: This article was about the Take Back the Night march. This was a four-part series on the impact of busing on the public schools...
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 SHERRY holds up her finger to stop ANDY talking.
C: SHERRY
D: I have two positions available. One is assistant to the road test editor of Auto Universe magazine.
C: ANDY
D: And the other one--?
E: forces a smile
S: INT. RUNWAY RECEPTION AREA -- DAY
N: Sleek, elegant, hard-edged chic. Behind the reception desk is an elegant logo that says RUNWAY. ANDY walks over.
C: ANDY
D: Hi, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton--
C: EMILY
D: Andrea Sachs?
E: O.S.
N: (EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. ANDY refers to herself as AN-dree-a.) ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, more groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the sleek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barely tamped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: Human Resources certainly has a bizarre sense of humor. Follow me.
E: CONT'D sigh, annoyed
S: INT. RUNWAY HALLWAY -- DAY
N: EMILY briskly walks ANDY down the hall.
C: EMILY
D: Okay, so... I was Miranda's second assistant, but her first assistant recently got promoted so now I'm the first...
N: ANDY glimpses an office in front of them, seductively bright.
C: ANDY
D: And you're replacing yourself.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: I'm trying. Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks. We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?
C: ANDY
D: Yes. Of course. Who's Miranda?
C: EMILY
D: You didn't just ask me that. She's the editor in chief of Runway. Not to mention a legend. Work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want. A million girls would kill for this job.
E: eyes widening
C: ANDY
D: Sounds great. I'd love to be considered.
N: She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.
C: EMILY
D: Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine. An interest in fashion is crucial.
C: ANDY
D: What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?
N: EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea what EMILY could mean. Suddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.
C: EMILY
D: Oh my God. No. No, no, no.
C: ANDY
D: What's wrong?
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY
N: A black sedan pulls to a sudden stop outside the building.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN - DAY
N: EMILY begins rapid-fire dialing four digit extensions. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: She's on her way -- tell everyone!
E: all but screaming
N: Just then a dapper man of about 40 walks briskly by.
C: NIGEL
D: I thought she was coming in at 9.
C: EMILY
D: Her driver text-messaged. Her facialist ruptured a disk. God, these people!
N: NIGEL turns and sees ANDY. Looks at EMILY. Who is that?
C: EMILY
D: I can't even talk about it.
E: CONT'D
N: No time to discuss. NIGEL calls down the hallway.
C: NIGEL
D: All right, everyone. Man your battle stations! Did somebody eat an onion bagel?
E: beat, bewildered
N: Behind him, ANDY tries not to look guilty.
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY
N: The sedan door opens. We see only flashes of MIRANDA, what she's wearing, not the complete picture yet... ...Manolos, Chanel jacket, Van Cleef earrings...
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ASSISTANTS frantically push clothing rails out of the way. EDITORS race into their office. ANDY peers in. One of the EDITORS changes from kitten heels to sky-high stilettos... ...another pulls on a body shaper under her dress... ...another hurriedly dumps the remains of her breakfast -- some cubes of cantaloupe -- into the trash... The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE LOBBY -- DAY
N: We watch MIRANDA walking through the lobby. We see PEOPLE react to her-- GUARDS, ASSISTANTS and SECRETARIES cower, DISTINGUISHED EXECUTIVES bow their heads in respectful greeting. MIRANDA maintains a high rate of speed towards the elevator. She gets in. The CLACKER inside immediately leaps out.
C: CLACKER
D: Sorry, Miranda.
N: MIRANDA doesn't acknowledge her existence.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: EMILY races to the kitchen (right near their bullpen). Gets a glass, reaches into the fridge, pours a Pellegrino. Races into MIRANDA'S office. Races back out. Grabs an armful of magazines and newspaper from her desk and runs back into MIRANDA'S office.
S: INT. RUNWAY - RECEPTION AREA -- DAY
N: ...MIRANDA steps out of the elevator and for the first time we see her head-on. MIRANDA'S look is so distinctive you can spot her a mile away. She is unlike any other beautiful woman, singularly MIRANDA.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: EMILY types frantically into her computer, presses print, stands by the printer waiting, takes the paper out of the printer, puts it on a clipboard. Notices ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: Oh no. You're still here. Go.
N: ANDY gets up.
C: EMILY
D: No, stay. I don't want you walking past her. Just sit there and I'll pray she doesn't notice you marring the area.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY sits back down. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Wow, this is like self-esteem camp.
E: to herself
N: The rest of the office continues its hubbub...
S: INT. RUNWAY - HALLWAY -- DAY
N: ..until the moment MIRANDA enters the office from reception. Instantly, a quiet falls. Everyone looks calm and professional. Or fakes it. EMILY, phony smile on her face, trots down the hall to walk MIRANDA to her office.
C: MIRANDA
D: I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.
C: EMILY
D: I'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm last night, but--
C: MIRANDA
D: The details of your incompetence do not interest me.
N: MIRANDA gestures impatiently. EMILY hands her the clipboard. MIRANDA peruses it as they walk down the hall.
C: MIRANDA
D: Tell Simone I'm not approving the girl she sent in for the Brazil layout. I wanted clean, athletic, and smiling not dirty, tired and paunchy...
E: CONT'D
N: EMILY follows her.
C: MIRANDA
D: RSVP yes to the Michael Kors party -- the car will drop me at 9:30 and wait until I leave at 9:45... Tell Natalie at Glorious Foods for the fortieth time -- no, I don't want the tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote. I want the chopped almonds.
E: CONT'D
N: EMILY jots everything down. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: Call my ex-husband and remind him the Parent-Teacher conferences at Dalton are tonight. Then call my husband and tell him to meet me for dinner at that place I went with Massimo...
E: CONT'D
C: EMILY
D: Right.
C: MIRANDA
D: And tell Richard I saw the pictures of for the feature on female paramedics and they're all so unattractive. I don't understand. How hard is it to find a decent-looking paramedic?... Also, I need to see what Nigel has called in for Gwyneth's second cover try...
N: MIRANDA stops at EMILY'S desk, takes off her coat, dumps it on EMILY'S desk, walks past ANDY, seeming not to notice her.
C: MIRANDA
D: Who is that?
E: CONT'D
N: Damn. Did notice her. EMILY follows MIRANDA.
S: 19A INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE 19A
C: EMILY
D: Nobody. Human resources sent her up about the assistant job and I was pre- interviewing her for you, but--
C: MIRANDA
D: I'll do it. The last two you sent me were total disappointments. Send her in.
S: 19B INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY 19B
N: EMILY walks out of MIRANDA'S office. Points at ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: She wants to see you.. Go go go....
N: And before ANDY walks in, EMILY takes ANDY'S hideous briefcase and chucks it under a desk. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY walks in. MIRANDA'S office is chic, clean, walls lined with photos by Avedon, Penn, Testino and Meisel. We see large framed photo of MIRANDA, her husband STEPHEN and her twin GIRLS, CASSIDY and CAROLINE, in the Hamptons. The iced Pellegrino sits on a coaster on the desk. A pile of magazines is fanned out precisely on a table.
C: MIRANDA
D: Who are you?
N: ANDY hands her resume to MIRANDA. MIRANDA ignores it.
C: ANDY
D: My name is Andy Sachs. I recently graduated from--
C: MIRANDA
D: What are you doing here?
C: ANDY
D: I think I could do a good job as your assistant and--
N: MIRANDA gives her a look.
C: ANDY
D: I came to New York to be a journalist and I sent letters to everyone and I finally got a call from Elias-Clarke and met with Sherry in Human Resources and basically it's this or Auto Universe.
E: CONT'D fast, blurting
N: ANDY stops, can't quite believe she said that. MIRANDA takes in this burst of honesty.
C: MIRANDA
D: So you don't read Runway?
C: ANDY
D: No.
C: MIRANDA
D: And before today, you had never heard of me?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: No.
C: MIRANDA
D: And you have no style or sense of fashion.
C: ANDY
D: That depends on--
C: MIRANDA
D: That wasn't a question.
C: ANDY
D: I was Editor in Chief of the Daily Northwestern. I won a national competition for college journalists with a series on the janitor's union --
N: MIRANDA holds up her hand.
C: MIRANDA
D: That's all.
N: ANDY, startled by the abruptness, keeps talking.
C: ANDY
D: --that uncovered the exploitation of--
N: MIRANDA stares. ANDY abruptly stops talking. Heads for the door. Then she stops and turns.
C: ANDY
D: Okay, you're right. I don't fit in here. I'm not glamorous or skinny and I don't know much about fashion. But I'm smart, I learn fast and I will work very hard.
E: CONT'D
N: And... MIRANDA says nothing. Just then we hear a voice, someone heading into MIRANDA'S office.
C: NIGEL
D: We got the exclusive on the yellow Cavalli for Gwyneth, the one he showed with a huge feathered headpiece, but she'll look like she's working the mainstage at the Golden Nugget, so instead...
N: NIGEL stops when he sees ANDY. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Thank you for your time.
E: to MIRANDA
N: She summons all her dignity and exits, walking past NIGEL, who looks at MIRANDA.
C: NIGEL
D: Who IS that sad little person? Are we doing a Before and After piece I don't know about?
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE LOBBY -- DAY
N: ANDY staggers out of the elevator, catching her breath. Suddenly she hears someone calling.
C: EMILY
D: Andrea!
N: ANDY turns. And sees EMILY.
S: INT. NATE'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
N: Nothing fancy. The kind of place that refills your Sprite. ANDY is with two of her friends, DOUG and LILY. DOUG is built like a linebacker and very sweet. And her boyfriend, NATE, great looking, no vanity. He's the kind of guy who had his own radio show in college and played intramural rugby. It's the end of NATE'S shift and he's wearing his kitchen whites. There are just a few people left in the restaurant and at the bar.
C: NATE
D: Wow. You got a job at a fashion magazine. Was it a phone interview?
E: beat
N: ANDY laughs, smacks him playfully.
C: ANDY
D: Don't be a jerk.
C: DOUG
D: Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Okay, how is it that you know who she is and I didn't?
C: DOUG
D: I'm actually a girl.
C: LILY
D: That would explain so much.
C: DOUG
D: Seriously, Miranda is a huge deal. I bet a million girls would kill for that job.
C: ANDY
D: Yeah, it's just that I'm not one of them.
C: LILY
D: You have to start somewhere. Look at this dump Nate works in. Paper napkins? Hello?
C: NATE
D: And Lily works at that gallery doing-- What the hell is it that you do?
E: doesn't miss a beat to LILY
C: DOUG
D: Lucky for me, I have my dream job.
C: NATE
D: You're a corporate research analyst.
E: huh?
C: DOUG
D: -- which totally rocks. The free bagels on Thursday? The booze? The whores?
N: They look at him.
C: DOUG
D: You're right. There are no bagels. And only a few whores.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. NATE'S RESTAURANT - STREET -- NIGHT
N: The pavement is shiny from a recent rain. It's a chilly night in March. ANDY and NATE walk home. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: You should see the way the girls dress at Runway. I'm not sure I have anything to wear to work.
C: NATE
D: You're going to be answering phones and getting coffee. You need a ballgown for that?
C: ANDY
D: I think I might.
C: NATE
D: I think you look great. Always.
N: She smiles. He pulls her in...
C: ANDY
D: You are so full of it.
N: He laughs, and kisses her.
C: NATE
D: Come on. Let's go home. I can think of something you can do without clothes.
N: Just then a Lincoln Town Car comes barrelling up the street going way too fast, almost clipping them.
C: NATE
D: Asshole!
E: CONT'D
N: He and ANDY give the car the finger, laughing.
S: INT. ANDY AND NATE'S APARTMENT -- DAWN
N: Small, with a view of an air shaft. The bed's a futon. On the floor. ANDY and NATE are asleep. Dim light trickles in. NATE wakes up, pulls ANDY closer. Soon they're kissing. Their kisses become more urgent... ANDY'S cell phone rings, shrill, annoyingly upbeat. She feels around, finding the phone.
C: ANDY
D: Hello? Now?
N: She looks over at the alarm clock which reads: 6:15 AM. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. RUNWAY -- DAWN
N: EMILY is in the office.
C: EMILY
D: Miranda decided to kill the Autumn Jacket story for September -- she's pulling up the Sedona shoot from October. You need to go into the office right this second. Pick up her coffee order on the way. Write this down.
S: INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
N: ANDY has tried on every bit of clothing she owns; there's a huge discard pile on the floor. Her closet is empty. She looks at her outfit in the mirror. And is promptly overcome by a wave of self-hatred. No time to fix it.
S: EXT. STARBUCKS -- DAY
N: ANDY, carrying a Starbucks tray loaded with coffee drinks and snacks, races up the street, sloshing coffee on her shoes. Her phone rings.
C: EMILY
D: Where are you?
C: ANDY
D: I'm almost there.
N: She runs faster.
S: INT. RUNWAY - RECEPTION -- DAY
N: ANDY steps out of one elevator as NIGEL exits the other. A beat. He realizes.
C: NIGEL
D: No...
C: ANDY
D: Yes. She gave me the job.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: Clearly my opinion means nothing. Nigel Kipling. Fashion Director. Let's see what we're working with. Wow. It's like Oklahoma and New Jersey had a baby out of wedlock.
E: extends his hand examining her outfit
C: ANDY
D: Actually, I'm from Cincinnati.
C: NIGEL
D: No, it's not possible. Not you.
N: As ANDY heads off down the hall...
C: NIGEL
D: Welcome to the dollhouse, Baby.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: MIRANDA is standing by the door to her office as LUCIA, a beautiful Brazilian woman who is one of the Senior Editors, walks in with a couple of FASHION ASSISTANTS.
C: MIRANDA
D: Is there a reason my coffee is not here? Was I unclear in some way?
N: EMILY looks panicked.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY races down the hall, carrying the coffee to the bullpen. Before ANDY can even say hello--
C: EMILY
D: I hope you know this is a very difficult job for which you are totally wrong and if you mess up MY head is on the chopping block.
N: EMILY takes the coffee, brings it into MIRANDA'S office, walks back out to her desk.
C: EMILY
D: Okay, first of all, you and I answer the phones. The phone MUST be answered every single time it rings.
E: CONT'D MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: Phones roll to voicemail, she gets very upset. If I'm not here, you are chained to this desk.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: What if the building's on fire or my appendix explodes or something?
C: EMILY
D: One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener. Miranda missed Lagerfeld right before he boarded a 17 hour flight to Australia. She now works at TV Guide.
C: ANDY
D: Man the desk at all times. Got it.
N: The phone RINGS. EMILY picks it up.
C: EMILY
D: Miranda Priestly's office. She's not available. I'll tell her you called. Yet again. Remember, you and I have totally different jobs. You run errands, you get coffee, etcetera. I am in charge of her schedule, her expenses, her appointments. And, most importantly... I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.
E: back to ANDY big drumroll, she beams
N: EMILY points to her Arc de Triomphe screensaver.
C: EMILY
D: I get to wear couture, go to all the shows, all the parties, meet all the designers. It's divine.
E: CONT'D giddy sighs happily, then, abruptly MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: Okay, stay here. I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.
E: CONT'D
N: EMILY shows ANDY a thick scrapbook.
C: EMILY
D: The Book is a mock-up of everything in the current issue. We deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night and she returns it in the morning with her notes. The second assistant is supposed to do it, but Miranda is very private and doesn't like strangers going to her house. So until she decides you're not a psycho, I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: How do I prove I'm not a psycho?
C: EMILY
D: I have no idea.
N: And with that, EMILY pivots and walks away. ANDY looks around, unsure.
C: ANDY
D: Wait. What do I do if--
N: EMILY keeps walking. And sure enough, the phone rings. ANDY looks at it.
C: ANDY
D: Oh no. Mrs. Priestly's office. That's what I meant. Miranda Priestly's office.
E: CONT'D takes a breath, picks up beat, wincing
N: She searches around for a pen.
C: ANDY
D: She's in a meeting. Can I take message? I'm sorry. Can you spell Gabbana-- Guess not.
E: CONT'D they hang up
N: She hangs up. Takes a breath. Okay. Got through one call.
C: 17A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: Just then JOCELYN, the attractively tomboyish accessories editor, walks out of MIRANDA'S office.
C: JOCELYN
D: Run-through at 3, shoot 8 am tomorrow. Of course. No problem.
N: JOCELYN glares at ANDY.
C: JOCELYN
D: Who the hell does she think I am, Houdini?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Hi, I'm Andy, I'm the new--
C: JOCELYN
D: Great. Fantastic. If you'll excuse me, I gotta go pull a bunch of fringe purses out of my ass.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 ANDY turns and sees NIGEL walking down the hall carrying a pair of stunning Dolce slingbacks. He holds out the shoes.
C: NIGEL
D: I guessed 8 1/2.
C: ANDY
D: That's very nice of you, but I don't need those. Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.
C: NIGEL
D: Do you?
C: MIRANDA
D: Emily!
N: We hear MIRANDA clearly. She's not yelling. She never yells.
C: MIRANDA
D: Emily!
E: CONT'D
C: NIGEL
D: She means you. Go.
E: nudges her
N: ANDY takes a deep breath.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE
N: ANDY appears in the door. MIRANDA is talking to PAUL, the art director, who is showing her a layout.
C: MIRANDA
D: It's too dark. I can't see any of the clothes...
C: PAUL
D: ...I think he intended to use shadow to show the contours of the...
C: MIRANDA
D: And what is this? I want the title of the layout to bleed over the left side of the photo...
C: PAUL
D: I see, well, we needed room for the typeface to pick up the lines of the dress, which is cut on the bias, so we...
C: 18A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: No, no, no. That's not what I want. I made that abundantly clear...
N: MIRANDA looks up and sees ANDY.
C: MIRANDA
D: There you are, Emily. How many times do I have to scream your name?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Actually, it's Andy.
N: MIRANDA gives ANDY a look. And ANDY notices she's brought the room to a screeching halt.
C: ANDY
D: My name is Andy. Andrea, but people call me Andy.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: What a fantastic story. So entertaining and full of useful information.
N: MIRANDA looks at her. And smiles. Terrifying.
C: MIRANDA
D: I need ten or fifteen skirts from Calvin Klein...
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: What kind of--
C: MIRANDA
D: Please bore someone else with your questions. Make sure we can get Pier 59 at 8 am tomorrow... Remind Jocelyn I want to see a few of those satchels Marc is doing in the pony... And tell Simone I'll take Frankie if Maggie is not available tomorrow... And did Demarchelier confirm?
C: ANDY
D: Demar--
C: MIRANDA
D: Get him on the phone.
N: As ANDY leaves --
C: MIRANDA
D: And Emily.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY turns.
C: ANDY
D: Yes?
N: And MIRANDA doesn't say anything. Just looks at ANDY'S shoes. Then back up at ANDY. Her message unmistakable.
S: INT. RUNWAY OFFICE - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY flies out of MIRANDA'S office, races over to the desk, pulls on the Dolces. MIRANDA immediately calls out...
C: MIRANDA
D: Do you have Demarchelier?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 ANDY tries to look the name up in the address book on the computer.
C: ANDY
D: Demarchelier... Demarchelier...
N: Just then EMILY appears behind ANDY. She dials the phone.
C: EMILY
D: I have Miranda Priestly calling. I have Patrick.
E: calls out
N: She flips the call to MIRANDA. Then turns to ANDY, who's slightly panicked.
C: ANDY
D: She called me in and asked me about Pier 59. She said something about Simone and Frankie and someone else. And she needs skirts from Calvin Klein. I think that's the most important thing, but I couldn't tell. Oh, and there was something about a pony.
C: EMILY
D: Did she say which skirts? Did she say what kind? Color? Shape? Fabric?
E: ANDY shakes her head No No. No. No. No.
C: ANDY
D: I tried to ask her, but--
C: EMILY
D: You never ask Miranda. Anything. All right, I'll take care of the other stuff. You go to Calvin Klein.
E: sighs
C: ANDY
D: Me?
C: EMILY
D: I'm sorry. Do you have a prior commitment? Is there some hideous pants convention?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: So I just, what, go down to the Calvin Klein store and ask them--
N: EMILY rolls her eyes so hard they almost eject from her head.
C: EMILY
D: You're not going to the store.
C: ANDY
D: Of course not. I'm going... to his house.
C: EMILY
D: You are catching on quickly. We always send assistants to a designer's home on their very first day. You're going to his showroom. I'll give you the address.
E: oh god why me?
C: ANDY
D: Sorry. Got it. What's the nearest subway stop?
C: EMILY
D: Good God. You do not. Under any circumstances. Take public transportation.
N: On ANDY. I don't?
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY
N: ANDY steps out. Sees a Black Lincoln Town Car. She smiles.
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE/INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY
N: ANDY rides uptown. She looks around -- the magazines, the tiny bottles of water, the little dishes of candy. The driver, ROY, looks at her in the mirror.
C: ROY
D: Miranda's new assistant. Congrats.
C: ANDY
D: Thanks.
N: ANDY takes some candy. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ROY
D: You know--
C: ANDY
D: You're going to say a million girls would kill for my job.
C: ROY
D: Actually, I was going to say those Jelly Beans are seven years old.
N: ANDY puts the candy back.
S: EXT. CALVIN KLEIN SHOWROOM -- DAY
N: ANDY looks up at the showroom. Her phone rings again.
C: MIRANDA
D: Are you there?
E: O.S.
C: ANDY
D: I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as--
N: Click. Her phone immediately rings again.
C: EMILY
D: While you're out... Miranda needs you to go to Hermes and pick up twenty five scarves we ordered for her. Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton, pick that up. And Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, she'll want more Starbucks when she gets back.
E: O.S.
N: Click.
S: INT. CALVIN KLEIN SHOWROOM -- DAY
N: LIZ, the sales rep, brings out a rack of skirts for ANDY.
C: LIZ
D: You must be new. Congratulations. People would KILL for your job. I would. I love Miranda. She's such an icon. I've dealt with her a couple times, but I'm sure she doesn't remember.
N: Just then ANDY'S phone rings. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: What do they have?
E: O.S.
N: ANDY looks at the rack, searching for the right terminology.
C: ANDY
D: There's a um, variety of skirts. Let's see...
N: LIZ mouths "Is that her?" ANDY nods. LIZ smiles.
C: MIRANDA
D: Who's there? Who are you dealing with?
E: O.S.
C: ANDY
D: I'm sorry. What's your name?
C: LIZ
D: Liz.
C: ANDY
D: It's Liz.
C: MIRANDA
D: Get away from her. She is useless and unattractive. Ask for Ivan, tell him we're doing a reshoot tomorrow and need at least ten skirts.
E: O.S.
N: Click. ANDY looks at LIZ.
C: LIZ
D: What did she say?
E: eager
C: ANDY
D: Is Ivan in by any chance?
E: wincing
C: LIZ
D: I'll get him.

S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY walks in, laden with stuff and more coffee and snacks. EMILY springs up. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: Oh my God. What took you so long? I have to pee.
C: ANDY
D: You haven't peed since I left?
N: Just then MIRANDA walks through, dumps her coat on ANDY'S desk and walks into her office.
C: EMILY
D: You do the coat.
N: She points to the closet. ANDY quickly hangs up the coat.
C: EMILY
D: Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30 and people are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: The run-through. Right.
N: Clearly, she has no idea what a run-through is.
C: EMILY
D: The editors bring in options for a shoot and Miranda chooses. She chooses every single thing in every single issue. Run-throughs are a huge deal.
E: exasperated
N: And indeed ANDY can see EDITORS running in and out of their offices, rack of clothes and accessories flying.
C: ANDY
D: Is it always like this?
C: EMILY
D: No. Sometimes it's busy.
N: Just then the tallest, thinnest and most intimidating CLACKER, the severely dressed, highly snobby SERENA, walks over.
C: EMILY
D: After the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch. This is her. The new me.
E: CONT'D to SERENA, re: ANDY
C: 24A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: SERENA eyes ANDY with disbelief.
C: EMILY
D: I told you.
E: CONT'D
C: SERENA
D: I thought you were kidding.
C: EMILY
D: Oh, no. I was quite serious.
N: EMILY turns to ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: I get twenty minutes for lunch, you get fifteen. When I come back, you can go.
E: CONT'D
N: As ANDY watches EMILY and SERENA'S thin hips as they move down the hall, talking about how absurd ANDY looks. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: You eat lunch?
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE CAFETERIA -- DAY
N: A pasta bar. Deserted. A pizza station. Not a soul. A salad bar. Girls crowd the lettuce area, though no one's within a mile of the dressing region. ANDY races over to the deserted soup station. Quickly ladles some corn chowder into a bowl. NIGEL walks by with his tray.
C: NIGEL
D: Corn chowder. Interesting choice.
N: ANDY looks at him, confused.
C: NIGEL
D: You do know that cellulite is one of the ingredients of corn chowder.
E: CONT'D
N: They walk over to the register, which has a long line. A few GIRLS are openly gaping, amazed that ANDY selected chowder.
C: ANDY
D: None of the girls here eat anything?
C: NIGEL
D: Not since 2 became the new 4 and 0 became the new 2.
C: ANDY
D: I'm a 6.
C: NIGEL
D: Which is the new 14.
N: ANDY dips a piece of bread in her chowder, eats it. Seeing this, two of the CLACKERS gasp in horror... Then ANDY notices she's dripped on her blouse. She dabs it.
C: NIGEL
D: Something tells me you've got more polyblend where that came from.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Okay. You think my clothes are hideous. I get it, okay? The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
E: MORE
C: ANDY
D: But I'm not going to be working in fashion forever. I don't see any reason to change everything about myself because I have this job.
E: CONT'D
C: NIGEL
D: You're right. That's what this multi- million dollar industry is all about. Inner beauty.
N: Just then NIGEL'S phone rings. He picks up, listens.
C: NIGEL
D: Miranda wants us upstairs. Chairman's on his way down to her office.
E: CONT'D
N: CLOSE ON... ANDY'S corn chowder and NIGEL'S salad being chucked in the garbage.
S: INT. ELIAS-CLARKE - ELEVATOR -- DAY
N: ANDY and NIGEL get in. IRV RAVITZ is already riding up. NIGEL nods, deferential.
C: NIGEL
D: Mr. Ravitz.
C: IRV
D: Nigel. Issue going well?
C: NIGEL
D: Our biggest September ever.
C: IRV
D: Great. I heard Miranda killed Autumn Jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot. What's that costing me?
C: NIGEL
D: About 300,000.
C: IRV
D: Must have been some lousy Jackets. But I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
E: smiles
C: NIGEL
D: Always.
N: IRV glances over at ANDY, offers his hand.

D: Irv Ravitz.
C: NIGEL

C: IRV
D: Congratulations, young lady. A million girls would kill for that job.
N: The elevator opens. IRV nods to NIGEL and exits.
C: NIGEL
D: Chairman of Elias Clarke. You know what they say, tiny man, huge ego. We should have taken the stairs.

S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: Accessories are spread out on the floor in basket trays. Clothes are on racks. MIRANDA clicks through the racks.
C: MIRANDA
D: No... No... No... I swear I don't understand why it's so difficult for you to pull together a decent run- through. You had hours to prepare... Where are all the advertisers?
E: continues clicking
C: LUCIA
D: We have some pieces from Banana Republic and--
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: We need more.
N: MIRANDA holds up a skirt. Shows it to Nigel.
C: MIRANDA
D: What do you think?
E: CONT'D
C: NIGEL
D: You know me. A full ballerina skirt with a hint of saloon and I'm on board.
C: MIRANDA
D: Is it too much like the--
C: NIGEL
D: --LaCroix from July? I thought of that, but with the right accessories, it could work...
N: MIRANDA nods. He's right of course.
C: MIRANDA
D: Where are the belts for this skirt?
N: JOCELYN races over and holds up two belts. MIRANDA studies them. ANDY looks at them too. To us, and to her, they look exactly the same.
C: JOCELYN
D: Tough call. They're so different.
N: ANDY lets out a little giggle. And it's like she set off a grenade. Slowly everyone turns to her.
C: MIRANDA
D: Is something funny?
C: ANDY
D: No, no, no. It's just...
N: And MIRANDA says nothing. ANDY twists in the wind.
C: ANDY
D: It's just that both of those belts look the same to me. I'm still learning about this stuff, so--
E: CONT'D
N: And the silence is deafening. Everyone looks to see what MIRANDA will do.
C: 28A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: This... stuff? Okay. I understand. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and select, say, that lumpy blue sweater because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what's on your body. What you don't know is that your sweater is not blue. It's not even sky blue. It's cerulean. You also don't know that in 2002, De La Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, Yves St. Laurent showed a cerulean military jacket, Dolce did skirts with cerulean beads, and in our September issue we did the definitive layout on the color. Cerulean quickly appeared in eight other major collections, then the secondary and department store lines and then trickled down to some lovely Casual Corner, where you no doubt stumbled on it.
E: MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: That color is worth millions of dollars and many jobs. And here you are, thinking you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry. In truth, you are wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room. From a pile of stuff.
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles at ANDY. Who quakes.
C: MIRANDA
D: That's all.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
N: ON ANDY at home, pacing. She changes out of her work clothes into sweats while NATE makes her what looks to be the tastiest grilled cheese in history.
C: ANDY
D: You should have seen the look she gave me. I thought the flesh was going to melt off her face.
N: NATE laughs.
C: ANDY
D: It's not funny. She could be the most horrendous person I've ever met. She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal. And all the Clackers just WORSHIP her... They call them Clackers. Their stilettos in the marble lobby... clack, clack, clack...
E: CONT'D off his confused look
N: She pulls an ancient Northwestern sweatshirt over her head. She starts eating the grilled cheese, gesturing angrily with it as she talks.
C: ANDY
D: And they all act like they're curing cancer or something. The amount of time and energy they spend on things that DON'T MATTER!!! Poring over these minute details. And for what?
E: CONT'D MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: So tomorrow they can spend an extra 300,000 dollars reshooting something that was probably fine to begin with? To sell people things they don't need?
E: CONT'D
N: She puts down the sandwich.
C: ANDY
D: God, I'm not even hungry anymore. Maybe that's why everyone there is so skinny.
E: CONT'D
C: NATE
D: Gimme that. There's about eight dollars worth of Jarlsberg in there.
N: He takes the sandwich, takes a bite.
C: ANDY
D: I just have to stick it out for one year. Then I can do what I came to New York to do. I can't let Miranda get to me. I won't.
C: NATE
D: Easy, Killer.
C: ANDY
D: And give me that sandwich.
C: NATE
D: Oh, no way. It's mine now.
N: She grabs it away from him. He chases her, trying to get it back. MUSIC UP. THE WORK MONTAGE.

N: MIRANDA walks past ANDY. ANDY puts her best face on.
C: ANDY
D: Good morning, Miranda!

S: 47D INT. STUDIO -- DAY 47D
N: ANDY opens the door onto in a narrow room filled with semi- naked women changing into bikinis. Someone points ANDY towards the STYLIST... on the other side. She picks her way across, trying not to stare and, in an effort to avoid brushing against a body part, she veers into a rack of clothing, sending it clattering into the wall.

S: 47FB EXT. BRYANT PARK -- DAY 47FB
N: We see ANDY carrying the "hat" -- a funny, over-the-top concoction (at least 30 inches tall, perhaps with a taxidermied bird in it or something such...). People stare.

N: Widen out to see EMILY. A beat.

D: Wow. Thank God it's Friday, huh?
E: CONT'D

E: realizes
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 She tucks it in her purse. They smile at each other.
C: ANDY
D: It's so good to see you. You want to start grilling me now or should we wait until after dinner?
E: CONT'D
C: RICHARD
D: Thought I'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.
E: grins
C: ANDY
D: Oh, just go ahead.
E: smiles
C: RICHARD
D: We're just a little worried. We get emails from you at your office at 2 am, your pay is terrible, you don't get to write anything...
C: ANDY
D: Hey. Not fair. I wrote those e- mails.
E: still trying to keep it light
C: RICHARD
D: I'm just trying to understand why someone who was accepted to Stanford Law turns that down to be a journalist and now you're not even doing that--
C: ANDY
D: Oh please. Not this again.
C: RICHARD
D: Why did you even bother applying to law school?
C: ANDY
D: Because it's what you wanted. This is what I want.
C: RICHARD
D: This? Being a secretary?
C: ANDY
D: I'm an executive assistant.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: RICHARD
D: You hang coats, you go to Starbucks, you're a secretary, Andy.
C: ANDY
D: You have to trust me. Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors. Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months, she'll meet editors and writers from every important magazine.
N: But RICHARD still looks dubious.
C: ANDY
D: Dad, I swear. This is my break. This is my chance. This is my--

C: ANDY
D: I need a jet from Miami to New York... A jet, any kind of jet... Yes, tonight, right now. From Miami to New York. As soon as possible. Please call me back as soon as the situation changes. I'm trying, Miranda. No one is flying out because of the weather.

S: INT. MIAMI INT'L AIRPORT -- NIGHT

D: I've done everything I could think of. I don't know what else to do.

D: I'm sorry, Dad. Miranda, you don't understand. Even if I get you a plane, they won't let you take off tonight and--
E: CONT'D she picks up
C: MIRANDA
D: Emily. Stop making excuses. GET ME HOME.

D: Would it help if I talked to her?
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY stands in front of MIRANDA'S desk, cowed.
C: MIRANDA
D: The girls' recital was wonderful. They played Rachmaninoff and everyone loved it. Except for me... because I was not there.
C: ANDY
D: I'm so sorry, Miranda.
N: MIRANDA turns away from the window to look at ANDY.
C: MIRANDA
D: Do you know why I hired you?
N: ANDY shakes her head. MIRANDA turns to face her.
C: MIRANDA
D: I always hire the same girl, stylish, slender, worships the magazine. And often they turn out to be disappointing and stupid.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY blanches. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: But you, with your fancy resume and your big speech about your so-called work ethic-- I thought you would be different. I thought, go ahead, take a chance, hire the smart, fat girl.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY'S eyes widen (she's not even remotely fat, of course.)
C: MIRANDA
D: I had hope. I always have hope. But you're as disappointing as anyone else.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: I did everything I could think of--
C: MIRANDA
D: That's all.
N: And she goes back to her work. ANDY stands there a second, then leaves. And we see her eyes start to well.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY comes out of the office, biting back tears. She immediately starts running down the hall.
C: EMILY
D: Excuse me, where do you think you--
N: ANDY keeps running.
S: INT. RUNWAY - NIGEL'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY walks in, very upset. NIGEL looks up, surprised.
C: ANDY
D: She hates me, Nigel.
C: NIGEL
D: And that's my problem because -- wait, no. Not my problem.
C: ANDY
D: I need your help. I don't know what to do. It's like I'm completely beneath her contempt.
C: NIGEL
D: So quit.
C: 38A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: She looks at him. What?
C: NIGEL
D: We could replace you in five minutes. With someone who really wants this job.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: That's not fair. I'm lucky to be working for Miranda -- I didn't get that at first, but I do now. I want to be here. But it just seems like no matter how hard I try, I don't do anything right.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: Andy, please. Be serious. You're not trying. You're whining.
N: She looks shocked.
C: NIGEL
D: You want me to say poor you, Miranda is picking on you? She's just doing her job. Wake up, Six. You're working at the place that first published some of the major artists of the century -- Halston, De La Renta, Lagerfeld. And what they made is cooler than art, because you live your life in it -- I mean, not you, but some people. This is not just a magazine. It's a shining beacon of hope for, oh, I don't know, say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers, pretending to go to soccer practice when he was actually at sewing class and reading Runway at night under the covers with a flashlight.
E: CONT'D
N: He picks up steam as he talks.
C: NIGEL
D: You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls and what's worse, you don't care. Because this is a "stepping stone" for you. This place, that people would die to work, you deign to work. And you want to know why she doesn't give you a kiss on the forehead and put a gold star on your homework?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Okay, fine!
N: He looks at her.
C: ANDY
D: You're right. I'm screwing this up. And I know this could be a big break for me. I'm going to try harder, I promise. But there's one thing I can't do by myself.
E: CONT'D
N: She looks at him. He realizes what she's asking. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: Oh, no. No way...
C: ANDY
D: You do it with the other girls.
C: NIGEL
D: The other girls are different. They really want it.
C: ANDY
D: Please, Nigel. Don't make me beg...
N: He looks at her, thinking...
S: INT. RUNWAY - CLOSET -- DAY
N: NIGEL swings open the door to... ...a large room piled high with shoes, bags, clothes, furs, jewelry. ANDY follows, looking around at everything.
C: NIGEL
D: I don't know what you expect me to do. These are all sample sizes -- 2 and 4.
N: He thinks, hands her an item.
C: ANDY
D: A... poncho?
C: NIGEL
D: You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.
N: He looks around, assessing everything with a practiced eye. Then he starts flings clothing at ANDY.
C: NIGEL
D: Versace peasant skirt -- we can pull it up, belt it, make it a dress... Miu Miu boyfriend cardigan... Alberta Ferretti dress -- smocked, very forgiving. And let's find you some Chanel. You're in desperate need of Chanel.
E: CONT'D
N: As she catches the clothing. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: Don't just stand there. We have to get you to the beauty department too. And God knows how long that will take.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: EMILY is talking to SERENA.
C: EMILY
D: I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
C: SERENA
D: Me, neither. The other day we were in the Beauty Department and she held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said "What is this?"
N: They laugh at the total absurdity of this.
C: EMILY
D: I knew from the moment I saw her that she was a complete and utter--
N: And suddenly ANDY appears in her gorgeous clothes, her make- up impeccable, hair soft, loose and pretty. She looks grown-up, sexy and above all sophisticated.
C: EMILY
D: --disaster.
E: CONT'D voice trailing
N: ANDY sits down at her desk, pretends she didn't hear her. EMILY is still staring. ANDY'S phone rings.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda Priestly's office. She's not in. I'll leave word.
N: She hangs up. EMILY is still gaping.
C: ANDY
D: Can I help you, luv?
E: CONT'D in EMILY'S posh accent
S: EXT. NATE'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY waits for NATE outside his restaurant in the alley. He walk out, bantering with a couple other cooks. He starts to walk away, going...
C: 41A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: ...right past ANDY. Stops. Walks back a few steps. He looks her up and down, stunned.
C: ANDY
D: What do you think?
C: NATE
D: I think we better get out of here before my girlfriend sees me with you.
N: She smiles, grabs his hand and walks him down the alley. To where her town car is waiting. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Wanna lift, stranger?
N: MUSIC UP. THE MAKEOVER MONTAGE.
S: EXT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- DAY
N: We see ANDY exit her apartment, wearing a fabulous outfit... she walks behind a newsstand, emerging from the other side... in a completely different fabulous outfit...
S: 62A&B EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY 62A&B
N: She goes into the subway, then comes out of the subway in yet another great outfit...
S: 62C&D EXT. STARBUCKS -- DAY 62C&D
N: She enters Starbucks... emerges wearing another outfit, heads down the street... and walks behind a bus, emerging from the other side in one more fantastic outfit...
S: 62E EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY 62E
N: Each outfit over the course of the montage improves on the one before... until we see ANDY walking in the plaza of Elias- Clarke, indistinguishable now from all the other CLACKERS.
S: 62F INT. RUNWAY - RECEPTION - DAY 62F
N: Andy walks through the reception area, walks behind a wall, and continues through the hallway in another fabulous outfit.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE
N: ANDY enters. Sets a glass of Pellegrino down on the table. Just then MIRANDA enters, on the cell phone.
C: MIRANDA
D: The gowns are fabulous, Ralph. We're using the burgundy for the cover try and the lemon chiffon for the goddess story.
N: And just then she looks up and sees ANDY. The transformed ANDY. And her reaction of approval is tiny, but it's there. Of course she keeps talking like she didn't notice a thing.
C: 42A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. BAR -- NIGHT
N: ANDY joins her friends and NATE. She plops an expensive, fancy Bang & Olufsen phone on the table.
C: ANDY
D: Bang & Olufsen. Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.
E: MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: I looked it up online. It's 750 dollars. She doesn't want it, so Emily told me to keep it. Oprah sent a present. So did Jessica Simpson. And Nelson Mandela.
E: CONT'D
C: NATE
D: All for a woman who doesn't need anything. Perfect.
N: She reaches into her bag, hands out perfume, cosmetics. Etc.
C: ANDY
D: Here... A bunch of Kiehl's, some Mason Pearson hair brushes...
C: DOUG
D: Dammit, I love your job.
N: DOUG picks up one of the perfume bottles and is about to spray it on his hand when ANDY stops him.
C: ANDY
D: It's called "Pink". For women.
C: DOUG
D: Men can be pink. I have a pink side.
C: LILY
D: Please. We're eating.
N: ANDY hands LILY a blue purse. LILY gasps.
C: LILY
D: Where did you get this? This is the new Marc Jacobs, sold out everywhere. It's nineteen hundred dollars. I can't take this.
E: CONT'D
N: But LILY'S already happily transferring her things from her old purse into the new one.
C: ANDY
D: Sure you can.
C: NATE
D: Why do women need so many bags? You get one, it holds all your junk, aren't you done?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: DOUG
D: Fashion is not about utility, Nate. An accessory is merely a piece of iconography used to express individual identity.
C: LILY
D: And it's preeeetty.
C: DOUG
D: That too.
C: ANDY
D: Thing is, it turns out there's a lot more to Runway than fancy purses... you know who's coming into the office Friday? John Updike.
C: NATE
D: Why, does he need a sweater?
N: They all laugh. ANDY plucks the current issue of Runway out of her purse.
C: ANDY
D: Look, there's a piece by Jay McInerney, an essay by Joan Didion, an interview with Christiane Amanpour oh...
E: a bit peeved
C: NATE
D: Look who's drinking the KoolAid.
N: She gives him a look. Just then ANDY'S cell phone rings. MIRANDA. NATE grabs it.
C: ANDY
D: Give me the phone.
N: He checks the name on the phone.
C: NATE
D: Oh, look. The Dragon Lady. Of course.
C: ANDY
D: Give me the phone.
N: ANDY grabs for the phone. NATE tosses it to LILY. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: LILY
D: I'll talk to her. Tell her she needs to get her own scrambled eggs.
N: She tosses it to DOUG. ANDY practically tackles him, grabs the phone away.
C: ANDY
D: Come on, guys. Give me the phone!
N: They are all stunned by her vehemence. Including ANDY.
C: ANDY
D: Hello, Miranda. Fine. No problem. I'm leaving right now. You guys didn't need to be such assholes.
E: CONT'D beat hangs up
N: She exits. And all her friends exchange a look. 66 & 67 OMITTED 66 & 67
S: EXT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY pulls up in front of a loft building in Tribeca.
S: INT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY rings the buzzer. No answer but she can hear VOICES behind the door. She pushes it and it opens. Inside is a loft with a party going on. ANDY looks around -- it's one of those New York parties you think you'll never be invited to. She walks over to one of the super hot women.
C: ANDY
D: I'm looking for James Holt...
N: She points to a handsome man by the window. JAMES HOLT, one of the top designers, 40's, muscular, tan, impeccable. ANDY walks over to him.
C: ANDY
D: Hi, I'm Andy. I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: JAMES
D: You must be the new Emily. Let me see.
N: He checks her out. Looks at her handbag.
C: JAMES
D: Open-woven leather, pieced by hand and finished with a suede trim. Who made this fantastic thing?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: You.
C: JAMES
D: Duh.
N: He hands her a folio with a handle.
C: JAMES
D: It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit, the centerpiece of my spring collection. Top secret stuff.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY takes the folio.
C: ANDY
D: I'll guard it with my life.
C: JAMES
D: Come on. You work for Miranda, you must be in desperate need of hard liquor.
N: He walks her to the bar. She tries not to stare at the party GUESTS... is that Lenny Kravitz? Is that Julian Schnabel?
C: JAMES
D: She'll have the punch. It's deadly. Have fun!
E: CONT'D to the BARTENDER hands her the punch
N: And he walks away. ANDY clutches the glass of punch.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: He's right. I had the punch at James's last party, woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but boxers and a cowboy hat.
N: She looks over. Sees a great-looking, sophisticated man in his 30's who has an air of mischief. CHRISTIAN THOMPSON. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Hi. I, um... I have to go.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: But you want to stay. You've never been to a party like this.
C: ANDY
D: God, I love it when total strangers tell me how I feel.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's my way. Christian Thompson.
E: extends his hand
C: ANDY
D: Christian Thompson? You're kidding. You write for every magazine I love. I actually reviewed your collection of essays for my college paper.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Did you mention my good looks and killer charm?
C: ANDY
D: No, but I did point out some factual errors and a penchant for confessional semi-fiction that borders on self-indulgent.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You and the Times. And what do you do?
E: laughs
C: ANDY
D: Well, I want to work somewhere like the New Yorker or Vanity Fair. I'm also a writer, but--
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Is that right? I should read your stuff. Send it over.
C: ANDY
D: Thank you. That would be great. Anyway, for now I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.
N: And his expression immediately changes. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You're kidding. Oh, that's too bad. You'll never survive Miranda.
C: ANDY
D: Excuse me?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You're smart, you're nice, you have a point of view. You can't do that job.
N: ANDY hands him her glass of punch.
C: ANDY
D: I have to go.
N: She starts to leave.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Let me guess. You have a boyfriend waiting. From... not high school... college? Nice-looking guy, devoted, about to ask you to move in with him, but you're not sure...
N: She stares at him. Appalled. And, you know, intrigued.
C: ANDY
D: You. Are not a nice person.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Nice to meet you, Miranda girl.
N: He walks away. Steam practically pours out of her ears.
C: ANDY
D: For your information, he's really handsome. And we already live together!
N: This doesn't cause him to turn around, though it does cause a few other people to stare. ANDY walks away, embarrassed.
S: EXT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY'S walking back towards her and NATE'S apartment, holding the folio. She crosses paths with NATE.
C: NATE
D: You got the nuclear briefcase from the undisclosed location. I'm proud of you.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Where are you going?
E: surprised
C: NATE
D: Doug and some of his banker buddies are playing Texas Hold `Em at his apartment. Gonna go get me some of that Wall Street cash.
C: ANDY
D: But I came back so we could hang out.
C: NATE
D: Man, I'm sorry. You didn't make that crystal clear when you stormed off after calling me an asshole.
E: lightly
C: ANDY
D: Okay, look, I'm sorry about that--
N: He gives her a kiss.
C: NATE
D: I'll see you later, okay?
N: Just then NATE'S cell phone rings. NATE picks up.
C: NATE
D: Hello? (the way ANDY talks to
E: CONT'D
C: MIRANDA)
D: Sure, Doug! I'll get on it ASAP! A six- pack? No problem. Budweiser or Michelob? Chilled? Of course...
N: ANDY looks at him, hand on hip as he walks away. Very funny.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- LATER -- DAY
N: We see MIRANDA, studying the sketches JAMES sent over, spread out in the folio.
C: MIRANDA
D: Emily!
N: ANDY walks into MIRANDA'S office. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want to move the preview to today at 12:30. And tell everyone else. Be ready to leave in half an hour.

S: INT. RUNWAY - HALLWAY -- DAY
N: NIGEL looks surprised.
C: NIGEL
D: They're not expecting us until Tuesday. Did she say why?
C: ANDY
D: Yes, she explained every detail of her decision-making, then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.
C: NIGEL
D: I see your point.
S: EXT. STREET -- DAY
N: MIRANDA and ANDY ride along in heavy traffic. MIRANDA is tapping her foot, impatient.
C: ANDY
D: What's a preview, anyway?
E: O.S.
C: NIGEL
D: Miranda insists on seeing all the designer's collections before they show them.
E: O.S.
C: ANDY
D: And she tells them what she thinks?
E: O.S.
C: NIGEL
D: In her way. There's a scale. One nod, good. More than one nod -- very good. There is only one actual smile on record -- Tom Ford, 2001. If she doesn't like it, she shakes her head.
E: O.S.
S: 76A INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY 76A
N: Finally she leans forward to HENRY, the driver. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 76A CONTINUED: 76A
C: MIRANDA
D: Just let us out here.
N: She gets out. ANDY scrambles to grab her stuff and follow.
S: INT. RUNWAY - DAY
N: NIGEL shakes his head.
C: NIGEL
D: And then there's the pursing of the lips.
C: ANDY
D: What does that mean?
C: NIGEL
D: Catastrophe.
N: 78 & 79 OMITTED 78 & 79
S: INT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- DAY
N: MIRANDA walks in the elevator. ANDY hesitates, unsure if she's permitted to be in the elevator with her. Okay, fine.
S: INT. JAMES HOLT'S ELEVATOR -- DAY
N: Beat. MIRANDA and ANDY ride up together.
C: ANDY
D: Last time I was here, James was having this cool party and-- --and this is why you don't like people riding up in the elevator with you.
E: off MIRANDA's look
N: MIRANDA smiles a tight little smile. Precisely.
S: EXT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- DAY
N: Another town car pulls up and NIGEL, LUCIA, JOCELYN and some of the other Runway editors and assistants pile out.
S: INT. JAMES HOLT'S LOFT -- DAY
N: MIRANDA walks in. JAMES is standing there with his staff and his Public Relations team. JAMES is clearly buzzing.
C: JAMES
D: Miranda. Great to see you.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 MIRANDA diligently kisses both of his cheeks.
C: JAMES
D: You got the sketches for your dress.
E: CONT'D
C: MIRANDA
D: Yes. I did.
N: Beat. And she conspicuously does not say she liked them.
C: MIRANDA
D: Thank you.
E: CONT'D
N: And her tone is very remote. And now we can see JAMES really start to quake. MIRANDA arranges herself on the Mies daybed, legs folded, ramrod straight. The other RUNWAY editors -- NIGEL, JOCELYN and LUCIA and their assistants, stand behind MIRANDA. JAMES and his people stand off to the side as a few fit MODELS begin walking out in various outfits.
C: JAMES
D: This season I started to think about the intersection of East and West...
N: No one in the room watches anything except -- MIRANDA'S reaction. As JAMES speaks, we dissolve from outfit to outfit. JAMES is trying desperately to impress MIRANDA. He's practically tap- dancing.
C: JAMES
D: I didn't want to do, say, a blonde in a kimono. It's more about capturing the Eastern sensibility in the Western woman. Kind of Uma Thurman in Kill Bill in a kick ass dress with an obi belt. The modern woman as Geisha meets rock star, with a little Desperate Housewives thrown in.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly, there's a glimpse of movement from Miranda -- could it be a nod? Everyone holds their breath. No, she's just straightening her glasses.
C: JAMES
D: And this, of course, is the dress we're making for you.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 An overly busy red dress with too many fashion ideas being attempted at one time.
C: JAMES
D: A lush Asian fabric, tailored, but with a bit of movement to work against the modernism.
E: CONT'D
N: And suddenly, there it is, the kiss of death. The dreaded pursing of the lips.
S: EXT. STREET -- DAY
N: The Runway team files out, MIRANDA first. ANDY and NIGEL walk together.
C: ANDY
D: She pursed her lips and because of that he's going to change his entire collection?
E: sotto voce
C: NIGEL
D: You still don't get it, do you? Her opinion is the only one that matters.
N: MIRANDA, about to get into the town car, turns to ANDY.
C: MIRANDA
D: Make sure you confirm my dinner with--
C: ANDY
D: --Galliano at Pastis. Done.
C: MIRANDA
D: And I need to see the look book for the November denim shoot.
C: ANDY
D: It's in the car.
C: MIRANDA
D: Fine.
N: MIRANDA turns to leave, pauses.
C: MIRANDA
D: Oh, and you'll be bringing The Book to my home tonight. Emily will give you the key, Andrea. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RUNWAY -- DAY
N: CLOSE ON A key, as EMILY hands it to ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: Guard this with your life.
C: ANDY
D: Of course. If I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right, that she doesn't think I'm psycho. Oh, and she actually called me Andrea instead of Emily. Isn't that great?
C: EMILY
D: Yeah. Whoopee. Okay, now, it's very important that you do EXACTLY what I'm about to tell you.
E: deadpan
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- NIGHT
N: We hear EMILY'S voiceover as we see this happening.
C: EMILY
D: The Book is assembled by 10 or 10:30, so you must wait around until then.
E: V.O.
N: We see ANDY, waiting. The area around MIRANDA'S office is totally quiet.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
N: ANDY drifts in and looks at MIRANDA'S office -- the pictures of her with everyone from Desmond Tutu to Paris Hilton. Then ANDY walks over to MIRANDA'S pristine white couch. Sits on it. Hell, why not. Lies down on it. Gingerly. Then--
C: INTERCOM
D: Book's ready!
E: loud
N: And ANDY startles and falls completely off the couch.
C: 54A.

N: An editorial ASSISTANT brings ANDY The Book. It's heavy.

N: We see ANDY removing the dry cleaning from the closet -- about a dozen garments on hangers. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: EXT. STREET/INT. TOWN CAR -- NIGHT
N: ANDY whisks across town. It's late, the streets are quiet.
C: EMILY

E: V.O.
S: 90A EXT. STREET -- NIGHT 90A
N: ANDY unloads the car and walks up the flight of stairs in front of the townhouse, carrying the book and dry cleaning. She takes out a key.
C: EMILY
D: Let yourself in.
E: V.O.
N: ANDY takes a deep breath and turns the lock.
S: INT. FOYER -- NIGHT
N: ANDY steps into a marble-floored foyer with a large staircase looming right in front of her.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: On EMILY, intense.
C: EMILY
D: Do not talk to anyone. Do not look at anyone. That is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible. Do you understand?
S: INT. MIRANDA'S FOYER -- NIGHT
N: ANDY steps inside, her footsteps echoing through the foyer.
C: EMILY
D: Open the door, walk across the foyer, then hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.
E: V.O.
N: ANDY looks. There are two identical doors on each side of the staircase. Dammit. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: And leave the Book on the table with the flowers.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: ANDY looks. There are one, two, three tables... all in different areas of the house. She looks very confused.
C: ANDY
D: Shit.
N: Suddenly she hears a noise. She looks up and sees two girls of about 12, CASSIDY and CAROLINE, peering down the staircase.
C: CASSIDY
D: It's that door. On the left.
N: ANDY hangs the dry cleaning. The girls call down.
C: CAROLINE
D: You can give us the Book.
C: CASSIDY
D: We'll give it to her.
N: ANDY shakes her head. No no no.
C: CAROLINE
D: It's okay. Come on up.
C: ANDY
D: But I can't... Shh...
C: CASSIDY
D: It's okay.
N: And ANDY, unsure what to do, starts to walk up the stairs. She gets about halfway up when she hears voices... MIRANDA and her husband, STEPHEN are in the dining room, a sliver of which is visible from the foyer.
C: MIRANDA
D: What did you want me to do? Walk out in the middle of a photo shoot?
N: ANDY freezes. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: STEPHEN
D: I rushed out of an investment committee meeting early, then I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour...
C: MIRANDA
D: We were in a loft near the Seaport. My phone didn't work. I told you.
C: STEPHEN
D: ...and I knew what everyone in the restaurant was thinking. There he is, waiting for HER again--
N: And as he says this he stops, curious. There on the stairs, head peeking into the second floor, is ANDY, frozen. With the TWINS smiling at her. And before ANDY can stop herself, her eyes float over to STEPHEN'S. Eye contact. Her heart does a flip. And her eyes dart over to MIRANDA and they make eye contact as well... ... and MIRANDA gives ANDY a look of utter coldness, disgust and judgement. ANDY freezes.
S: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
N: ANDY closes the door to the townhouse, heart pounding.
S: INT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY crawls into bed next to NATE, heart racing, and looks up at the ceiling, freaking out.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY walks in, already bracing herself, and runs into EMILY, emerging from MIRANDA'S office, very upset.
C: ANDY
D: Okay, before you start freaking out, it wasn't such a big deal. The twins said hello, I said hello back, then I went upstairs and gave the book to Miranda--
C: EMILY
D: You went upstairs? Oh my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: You're right. I made a mistake.
C: EMILY
D: Don't you understand? If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me. And if that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area until I find you and kill you.
C: ANDY
D: Wait a second. She's going to fire me?
C: EMILY
D: I don't know. She's not happy.
N: And they hear MIRANDA'S voice, ringing out from the office.
C: MIRANDA
D: An-dre-a.
N: ANDY and EMILY exchange a look. Oh, boy.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY walks in, apprehensive.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda, about last night, I--
C: MIRANDA
D: I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.
C: ANDY
D: Of course. I'll run down to Barnes & Noble right now.
C: MIRANDA
D: Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?
C: ANDY
D: Not that I can recall.
C: MIRANDA
D: We have all the published Harry Potter books. The girls want to know what happens next.
N: ANDY stands there a moment, fully aware of the impossibility of what MIRANDA just asks. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: So you want the... unpublished manuscript.
N: MIRANDA gives her a look. Is there a problem?
C: MIRANDA
D: We know everyone in publishing. Shouldn't be a problem. You can do anything, right?
E: beat
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- LATER
N: ANDY paces, panicky. EMILY watches her.
C: ANDY
D: She doesn't get it. There's no way I can get that book. I don't care who I call.
N: Just then MIRANDA walks out. ANDY springs up to get her coat.
C: MIRANDA
D: My girls are leaving on the train to their Grandmother's at 3. They'll need the book by then.
C: ANDY
D: Of course.
C: MIRANDA
D: I'd like my steak in fifteen minutes.
C: ANDY
D: No problem.
N: MIRANDA exits.
C: ANDY
D: Great. I have to get the impossible manuscript in four hours. And Smith and Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30. How am I supposed to get the steak? She's going to fire me, isn't she? She's just prolonging the kill. Like an evil cat with a tiny unfashionable mouse.
E: CONT'D paces
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: Oh look, you're getting paranoid. Yay. It's not just me. Listen, don't freak out. There could be a silver lining here.
N: ANDY looks at her. Really?
C: EMILY
D: When Miranda gives someone an impossible task, it generally means one of two things. One, she thinks you can actually pull it off.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Or--
C: EMILY
D: Or, you know, that thing you were saying about the cat.

D: It's for Miranda Priestly... it's very important. Yes, I know, it's impossible to get...
N: ...she raps on the door of the closed restaurant. The MANAGER recognizes her, lets her in.
S: INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY'S -- DAY
N: From the bar, ANDY watches the steak sizzle, pacing nervously. ANDY'S cell phone rings. She grabs it.
C: ANDY
D: Anything? Can you try again? I would really appreciate any leads at all... thanks. No pressure. If I don't have it by 3, I'm fired.
C: MARTY
D: What an amazing job, working for someone like Ms. Priestly.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Yeah. It's a real party.
N: ANDY walks towards the door. And suddenly something catches ANDY'S eye... We see what ANDY'S looking at -- an ad on the side of the bus stop advertising the latest issue of the New Yorker. ANDY sees a familiar name: CHRISTIAN THOMPSON.
S: INT. TAXI -- DAY
N: CHRISTIAN answers his cell phone.
C: ANDY
D: You probably don't remember me. We met at James Holt's party and I work for Miranda Priestly and--
E: O.S.

N: 104pt EXT. STREET -- DAY 104pt ANDY on the cell phone.

D: The Harry Potter manuscript? You've gotta be kidding.
C: ANDY
D: I'm sorry to ask you. I'm desperate.
E: O.S.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Just tell her it can't be done. You'll have to come up with a plan B.
N: On ANDY.

S: INT. RUNWAY - HALLWAY -- DAY
N: ANDY runs down the hall with MIRANDA'S food, passing EMILY.
C: ANDY
D: Is she back? Am I fired?
C: EMILY
D: You know, I rarely say this to people who aren't me, but you need to calm down.
N: ANDY ignores her, racing around getting the dishes and silverware for MIRANDA'S steak.
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: We see the steak, prettily arranged on MIRANDA'S china. ANDY sets up the salt and pepper. MIRANDA walks in. When MIRANDA sees the steak, she freezes.
C: MIRANDA
D: What is that doing here? I ordered it ages ago.
N: ANDY looks confused. Ages?
C: MIRANDA
D: Luckily, before I starved to death, Irv invited me to lunch. Get rid of that. I'll be back at 3. Please have my Starbucks order waiting.
E: CONT'D re: steak
N: And before she exits...
C: MIRANDA
D: And if you don't have the Harry Potter book by then, don't come back.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RUNWAY - KITCHEN -- DAY
N: ANDY carries a tray with all the food on it into the kitchen. A beat. She looks down at the tray. And suppresses an urge to throw the whole thing at the wall. She positions the tray over the garbage and tilts it, letting everything -- steak, china, silverware -- fall into the can. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY
N: ANDY is getting MIRANDA'S coffee.

E: on the cell phone jump cut jump cut jump cut to to the BARRISTA
N: The BARRISTA gives her a look.
C: ANDY
D: Sorry, my boss is particular. Are you sure? You're my last shot. All right, well, thanks for trying.
E: CONT'D into phone sighs
N: She hangs up. The BARRISTA hands her the coffee.
C: BARRISTA
D: Sounds like a great job.
C: ANDY
D: Actually, it is. A million girls would kill for it.
N: And she starts to laugh. The girl stares at her.
S: EXT. STARBUCKS -- DAY
N: ANDY walks out of the Starbucks with the order on a tray. ANDY stands there a moment. People bustle around her, as she finds herself at a literal crossroads. She looks up at the building. Suddenly she stops a PASSERBY who looks at her, curious. Yeah, lady?
C: ANDY
D: Want a mocha?
N: And ANDY starts passing Starbucks to people on the street. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. NATE'S RESTAURANT - KITCHEN -- DAY
N: NATE on the phone. Intercut with him and ANDY on the street.

D: I failed. She's going to fire me anyway. Might as well beat her to the punch.
C: NATE
D: Wow. Good for you. Congratulations, Andy. You're free.
C: ANDY
D: Call you later.
N: ANDY hangs up, and immediately her phone rings again. She looks down. Assuming it's NATE.

C: ANDY
D: No. That would mean I actually... did something right. But see... thing is... See, I was about to...
E: stunned
N: And we see ANDY. She looks up at the Elias-Clarke building, teetering on a precipice. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 110pt CONTINUED: 110pt

S: 111B EXT. STREET/INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY 111B
N: We see HENRY, driving MIRANDA. He hangs up the cell phone. Then he turns down a side street. MIRANDA catches his eye in the mirror. What the hell?
C: HENRY
D: Too much traffic on 5th. UN's in session.
N: MIRANDA makes an annoyed face.
C: 65A.

S: INT. RUNWAY - HALLWAY
N: The tray with Miranda's Starbucks on it... We follow it down the hall and see it being set on MIRANDA'S desk. And beside it lands boom! an envelope. Widen out to see--
S: 115A INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY. 115A
N: MIRANDA, looking at the envelope. And then we see ANDY. She stands there, quiet, calm. And if MIRANDA is amazed by what ANDY did, she doesn't show it. She opens the envelope, looks in.
C: MIRANDA
D: One copy? What are my twins supposed to do with that... share?
C: ANDY
D: Actually I made two copies. And had them color-copied, re-set and bound so they wouldn't look like manuscripts.
N: She smiles. MIRANDA nods, but still won't concede the point.
C: MIRANDA
D: And where exactly are those fabulous copies? I don't see them anywhere.
S: INT. TRAIN -- DAY
N: The MetroNorth from New York City to Bedford. In the front row, we see two girls in matching outfits with two matching Harry Potter manuscripts. The twins, with their NANNY beside them. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY smiles at MIRANDA. Her faith in herself restored.
C: ANDY
D: Anything else I can do for you?
E: brightly
S: EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY
N: ANDY walks out. The CLACKERS stream in and out of the building. And ANDY raises her arms and does a victory dance, now graceful in her stilettos. People stare. Doesn't bother her.
S: INT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
N: ANDY is making a small diorama of the planetary system. NATE walks in. He's carrying a bag of groceries.
C: NATE
D: I went over to Dean & DeLuca -- man, they charge like five bucks a strawberry, but I figured, you quit, we should celebrate.
C: ANDY
D: Listen, Nate--
N: And he sees what she's doing. Realizes.
C: NATE
D: So you quit, but you're still doing the twins' science project. Big of you.
C: ANDY
D: After I called you, I realized... It doesn't make sense to throw away all these months of hard work. I just had a moment of weakness. That's all.
C: NATE
D: Either that or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.
N: She looks at him.
C: NATE
D: Okay. Whatever. It's your job.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: That's all it is, Nate. Just a job.
C: NATE
D: No, no. It's an important magazine. That's what you said, right?
N: He sees the latest issue of Runway. Picks it up.
C: NATE
D: Let's see... How to buy a custom-made 600 dollar bra. That's important. A list of the 10 best wrinkle creams under $500. That's important.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: I get the point, Nate.
N: He continues leafing through.
C: NATE
D: The new Botox. The new pea coat. The new Gstaad. What the hell is--
E: wrestling with the word
C: ANDY
D: Gstaad. It's a ski resort. In Switzerland.
C: NATE
D: See? I now live with someone who knows that. Thank you, Miranda Priestly.
C: ANDY
D: Nate, it's not like I run the magazine. I just work there, remember?
N: NATE doesn't say anything, keeps putting away groceries. She walks over to him.
C: ANDY
D: I'm the same person I was. I still want the same things.
E: CONT'D
N: But he doesn't look too convinced.
C: ANDY
D: I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NATE
D: That's the thing -- I liked your old clothes.
C: ANDY
D: What about these? These are pretty nice.
E: re: her shoes
N: He doesn't take the bait.
C: ANDY
D: And this skirt? Okay. What about this?
E: CONT'D nothing
N: She unbuttons her shirt, revealing a bra that costs more than every item of clothing NATE owns combined. Beat.
C: NATE
D: I like that.
N: He grabs her and kisses her.
S: 119A INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY 119A
N: The senior staff members are gathered around a table -- NIGEL, JOCELYN, LUCIA, a few others including PAUL, the art director of the magazine.
C: NIGEL
D: ...Posen's doing some very sculptural suits, so Testino wants to shoot them at the Noguchi Garden in the Chase building.
C: MIRANDA
D: Perfect. What about the accessories pages for April?
C: JOCELYN
D: One thought was enamel -- bangles, pendants, earrings--
C: MIRANDA
D: We did that two years ago. What else?
C: JOCELYN
D: Well, they're showing a lot of florals for spring and so--
C: 68A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 119A CONTINUED: 119A
C: MIRANDA
D: Florals. For spring. Groundbreaking.
C: PAUL
D: But we thought about shooting them in an industrial space.
N: She looks at him. Death ray. He soldiers on.
C: PAUL
D: We thought the contrast between the femininity of the florals--
E: CONT'D
N: And she's still just staring. He continues falling forward.
C: PAUL
D: --and the um, the more raw, rough-hewn nature of the backdrop would create a tension which--
E: CONT'D
C: MIRANDA
D: No.
C: PAUL
D: --which--
C: MIRANDA
D: No.
N: Just then EMILY walks in with a note for MIRANDA. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 119A CONTINUED: (2) 119A Before she can get all the way across the room, EMILY dissolves into hacking coughs. MIRANDA gives her a look, then turns back to her staff.
C: MIRANDA
D: Anyone have anything I can actually use?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY is at her desk. EMILY walks back, blowing her nose, rubbing her eyes -- basically, a Nyquil ad.
C: ANDY
D: Are you okay?
C: EMILY
D: Tonight's the benefit. I've been looking forward to it for MONTHS. I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing Valentino. Everyone's going to be leaving to get dressed soon, so after you drop off Miranda's Fendi bag at the re-beaders, you can just go home.
E: blows her nose
C: ANDY
D: Great. Thanks. That's perfect, because I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before they close...
N: ANDY grabs her purse and, from under her desk, she retrieves a wrapped present.
C: ANDY
D: ...it's Nate's birthday and we're having a little party for him--
E: CONT'D
N: EMILY looks at her. Too sick and too Emily to care.
C: ANDY
D: Anyway, have fun tonight.
E: CONT'D
S: 120A INT. LOBBY -- DAY 120A
N: ANDY, feeling liberated, walks out, carrying the present and a shopping bag with MIRANDA'S bag in it. And that's when her cell rings.

S: INT. RUNWAY - MIRANDA'S OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY and EMILY walk in together, looking confused. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: I want to make sure before the benefit that you are both fully prepped on the guest list.
N: ANDY and EMILY exchange a look.
C: ANDY
D: Um... I thought only the first assistant went to the benefit.
C: MIRANDA
D: Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to be disgustingly ill. You'll come and help Emily.
N: On EMILY and ANDY'S surprised faces.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: They walk out. EMILY is clearly peeved.
C: EMILY
D: I don't see why she needs both of us.
N: Eight second coughing fit.
C: ANDY
D: Don't look at me. This is the last thing I want to do.
N: EMILY dumps something on ANDY'S lap -- a book of what looks like mug shots.
C: EMILY
D: These are all the guests. Miranda invites everyone. We have to make sure they all think she knows exactly who they are. I've been studying for weeks.
C: ANDY
D: I need to learn all these people by tonight?
C: EMILY
D: Don't be silly.
N: She pulls out another big book of headshots.
C: EMILY
D: You have to learn these too. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05

E: CONT'D back to LILY
N: She hangs up.
C: ANDY
D: Will that fit me?
E: CONT'D
C: NIGEL
D: Of course. A few extra yards of fabric and a staple gun and we're in business.
S: INT. RUNWAY - STUDIO -- LATER
N: We see ANDY from behind as the MAKEUP ARTIST applies the finishing touches. He studies her.
C: NIGEL
D: Remember, there are two keys to wearing an evening gown -- one is to maintain a regal bearing. The second--
C: 71A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: He mimes adjusting one's boobs in a strapless dress.
C: NIGEL

E: CONT'D
S: EXT. STREET/INT. TOWN CAR -- NIGHT

C: ANDY
D: Let's see. My feet are killing me, everything pinches...
E: V.O.
S: EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NIGHT
N: All lit for a gala charity benefit. A red carpet lined with notables leads up the steps.
C: ANDY
D: ...my breasts are squeezed into a ball and this hairpiece is like having a boulder pinned to my head...
E: V.O.
N: And suddenly the door to the town car opens and ANDY steps out onto the red carpet. And she looks unbelievable, gorgeous, perfect.
C: ANDY
D: Never felt better.
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: ANDY walks up the red carpet where she catches sight of NIGEL, talking to reporters on the red carpet.
C: NIGEL
D: ...this benefit is the social event of the season. It represents what Runway is about -- grace, style, elegance...
N: As he says "elegance", he catches sight of ANDY, smiles and does a smaller version of the "adjusting the girls" gesture. ANDY smiles at him and walks on. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 Just then EMILY spots ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: Oh my God, Andy. You look... chic.
N: But ANDY is busy staring at EMILY, in her strapless dress.
C: ANDY
D: And you look... so thin.
C: EMILY
D: Do I? It's for Paris. I'm on a new diet. I don't eat anything, and then, when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.
E: flattered
C: ANDY
D: It's definitely working.
C: EMILY
D: I know. I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
C: ANDY
D: That's... great.
N: EMILY smiles proudly, then dissolves into another round of bone-rattling coughs.
C: EMILY
D: Ready?
S: INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT
N: ANDY and EMILY enter. It's beautiful. Everything in sight is white -- white tulips, bone white china, white candles. All the GUESTS are in black or white. EMILY looks around. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: We need to make sure we're there the second she walks in.
C: ANDY
D: I was wondering how long you think we'll have to stay because I was hoping to--
C: EMILY
D: There she is.
N: Just then MIRANDA walks in. She's wearing the awkward dress from JAMES'S sketches, made over to perfection. EMILY and ANDY rush over to MIRANDA.
T: QUICK CUTS at the ball.
N: ANDY and EMILY stand at MIRANDA's side as she fields greetings. EMILY whispers to MIRANDA.
C: EMILY
D: John Folger. New artistic director, Circle in the Square.
E: CONT'D

C: EMILY
D: She knows him.
E: shushes ANDY
C: MIRANDA

C: MASSIMO
D: I would never miss a chance to see you, Miranda, darling.
C: 73A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: A DISTINGUISHED COUPLE approaches. Walks towards MIRANDA, ANDY and EMILY. MIRANDA holds her smile, waiting for information.
C: MIRANDA
D: Emily?
E: smiling
N: EMILY racks her brain. Which goes blank. She starts to panic.
C: EMILY
D: That's... Wait... I know who that is... It's...
E: fumbling
N: Seeing EMILY struggle, ANDY leans in to MIRANDA.
C: ANDY
D: Ambassador Franklin. And that's the woman he left his wife for, Rebecca. The woman he's leaving HER for is the man walking down the stairs in Valentino.
N: MIRANDA greets the couple.
C: MIRANDA
D: Ambassador, Rebecca.
N: EMILY whispers to ANDY.
C: EMILY
D: Thanks.
N: Just then ANDY sees a very fashionable WOMAN, with a more avant-garde look than MIRANDA, headed for them. And she's being escorted by none other than... IRV. EMILY whispers to ANDY. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: That's... Jacqueline Follet, right? From French Runway.
E: trying to remember what she studied
C: EMILY
D: Yes. Oh my God. Miranda hates her. She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left...
N: As she says this we see MIRANDA greeting JACQUELINE "warmly".
C: MIRANDA
D: Ah, Bonsoir, Cherie. Ta robe est rudement chouette.
C: JACQUELINE
D: I like your dress too. Very... Americaine. Sportif.
C: MIRANDA
D: Thank you for coming to our little get together tonight.
C: JACQUELINE
D: Of course. I plan my whole year around it.
C: MIRANDA
D: And we're all so grateful.
C: JACQUELINE
D: After all, we're family, no?
N: She smiles at IRV, who smiles right back. MIRANDA smiles too, but looks like she'd rather throw darts at JACQUELINE. ANDY quickly steps forward.
C: ANDY
D: Alors, Jacqueline, ditez-moi, avez- vous rencontré Brad Pitt?
C: JACQUELINE
D: Ah, no... Pas encore...
N: And ANDY pulls JACQUELINE across the room. LATER, the party is in full swing. EMILY and ANDY are with MIRANDA, who is talking to a group of luminaries including IRV.
C: 74A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: EMILY turns to ANDY and whispers.
C: EMILY
D: You can go. I've got it from here.
C: ANDY
D: Are you sure?
C: EMILY
D: Go. Have fun.
N: And for the first time they seem like friends. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Thank you. Thank you so much.
E: amazed
N: But just as ANDY'S about to leave, STEPHEN appears, quite drunk, and joins MIRANDA'S group.
C: MIRANDA
D: Darling, there you are.
C: STEPHEN
D: It's a banner evening. Three people have failed to recognize me, one person called me Mr. Priestly, and now the damned bartender refuses to serve me.
N: Everyone looks uncomfortable. STEPHEN turns to IRV.
C: STEPHEN
D: Why don't you get me a drink? He's gotta listen to you, right, little guy?
E: CONT'D
N: Everyone freezes. MIRANDA forces a laugh. An awful beat. And ANDY leaps in, quickly turns to IRV, distracting him.
C: ANDY
D: I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been dying to ask you... Is it true that John Cheever used to ghostwrite the editor's page of Manhattan Magazine in the 50's?...
N: And while she chats with him, MIRANDA puts her arm around her husband and leads him gently away.
C: MIRANDA
D: Come on, darling, let's get something to eat. I'm starved, aren't you?
N: And as she walks away, MIRANDA turns. And MIRANDA mouths the words "Thank You" to ANDY. ANDY'S eyes go wide in disbelief. Then she smiles. Yes!
S: EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NIGHT
N: ANDY trots down the steps, starting to take down her hair as she races to the car.
C: 75A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
N: Suddenly she looks up. And sees CHRISTIAN, walking up the steps, looking better than anyone ever should in a tuxedo. He smiles and clutches his heart like he's been shot by cupid.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Look at you... you're a vision. Thank God I saved your job.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Hey, I figured out a few things on my own, too. Turns out I'm not as nice as you thought.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: God I hope not.
N: He openly admires her in a way that makes it clear he's imagining her with the dress off.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: If you didn't have that stupid boyfriend, I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Do you really say things like that to people?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Evidently.
C: ANDY
D: I have to go...
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Are you sure? My editor from Vanity Fair is in there and I was going to introduce you to him. You sent me your stuff, remember? I have to be honest, I only read a couple -- that was quite a big packet - - but they weren't half-bad. You're pretty talented, Andy. He should meet you. Come on in. Just one drink.
E: off her look, surprised
C: ANDY
D: Well, maybe I could-- No no no. I can't. I just can't.
E: quickly
N: ANDY turns and races towards her town car.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Say hello to the boyfriend for me.
N: ANDY looks at her watch as she runs away. Winces. She's so late.

S: 130A INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT 130A
N: ANDY walks in, holding a cupcake with a lit candle on it. NATE'S watching ESPN. He barely looks up.
C: ANDY
D: Happy Birthday.
N: NATE turns off the TV, looks at her.
C: ANDY
D: Nate, I'm so sorry. I was trying to leave, but there was a lot going on and I didn't have a choice and--
E: CONT'D
C: NATE
D: Don't worry about it. I'm going to bed.
N: He walks past her.
C: ANDY
D: Can we at least talk about it this--
N: He starts to leave, turns, looks at her.

D: You look really pretty.
N: And he walks into the bedroom. ANDY stands there, feeling terrible.

N: Very early. ANDY is getting dressed, by now every bit as expert as the girls in the beginning of the movie. She pauses a moment, watching NATE sleep. Then she exits. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: 130C INT. RUNWAY -- DAY 130C
N: ANDY on the phone.
C: ANDY
D: I don't understand what's so difficult about scheduling a preview. If you want Miranda to give you any editorial, we'll need to see the clothing at least three weeks before the show. Yes, please. See what you can do.
N: She hangs up. EMILY looks over at her, raises an eyebrow.
C: EMILY
D: Everything okay?
C: ANDY
D: Yeah. I'm... fine.
N: The phone rings.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda Priestly's office. Thanks. I gotta go pick up the Polaroids from the shoot.
E: CONT'D hangs up
S: 130D EXT. ZOO -- DAY 130D
N: Outside at the zoo. We see MODELS, wearing gorgeous evening gowns, their faces partly obscured by beautifully detailed masks depicting different animals. We see NIGEL, JOCELYN and a few CLACKERS.
C: JOCELYN
D: No, no, no. I think Gisele should be the lizard and Vivian the donkey.
C: NIGEL
D: The lizard's better with the Dolce. Sometimes I can't believe I talk about this crap all day.
E: beat
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 130D CONTINUED: 130D Two of the CLACKERS are checking out the MODELS. CLACKER #2 God, we should have a pig mask for Rhona. CLACKER #1 I know. She's huge. We see the model they're talking about. Perfectly skinny, of course. Just then ANDY walks over. The CLACKER hands ANDY a stack of Polaroids. ANDY turns to go, but NIGEL stops her.
C: NIGEL
D: Get these to Miranda right away. Tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rochas.
C: ANDY
D: Great. No problem.
E: flat
C: NIGEL
D: Hey. Adjust the attitude. Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
C: ANDY
D: Sorry. Busy day. And my personal life is going down the drain. That's all.
C: NIGEL
D: Join the club. You start to do well at work, that's what happens.
N: ANDY looks at him. I'm doing well at work?
C: NIGEL
D: Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke. That means it's time for a promotion.
E: CONT'D
N: 131-134 OMITTED 131-134
S: INT. MIRANDA'S FOYER -- NIGHT
N: ANDY steps in, carrying the dry cleaning and The Book, moving quickly. Suddenly she hears a voice, emerging from upstairs.
C: MIRANDA
D: Andrea. Come up here.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 ANDY practically has a heart attack.
S: 135A INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 135A
N: ANDY walks in, curious. And scared. ANDY steps into the apartment,
C: MIRANDA
D: Paris is the most important week of my year. I need the best team possible with me.
N: And this is when ANDY starts to have a bad feeling.
C: MIRANDA
D: That no longer includes Emily.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY realizes...
C: ANDY
D: Wait. You want ME to -- oh, no. No, no. Emily would die. Her whole life is about Paris.
N: MIRANDA stares. Doesn't care.
C: ANDY
D: She hasn't eaten in weeks. I can't do that, Miranda. I can't.
E: CONT'D
C: MIRANDA
D: If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future at Runway or any other publication.
N: ANDY looks at her.
C: MIRANDA
D: The decision is yours.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: But--
C: MIRANDA
D: That's all.
S: EXT. MIRANDA'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
N: ANDY walks out of the building. ROY opens the door to the town car, but she waves him away. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT
N: ANDY walks downtown alone, thinking. Walks by a newsstand covered with the latest Runway... a store window filled with the latest fashions... a bunch of people her age drinking at an outdoor restaurant, looking carefree...
S: INT. ANDY & NATE'S APARTMENT -- LATER
N: ANDY looks through the clips of all her articles from college. And at a picture of herself at graduation, surrounded by her parents, her relatives, her friends. Her parents are beaming, exuding pride.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: The desks outside MIRANDA'S office are empty. We hold for a few beats. Then ANDY comes in, walking slowly, still unsure. And at that moment MIRANDA appears. They look at each other. MIRANDA nods, almost imperceptibly. ANDY nods back. And MIRANDA takes her coat off. ANDY holds out her arms to take the coat from her. But MIRANDA puts the coat on EMILY'S desk instead. Right in front of EMILY'S Arc de Triomphe screensaver. And then MIRANDA strides into her office. ANDY sits down, trying to grasp the magnitude of what just happened. And just then MIRANDA pokes her head back in.
C: MIRANDA
D: Don't forget to tell Emily.
N: And we see ANDY'S face. Me?
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: ANDY is waiting for EMILY, dreading her arrival. Suddenly she can't take it anymore. She dials the phone.
S: EXT. MIDTOWN STREET -- DAY
N: EMILY is in even more than her usual tizzy.
C: ANDY
D: Emily--
E: O.S.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: EMILY
D: Sorry I'm late. Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermes and she told me yesterday but I forgot and so--
C: ANDY
D: Emily, I have to talk to you.
E: O.S.
C: EMILY
D: I freaked out of course, but then I just called Martine at home and she opened the store early, so I got them.
N: EMILY juggles an Hermes bag, her purse, her cell phone, almost mows down an OLD LADY. She mouths "Sorry."
C: ANDY
D: Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want to talk to you about something--
C: EMILY
D: I hope it's not another Miranda problem--
C: ANDY
D: Not exactly.
C: EMILY
D: Good. Because I've got so much to deal with before I go, I swear to God I can't even--
N: And that's when EMILY steps into the street without looking. The second she steps off the sidewalk-- Blam! EMILY is hit by a taxi. We see her purse, her cell phone, her shopping bags, some of the orange Hermes boxes, and some of the scarves as they fly through the air.
S: INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL -- DAY
N: ANDY sits in the waiting room, distraught.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
N: Lying in a hospital bed, her face with no make-up, wearing a dumpy hospital robe, EMILY looks like what she is... ...a skinny tired young GIRL. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 ANDY stands by the window, arms folded, defensive.
C: EMILY
D: I don't care if she was going to fire you or beat you with a red hot poker, you should have said no.
C: ANDY
D: I didn't have a choice. You know how she is.
C: EMILY
D: Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.
N: Just then an ORDERLY walks in with her dinner, laden with fattening foods -- a cream soup, bread, pasta, cheese and dessert. EMILY grabs a pudding, peels off the foil top.
C: EMILY
D: What gets me about this whole thing is, you're the one who pretends you don't care about this stuff. You don't care about fashion, you just want to be a journalist, blah, blah, blah. What a load of bollocks.
E: CONT'D
N: She angrily finishes the last spoon of pudding, grabs a dinner roll, which she starts to butter.
C: ANDY
D: Look, I know you're mad. And I don't blame you.
C: EMILY
D: Face it, Andy. You sold your soul the day you put on your first pair of Jimmy Choos.
N: She bites off a hunk of dinner roll...
C: EMILY
D: And you know what really kills me? The clothes you're about to get. You don't deserve them. You eat carbs, for Christ's sake. It's so unfair. Just go.
E: CONT'D with her mouth full takes another bite
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Emily--
C: EMILY
D: I said, go!
S: INT. CHELSEA GALLERY -- NIGHT
N: LILY has curated a show at the gallery where she works. LILY rushes around. NATE is not there yet. ANDY stands with DOUG.
C: DOUG
D: You're going to Paris for the couture shows? That's the coolest fashion event of the year -- who are you going to see Galliano? Lagerfeld? Nicolas Ghesquiere?
C: ANDY
D: Okay, now you're scaring me.
N: Just then LILY walks over to them.
C: ANDY
D: Lily, this show is amazing. I am so proud of you.
E: CONT'D
C: LILY
D: I wasn't sure you would be able to make it.
C: ANDY
D: What are you talking about? I wouldn't miss this.
N: LILY and DOUG look at her. ANDY (cont'd) (CONT'D) Okay, so lately I've missed a few things... a lot of things... almost everything.
C: LILY
D: I'm just glad you're here. Start with the murals in the other room. They're amazing...
N: 145A A LITTLE LATER-- 145A ANDY looks at the artwork. Suddenly she hears a voice.
C: 84A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 145A CONTINUED: 145A
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Hey, Miranda Girl.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 145A CONTINUED: (2) 145A She closes her eyes. Can't be. She turns. Yup.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I was just thinking about you.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Come on.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It's true. I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview and I was making plans for Paris and found myself wondering if you would be there.
C: ANDY
D: Actually...
N: Stop smiling. Why am I smiling? ANDY (cont'd) (CONT'D) I am going--
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's great. I'm staying at a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh across the street from a falafel restaurant that will change your life.
C: ANDY
D: Sorry. I'll be too busy working. You'll have to find someone else's life to change.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: But that's just it. I'm starting to wonder if I can.
N: And with that, he leans in, plants a soft kiss on her cheek. ANDY closes her eyes, blushing like crazy. When she opens her eyes, CHRISTIAN is gone. And it's not for a moment that she notices... ... LILY, about ten feet away, staring at her, a look of surprise and disgust on her face.
S: 145B INT. CHELSEA GALLERY -- NIGHT 145B
N: ANDY follows LILY through the gallery. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 145B CONTINUED: 145B
C: ANDY
D: He's just a guy I know from work.
C: LILY
D: Yeah. That looked like work.
C: ANDY
D: You're making a big a deal out of--
C: LILY
D: The Andy I know is madly in love with Nate, is always five minutes early and thinks Club Monaco is couture. For the last 16 years I've known everything about that Andy, but this person?
N: She gestures to ANDY. LILY (cont'd) (CONT'D) This glamazon who skulks around in corners with some random hot fashion guy? I don't get her. ANDY looks at her, stunned.
C: LILY
D: Have fun in Paris.
E: CONT'D
N: She turns and walks away. ANDY turns. NATE is standing there.
C: NATE
D: You're going to Paris?
C: ANDY
D: It just happened--
C: NATE
D: I thought Paris was some big deal for Emily and--
C: ANDY
D: Great. Now you're going to give me a hard time, too?
N: And ANDY walks away, upset. NATE follows her.
S: EXT. GALLERY -- NIGHT
N: NATE follows ANDY outside.
C: NATE
D: What the hell is wrong with you?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Miranda asked me and I couldn't say no, okay? I didn't have a choice.
C: NATE
D: I know, I know. That's your answer for everything lately. I didn't have a choice. Like this job was forced on you. Like you don't make these decisions yourself...
C: ANDY
D: Okay. I get it, you're mad because I work late all the time, because I missed your birthday party--
C: NATE
D: Oh, come on. What am I, four?
C: ANDY
D: You hate Runway. And Miranda. You think fashion is stupid. You've made that clear.
C: NATE
D: Andy, I make port wine reductions all day. I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps. I wouldn't care if you were out all night pole dancing if you did it with some integrity.
C: ANDY
D: So now I have no integrity. Great.
C: NATE
D: You used to say this was just a job. You made fun of the Runway girls. And now you've become one of them.
C: ANDY
D: That's absurd.
C: NATE
D: Look at you. Now that I know how much you're willing to change to be successful, it makes me wonder if we ever had anything in common.
C: ANDY
D: You don't mean that.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NATE
D: I do. I really do.
N: Beat. ANDY tries to catch her breath.
C: ANDY
D: Then maybe this trip is coming at a good time. Maybe we should take a break.
N: She stands there, waiting for him to protest, throw his arms around her. He looks at her. Stunned at what she just said. And after a painful moment, he simply walks away.
C: ANDY
D: Nate!
E: CONT'D
N: He turns. And just then her phone rings. They both know who it is. And that she has to take the call.
C: NATE
D: In case you're wondering, the person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in.
N: The phone keeps ringing.
C: NATE
D: I hope you two are very happy together.
E: CONT'D
N: And he walks away. ANDY clicks on the phone.
C: ANDY
D: Hello, Miranda...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. PARIS -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT
N: A limo drives across the city.
S: INT. LIMO -- NIGHT
N: ANDY looks out the window, watching Paris at night whizzing by. And even though she's still feeling melancholy, she is awed by what she sees. MIRANDA, sitting across from ANDY, is not even looking out the window. She's looking through the Book. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: EXT. PLACE DE VENDOME -- NIGHT
N: The Paris Ritz. MIRANDA'S limo pulls up.

C: ANDY
D: This is my room?
N: 151-154 OMITTED 151-154
S: INT. FASHION SHOW - PARIS -- DAY
N: ANDY sits in the front row beside MIRANDA. Half the INVITEES are looking at the clothes. The other half are watching MIRANDA'S reaction to the clothes.
S: INT. FASHION SHOW -- NIGHT
N: Backstage at a fashion show where the models are undressing and changing... MIRANDA hobnobs with designers, editors and celebrities and ANDY is right there beside her.
S: EXT. FASHION SHOW -- DAY
N: MIRANDA walks by some paparazzi outside the Chanel show. They scream her name. She shows off her best smile. ANDY squints, blinded by the flashbulbs. Suddenly she hears a voice behind her.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You know, I've been thinking, and you still owe me for Harry Potter.
N: She turns. Sees CHRISTIAN. And she finds herself alarmingly happy to see him. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Oh, do I?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Of course you do. You working tonight?
C: ANDY
D: Actually, Miranda has a dinner.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: So you're free. Perfect. Oh, but there's a problem, huh? Le Boyfriend.
N: At the mention of this, ANDY blushes slightly.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Wait. Don't tell me, The boyfriend is non plus? Je suis trés trés desolé.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Oh, you're so full of it. You are not desolé at all.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Yeah, not even a little. What time should I pick you up?
S: INT. RITZ HOTEL - MIRANDA'S SUITE -- EVENING
N: ANDY walks in, cheerful, carrying a seating chart. She is surprised to see MIRANDA just sitting on the sofa. There's a strange lag before she looks up at ANDY. ANDY registers something is odd. Finally--
C: MIRANDA
D: There you are. We need to go over the seating chart for the luncheon.
E: distracted
N: ANDY starts to take the chart out of her bag, but she can't help but notice MIRANDA is... staring into space.
C: ANDY
D: Sure. No problem. I have it right here, um...
N: And finally MIRANDA focuses on her. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.
N: ANDY puts down the seating chart. MIRANDA studies it. And there's an uncharacteristic lag in her decision making. ANDY watches her. Something definitely is up.
C: MIRANDA
D: Okay, so, first of all, let's put Jay- Z at my table.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: But your table is full.
C: MIRANDA
D: Stephen won't be coming.
N: She takes his the tab off the seating chart and removes it. ANDY looks at her, not understanding.
C: ANDY
D: So Stephen is not... so you don't need me to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?
C: MIRANDA
D: Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce, then "fetch" him. Fetch away.
N: ANDY now freezes.
C: MIRANDA
D: When we get back to New York, we'll need to think of a way to keep it out of the press.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Of course.
C: MIRANDA
D: Another divorce in the papers... and we all know what they'll say about me - - Dragon Lady, career-obsessed, drove away another "Mr. Priestly".
N: And despite herself, MIRANDA wanders off her path... The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: He knew who I was, you know. They all did. And at first they're always proud to be with a powerful, accomplished woman. That's what they say. But then...
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY is afraid to move a muscle, afraid to startle MIRANDA.
C: MIRANDA
D: I don't care what anyone says about me, of course. But it's so unfair to the girls... another disappointment, another stepfather, gone...
E: CONT'D
N: She tries to shake herself out of it.
C: MIRANDA
D: I mean, the point is--
E: CONT'D
N: She pauses to collect herself. For a second ANDY thinks she might actually fall apart.
C: MIRANDA
D: We really need to figure out where to put Donatella because she's barely speaking to anyone.
E: CONT'D
N: Beat. And ANDY can't believe she's recovered so quickly.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda, I'm so sorry. If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.
N: And her pitying tone finally shakes MIRANDA back.
C: MIRANDA
D: Don't be ridiculous... why would you do that?
N: Beat. And ANDY can't believe she's recovered so quickly.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda, is there... is there anything else I can do?
N: And MIRANDA slowly looks at her, the ice completely forming.
C: MIRANDA
D: Your job.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: EXT. RITZ HOTEL -- NIGHT
N: We see MIRANDA, striding out of the lobby. And what we notice is... she looks fine. Done up, confident walk.
S: INT. LIMO -- NIGHT
N: MIRANDA closes the door. And now that she's alone, for one second her veneer cracks. She takes a breath. Moving on.
C: MIRANDA
D: Go.
E: to the DRIVER
S: 162A INT. HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT 162A
N: ANDY is dressed for her date with CHRISTIAN. Just then there's a knock at the door. ANDY opens it.
C: NIGEL
D: Hi. Listen, I need Miranda's itinerary because--
N: He looks at her outfit.
C: NIGEL
D: Who put that together for you?
E: CONT'D
N: She hands him the itinerary.
C: ANDY
D: What do you mean?
C: NIGEL
D: That outfit.
C: ANDY
D: Oh, I just threw it on.
C: NIGEL
D: Incredible. Well, I guess my work here really is done. Come on. Let's have champagne. We're celebrating.
E: takes it in
N: He walks over to the minibar and takes out champagne, pops the cork, pours two glasses.
C: ANDY
D: What are we toasting?

C: NIGEL
D: To getting the dream job, the one a million girls wanted.
C: ANDY
D: Nigel. I got my job months ago.
C: NIGEL
D: I'm not talking about you.
N: She looks at him, confused.
C: NIGEL
D: James Holt. Massimo is investing in James' company, taking it global with the rest of CFG -- shoes, bags, fragrances, the works. So James needs a partner. And that would be me. Miranda knows. She put me up for it.
E: CONT'D off her look
C: ANDY
D: You're leaving? Nigel, I can't imagine Runway without you.
E: stunned
C: NIGEL
D: Can you believe it? For the first time in eighteen years, I'm going to call the shots in my own life. One day I might be able to come to Paris and actually... see Paris.
C: ANDY
D: God. I'm so happy for you, Nigel. You deserve it.
C: NIGEL
D: Bet your ass.
N: He raises a glass. They toast.
S: INT. L'AMBROISIE -- NIGHT
N: CHRISTIAN and ANDY have dinner in a tiny romantic restaurant on the Place des Vosges.
C: ANDY
D: ...I've never seen anyone as dedicated as Miranda.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: CHRISTIAN
D: That's fantastic. Can we stop talking about her now?
C: ANDY
D: I'm just saying, yes, there are things she does I don't agree with, but...
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Oh, come on, Andy. You hate her. Just admit it. She's a notorious sadist, and not in the good way.
C: ANDY
D: Okay, so she's tough, but if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything but how great she is at her job.
N: CHRISTIAN bursts into laughter.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I can't believe this. You're defending her. The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories -- you're crossing over to the dark side.
C: ANDY
D: I resent that.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: You shouldn't. It's sexy.
N: He pours her more wine. And despite herself, she smiles.
C: ANDY
D: Sexy? Really?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Really.
S: EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT
N: They walk home together through the Place Des Vosges, leaning against each other. ANDY is tipsy.
C: ANDY
D: I have no idea where we're going. You could be leading me anywhere...
C: 95A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Don't worry. I know this city like the back of my hand. It's my favorite place on the planet. You know what Gertrude Stein said -- "America is my country and Paris is my hometown."
N: She looks at him and laughs.
C: ANDY
D: You are unbelievable. Do you write that stuff down and file it away to use on girls?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: I work free-lance. Leaves me with some time on my hands.
C: ANDY
D: Well, I never understood why everyone was so crazy about Paris, but now...
N: She swirls around.
C: ANDY
D: It's. So. Beautiful.
E: CONT'D
N: And suddenly he catches one of her arms and almost like a dance move pulls her into him and kisses her.
C: ANDY
D: I can't do this.
E: CONT'D Another kiss MORE
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: Nate and I only split up a few days ago. I've had too much wine and my judgement is impaired. I barely know you and I'm in a strange city. I'm out of excuses.
E: CONT'D Another kiss Another kiss He kisses her again
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Thank God.
S: INT. CHRISTIAN'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
N: ANDY and CHRISTIAN are kissing on his bed.
S: INT. CHRISTIAN'S HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
N: ANDY wakes up. Her hair and make-up from the night before are askew. She realizes what she did. We hear the sound of the shower running. She sits up. Catches sight of herself in the mirror. Ouch. Checks the clock on her phone. Late. Shit. ANDY starts getting dressed, quickly. She tries to find her left shoe, pulls on the bedspread, knocking a few papers on the bedside table. And that's when sees something. A mock-up of a magazine. With the familiar RUNWAY logo. She picks it up. 167-170 OMITTED 167-170
S: INT. SHOWER -- DAY
N: CHRISTIAN stands under the spray of water. Suddenly the shower curtain is yanked back. ANDY standing there, furious. Holds up the issue of mock-up.
C: ANDY
D: What the hell is this?
N: CHRISTIAN, cool as can be, steps out and grabs a towel, which he wraps around himself. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: CHRISTIAN
D: What does it look like? It's a mock- up.
C: ANDY
D: Of?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline is the new editor-in- chief.
N: He walks into the hotel room.
S: 171A INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAY 171A
N: ANDY follows him. He calmly dresses as they talk.
C: ANDY
D: They're replacing Miranda?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: Yes. And she's bringing me in to run all the editorial content. Are you really surprised? Jacqueline is a lot younger than Miranda. Has a fresher take on things. Not to mention that American Runway is one of the most expensive books in the business. Jacqueline does the same thing with a lot less money. Irv is a businessman, you know.
E: off ANDY'S stunned look
C: ANDY
D: Miranda will be devastated. Runway is her whole life. He can't do that to her.
C: CHRISTIAN
D: It's done. Irv's going to tell Miranda after the party for James.
C: ANDY
D: And she has no idea...?
C: CHRISTIAN
D: She's a big girl. She'll be fine.
N: He reaches out to grab her arm. But she looks at him with utter contempt. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 171A CONTINUED: 171A
C: ANDY
D: I have to go.
N: She walks away. He calls after her.

E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOTEL CRILLON - CORRIDOR -- DAY
N: ANDY runs down a corridor. She paces a second, knowing she's going to get her ass kicked, then knocks on the door. IRV opens the door. We see MIRANDA behind him. When she sees ANDY, she walks over. Turns to IRV.
C: MIRANDA
D: Excuse us a moment.
N: MIRANDA pulls ANDY into the hall.
C: MIRANDA
D: Have you lost your mind?
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: I have to talk to you.

S: INT. CHATEAU -- DAY
N: Finally, ANDY sees MIRANDA walking in. MIRANDA prepares to walk right past her.
C: ANDY
D: Miranda, wait. I have to talk to you. You can fire me if you want to after that, but... Irv is going to make Jacqueline Follet editor-in-chief of Runway. Christian Thompson told me, he's going to work for her. Irv's going to tell you today. I thought if I told you now, you could fix it.
E: gathers all her nerve
N: ANDY stands there, breathless. Waiting for MIRANDA'S reaction. And MIRANDA looks past her... ...we see she's scrutinizing a passing floral arrangement.
C: MIRANDA
D: Are those freesias?
C: ANDY
D: What? No. I specifically told them--
C: MIRANDA
D: If I see freesia anywhere, I will be very disappointed.
N: She walks away. Leaving ANDY standing there.
S: INT. CHATEAU -- DAY
N: We see MIRANDA, mingling with everyone, looking completely poised. ANDY watches her. Just can't believe her composure. She spots CHRISTIAN. He raises a glass. She looks away. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 Suddenly the room quiets as NIGEL steps to the podium.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CHATEAU -- DAY
N: NIGEL is at the podium introducing MIRANDA.
C: NIGEL
D: For seventy-two years, Runway has been more than a magazine, it's been a beacon of elegance and grace. Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon, setting a standard that inspires people across the globe. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.
N: We see ANDY, applauding as MIRANDA steps to the podium.
C: MIRANDA
D: Thank you everyone. Before I talk to you about James and everything he's accomplished, I have news.
N: JAMES smiles at her, raises a glass of champagne.
C: MIRANDA
D: Tonight is not just an important night for me, for Runway, and for James, it's also important for someone else in this room...
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY shoots a look at CHRISTIAN. Can tell from the look on his face he has no idea where this is going.
C: MIRANDA
D: As of next month, James will be partnering with CFG in an expansion of his line.
E: CONT'D
N: Light applause.
C: MIRANDA
D: James and Runway have one important thing in common -- a commitment to excellence.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY looks over at NIGEL. Beaming. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: MIRANDA
D: And so it comes as no surprise that James has selected someone from the Runway family as the new copresident of JH International...
E: CONT'D
N: NIGEL straightens his suit.
C: MIRANDA
D: My esteemed colleague, Jacqueline Follet.
E: CONT'D
N: And she indicates JACQUELINE, who waves. Everyone applauds. ANDY'S mouth falls open. She looks over at NIGEL again. His face betrays nothing. He applauds along with everyone else. And ANDY looks to CHRISTIAN. Who is also shocked as hell.
C: MIRANDA
D: Let's wish Jacqueline the best as she pursues this wonderful opportunity.
E: CONT'D
N: A hearty round of applause for JACQUELINE. MIRANDA smiles.
C: MIRANDA
D: And now to the business at hand. A celebration of one of my favorite designers...
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles at JAMES. 182-187 OMITTED 182-187
S: INT. CHATEAU -- LATER
N: ANDY watches everyone swirling around MIRANDA. She walks over to NIGEL among the crowd of well-wishers.
C: ANDY
D: You said it was your dream job.
N: He turns to her. Some emotion on his face now.
C: NIGEL
D: I've given her everything I have, Andy. She knows that.
C: ANDY
D: But you don't need her. You could just leave anyway and-
C: 101A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: When the time is right, she'll pay me back.
E: quickly cutting her off
C: ANDY
D: You sure about that?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NIGEL
D: No. But I hope for the best. I have to.
N: And he rejoins the swirl. Just then CHRISTIAN catches ANDY'S eye. At the same time, MIRANDA appears in front of her.
C: MIRANDA
D: I'm ready to go.
N: And ANDY turns and walks away, without so much as a glance back at CHRISTIAN.
S: INT. LIMO -- DAY
N: MIRANDA and ANDY ride in the limo on their way back to Paris. MIRANDA is as relaxed as we've seen her.
C: MIRANDA
D: You thought I didn't know.
N: ANDY nods.
C: MIRANDA
D: I've known what was happening for quite some time. It took a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline, one she would accept. Turned out, that James Holt job is so absurdly overpaid--
E: CONT'D
N: 189aaA INT. RESTAURANT -- DAY 189aaA MIRANDA introduces MASSIMO to JACQUELINE.
C: MIRANDA
D: --she jumped at it.
E: V.O.
N: 189baA INT. LIMO -- DAY 189baA ANDY takes this in...
C: MIRANDA
D: Then I let Irv know Jacqueline was unavailable.
N: 189aA INT. MIRANDA'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY 189aA MIRANDA welcomes IRV into her hotel suite. 102aA. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 189aA CONTINUED: 189aA
C: MIRANDA
D: Truth is, there's no one who can do what I do, her included.
E: V.O.
N: 189aB INT. LIMO -- DAY 189aB ANDY watches MIRANDA, stunned.
C: MIRANDA
D: Any of his other choices would find the job impossible and the magazine would surely suffer. Especially because of the list--
N: 189aC INT. MIRANDA'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY 189aC A quick flash of MIRANDA with IRV. She pushes a list across the table.
C: 102A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 189aC CONTINUED: 189aC
C: MIRANDA
D: --designers, photographers, editors, writers, models, all of whom were found and nurtured by me...
E: V.O.
N: 189aD INT. LIMO -- DAY 189aD ANDY listens, amazed.
C: MIRANDA
D: ...all of whom have promised to follow me whenever and if ever I leave Runway. To any publication I choose. Of course, as soon as Irv understood, he reconsidered.
N: 189aE OMITTED 189aE 189aF INT. LIMO -- DAY 189aF ANDY looks at MIRANDA, taking it all in. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 189aF CONTINUED: 189aF
C: MIRANDA
D: I must say, I was impressed with you, how intently you tried to warn me.
N: ANDY looks at her, stunned that she knows.
C: MIRANDA
D: I never thought I would say this, Andrea, but I see some of myself in you. Your dedication, your focus.
E: CONT'D
N: MIRANDA looks out the window. They're approaching the next party and the paparazzi are waiting outside...
C: MIRANDA
D: People think success happens to you. It doesn't. You choose it. Every day, I choose excellence. Who else does what I do, at my level? Nobody. They don't even understand what it takes, the days, measured in milliseconds...
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY stares at her.
C: MIRANDA
D: But now you know --and I know -- that you have it in you. That you can see beyond what other people want and choose for yourself.
E: CONT'D
N: She smiles, like she's just given ANDY an enormous compliment. ANDY reels.
C: ANDY
D: But I don't think I am like that.
N: MIRANDA looks at her. Oh?
C: ANDY
D: I couldn't do what you did to Nigel, Miranda. There's no way I could do something like that.
E: CONT'D
N: Pause. ANDY can barely believe what she said. But instead os exploding... MIRANDA smiles.
C: MIRANDA
D: Of course you can. You already did. To Emily.
N: ANDY reels. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 189aF CONTINUED: (2) 189aF
C: ANDY
D: That's not what I -- that was different. I didn't have a choice.
C: MIRANDA
D: No. You did choose. You chose to get ahead. You want this life, those choices are necessary.
C: ANDY
D: But what if it's not what I want? I mean, what if I don't want to live the way you do?
N: MIRANDA looks at her and smiles, and this time, for the first time, her smile is almost maternal.
C: MIRANDA
D: Don't be silly, Andrea. This is what everyone wants. Everyone wants to be us.
N: And with that she opens the door to the limo...
S: 189A EXT. RED CARPET 189A
N: ...onto the red carpet where she is instantly embraced by the flashing lights of the cameras. ANDY quietly steps out behind MIRANDA. Squinting. She's never gotten used to the lights. MIRANDA moves down the red carpet. We follow her. It's not until MIRANDA is about to open the door that she realizes... ANDY is no longer beside her.
S: EXT. PARIS STREET -- EVENING
N: We see ANDY, walking up the street in the dusky light. She has never looked more beautiful. She is serene. And she is free. The wind blows through her hair. She smiles. Her phone rings. She looks down. Sees the name MIRANDA. ANDY doesn't break stride for a moment as she... ...tosses the ringing phone into the nearest fountain.
C: 104A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. AIRPORT -- DAY
N: ANDY walks off the plane. Sees LILY standing there, among the CHAUFFEURS, holding a sign that says SACHS. ANDY cracks up, walks over to her.
C: LILY
D: Sorry. Town car's in the shop.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: You're such a pain.
C: LILY
D: And you'd be lost without me.
C: ANDY
D: True.
N: They hug. And start walking away together...
C: LILY
D: Does this mean I have to give my purse back?
N: She hugs it close.
S: INT. REUNION RESTAURANT -- DAY
N: ANDY waits nervously. NATE walks in, slides into the booth across from her.
C: NATE
D: I have to be at work in ten minutes. What's up?
C: ANDY
D: I just wanted to say...
N: She gathers her nerve.
C: ANDY
D: Nate, you were right. About everything. I turned my back on my friends, my family, on everything I believed in. And for what?
E: CONT'D
C: NATE
D: Shoes. And jackets and belts and--
C: ANDY
D: Nate, I'm just... I'm so sorry.
N: Beat. He looks at her.
C: NATE
D: I flew up to Boston while you were gone. Interviewed at the Oak Room.
C: ANDY
D: And?
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: NATE
D: You're looking at their new sous-chef. I'm moving up there in a few weeks.
C: ANDY
D: That's great, I... congratulations.
N: A moment. As it sinks in what this means.
C: ANDY
D: Don't know what I'm going to do without those late night grilled cheeses.
E: CONT'D
C: NATE
D: They have bread in Boston. Might even have Jarlsberg. We might be able to figure something out.
C: ANDY
D: You think?
C: NATE
D: You never know.
N: They smile at each other. Friends, at least, for now.
C: NATE
D: So, how about you? What are you going to do now?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Not sure.
C: NATE
D: I'm not worried about you. Anything you try, you're gonna kick ass.
C: ANDY
D: You think so?
C: NATE
D: No. I know it.
C: ANDY
D: Thanks. I actually have a job interview today.
N: Beat. He looks her up and down.
C: NATE
D: And that's what you're wearing?
C: 106A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. OFFICE -- DAY
N: ANDY sits across from a scruffy guy in his early forties.
C: EDITOR
D: You know our pay is crap.
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
C: ANDY
D: That's fine.
C: EDITOR
D: Your clips were excellent. That thing on the janitor's union... that's exactly what we do here.
N: She smiles, humble now.
C: EDITOR
D: My only question is... Runway? What the hell kind of blip was that?
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Learned a lot. In the end, though, I kind of screwed it up.
C: EDITOR
D: That's not what I hear.
N: ANDY looks at him, confused.
C: EDITOR
D: I called over there for a reference, left word with some snooty girl, next thing you know I got a fax from Miranda Priestly herself--
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY blanches.
C: EDITOR
D: ...saying that of all the assistants she had, you were by far her biggest disappointment.
E: CONT'D
N: ANDY takes a deep breath...
C: EDITOR
D: And that if I don't hire you I'm an idiot.
E: CONT'D
N: On ANDY, stunned.
C: EDITOR
D: You must have done something right.
E: CONT'D
N: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: EXT. ELIAS CLARKE -- DAY
N: ANDY walks over to the Elias-Clarke building, looking at a place that was, in its way, a home to her. Her eyes sweep up the building to the Runway offices. She takes out her cell phone.
S: INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY
N: We see EMILY, back at her desk. The camera widens out so we can see... a new SECOND ASSISTANT, eager and nervous. She is showing EMILY a letter.
C: EMILY
D: My God, you call this a letter? Can you spell any word in the English language?
N: The phone rings. EMILY picks up.
C: EMILY
D: Miranda Priestly's office.
E: CONT'D
C: ANDY
D: Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I have a favor to ask you.
S: 198A INT. RUNWAY -- BULLPEN -- DAY 198A
N: EMILY looks incredulous.
C: EMILY
D: You're joking. YOU have a favor to ask of ME?
S: 198B EXT. STREET -- DAY 198B
N: ANDY is walking up the street, on her cell phone.
C: ANDY
D: Thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris and I don't have anyplace to wear them, so I was wondering... is there any way you could take them off my hands?
N: Beat. EMILY realizes what ANDY is offering, but she won't let that show...
C: 108A.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 198B CONTINUED: 198B
C: EMILY
D: Well, I don't know. It is a huge imposition, but I suppose I could help you out... I'll have Roy pick them up this afternoon.
C: ANDY
D: Thanks, Emily. I appreciate it.
S: 198C INT. RUNWAY -- DAY 198C
N: And without a goodbye, EMILY hangs up. The slightest smile creeps across EMILY'S face, but she quickly recovers, hands the ASSISTANT the letter.
C: EMILY
D: Why can't you be more like Andy?
S: EXT. STREET -- DAY
N: ANDY hangs up her phone and smiles. And suddenly she sees MIRANDA walk out of the building, on the phone.
C: MIRANDA
D: ...I don't understand why it's so challenging to get a car when I ask for one.
C: EMILY
D: It should be there any second.
E: O.S.
N: And at that moment the car edges into view. MIRANDA hangs up and strides towards it. And just then something catches MIRANDA'S eyes. ANDY, watching her. They look at each other. A beat. And then ANDY nods her head -- in thanks, in salutation, and in farewell... But MIRANDA does not react. She gets into the car. ANDY shakes her head. That's MIRANDA. She smiles, then turns and starts to walk down the street.
C: 108B.
D: The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05
S: INT. CAR -- DAY
N: MIRANDA gets in, sits back in her seat. Through her window she can see ANDY, a bounce in her step, walking away... And MIRANDA, alone, where no one can see her, finally breaks into a real smile. The Devil Wears Prada 2nd Blue In Progress 12/00/05 She nods to her driver. Let's go.
S: EXT. STREET -- DAY
N: ANDY walks away, smiles, shakes her head, the whole thing almost like a dream. And as she continues moving confidently in the opposite direction from MIRANDA we...
