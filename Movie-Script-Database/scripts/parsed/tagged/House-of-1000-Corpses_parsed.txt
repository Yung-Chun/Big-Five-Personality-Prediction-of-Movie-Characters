N: From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody inside starts SHOUTING at each other. Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against the wall, screaming in pain. We move QUICKLY towards the entrance.
S: INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT
N: Suddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a sledgehammer. Rich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead. Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red.

C: JERRY
D: Alright then, out of all of Charlie's chicks who do you think is the hottest?
S: INT. CAR - FRONT SEAT - NIGHT
N: Fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the car's dashboard, a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear-view mirror. Behind the wheel, the driver, BILL HUDLEY, 29, downs the last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing it among the other trash before him.
C: BILL
D: I guess if I had to choose I'd say... mmmmmm... Sandra Good. She seemed like a nice girl, I mean in a psycho kind of way.
N: Beside him rides, JERRY GILMORE, 30, slumped down in his seat, reading a magazine with a flashlight, feet hanging out the window.
C: JERRY
D: Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.

C: BILL
D: Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her? Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.

C: BILL
D: Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
C: JERRY
D: Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
C: BILL
D: I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
C: JERRY
D: I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
C: BILL
D: Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
C: JERRY
D: Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
C: BILL
D: Hot has got nothing to do with it.
S: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
N: A LONE FIGURE in a cheap skull mask and white robe stands hidden behind a billboard off to the side of the road. Bill's car drives past.

D: Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
E: sitting up reading the sign
C: BILL
D: Perfect.

S: EXT. CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

S: INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT
N: Spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood. Bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter. In the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure. It is the size of a small child. A banner above reads: AQUALINA - THE MERMAID.
C: BILL
D: How long have you been running this place?
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
N: Spaulding slides the mop and bucket behind the counter.

E: pointing to Aqualina
S: INT. SPAULDING'S - RESTROOM - NIGHT
N: The restroom is gray, dingy, a single exposed light bulb hangs from the ceiling. The peeling walls are plastered with
T: newspaper clippings and faded photos.
N: Mary is in the stall, sitting on the toilet, staring straight ahead at a poster of RHONDO HATTON, a B-MOVIE ACTOR that suffered from acromegalia. Denise standing at a tiny sink, splashes water on her face. She looks at herself in the mirror.

C: MARY
D: It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
C: MARY
D: I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
C: DENISE
D: A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
C: MARY
D: If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.

N: Jerry knees over a box of magazines labeled TRUE CRIME $1.00, he flips through an issue, tosses it back. Bill leans against the wall next to him, sipping a hot cup of coffee. The girls return from the bathroom. Jerry jumps up with excitement.

C: DENISE
D: Tickets for what?
C: JERRY
D: This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.

C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Anytime this year, people. Alright line your asses up in front of the black door. The tour is about to begin.
N: Spaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter. The kids wait. The black metal door CREAKS open. They enter the darkened room.
S: INT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT
N: Darkness. A blue light comes on. Spaulding is standing on a MOTORIZED PLATFORM. He begins the tour, speaking through a small megaphone.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God. To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish.
E: pointing with a cane
N: A lifeless wax figure POPS forward with a loud metal CLANG. Mary jumps back with fright.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning himself with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray...

C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: To your right. One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein.
N: Behind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain woman. Mary recoils in disgust.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Murderer, cannibal and momma's little bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special pleasure in playing with the dead bodies of women, especially their sexual organs. He was quite a handy little dandy, fashioning lamp shades, jewelry and human skin suits from his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: A wax figure of a young man in doctor's scrubs. He is covered in blood.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: And now I would like to introduce a local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse Nellie and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.
N: Another wax figure, of a bloody corpse, JUMPS up.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Murderer, torturer and most of all master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern at Willows State Mental Hospital, nicknamed Weeping Willows for its neverending cries of pain, took great pleasure in control. Through primitive brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill, or so the story goes. His terrifying experiments continued until 1952.
N: Jerry stares fascinated.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: At which time he was discovered and turned over to authorities for observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale was abducted from his cell by members of the victims' families. Vigilante justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was taken out and hanged. The next day his body was found to be missing. Some say he survived, rescued by his loyal slaves, others say they hung the wrong man... To this day no sign of Dr. Satan has ever been discovered. But who knows? Maybe he lives next door to you.

C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Please exit through the door.

S: EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The camera moves down a quaint quiet little street. We come to rest at a modest two-story house. The house is decorated for Halloween. Parents and their children roam from house to house, trick or treating. We hear the sound of a phone ringing.

N: An OLD FARMER and his WIFE stare directly into the camera.
C: OLD MAN
D: I don't know where that skunk ape sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all... all I know is he eats squirrels to survive and he had impure relations with my wife.

C: JERRY
D: Keep straight on this road here.
C: BILL
D: How much further?
C: JERRY
D: I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
C: BILL
D: I don't know.
N: Mary and Denise sit bundled up in blankets.
C: MARY
D: Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
C: DENISE
D: Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
C: JERRY
D: Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
C: BILL
D: What's that?
N: Through the windshield we see a LONE FIGURE hitch-hiking by the side of the road. It is a girl, BABY, 27, in a worn cowboy hat and long fur coat. She is soaked to the bone.
C: JERRY
D: It's a hitchhiker.
C: BILL
D: Way out here?
C: MARY

C: JERRY
D: Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
C: DENISE
D: That seems likely.
E: sarcastically
C: MARY
D: Should we stop?
C: BILL
D: We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
C: MARY
D: She looks like a freak.
C: DENISE

C: JERRY
D: Really, that's a long time.
C: BABY
D: Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
C: JERRY
D: Yikes.
C: BABY
D: Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
C: DENISE
D: Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest way for a girl to travel.
C: BABY
D: Yeah, but it's fun.
C: MARY
D: Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
C: BILL
D: Where ya headed?
C: BABY
D: Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.

C: JERRY
D: Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
C: BABY
D: Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
C: JERRY
D: Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
C: BABY
D: Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
C: JERRY
D: What?

D: Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
S: INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL
N: The camera FLOATS through the hallways of the Peabody Mental Institution. It is HALLOWEEN. PATIENTS wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns and cheap plastic masks. Some are laughing, some are screaming. We move into a private room. Where we see DOCTOR SATAN completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a BOUND AND GAGGED PATIENT. We move off the doctor to a crayon child's DRAWING of a JACK- O'-LANTERN. Tortured screams fill the room.

E: to Denise
S: EXT. STRANGER'S POV - SAME
N: A gun barrel is raised and we are looking through the sight at the car. Pop! Pop! Pop! The GUN fires THREE SHOTS at the car's rear tire. The stranger whistles and the dog moves to the side of the road.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: The SOUND of the heavy rain MASKS the gunshots.
C: BILL
D: Hey, he moved.
C: MARY
D: Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
N: As the car moves past, Denise stares at the dog sitting calmly to the side of the road. The dog blankly stares back at her.
C: JERRY
D: That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
C: BILL
D: Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
C: JERRY
D: No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
C: BABY
D: I'd like to see that.
C: MARY
D: Nice.
C: JERRY
D: The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
C: BABY
D: Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
N: Without warning the car lunges to one side.
C: JERRY
D: What was that?
C: BILL
D: Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

C: BILL
D: I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
C: JERRY
D: Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
C: BILL
D: Jesus Christ, Jerry.
C: JERRY
D: Well, technically I did what ya said.
C: BILL
D: You're a real fucking piece of work.
N: Bill stares at Jerry in disbelief.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT

C: BABY
D: Are you two gals all funny with each other?

D: For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we gonna do?
N: Baby starts laughing.
C: MARY
D: What the hell are you laughing about?
C: BABY
D: I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
C: MARY
D: Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho.
E: muttering to herself
C: BILL
D: I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
C: BABY
D: If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
C: MARY
D: Just back up.
C: JERRY
D: I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
C: BABY

C: BILL
D: Fine. I'll go straight.
C: MARY
D: What!
C: BILL
D: Fine! I'll go straight!
E: over the loud music
N: The car moves forward. After about fifty yards the car HITS something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog.
C: BILL
D: Fuck! We are fucked!
C: DENISE
D: Turn that fucking radio off!
N: Bill shuts off the radio.
C: DENISE
D: Now what are we gonna do?

C: BILL
D: Well, yeah, kind of.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Jerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book on Freak Shows. Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up under layers of blankets and clothes.
C: DENISE
D: Fuck, it's freezing.
C: JERRY
D: Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
C: DENISE
D: Oh, yeah.
C: JERRY
D: Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
C: JERRY
D: It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
C: DENISE
D: So.
C: JERRY
D: Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
C: DENISE
D: Why?
C: JERRY
D: Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
E: scanning the book
C: DENISE
D: Yeah?
C: JERRY
D: These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
C: DENISE
D: So what?
C: JERRY
D: I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
C: DENISE
D: You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
C: JERRY
D: I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
E: to himself
C: MARY
D: God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
E: bursting in
C: JERRY
D: Huh?
C: MARY
D: That stupid hillbilly slut.
C: JERRY
D: Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
C: MARY
D: You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
C: JERRY
D: When?
C: DENISE
D: When you were outside with Bill.
C: MARY
D: She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, she said we looked queer.
C: JERRY
D: Aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing... I mean anything... chicks.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: An old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely overgrown. Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the main drive. Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house. The front of the house is covered with strange junk art. Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.
C: BABY
D: These are all my dolls. I use to like to chop their heads off.
N: Broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof. Glowing down from the upper windows are grinning JACK-O'- LANTERNS.
C: BABY
D: The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
C: BILL
D: OK.
N: Baby RUNS OFF around the side of the house. Bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate farm grounds. The rain continues to hammer down. From BILL'S POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE walking in the distance. The shape of a large dog follows behind him. Bill JUMPS, startled by the sound of the heavy front door opening.
C: BILL
D: Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
C: BABY
D: Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
C: BILL
D: Is your brother ready to go?
C: BABY
D: Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.

D: Yeah, come on.
N: Baby GRABS Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house. The heavy iron door slams shut.

C: MARY
D: How long has it been?
C: DENISE
D: I don't know... about half an hour.
N: A metal KLANG is faintly heard.
C: MARY
D: What was that?
C: DENISE
D: What? I didn't hear anything.
C: MARY
D: Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
N: Mary reaches over the front seat and turns off the radio.

C: DENISE
D: Shhhhhh, quiet.
E: whispering
C: MARY
D: I still don't.
C: DENISE
D: Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
N: Mary turns on the headlights. Denise lets out a blood-curdling SCREAM. Jerry bolts up.
C: JERRY
D: What... what!
N: Standing dead center in the road is the GIANT SHAPE of a MAN holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end.
C: MARY
D: Lock the doors... quick, quick.
N: Everybody scrambles to lock the doors.
C: DENISE
D: Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.
N: On closer inspection, Jerry notices the chain is attached to the back of a TOW TRUCK.
C: JERRY
D: Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
C: MARY
D: What!
C: DENISE
D: Jesus Christ.
C: MARY
D: I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
C: JERRY
D: OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
E: Scottish accent
C: MARY
D: Enough with the stupid voices.
N: The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck. A SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING.
T: DISSOLVE TO:

D: I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea.
C: RAYMOND MASSEY
D: What is?
C: MELVYN DOUGLAS
D: Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them.
C: GLORIA STUART
D: I'm sure it would be very amusing.
N: We pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa.
C: BILL
D: So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
C: BABY
D: No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
E: speaking from the next room
C: BILL
D: Um, yeah sure, I guess.
C: BABY
D: You sure do a lot of guessing.
N: Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him.
C: BILL
D: Thank you.
C: BABY
D: You're welcome.
N: Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous.
C: BILL
D: Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?

C: BABY
D: A dead one.
C: BILL

C: BABY
D: Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
C: BILL
D: What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
C: BABY
D: Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
C: BILL
D: That's not something to joke about.
C: BABY
D: OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.

C: BILL
D: Hey, great they're back.
C: BABY
D: Whoopie fucking doo.

D: Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
C: JERRY
D: Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
E: quietly to Bill as he passes
N: Mary is the last one out of the car. She says nothing as she walks to join the others on the porch. Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house.
C: BILL
D: Mary, I'm sorry but he left without me. Mary... come on, you don't think I'd leave you stranded out there.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

N: Baby sits silently watching TV.
C: DENISE
D: Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
C: MARY
D: Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
E: sarcastically
N: A VOICE from upstairs answers.
C: MOTHER
D: Ain't got one.
N: MOTHER comes into view from the darkness above. She is in her fifties, but looks younger. A sleazy white trash queen. She slowly descends the stairs.
C: DENISE
D: Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
C: MOTHER
D: No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
C: JERRY
D: Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
C: MOTHER
D: His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
C: JERRY
D: Oh, right.
C: MOTHER
D: What do they call you, sweety?
C: JERRY
D: Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
C: BILL
D: Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
C: DENISE
D: I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no, no fuss. Baby... go see what Rufus Jr. is doing with these nice folks' automobile.

S: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
N: Mother, Jerry, Denise and Mary are all seated on the sofa. Bill sits in an easy chair.
C: MOTHER
D: So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
C: JERRY
D: Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, really... ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
E: flirting puts her hand on Jerry's knee and winks
C: JERRY
D: I don't doubt that.
C: DENISE
D: No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house... ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
E: glances at Jerry
C: MOTHER
D: That's nice.
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
C: JERRY
D: And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
C: MOTHER
D: I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
C: JERRY
D: I was just kidding.
N: Bill and Mary snicker at Jerry's comments. Denise tries to keep a straight face.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
C: MARY
D: No, just a little too old.
C: MOTHER
D: Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
N: Baby returns from the garage.
C: BABY
D: Tiny's home.
C: MOTHER
D: What about R.J.?
C: BABY
D: Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
C: BILL
D: The yard, what's that?
C: MOTHER
D: It's an old auto junkyard out in Baldwin.
C: DENISE
D: How long is that gonna take?
C: MOTHER
D: He should be back in a couple hours.
C: MARY
D: A couple hours!
C: DENISE
D: Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
N: Mother and Baby laugh.
C: MOTHER
D: Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
E: laughing
C: DENISE
D: How's he get around out here?
C: BABY
D: He walks, duh.
C: MARY
D: Fucking great.
C: MOTHER
D: I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
C: MARY
D: Sorry.
C: MOTHER
D: Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
N: Under the circumstances they realize they have no choice. They grin and bear it.
C: DENISE
D: Thank you.
C: JERRY
D: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
E: imitates Elvis
C: MOTHER
D: You're a strange one, aren't ya honey. I think you and me are get on like... ...like something real good.
E: Mother touches Jerry's shoulder suggestively she thinks for a second
N: Camera moves over to the TV. THE END fades up on screen. Dr. Wolfenstein appears over the credits.
C: DR. WOLFENSTEIN
D: There well, who knew there was love to be found in The Old Dark House. Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic... are you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?
S: INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM
N: Bill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a large dining room table. A thick mountain of candles sits burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow. Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the table, spiders, bats and black cats. There is a hand-made PAPER MACHE MASK sitting on each plate.
C: MARY
D: I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
E: holding up the witch mask
C: BILL
D: Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
C: DENISE
D: Really, now is not the time to make waves.
C: JERRY
D: Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
C: DENISE
D: Shhhhhh.
N: Mother walks in holding a covered serving tray.
C: DENISE
D: You sure you don't need any help in there?
C: MOTHER
D: No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
N: She sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen. BOOM! The sound of the front door SLAMMING shut is heard, followed by the POUNDING of heavy footsteps. Mother's and Baby's shouting is heard.
C: BABY
D: Ma, Tiny's in.
E: O.S.
C: MOTHER
D: Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
E: O.S.
S: INT. HOUSE - BABY'S ROOM
N: Baby is standing in front of her closet staring at her clothes. The walls of her room are covered with B+W photos of movie stars.
C: BABY
D: Ma, I can't, I'm busy getting dressed.
E: whining
S: INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM
N: TINY ENTERS and removes his coat. Everyone is speechless. Tiny is over SEVEN FEET TALL and weighs THREE HUNDRED POUNDS. He is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched into it. A red knit ski mask covers his face. Black gloves cover his hands. Tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says nothing. Mother comes to fetch Tiny. She relays a message to him with strange hand gestures. Tiny gets up and leaves the room.
C: MOTHER
D: You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
C: DENISE
D: Oh.
C: MOTHER
D: Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
C: DENISE
D: What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
C: MOTHER
D: He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
C: BILL
D: Is that why he wears the mask?
C: MOTHER
D: Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around new people, but he'll warm up to ya... especially the ladies.
C: JERRY
D: Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
C: MOTHER
D: Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
C: JERRY
D: Didn't ya think, Mary?
N: Mary just smiles, then gives Jerry a dirty look.
C: MOTHER
D: Well, we'll see... the night is young and so are you... oh well, couple more minutes.
N: Mother returns to the kitchen.
C: DENISE
D: Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
E: elbows Jerry
C: MARY
D: Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
C: JERRY
D: Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
C: BILL
D: Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
C: JERRY
D: Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
C: BILL
D: Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
C: JERRY
D: Tasted pretty good.
E: shrugs
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body of GRAMPA. Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.
C: GRAMPA
D: God damn it, I can do it. I can do it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet.
N: Grampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out of the room.
C: GRAMPA
D: God damn, my dogs are barking.
N: As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that Grampa is in his late 80's. Grampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room. As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE OBJECT sitting on a shelf. A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973. The sound from the TV fades up in the background. BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.
C: BELA LUGOSI
D: Your hands, please. Your left hand shows your past...
E: V.O.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: TV SCREEN Bela is seen as a fortune teller holding a woman's hands. This is a scene from The Wolfman.
C: BELA LUGOSI
D: ...and your right hand shows your future.
N: CLOSE UP We see a tight shot of the woman's palm. A pentagram appears.
S: INT. DENISE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: We PULL BACK from the TV to find Donald Willis sitting in a old easy chair. The room is modest, but comfortable. He reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices the time, concerned look comes over his face. The phone rings. He quickly answers it.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Hello, Denise?
N: Disappointment. He mutes the TV.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Oh, yeah... no, Fred. I was hoping you were Denise, she's a little late. Yeah, yeah I'm sure the rain just slowed 'em down... yeah... uh-huh, yeah... no, no you can keep it 'til Tuesday... alright, talk to ya tomorrow, bye.
E: pausing
N: Unmutes the sound on the TV.
S: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The feast is on. Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise are gathered around the table.
C: MOTHER
D: OK, everyone, put on your masks. We can't very well eat with our everyday faces exposed.
N: Mother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates.
C: GRAMPA
D: Christ kid, put it on. She ain't letting any of us touch the grub 'til you're wearing the damn thing.
E: to Mary
N: Mary rolls her eyes and complies.
C: JERRY
D: I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
C: MOTHER
D: Firefly.
E: hesitates
C: JERRY
D: Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
C: BILL
D: Here we go.
N: Grampa shifts his eyes onto Mother.
C: MOTHER
D: Well, I'm not much for local gossip an this and that, but I've heard it mentioned in passing over the years but... I mean folks is queer and they say things, crazy things you know what I mean?
E: nervously
C: GRAMPA
D: It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ, Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's nuts alright... ...hey, I hear some genius up north got a hot line on the Easter Bunny for ya.
E: starts laughing
N: A voice from the shadows interrupts.
C: OTIS
D: I know all about what you want to know about.
E: slowly
N: A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner of the room. This is OTIS. He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO. He is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one head. The label reads WOLF.
C: MOTHER
D: Otis! I can't believe you decided to come down and join us... and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special night... all my babies together.
E: happy surprise
N: Otis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans forward onto the jar, resting his chin.
C: OTIS
D: Now, I don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr. Satan but...
C: BILL
D: From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum.
C: OTIS
D: That old bitch hog don't know shit. He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.
E: laughing
C: JERRY
D: But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right?
C: GRAMPA
D: What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?
E: mouth full of food
C: MOTHER
D: Grampa... watch the language.
C: OTIS
D: I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
C: JERRY
D: I really want to know.
C: GRAMPA
D: Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten him.
C: OTIS
D: Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in the fire if I told ya you'd see Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing, "Holy Miss Moly, I got a live one."
C: DENISE
D: Can we please change the subject?
N: The CLOCK on the wall strikes TEN.
C: GRAMPA
D: Dinner's over. Ladies and Germs... it's showtime.
E: shouting pushes his plate back and stands up
N: Grampa hobbles out of the room.
C: BILL
D: What's he so excited about?
C: DENISE
D: Yeah, showtime for what?
C: MOTHER
D: For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
C: JERRY
D: Oh, you mean on TV.
C: MOTHER
D: No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
C: JERRY
D: Great.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT
N: Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings them open. Standing inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for the occasion.
C: MOTHER
D: Please, come in... how many in your party... ...one, two, three and four... right this way.
E: she counts the heads
N: Mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange pumpkin.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT
N: We follow Mother inside. Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through the rotting wood rafters. Crates, barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES.
C: MOTHER
D: Please be seated.
N: Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row.
C: JERRY
D: This is way too fucked up for words.
E: whispering
C: MARY
D: I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
E: loud whisper
C: BILL
D: Just grin and bear it.
C: DENISE
D: That food... ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
E: holding stomach
N: Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats. Mary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy Legend GRAMPA and the World Famous BABY.
C: MARY
D: Check this out.
E: to Bill
C: BILL
D: Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
N: The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge music. A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. Mother Firefly stands behind the controls. She is smiling proudly. The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL: A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage. A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls. A microphone stands center stage.
C: BILL
D: I can't believe what I'm seeing.
E: quietly
C: JERRY
D: I know, this is fucking nuts.
C: MARY
D: This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
C: BILL
D: Just sit back and enjoy the show.
N: The sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not.
C: GRAMPA
D: Ladies and gentlemen, straight from his smash six week sold out run at Tiki-Ti Club... the Stardust lounge is proud to present Mr. Sexy himself... Grampa Hugo.
E: V.O.
N: Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to speak.
C: GRAMPA
D: Hey, let me tell ya a story... so I'm hanging out with my buddy Hal Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal let's go get some booze and chase the chickens... fucking Hal says no, no the old battle axe at home will break my balls... I gotta get my ass home.
N: The kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh.
C: GRAMPA
D: So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the secret. Go home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife's pussy... I mean jam your face right in the bush.
N: Jerry starts to giggle.
C: DENISE
D: What are you laughing at?
E: quietly
C: JERRY
D: I don't know, I think he's funny.
C: DENISE
D: This isn't funny, it's twisted.
C: GRAMPA
D: So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping and licking away at her pussy, she's screaming and howling... totally passes out from the experience.
C: MARY
D: Dear God, let this end.
C: GRAMPA
D: Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good, so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave... ...suddenly he lets out a horrible scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
E: pauses
N: The recorded crowd chuckles.
C: GRAMPA
D: Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet down, you'll wake Grandma!"
N: The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry. Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy.
C: GRAMPA
D: Thank you, you're too kind, too kind... stay in your seats, coming up next we got something special for you men out there.
N: The curtains close and the stage goes dark.
C: DENISE
D: Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
C: BILL
D: Man, it's already ten thirty.
E: looking at his watch
C: MARY
D: I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
C: JERRY
D: Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
C: BILL
D: Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
C: DENISE
D: I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
C: MARY
D: I fucking hope so.
N: The stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music begin. Baby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears to be somewhat intoxicated. The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song.
C: DENISE
D: You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
C: JERRY
D: Shhhhhh.
C: MARY
D: How much is a person supposed to stand?
C: BILL
D: Quiet.
E: motioning for Mary to keep her voice down
C: MARY
D: Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
E: sarcastically
N: Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience members. Baby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face. Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably. Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary. Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is FURIOUS. Baby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk. Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on Bill. Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap. Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill. Baby crashes onto the floor.
C: MARY
D: Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore!
E: Mary spits at Baby
C: BABY
D: You shouldn't a done that.
C: MARY
D: Why? You gonna do something about it?
C: BABY
D: Yeah, I'll do something.
E: standing up
N: Baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back.
C: BABY
D: I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
C: MOTHER
D: Baby! Stop!
N: Mrs. Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight and intercedes.
C: BABY
D: Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
C: MOTHER
D: No, I told you...
N: SCREECH! The garage door slides open. Rufus has returned.
C: RUFUS JR.
D: Car's done.
E: interrupting
C: DENISE
D: Thank God.
C: MOTHER
D: I suggest you kids leave now.
C: MARY
D: Don't worry, I'm gone.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Bill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car.
C: BILL
D: Don't look back, just get in the car.
C: DENISE
D: Lock the fucking doors.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway towards the road. The heavy rain makes visibility difficult.
C: BILL
D: Almost there.
E: straining to see through the darkness
C: JERRY
D: Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
C: MARY
D: Of course she was gonna cut me, she's a fucking nut... I knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up.
E: leaning her forehead on the window closes her eyes and takes a breath
N: SLAM! Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window. Mary jumps back in terror.
C: BABY
D: You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna die like a dog!
E: screaming
N: Baby disappears into the darkness.
C: MARY
D: Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!
N: Bill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut with a huge padlock. LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows. FLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer down from above.
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
N: Bill opens the car door, starts to get out.
C: MARY
D: What are you doing!
E: hysterical
C: BILL
D: I gotta open the gate.
C: MARY
D: Drive through it!
C: BILL
D: It won't work.
C: JERRY
D: Holy fuck, hurry up.
N: Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates. SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops to his knees.
C: MARY
D: Bill! Help him!
N: Jerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL PIPE. Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the car's windows.
S: EXT. CAR - NIGHT
N: From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten. The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle. The scarecrows continue to pound on the car. As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.
T: FADE TO:
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC
N: From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning sunrise. All is still. The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind it.
S: EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE
N: Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is 7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off. A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep groan. A light turns on.
S: INT. WILLIS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
N: Don Willis wakes up, having fallen asleep in his easy chair. He sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes. He runs a hand across his head, smoothing out his thinning grey hair. He picks up a phone next to his bed, dials a number, waits.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Hi. Lieutenant Broekman please... Donald Willis.
N: He holds.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Hey, Phil... Yeah, I'm alright... but I need you to check on something for me.
E: listens
N: Willis stands, walks to the window, opens the shades, morning sun fills the room. shelf by the window is cluttered with framed photographs. B+W memories of Denise at the beach, RUDY the dog. High school graduations and Donald Willis in uniform with the other members of 56 Precinct. Donald is a FORMER POLICE OFFICER.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: I'm a little worried about Denise. She called me last night from the road, out by Ruggsville at some joint called Spaulding's or something like that, said she'd be here about eleven... but she never showed up.
N: Paces.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Yeah, if you could run a check on up that way and see about any accidents or road closing or anything, I'd really appreciate it... ...yeah, yeah, I know... I'm sure nothing happened but, you know me I like to worry... thanks... bye.
E: listening
N: Hangs up the phone.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY
N: Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. Sunlight peers through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves as wallpaper surrounding the window. Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG EYED KITTEN. She stares at it and smiles. A look of horror begins to appear on her face. She begins to scream uncontrollably.
C: OTIS
D: Shut your fucking mouth!
E: off screen
N: She is hysterical.
C: OTIS
D: I said shut your mouth!
N: ZOOM BACK to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair, facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. This is Otis's art studio. Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint brush and calmly walks over to Mary. He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his hand and leans his nose against hers.
C: OTIS
D: Listen, you Malibu Barbie middle class piece of shit. I'm trying to work, you got me, work... you ever work?
E: slow and sinister
N: Mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes.
C: OTIS
D: Yeah, I'll bet you did. Scooping ice cream to your shitheel friends on summer break... well, I ain't talking about white socks with Mickey Mouse on one side and Donald Duck on the other... shit, you ain't reading no funny books, mamma.
N: Otis raises his paint covered hand.
C: OTIS
D: This is blood and guts, Suzy Q. Our bodies come and go, but this blood is forever... ...let me read you something, listen and learn... you listening?
E: pulls a small book from his breast pocket
N: Otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the face with the book. She nods again. He lowers the book.
C: OTIS
D: And the angels, all pallid and wan, Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy "Man" And its hero the Conqueror Worm... ...you get that? Art is eternal, you get me, mamma?
E: gesturing dramatically pauses
N: Mary stares dumbfounded.
C: OTIS
D: Now, I'm gonna remove my hand... you make a sound and I swear I'll slit you open and make you eat your own fucking intestines... you get me?

C: MARY
D: Where is he?
E: softly
C: OTIS
D: Let's go see.
N: Otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the room towards a curtained off area. Whoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING.
C: MARY
D: Bill? No, no, no! What have you done? Bill!
E: behind curtain
S: INT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY
N: Ugliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade fish tail. He is lying on his ride side posing. Bill's face is frozen in a death scream.
C: OTIS
D: Behold... The Fish-Boy!
C: MARY
D: This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.

D: Fuck you, you fucking freak!

C: MARY
D: What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.
E: squirming
C: OTIS
D: You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
N: Otis draws back the knife.
C: MARY
D: Noooooooooooo!

N: Otis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera. CLOSE UP - CLOWN FACE Ravelli's clown head bobs back and forth. PULL BACK TO: Ravelli, wearing his clown head, stands by the road side waving to passing cars.
S: EXT. SPAULDING'S - DAY
N: A police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car. Following close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall athletic.

D: Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
E: pauses, looks around, pulls up his belt
C: NAISH
D: Right.
N: They walk to the door.
S: INT. SPAULDING'S - DAY
N: The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit. Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter. No one is around. A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once, waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response.
C: NAISH
D: Get a load of all this crap... this is one sick place.
E: looking around the room
N: Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop. Spaulding shouts from the backroom.
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when I get out there... 'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

S: INT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY
N: The store is decorated for Halloween. Off to one side is a curtained room. A sign reads "XXX 8mm loops", sex noises can be heard inside. Baby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the CASHIER, a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases. The counter is loaded with bottles.

S: EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUOR - MIDDAY
N: Baby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette.
S: EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY
N: Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police cruiser arrives on the scene. Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser.

C: HUSTON
D: You find something, Georgie?
C: WYDELL
D: Yep, I found something.
E: disgusted
N: We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy laying in the trunk. Her arms and legs are hog tied. She is dead. The word TRICK is carved into her side.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - TINY'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Water drips down from the leaking pipes above. Scavenging rats scurry across the concrete floor. In a far corner a single light burns, a child's Humpty Dumpty lamp, illuminating -- Denise is strapped to an old wooden bed. She has been stripped of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little girl's dress. Her hair is tied in pigtails. She is cold and shivering. BOOM. The basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down the creaking stairs. It is Tiny. Tiny is wearing an orange T-shirt that reads, "This is my Halloween costume". For the first time we see the skin on his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars. He is holding a small tray. On the tray is a box of cereal, milk, a bowl and a spoon. Tiny goes over to Denise, sets down the tray, and proudly displays his T-shirt.
C: DENISE
D: Please... Tiny, please. Let me go... help me.
E: hoarse and dry
N: Tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at Denise like a confused dog.
C: DENISE
D: Please, God please.
E: crying
N: Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon. Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby. Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room. He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin female bodies. Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage. One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do not. They are dead. Tiny turns off the overhead light.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Wydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking lot.
C: NAISH
D: You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
C: WYDELL
D: Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
E: scanning the parking lot
C: NAISH
D: Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
C: WYDELL
D: Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
C: NAISH
D: I guess not.
C: WYDELL
D: That must be him.
S: EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
N: A rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road. A filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars. Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards. A Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup. A police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the car.
C: WYDELL
D: Mr. Willis?
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Yes, sir.
C: WYDELL
D: I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
N: Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands.

D: George Willis... ...any leads?
E: to Wydell
C: WYDELL
D: Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: That's it?
C: WYDELL
D: Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Dr. Satan?
C: NAISH
D: Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
C: WYDELL
D: Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: What about the body you found?
C: WYDELL
D: Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
E: slightly surprised
C: NAISH
D: Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Fit the profile?
C: NAISH
D: No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
C: WYDELL
D: Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Christ, you know it's crazy... I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
E: wipes his brow gets choked up
C: NAISH
D: Don't worry, we'll find her.
C: WYDELL
D: Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
N: Willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into the trash and opens the back door of the police car. He gets inside. Wydell and Naish climb in. The car drives off.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
N: THUMP! CLOSE UP on a bloody, bandaged face. THUMP! As we pull back to see Jerry, completely bandaged like a mummy, strapped to a wall. His arms and legs are spread. THUMP! Knives stick in the wall next to the body.
C: GRAMPA
D: God damn bitch, what the fuck are you waiting for... Charles Nelson Reilly don't know shit...
E: off screen
N: We pull back further to see Otis pacing wildly back and forth in front of his TV, watching MATCH GAME. Grampa sits eating a TV dinner.
C: OTIS
D: Watch that bitch, she's thinking about that Klugman bangin' Brett Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard Dawson.
E: gesturing at the TV with a knife
N: Otis throws the large hunting knife at the wall next to Jerry.
C: OTIS
D: He's the fucking slick jack Match Game man, mamma.
C: GRAMPA
D: Where do they find these people?
S: INT. POLICE CRUISER - LATE AFTERNOON
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
C: NAISH
D: No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
C: WYDELL
D: I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: I pray to God there is.
C: NAISH
D: Turn up this road.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Where we headed?
C: WYDELL
D: I seem to remember another farm set way back off the road where the car was found. I'm not sure if anyone lives there anymore, but it's worth a look.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse. It moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt. The doors swing open and Wydell, Naish and Willis get out.
C: WYDELL
D: I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
C: NAISH
D: Right... ...come on.
E: to Willis
N: Naish and Willis head off around the back of the house.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the surrounding counters. A large cat walks across piles of food left to rot on a table. Boxes of trash and old newspapers are stacked to the ceiling. Music from a crackling radio is heard. Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove. A LOUD knocking interrupts her cooking. She sets down her spoon and walks to the front door. Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a small side window. She sees Wydell and runs from the kitchen.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Wydell walks up the front steps.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Mother runs toward a door at the end of the hall. She swings open the door.

C: OTIS
D: What! God damn, how many?
C: GRAMPA
D: What? How many?

C: OTIS
D: Don't worry about it.
N: Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver.
C: MOTHER
D: I don't know. I only saw one.
C: OTIS
D: I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs... ...here, take this.
E: handing the gun to Mother
C: MOTHER
D: What should I do?
E: takes the gun
C: OTIS
D: Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
N: Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage.
C: NAISH
D: Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Shhhh... you hear that?
N: The soft sound of moaning can be heard.
C: NAISH
D: Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Over here, inside the smokehouse.
N: Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The thick door is chained shut.
C: NAISH
D: Anybody in there?
E: knocking on door
N: The moaning gets louder.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: We gotta break it open.
C: NAISH
D: I ain't got a warrant.
N: Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Tell it to my daughter.
C: NAISH
D: Shit... fuck procedure.
E: grabbing hold to help
N: Together they struggle to open the door.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
N: Mother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind her back, tucked in her apron strings.
C: MOTHER
D: Well hello, officer.
E: trying to be sexy
C: WYDELL
D: Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
E: holding up his badge
C: MOTHER
D: Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?

D: I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
E: holds up picture
C: MOTHER
D: Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
N: She begins to close the door. Wydell stops her.
C: WYDELL
D: Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
C: MOTHER
D: I um... no, I don't think so...
C: WYDELL

C: MOTHER
D: Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
N: She closes the door.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
N: Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse. Hanging upside down inside is Mary. She hangs from ropes strapped to the ceiling. Large hunks of meat hang around her in the cramped room.
C: NAISH
D: Jesus Christ.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Call Wydell.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
N: Wydell and Mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table. Pictures of Denise and her companions are spread on the table. Wydell takes notes as Mother talks.
C: WYDELL
D: Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
C: MOTHER
D: No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?

N: Suddenly, Naish's voice comes over Wydell's walkie-talkie.
C: NAISH
D: Wydell.
C: WYDELL
D: Excuse me for a second.
N: Pulls walkie-talkie from his belt to respond.
C: WYDELL
D: Over.
C: NAISH
D: We found one.
N: Click. Mother points the gun at Wydell's head and fires. He falls dead to the floor.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME
N: Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie.
C: NAISH
D: Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over!
E: into walkie-talkie
N: No response.
C: NAISH
D: Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
C: MR. WILLIS
D: Right.
N: Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before he is hit in the back by a bullet. He stumbles and falls to his knees. He kneels silent, stunned. We hold on his face and watch as his life passes before him. A quick MONTAGE, we see the following images flash by: A. A father and daughter together in happier times. B. A child's birthday party. C. A baby crying. D. Willis and his deceased wife. Otis fires another shot. Willis falls forward into the mud, dead. Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls out from behind him.
C: OTIS
D: Hands up, bitch!
N: Naish raises his hands.
C: OTIS
D: Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie.
N: Naish turns around.
C: OTIS
D: Interlock your fingers behind your head... ...do it!
E: Naish hesitates
N: Naish obeys.
C: OTIS
D: Kneel.
N: Naish kneels down. From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side. The scene fades to blood red.
S: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes, a heavy rain falls. Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises from the chimney. It is Halloween night.
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: CLOSE-UP TV Dr. Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer.
C: DR. WOLFENSTEIN
D: It is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour. Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work... so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic... ...The House of Frankenstein.
E: lightning crashes
N: The movie begins and we move off the TV to see: Hundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor. Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long chain connects the object up into the rafters. This is the Halloween party from Hell. An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an unmarked bottle.
C: GRAMPA
D: Get those motherfucker... those high water bitches and rocketship daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em.
E: slurred drunken yelling at the screen
N: CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape. A drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE. Mother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs.
C: RUFUS JR.
D: Show me, show me, show me, show me!
E: shouting through megaphone
N: Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper, spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual. As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are gagged. Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing moonshine in their faces.
C: BABY
D: Drink up, it's party time.
C: MOTHER
D: Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
E: looking around
C: BABY
D: Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
N: Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around and around.
C: RUFUS JR.
D: Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!
C: MOTHER
D: Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come down with all this hoop-dee-doo bouncing off the walls. Now, calm down.
C: GRAMPA
D: I shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning... how he got in my pajamas I'll never know.
C: BABY
D: Grampa, shhhhhhhh.
C: GRAMPA
D: Then we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge 'em.
C: MOTHER
D: Let him finish.
E: gesturing at Grampa
C: GRAMPA
D: Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.
N: The room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs. A robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he begins to descend. Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the last step Rufus hands him the megaphone. Denise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn rotate past the scene unfolding.
C: OTIS
D: I'm the one who brings the Christmas candy... now tell me ...Who's your Daddy?
E: through the megaphone pauses and raises his arms
N: Otis walks closer to the rotating captives.
C: OTIS
D: I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
E: waits
C: MOTHER
D: Who's your Daddy!
C: OTIS
D: Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
C: BABY
D: Who's your Daddy!
C: MOTHER
D: Who's your Daddy!
N: Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly before Denise. He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN sewn together from pieces of Denise's father. Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely able to comprehend the madness around her. Otis moves in close and licks her across the face.
C: OTIS
D: I'm the one who loves you when you're fucking dead!
N: Everyone chants "Who's your Daddy?"
C: OTIS
D: Now, I say my little darlings... maybe prancing around where you don't belong ain't such a winner of an idea...
E: imitating Willis rotates the chain to Mary slaps Mary across the face
N: Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry.
C: OTIS
D: And you, the great rusher of fools, what were you after... Huh, speak to me... Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan... everybody got to know about Dr. Satan, Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest for fuck sake, he's already got one foot in the grave and the other's tap dancing around the edge... ...well, I can see the disappointment on your sad little puppy face... so I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna let you meet the old bastard.
E: slaps Jerry slaps him again gets nose to nose with Jerry
C: GRAMPA
D: That's a horse's ass alright, I told you.
N: Jerry's eyes widen in fear.
C: OTIS
D: Baby, roll that old love machine over here, so this boy can meet his hero.
N: Baby rolls Grampa over to Jerry.
C: OTIS
D: You see it's all true, the boogieman is real and you found him... ...why so sad? Isn't this what you begged for? There he is, the living legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan. Now, don't get shy on me... ask your hero some questions, don't blow this last in a lifetime opportunity.
E: lifts his skin mask Jerry stares in shock
C: GRAMPA
D: Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the air, the earth... the universe.
N: Mother moves in close to Jerry.
C: MOTHER
D: Look at the way he lights up... Grampa just loves meeting his fans.
N: Otis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice.
C: OTIS
D: Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I really think you're the coolest... you're tops on the playground, cooler than the Fonzie.
N: Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine.
C: BABY
D: Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a question.
N: Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated.
C: BABY
D: I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do you like to kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty?
E: squeezing Mary's face, hard
C: GRAMPA
D: What the fuck are you saying? Who the hell is talking to me?
N: Tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum. KLANG - KLANG - KLANG. Rufus joins in, clapping his hands.
C: MOTHER
D: Come on, my babies are getting restless.
C: RUFUS JR.
D: Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in the pit.
N: Mother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus.
C: OTIS
D: Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's time they get what they came here for.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
N: The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night. Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary. Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam. The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.
C: OTIS
D: Hold this. Point it over here.
E: handing Baby the lantern
N: Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure. Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, attached to the hook is a chain. Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank. Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain. Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. He flips open the lid.
C: OTIS
D: Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.
N: Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck.
C: BABY
D: Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
C: MOTHER
D: Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
T: Rufus cuts loose the gag.
C: JERRY
D: Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
C: BABY
D: Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
E: imitating Jerry
C: OTIS
D: Bitch, shut your mouth and get your shit in the box.
C: JERRY
D: Let us go, please... let the girls go.
C: BABY
D: Let us go, please... let the girls go.
E: imitating Jerry
N: Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry.
C: OTIS
D: Get in... now!
C: MOTHER
D: Wait, I want to say good-bye.
N: Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss.
C: MOTHER
D: Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
C: JERRY
D: Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
C: MOTHER
D: Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
C: BABY
D: We won't tell anybody.
N: Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards the coffin.
C: OTIS
D: Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot... alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking night.
C: JERRY
D: Please, please this is insane. You can't do this.
N: Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin.
C: OTIS
D: It is and I can... next.
N: Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts to run.
C: OTIS
D: Where's she think she's a gonna get to? She's gonna run all the way home.
E: laughs and raises his pistol
C: BABY
D: No! Let me get her... ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun... can I get her?
E: turns to Mother
C: MOTHER
D: That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
C: OTIS
D: Well, go get her.
E: rolls his eyes
N: Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after Mary. Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag from her mouth and gasps for air.
C: BABY
D: There once was a woman who lived with her daughter in a cabbage garden.
E: O.S.
N: Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden crosses. She is in a homemade cemetery.
C: BABY
D: ...along came a rabbit and ate up all the cabbages. The woman said...
E: O.S.
N: Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing.
C: BABY
D: ..."Go into the garden and drive out the rabbit"...
E: O.S.
N: THUD! Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward. Baby JUMPS on top of her and sits on her back. Baby is holding a large hunting knife.
C: BABY
D: "Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...
N: Mary screams in pain, as Baby PLUNGES the knife into her. Baby STABS Mary again and again and again. Mary lets out a long gurgling scream, then goes silent.
C: BABY
D: ..."Come maiden," said the rabbit... ...sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit hutch.
E: leans down
N: Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.
S: EXT. PIT - NIGHT
N: Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we see them crushed together. Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is inside Otis slams the door shut. Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern and a small tape recorder playing music.
S: INT. PIT - NIGHT
N: Enter Hell. The dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy wet filth of the rotted wood walls. The stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the thin air. Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in thick maggot infested sludge. Bits of animal and human skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along the walls.
S: INT. COFFIN - NIGHT
N: Through the dim light, we see the tightly packed forms of Jerry and Denise.
C: DENISE
D: We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
E: hysterical
C: JERRY
D: Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
C: DENISE
D: I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
E: crying
C: JERRY
D: I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
N: Boom! A LOUD THUMP is heard against the side of the coffin.
C: JERRY
D: That was good babe, just keep doing that.
N: BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
C: DENISE
D: That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
C: JERRY
D: Someone is out there... ...help, we're in here!
E: shouting
C: DENISE
D: Help, help us.
N: Suddenly, an arm breaks through the side of the coffin. Another smashes through the top of the lid. The coffin begins to violently shake. Denise screams. Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction. He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the darkness.
C: DENISE
D: Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
S: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
N: The spastic light of TV static strobes across the sleeping face of Grampa. Beside him, Mother sleeps peacefully.
S: EXT. BARN - NIGHT
N: The rain has stopped. Tiny opens the doors to the barn. He goes inside. He exits a few moments later, dragging a huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.
S: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
N: Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the many automobiles beneath. Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and starts the engine. He drives off.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
N: Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He turns on the overhead flashing lights.
S: EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT
N: The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields.
S: INT. PIT - NIGHT
N: Denise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the coffin's remains are scattered around her.
C: DENISE
D: Jerry please answer me.
N: A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of the pit.
C: DENISE
D: Jerry... ...is that you?
E: moving slowly forward
N: Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. She turns the corner to see: TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry. The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, they stare at Denise, then return to their prey. Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness. They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
N: Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter. Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with rope.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
N: Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as she dances.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
N: Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to laugh. The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The car drives off.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
N: Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll. Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the stake.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
N: Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe, walks solemnly through the tall grass.
S: INT. PIT - NIGHT
N: Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds. A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer, CLAWING at her face. Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces and starts to run.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
N: Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin. Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head. Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
N: The police car drives wildly through the fields.
S: INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
N: Baby motions to Rufus to steer the car towards the fire.
S: INT. PIT - NIGHT
N: A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS move silently towards her, blocking her only exit. The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a ladder. The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling above her, trying to break free. Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal: STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another piece. With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up through the opening.
S: EXT. PIT - NIGHT
N: Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She crawls free of the hole, gasping for air. She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull her back into the hole. Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
N: Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake. Rufus and Baby stand on the hood. Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm. Tiny raises the torch. Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny. Tiny throws the torch onto the stake. The stake ignites into a huge FIREBALL.
S: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
N: Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run. The flaming object burns in the distance behind her. Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.
S: EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
N: Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before him.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight. In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise stands in the middle of the road. The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck. Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to stop. The truck comes to a halt. She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.
S: INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding. Denise is shaking from shock.
C: DENISE
D: Go, go! Drive... drive!
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Hold on, girly, what's the problem?
C: DENISE
D: Murdering... blood and Jerry... ...monsters... I... I... I got away...
E: becoming hysterical starts to cry uncontrollably
C: CAPT. SPAULDING
D: Well, I don't see what the fuck you're getting at, but I got some friends that live just up this road.
N: Starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the farmhouse.
C: DENISE
D: No! No, that's it... that house is... ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!
E: screaming tries to open the truck door
N: Boom! The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides open. Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back of the truck. SLAM! The metal door shuts.
S: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
N: The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows, grinning their evil grin. THE END
