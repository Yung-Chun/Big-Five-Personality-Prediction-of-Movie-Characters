M: Darkness.
N: The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under the water part of a young mans face. His eyes are closed. The light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S A W. The title fades away. The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. The camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical.
C: ADAM
D: Help! Someone help me! Is someone there? Hey! Shit, Im probably dead.
E: He stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. He looks out into the darkness and calls out. He turns back to the corner to which he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice
N: Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs to LAWRENCE.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Youre not dead.
N: Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.
C: ADAM
D: Whos that? Whos that?!
C: LAWRENCE
D: Theres no point in yelling, I already tried it.
E: his voice strangely a bit on the calm side, and almost irritated with Adams reaction to the situation. This shall be his tone for many scenes to come.
C: ADAM
D: Turn on the lights!
C: LAWRENCE
D: Would if I could.
C: ADAM
D: What the fuck is going on? Where am I?
E: He turns into his corner, touching the wall.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I dont know yet.
C: ADAM
D: What is that smell?
E: smelling something; in disgust
C: LAWRENCE
D: Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something.
N: With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam. As they come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men are barefoot. Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360° angle above and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him. The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.
C: ADAM
D: Holy shit!
N: He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.
C: ADAM
D: HELP!!! HELP!!! Help!
E: screaming He falls back onto his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can.
N: Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.
C: LAWRENCE
D: No one can hear you.
N: Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical.
C: ADAM
D: What the fuck is this?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Calm down, just calm down. Are you hurt?
E: He knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.
N: Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.
C: ADAM
D: I dont know...yeah!
N: Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against it for support.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Whats your name?
E: calmly
C: ADAM
D: My name is Very Fucking Confused! Whats your name? Whats going on here?
E: sarcastic demanding
C: LAWRENCE
D: My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. I just woke up here, just like you.
E: internal eye roll; hes getting more and more aggravated with Adams behaviour He reaches up, wipes his face with his sleeve
N: Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic. He winces at the metal biting into his skin.
C: ADAM
D: Ah!
E: in pain
N: Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Recognize him?
N: Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head.
C: ADAM
D: No.
E: sharply
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well, do you have any idea how you got here?
E: trying to get SOMETHING out of this kid
C: ADAM
D: No.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Whats the last thing you remember?
C: ADAM
D: Nothing. I went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. So what about you, huh?
E: he sits back onto the floor, stops pulling at his chains for a moment. He raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well theres...theres not much to tell, really. I was on my way home from work and uh, I dont remember anything else.
E: He shrugs slightly, shaking his head. Across the room, Adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.
N: Adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer.
C: ADAM
D: First dead body Ive ever seen. Look different in real life. They dont move.
N: Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.
C: LAWRENCE
D: From the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either.
N: Suddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. He studies himself then glances to Lawrence.
C: ADAM
D: Can you see any scars?
C: LAWRENCE
D: What?
E: looking at him strangely
C: ADAM
D: Huh? This is what they do man, They kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.
E: he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars. A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, but Adam states it with conviction.
C: LAWRENCE
D: No one has taken your kidneys.
E: a scoffing tone in his voice
C: ADAM
D: How can you tell from way over there?
E: disbelief
C: LAWRENCE
D: Because youd either be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. Trust me.
E: matter of fact
C: ADAM
D: What are you, a surgeon?
E: He lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to prod at the chain around the pipe again.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah. So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?
E: He sighs. Hes getting tired of Adam already. He speaks sharply.
N: Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again calm.
C: ADAM
D: Adam.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well Adam, what we need to do is start thinking about why were here. Whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now. But they didnt. They must want something from us. Question is what. That clock.
E: getting to his feet, his voice a bit calmer he leans with one hand outstretched against the pipe to his right. Adam watches him, scared but calm He looks up and around the room He sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. We see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. It reads currently at 10:22.
C: ADAM
D: What about it?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Its brand new.
E: squints, studying it
C: ADAM
D: So?
E: not getting what hes implying
C: LAWRENCE
D: So, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door.
E: sighs; its quite simple, why cant Adam see it? Adam looks a bit confused still, mulls over that information. Lawrence thinks for a moment.
N: Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he can. In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what it is. Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what Adam has in his hand.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What is that? Excuse me.
E: Adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. Lawrences voice grows impatient.
C: ADAM
D: Its a tape.
E: glances up briefly at Lawrence, then back down at the tape. His voice sounds slightly surprised.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Where did you find it?
C: ADAM
D: It was in my pocket.
N: Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with LAWRENCE written across it in the same black lettering as Adams.
C: ADAM
D: It says Play me.
E: regarding his tape
N: Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the palm of his hand. First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams. It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying it, not sure what its there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try to unlock his chains with the key. It doesnt seem to be working.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on, come on, come on....
E: frustrated, mumbling to himself and to the key
C: ADAM
D: Throw it over here.
E: seeing that it doesnt seem to be working on Lawrences lock
N: Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds up the key and throws it. Adam misses the key at first as it hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.
C: ADAM
D: Fuck.
E: He leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work. He tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. It isnt working there either.
C: LAWRENCE
D: No?
E: watching him
N: Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Use your shirt.
C: ADAM
D: What?
E: gets back up to his knees
C: LAWRENCE
D: Your shirt.
N: Adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. It misses. He tries a second time; same result.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on...
N: Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.
C: ADAM
D: It wont work.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well, look around, there must be something else you can use.
E: trying to get him to not give up yet
C: ADAM
D: Theres nothing.
E: stands, ready to give up, skeptical
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well there must be something!
E: insistent
N: Adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels down, holding out the shirt, aiming.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on, you can do it.
N: Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. He misses.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on, come on, again.
N: He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected.
C: JIGSAW
D: Rise and shine, Adam. Youre probably wondering where you are. Ill tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it?
E: on tape end
N: Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.
C: ADAM
D: I dont get it.
E: He presses the stop button on the tape.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Throw me the player.
E: eagerly, gestures.
C: ADAM
D: No, you throw me your tape.
E: pauses, thinks
C: LAWRENCE
D: Look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me.
E: a heavy sigh. He looks at Adam as a slow-minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in, and speaks to him as such.
C: ADAM
D: Im not going to risk breaking it! You throw me your tape!
E: picks up on the tone, speaks defensively
N: Lawrence pauses, looking at Adam as though hed like to smack him, then holds up and tosses the tape. It hits the floor behind Adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. Its the same chilling voice as on Adams tape. As the tape plays, Adam stares at Lawrence, and Lawrence at the tape recorder.
C: JIGSAW
D: Dr. Gordon, this is your wake up call. Every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. You have until six on the clock to do it. There sa man in the room with you. When theres that much poison in your blood , the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. There are ways to win this hidden all around you. Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin.
E: on tape Adam glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, then back up at Lawrence another view of the body from Lawrences POV Jigsaw coughs end
N: The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. Lawrence stands up.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Give me that. Now.
E: firmly Adam tosses him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his spot on the floor.
C: JIGSAW
D: ...then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot.
E: on tape
C: ADAM
D: Any idea who that is?
E: thinking, trying to figure this out
C: JIGSAW
D: Let the game begin.
E: on tape
C: ADAM
D: He knows us.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Wait a minute.
E: rewinds more
C: ADAM
D: What do you think? Probably a joke, right?
E: false hope
C: LAWRENCE
D: Shh, shh!
E: presses play
C: JIGSAW
D: Let the game begin.
E: on tape
C: LAWRENCE
D: Listen...
E: softly
C: JIGSAW
D: ...Follow your heart.
E: on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after a brief silence
N: Lawrence stops the tape.
C: ADAM
D: What the hell does Follow your heart mean?
N: Lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to Adam and points.
C: LAWRENCE
D: There! Right next to you, on the toilet.
N: Adam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, not really sure what hes looking for.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Come on, come on.
E: impatient, gesturing
N: Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of Youve got to be kidding me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.
C: ADAM
D: Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. He coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Anything?
E: expectantly
C: ADAM
D: No solids.
E: disgusted
C: LAWRENCE
D: Take off the lid. Come on!
E: He points to the lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no patience.
N: Adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence to see, turns to him.
C: ADAM
D: I really wish I had checked in there first.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Huh. What is it?
E: he smiles slightly
N: Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Hey! Mind passing me the other one?
E: Adam turns and looks. Lawrence speaks in an irritated voice
N: Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrences left. Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. Suddenly, Adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.
C: ADAM
D: Fuck! Fuck!
E: enraged He reacts violently, hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. A small piece of the mirror breaks off and flies to the floor.
N: Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his head slightly.
C: LAWRENCE
D: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. I think I may know whos done this to us.
E: everything is becoming more clear now Adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.
C: ADAM
D: What did you say?
E: he stands up; is Lawrence hiding something from him?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Its not someone I know personally. Its...just someone I know of.
C: ADAM
D: Jesus Christ! Tell me, who is it?!
E: getting slightly frantic again
N: The camera closes up on Lawrences face. To the right of it, the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. As Lawrence speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs.
C: LAWRENCE
D: The last I heard...the police still hadnt caught him.
N: We now see the three figures descending through a trap door down a flight of stairs. The lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time. The trio enters a small, cell like room with a low ceiling. They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY. Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early fifties. Sing is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties, and Kerry is a Caucasian woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair that is tied back in a ponytail. All are well dressed, Sing and Tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. They are the detectives working on this case. As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. We cannot see it yet.
C: LAWRENCE
D: And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect.
E: VO
N: Tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, and comes up alongside Sing, looking at the same thing.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ill start from the beginning.
E: VO
C: KERRY
D: This ones not fresh anymore. At least three weeks out. Victims a 46-year old male. Died of massive blood loss. Mostly through the femoral artery. He started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did. Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor. We also found this.
E: Detective Tapp squints as he peers in and studies the body Quick flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup of behind the mans head and upper back. There are deep cuts all over. The camera cuts upwards to the detectives. The camera pans around to Detective Tapp, who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside, shining his flashlight in. Another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side; we can see the razor wire digging in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts. She holds up an evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder, just like the one Adam and Lawrence found in their cell. She presses the play button, and Tapp and Sing listen. Its the same chilling voice from Adam and Lawrences tapes.
C: JIGSAW
D: Hello Paul. You are a perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention? Tonight, youll show me. The irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. But if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. Find the path through the razor wire to the door. But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul?
E: on tape Flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. The shots go back and forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. His screams sound distant under Jigsaws voice. end
C: KERRY
D: The door was on a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.
E: stopping the tape
N: Cut back to Detective Tapp, who notices something and shines his light on it. We see a strange wound on Pauls body, a piece of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.
C: TAPP
D: Jigsaw piece. I think were gonna be here for a while, Sing.
E: Sing looks in as well, see it. There is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound. Tapp sighs. Sing looks to him. We get another quick crime scene shot of Paul.
C: LAWRENCE
D: The newspapers started calling him the Jigsaw Killer.
E: VO
N: Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom. For his next two spoken lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives in the razor wire room.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. He never killed anyone.
N: Sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines Pauls body a bit. A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown. More gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
C: LAWRENCE
D: He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.
E: VO
N: Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaws voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the flashback shots.
C: JIGSAW
D: Hello Mark. If youre so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? Lets put your so-called illness to the test. Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the safe. The combination to the safe is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step . And by the way, thats a flammable substance smeared on your body , so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you...
E: VO, on tape there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car. Flashback image of Mark waking up. He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared. Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, as with Paul. quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls Marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere
C: MARK
D: Help!!!!!
E: huddled over the safe; screams, but it is still distant sounding
C: JIGSAW
D: ....or all the people youve burned with your act just might have their revenge.
E: VO ctd Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe
N: We see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up crime scene photo of Marks charred face. The shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding the tape recorder.
C: KERRY
D: I found something else. Well, two things, actually. There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole. Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games. He was there at the last one as well. Only this time, he left us his penlight.
E: She moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut, about an inch or two in diameter. The light from the outside shines in. She walks over to Sing and Tapp She holds up the penlight in an evidence baggie, clicking it twice then handing it to Tapp.
C: TAPP
D: Get a rush on the prints.
E: taking the baggie, studying it He hands it back to her.
C: KERRY
D: Copy that.
E: taking the baggie, moving out of the room
T: CUT TO
N: Hospital room. Lawrence in his white doctors coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical students. A nurse in white stands off to the side. Lawrence is going over the patients charts. He goes over to the x-ray display, pushing the light on to view two x-rays of someones skull. He points to it with his pen as he speaks.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.
E: He turns back to the three young medical students. One of them, a pretty Asian girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated with him.
N: In the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This is Zep. Hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, and something else below the surface. He glances down at John sleeping, then up at Lawrence.
C: LAWRENCE
D: The patient had...
C: ZEP
D: His name is John, Dr. Gordon. Hes a very interesting person.
E: cutting him off He looks down at the patient, who we see is a man in his late forties-early fifties, hairless except for a small white goatee. His head is to the side and he is sleeping. On the tray table in front of him is a notebook and some colored pencils. As Zep looks at him and speaks of him, there is caring in his voice, something Dr. Gordon has yet to display regarding this patient.
N: Lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face and he nods. His tone matches his look.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thank you for that information, Zep. As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. Continuing on, the patient....
E: he looks to the students, who all share his smug smile Zep just stares at Lawrence, his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface. The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, then turns away, and continues down the hall with his cart.
N: But he is cut off by a voice on the intercom.
C: INTERCOM
D: Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please page the operator.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Obviously someone doesnt want me to tell you what the patient has. Excuse me.
E: a smug but annoyed smirk He steps around the students, leaves the room. The three students watch after him with great admiration.
N: Cut to Lawrences office at the hospital . Inside, Tapp is leaning against Dr. Gordons chair, studying the various framed degrees on the wall. Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across from the desk, twisted around in his seat to look at a couple of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him. Lawrence opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.
C: TAPP
D: Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing, City Homicide. Very impressive.
E: he gestures to the degrees on the wall.
N: Lawrence smiles, pretending to care about what they think, truly just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more of his time. As he speaks, he walks over to the chair behind his desk.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Oh. Thank you, I do my best.
E: He sits in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next to Sing across from him. Sing studies him silently, chewing gum.
C: TAPP
D: Sorry to interrupt you while youre working.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thats fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen?
N: Tapps tone turns a bit more serious, but still amiable enough.
C: TAPP
D: Are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Why is it that youre interested?
E: his tone just barely masking his concern
C: TAPP
D: Wed like to ask you a few questions about it. For your sake, I think its best if we do it down at the station. Would you like to follow us there?
C: LAWRENCE
D: No, Im afraid thats...thats quite out of the question. I cant just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so...
E: Shaking his head, this is unbelievable
C: SING
D: Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. Doc.
E: amiable but hinting that he knows something
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im sorry, youll have to tell me again. What is this all about?
E: chuckles uncomfortably
N: Tapp produces the penlight from his pocket, holds it up for Dr. Gordon.
C: TAPP
D: Is this yours, Doctor?
N: He puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them. Cut to the Police Station. In an interrogation room, Lawrence paces back and forth nervously, now wearing his suit jacket. His lawyer sits at the table, taking notes.
C: LAWYER
D: So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Of course not!
C: LAWYER
D: I have to ask. What were you doing last night.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I was seeing someone.
E: a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt in his voice. As much as he would allow.
C: LAWYER
D: Who? Look, if you cant be honest with me...
E: a slight pause Lawrence doesnt answer, just continues his pacing. The lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts down his pen.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. Alright? What am I gonna do?
E: His tone quick, almost blurting He sighs, shakes his head. Hes fucked, either way.
C: LAWYER
D: Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later.
N: Cut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against his knee.
C: LAWRENCE
D: That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder.
E: sighs
N: Cut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts it behind him.
C: SING
D: Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up.
E: His voice indicates that he still believes theres more to it; he does not and will not trust Lawrence.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Good! Can I go home now?
C: SING
D: We have one of the victims who managed to escape. Want to know if you wouldnt mind sticking around and listening to her testimony? Maybe itll trigger something.
E: continuing As he speaks, we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass being led carefully into the room next to them and sat at a table. This is AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her clearly; she cannot see them. Tapp and an unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room. The man guides Amanda into her chair, stands behind her against the wall. Tapp sits in a chair to her left.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Id like to help, really, but...
E: doesnt really care
C: SING
D: Well, wed really appreciate it. Shes the only one who made it.
E: cutting him off quickly, wont let him out of this that easily
C: LAWRENCE
D: Okay.
E: quietly, giving in.
N: Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.
C: TAPP
D: Amanda...in your own time, tell me the first thing you remember.
E: speaking slowly, gently
N: We move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting as Pauls cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.
C: AMANDA
D: I woke up. All I could taste was blood. And metal.
E: VO The camera moves back quickly, and we see her tied to the chair, her wrists bound to the arms of the chair. She pulls against her bonds, moaning loudly, trying to speak or cry out but cannot.
N: She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen. The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.
C: JIGSAW
D: Hello Amanda. You dont know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. The device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, Ill show you.
E: from the TV The video moves next to the doll, to a device like the one shes wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.
N: The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to a close up of the doll.
C: JIGSAW
D: There is only one key to open the device. Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice.
E: from the TV
N: The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly. Thats when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her. The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.
C: AMANDA
D: And then I saw the body.
N: We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. She sobs harder, hunched over him. Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of the shot.
C: AMANDA
D: There was a knife.
N: Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when... HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands. A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table in Lawrences interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it.
C: SING
D: Hed been injected with an opiate overdose. He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
E: VO as camera pans up to Lawrence
C: LAWRENCE
D: You mean....he was alive?
C: SING
D: Was.
E: staring, nods slightly
N: Back to Amandas Interrogation room, her head still hung, still sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks
C: TAPP
D: What happened after you took it off?
N: Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell. Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering at her, then speaks.
C: JIGSAW
D: Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
N: Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp.
C: TAPP
D: You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt that right, Mandy? Do you think that is why he picked you? Are you grateful, Mandy?
E: she nods, but doesnt look up. She lets out a sob, briefly nodding once.
N: She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first time.
C: AMANDA
D: He...helped me.
E: softly
N: As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are. Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence.
C: ADAM
D: Are you sure its him?
E: softly
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah, Im sure.
E: nods slightly
C: ADAM
D: How do I know youre telling the truth? You can be the one who put me in this room!
E: becoming a little hysterical again. He speaks accusingly he gesticulates as he speaks, pointing to Lawrence and himself.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im in exactly the same situation youre in.
E: internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as to a simpleton
C: ADAM
D: Wrong. Wrong! Youve got one thing I dont: Information! You know who did this! Now you either tell me what is really going on or Ill cut you with this, you hear me? Ill cut-
E: he stands up, kicking his chained foot out. Shouts. He hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose, pointing He picks up a glass shard that fell when he broke the mirror, holds it up threateningly to Lawrence Lawrence rolls his eyes, turns his head over to his left, away from Adam But he stops short as he sees something in the glass. He flips it over, studying it, flips it back. He looks over to the mirror on the wall, studying it, thinking.
N: Lawrence notices that Adams ranting has ended, glances over at him.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What?
C: ADAM
D: Its a two-way mirror.
E: looks over at Lawrence, then back at the mirror.
N: Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.
C: MAN
D: I can see you...
E: OS, Taunting
C: ADAM
D: So thats what this is. Reality TV.
E: from on video
C: MAN
D: Dont look at me. I cant help you.
E: OS. Still taunting, sounds as though on a power trip
N: The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
C: ADAM
D: Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having a blast. This is the most fun Ive had without lubricant. Make sure youre getting everything.
E: he bends down and picks up another piece of debris from the floor Hums the piece of debris at the window. It makes a thwacking sound, but doesnt break. Not even a crack. Bends down, throws picks up and throws another piece of debris. It hits, but no breakage. Leans down for another piece.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thats not going to do anything.
E: Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying to break the glass
C: ADAM
D: You just want to leave it running on us?
E: pauses, looks to Lawrence the shot switches to surveillance view
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well, you wont stop it. Thats why we cant cut through these chains. Its why you wont break that glass. Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him.
E: very matter-of-fact shot switches to regular view he gestures to the pipe then the glass He appears deep in thought, starting to understand the set-up more so, figuring out the way this guy thinks. Almost admiring him. The situation may be bad, but its a brilliant design.
C: ADAM
D: You sound like you admire this prick.
C: LAWRENCE
D: To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. Help me find it.
E: explaining He looks up at the ceiling, at the walls, around the room determined
N: Adam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrences calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is almost becoming as sick of Lawrences attitude as Lawrence is of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly.
C: ADAM
D: How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when your wife and kid are out there. Hes got them, too. He could be doing anything to them right now. Are you thinking about that?
E: Shot of Lawrence looking around the room Shot of the clock; its now 12:05.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I AM thinking about that. Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter.
E: Suddenly looks right at him, snaps angrily Adam backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, his voice changes to calm but sad.
N: Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of the Gordon Household. The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern.
C: ALISON
D: Diana, Honey, are you okay? Diana, Honey, can you hear me?
E: she pushes back the covers and gets up, crouching down in front of her daughter. Looking up at her, she places her hands on her daughters arms.
C: DIANA
D: Mommy?
E: very softly, but showing almost no fear
N: Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek.
C: ALISON
D: Oh, what is it, sweet pea?
C: DIANA
D: Theres a man in my room.
E: very calmly
C: ALISON
D: Oh Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding in your imagination?
E: sighing, but not rudely. This is not the first time this has happened
C: DIANA
D: He talked to me.
C: ALISON
D: Okay, Ill come and check your room.
E: sighs She smiles a small, assuring smile
C: DIANA
D: I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
C: ALISON
D: Alright, if you want. Come on.
E: her smile fading a bit
N: She stands and leads Diana out of the room. Cut to Lawrences office. Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer, focused on some paper hes writing. Diana and Alison appear in the doorway to his left. He doesnt even look up, just keeps typing. Alisons tone when she speaks indicates that she knows hell probably say no, or put it off on her.
C: ALISON
D: Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Just a minute.
E: his eyes never leaving the screen; raises his finger to pause them
C: ALISON
D: She wants you to check her room.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.
E: keeps typing, never looks up
N: Alison waits a moment, then turns to Diana.
C: ALISON
D: You know what sweetie? Ill go check with you.
E: softly
N: They turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes typing, then closes the laptop.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Nope! Im done.
E: he smiles, turning to look at them.
N: Cut to Dianas room. Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp on Dianas side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up against her pillows and stuffed animals. Lawrence sits on the side of her bed.
C: LAWRENCE
D: See? Theres no one in your room. Theres no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep?
E: very reassuringly he pulls the covers up over her, up to her chest.
C: DIANA
D: Im still scared.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You are? Give me your tootsie. Oh, what a big tootsie. Remember this one? This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went Weeee! all the way home!
E: He pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot. He takes it in his hand. He turns to her, raising his eyebrows up He counts on her toes as he says the following he tickles up her leg to her tummy and she giggles
N: Just then, Lawrences beeper goes off. He leans back, takes it out and looks at it.
C: DIANA
D: I hate that thing.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddys job is like. Now, come on. Lets see. Try and get some sleep now, okay?
E: he re-tucks her in, she smiles at him. He gives her a kiss, smiles, stands up and goes to the door.
C: DIANA
D: Youre not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?
C: LAWRENCE
D: What? What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy? No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea?
E: suddenly concerned He stops at the door, turns, goes back over to her bed, sits down next to her and leans over. This was the last thing hed expected her to say She nods; he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face.
C: DIANA
D: No one.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well its not true, okay?
C: DIANA
D: Okay.
E: very softly
C: LAWRENCE
D: How much do I love you?
N: He moves his face closer to her and together they say LAWRENCE & DIANA Love you very much
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thats right, thats right! Good night, sweetie.
E: He gives her a kiss, pulls back.
C: DIANA
D: Good night, Daddy.
N: Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. He pauses before he steps out.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite story.
C: DIANA
D: Okay.
E: with a small smile
C: LAWRENCE
D: Okay.
E: he goes out.
N: Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence. Lawrence walks towards the door, Alison behind him. Alisons voice starts to cut over the scene. Her tone is very pissed off.
C: ALISON
D: I dont know how much longer I can do this, Larry.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What, what are you talking about?
E: sounds as though he has no idea what she means
C: ALISON
D: How can you walk through life pretending that youre happy?
E: pissed, in disbelief
C: LAWRENCE
D: I am happy.
C: ALISON
D: That is complete bullshit. Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
E: confrontational cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes are open, she can hear everything. We stay with her for the rest of Alisons line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible
C: LAWRENCE
D: Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.
C: ADAM
D: Shes beautiful.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thank you.
C: ADAM
D: You gonna have any more kids?
E: sighs, then looks up at Lawrence
C: LAWRENCE
D: Weve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one.
E: a bit wearily, but not snobby The tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and attention to his daughter.
C: ADAM
D: So wheres the lucky wife?
E: referring to the wallet a small smile
C: LAWRENCE
D: Theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. Its my favourite one because were all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos.
E: Adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks
N: Cut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.
C: JIGSAW
D: X Marks the spot. Sometimes you see more with your eyes shut.
E: VO
N: Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence.
C: ADAM
D: Its uh, its not here.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What?
E: a slight disturbance from his momentary nostalgic bliss
C: ADAM
D: Uh, this photo youre talking about...its not here.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Really? Are you sure?
E: slightly surprised, reaching out his hand for Adam to toss the wallet.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah.
E: Tucking the picture in his right hand, he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it, creasing his brow in concern, while Adam backs up against his wall, holding the photograph out of Lawrences sight against a pipe he rests his arm on as he looks at the photograph.
C: LAWRENCE
D: He...he mustve taken it. I...
E: disbelief, shaking his head
N: Alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to look through the wallet, and we hear Alisons voiceover from the scene in the main hall.
C: ALISON
D: How can you walk through life pretending that youre happy?
E: VO
N: CUT TO the Main Hall of the Gordon Residence, back to the earlier flashback of Lawrence and Alison. This time, we stay with them.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I am happy.
E: He walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. Alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react, to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.
C: ALISON
D: That is complete bullshit. Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
E: pissed
C: LAWRENCE
D: We can talk about this alter, okay?
E: tired of this, brushing it off as not that important, like there really is nothing wrong He leans in to kiss her, but she shakes her head. He pauses there.
C: ALISON
D: Just leave.
E: firmly
N: He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door.
C: VOICE
D: Goodnight, little girl. watching her.)
E: camera pans up closer into the closet, and we a widened blue eye and part of a face
N: The closet doors burst open and Diana screams. Cut back to the main hall where Alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her daughters room.
C: ALISON
D: Diana!?
N: Alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.
C: ALISON
D: Diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over Dianas bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana and she screams, struggling against him. Alison goes for them.
N: Quick cut to NOW, in Alison and Lawrences bedroom. Waistline shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. A gun is tucked into his belt and Dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. He saunters over to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing. The figure crouches down beside Diana, dropping the teddy bear behind her, his face still unseen. He takes the stethoscope and holds the end to Dianas chest. The sound of a loud, steady heartbeat is heard. Alison screams at him through her gag.
C: ALISON
D: Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from her!
N: He pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. He reaches with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. Dianas screams become more desperate, Alisons more frantic, more angry. He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mothers head. We hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.
C: ALISON
D: Keep your motherfucking hands off of my daughter!
E: through her gag
N: He pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back into his belt. He reaches down behind Diana and picks up the teddy bear. As he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a moment then tucks it in front of her. He pats her on the head and stands up, moving over to the window. He parts the curtains slightly and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. It is Zep, the orderly from the hospital. Cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the Gordon home, of the window where Zep is standing. The camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.
C: VOICE
D: Who are you little man...I see you... Does Dr. Gordon know youre at home with his wife? I know you know something. What are you doing in there? Waiting for the doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, too. Hmm.
E: VO as we view shot of Zep cut to a television screen with the video of Zep in the window. Fade back and to the right as we get a view of someones apartment. Plastered on the walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment. As we move further right and hit the window we see Detective Tapp, leaning over the camera shooting the Gordons window, adjusting the view. Something about him seems just not right. We cut back to his view from the camera. his voice goes up a bit louder
N: Cut to a view over Tapps couch of the television with Zep on video on the screen. Tapp walks over and sits down in front of the television, his back to us.
C: TAPP
D: I never should have let you go...
N: Camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging dead in his cage Killer Preaching Says Top Cop, Psychopath Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniacs Game quick flashback footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.
C: TAPP
D: I never shouldve let you go...
E: VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack
N: The car pulls up alongside a building, with Lawrence in the passenger seat, and Tapp driving. Lawrences awkwardness, Tapps distrust, and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between them.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Here we are. That was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told.
E: Pretending like hes trying to be helpful, really just glad to be out of Tapps company Tapp just nods, says nothing. Lawrence smiles very uncomfortably, gets out of the car.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Look, Im sorry I cant be of more help to your investigation.
E: leaning down and looking back into the car window.
C: TAPP
D: You know, we arrested a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here. The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, Doctor.
E: nods very slightly hint hint
N: Lawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp waits a moment, then drives off. BAM into static and then the video from Amandas cell. We are not at Tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
C: JIGSAW
D: Hello Amanda. You dont know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. Theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.
E: from the video
N: In the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk. He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen. Tapp stops and rewinds the tape.
C: SING
D: Ill catch you guys down there.
E: to the other detectives leaving he reaches over and gets something off of his desk
C: JIGSAW
D: Think of it like a reverse bear trap.
E: from video
N: Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.
C: JIGSAW
D: Ill show you...
E: from video
N: Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding. Sing watches too, not paying as close attention. As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks. The look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partners obsession over this case.
C: SING
D: Hey Tapp?
N: Tapp doesnt look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper.
C: TAPP
D: Mmm?
C: SING
D: Were gonna go down to the Grill, go get a beer. You wanna come?
C: TAPP
D: I dont think so. Thanks anyway.
C: SING
D: You know I always ask.
E: Figured he might answer as such He puts on his jacket
C: JIGSAW
D: There is only one key...
E: on video
C: SING
D: Ill leave you to have fun up here.
E: He puts his hands on his hips, watching some more of the video.
C: JIGSAW
D: Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
E: on video
C: SING
D: Hey Tapp? I dont mean for this to be disrespectful... Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
E: still trying to reach him, break him from his obsession groove pause
N: Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a bit too, but doesnt look up. Sing remains grinning a bit. But then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.
C: JIGSAW
D: Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
E: on video
N: Tapp fast forwards.
C: JIGSAW
D: Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up.
E: on video Sing steps off to the right Tapp rewinds again, suddenly pauses
C: TAPP
D: Wait wait wait, Sing!
N: Sing stops, turns.
C: TAPP
D: Get back here!
C: SING
D: What?
C: TAPP
D: Mmm!
E: he gestures franticly for him to come over.
C: SING
D: What?
E: sighs then comes over
N: Tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen to a grafittied wall on the video.
C: TAPP
D: Remember 118th Street?
C: SING
D: Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was only about four blocks.
E: looks at the screen, thinks a minute
C: TAPP
D: Now listen to this.
N: They listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They look at each other. Tapp hits stop.
C: TAPP
D: We gotta check the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go, right now! Mmm!
E: looking up at Sing
N: Sing turns and quickly walks off.
T: CUT TO
N: Close up of a map, with Sing speaking in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres a brief shot of the two of them sitting over the map, then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a warehouse, including a close up of a street sign Stygian St.
C: SING
D: On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. Its an old listing. Used to be a mannequin factory. You think we have enough for a warrant, though?
E: VO cut back to view of the two detectives
C: TAPP
D: Who said anything about a warrant?
E: He grins, gets up and grabs his jacket.
C: SING
D: Right now?
E: are you serious?
C: TAPP
D: Why not?
C: SING
D: Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, and quickly follows Tapp.
N: Brief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud static, which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse building and a car speeding by. Our view is from inside the car as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded and cocked.
C: TAPP
D: At least well have the cover of darkness.
E: VO
C: SING
D: Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
E: VO
N: A shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Pauls razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti from the video.
C: TAPP
D: I got you...
N: They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, dolls representing each of them.
C: TAPP
D: What the hell is this?....... Oh shit...
E: his voice almost a whisper
N: They move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amandas video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives.
C: SING
D: Oh fuck!
N: They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his tape at the detectives. Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns ready.
C: TAPP
D: Wait Sing!
E: looks to Sing, says softly
C: SING
D: What?
E: trying to keep his voice low but coming off a bit loudly
C: TAPP
D: Lets see what hes gonna do.
E: eager
C: SING
D: Why? Weve fucking got him.
N: Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element.
C: TAPP
D: We dont know what he looks like. Lets see what hes gonna do.
C: SING
D: No fucking way!
E: rather loudly, again
N: As the two argue, the man in the chair continues to protest his position.
C: TAPP
D: Sing, Sing!
E: he moves in front of the man a bit, holding up his hand to try to halt Sing, trying to convince him to go along with him.
C: SING
D: Fuck that. Im gonna take him.
E: isnt buying into it
C: TAPP
D: Sing!
C: SING
D: What the fuck? Shit!
C: TAPP
D: Wait Sing, listen.
N: Whoever it is is moving closer, so they quickly cover up the man and the other things they uncovered. The man in the chair protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can in his chair. Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps to the man in the chair. The figures hood is up; we do not see his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat difficult time with it. He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through the gag. When the figure speaks, we instantly know it is Jigsaw; it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the video.
C: JIGSAW
D: Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful tranquilizers next time. Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. Youre a test subject for something greater than yourself.
E: Jeff continues his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw reaches over and touches his shoulder
N: Thats when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move out of their hiding spot, aiming their weapons at Jigsaw.
C: SING
D: Freeze! Police!
C: TAPP
D: Hold it right there! Dont move!
C: SING
D: Put your fucking hands in the air!
N: Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life. He remains with his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
C: JIGSAW
D: Now youll make a choice. In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.
E: Sing runs up the steps to try to where Jigsaw is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where he stands.
C: TAPP
D: Shut up and get down here!
C: SING
D: What did you do? Turn it off!
E: keeping his gun steadily aimed
N: Jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills come closer.
C: TAPP
D: Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this bastard down. Move!
E: Sing tosses Tapp the shotgun.
C: SING
D: How do you turn it off?!
E: to Jigsaw
C: TAPP
D: Tell him how to stop it!
N: Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs.
C: JIGSAW
D: One key will unlock it.
C: SING
D: Where is it?!
E: frantic
C: JIGSAW
D: Its in the box.
C: SING
D: Box! Fuck! Which key, which key?!
E: He sees a box on the side of the chair and opens it. Inside he pulls out a ring of at least 30 keys, and goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock the device. He tries a couple of keys, none working.
C: TAPP
D: Tell him which key it is!
C: JIGSAW
D: Time is running out.
E: now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. His back is to us, we still dont see his face.
C: TAPP
D: Shut up and get down here right now, asshole!
N: Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.
C: JIGSAW
D: Whats more important to you Officer, arresting me or the life of another human being?
N: Sing keeps trying various keys. Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs him, pushing him down to his knees. Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly raised.
C: TAPP
D: Get down on your knees!
C: SING
D: Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!
C: TAPP
D: Hands behind your head! Sick bastard.
E: gun aimed at the back of Jigsaws head Jigsaw obliges
C: JIGSAW
D: Yes, I am sick, Officer.
C: SING
D: Tapp! Its like, theres a hundred keys in here!
E: still trying various keys, none working. Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes his eyes, crying, as the drills are only 2 inches away
C: JIGSAW
D: Sick from the disease eating away at me inside. Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
N: Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking and stopping them. Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted by the gunfire.
C: JIGSAW
D: Sick of it all!
E: as he pops a blade out of a wristband hidden up his right sleeve He lashes upwards, slashing Tapps throat
C: SING
D: Tapp!!!
E: seeing the throat slash runs down from Jeff towards them. Tapp clutches his throat, completely surprised, gurgling.
N: Jigsaw RUNS, fast as he can, out of the room. Sing takes a couple of shots at him and misses. He stops when he reaches Tapp, who is slumped against the fence/wall and bends down next to him.
C: SING
D: No, no! Tapp! Shit!
E: desperate, a trace of despair
N: Tapp gurgles at him, hands him the shotgun.
C: SING
D: Ill be back, okay? Ill be back.
E: standing, touching Tapp on the shoulder then head
N: Tapp just kind of nods, gurgling and holding his throat. Sing spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the warehouse, out of the room and down a flight of stairs. He moves down a long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. He drags himself along the floor. Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to get away. He takes aim.
C: SING
D: Freeze or Ill shoot!
E: shouting
N: Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing. Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs just before the hallway where Sing now is. On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further down the hall. Sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end of the hall and starts sliding a large door open. At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now missing. At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck.
C: TAPP
D: Had you...had you on your knees. Youre running. Youre running... Youre running scared because we had you. Im going to close this case. Ram close it. Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close it, Sing.
E: weak, desperate He sits forward, getting some things off the coffee table He gets up and goes over to the desk in the corner with the audio recording device and dozens of photos pinned to the wall, takes a seat He picks up a small framed photograph, which we cant see, but likely, its of Sing.
C: LAWRENCE
D: X Marks the spot... X marks the spot...we need to search this room again. What are you doing over there?
E: He stands, touching the pipe and looking up and around a bit. He turns and looks over at Adam.
N: Cut back into regular view in the bathroom, with a shot of Adam sitting on the tub, holding the photograph of Alison and Diana just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub, looking down at it. He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Excuse me?
E: irritated
C: ADAM
D: Just because Im stuck in this room with you doesnt mean I have to report to you every ten seconds.
E: glancing up; calm irritation
C: LAWRENCE
D: I really dont see the point in us not helping one another.
E: sighs
C: ADAM
D: well what do you want me to do? Im on a leash.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thats exactly why we need to talk. We need to think!
C: ADAM
D: I am thinking!
C: LAWRENCE
D: Well then dont keep me in the dark about what youre thinking!
E: snapping at him
N: There is a pause as something about that statement strikes Adam.
C: ADAM
D: Turn off the lights.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What?
C: ADAM
D: Turn them off now, please!
E: letting the photo fall into the tub as he stands
C: LAWRENCE
D: Why?
E: doesnt get it
C: ADAM
D: Just turn them off for a second!
E: impatiently
N: Lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards, reaching over and flipping off the lights. Adam looks around. Lawrence looks around too, but he sees nothing. He doesnt seem to think this is going to help any. Then we see on the wall next to him a glow in the dark X painted on the tiles. He doesnt see it and shrugs, but Adam spots it.
C: ADAM
D: Jesus, behind you!
C: LAWRENCE
D: How come we didnt see that before?
E: turns and sees it, is surprised
C: ADAM
D: The lights in here hadnt charged it. It must be glow in the dark paint or something.
N: Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, though not as much as before. Lawrence leans over and picks up his hacksaw, going over to the tiles where the X is and starts hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw. He breaks through, reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small brown box with a hinged lid. He cant believe it. He looks to Adam, a small grin on his face. He places it on the floor and sits down behind it.
C: ADAM
D: Open it!
E: excitedly
C: LAWRENCE
D: Its locked. The key, the one from my envelope. Where is it?
E: turns it around so we and Adam can see the small lock on it. He pauses, thinking, then realizes something
N: Adam looks around him, then leans down, looking on the floor for the key.
C: ADAM
D: Where the fuck...Here.
E: soft, hushed tone as he looks He finds it, picks it up and tosses it over.
N: Lawrence picks up the key, tries it on the lock. It works. He takes the lock off, opens the box. He holds up a cell phone, smiling in relief.
C: ADAM
D: Cell phone. The most beautiful invention on this planet!
E: big smile
N: Lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes. Adam lets out a joyful laugh.
C: ADAM
D: Make that second most beautiful invention! Give me that.
E: He reaches out his hand for Lawrence to toss it.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Are you joking? Youre gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth?
C: ADAM
D: Yes, Im willing to risk it! Give me that sweet cancer. I dont care, I really dont. Give me one of those.
E: pause, then Lawrence ignores his request, tosses out the other cigarette and a lighter. He finds lastly a small folded up note with the words Shh, Doctor, written on it.
N: Jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as Lawrence opens the paper and reads it, keeping it low in the box where Adam cant see it.
C: JIGSAW
D: The cigarettes are harmless, I promise. Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed. Think about this - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.
E: VO
C: ADAM
D: May I please have a cigarette?
E: growing impatient
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im trying the police. Shit. This was meant to receive calls, not make them. Wait a minute...this has happened before.
E: ignoring his plea He flips open and dials on the cell phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating the call cant go through comes from the phone. He dials again, same result. Pause, thinks. A moment; he realizes something.
N: Cut back to an overhead descending view inside a parking garage.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Last night, after I finished at the hospital. I was walking back to my car. I thought I was alone, but Im sure someone else was there.
E: VO fade into another closer shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking down the corridor, carrying his briefcase. He stops a moment He squints, bringing his hand up over his eyes. There is a flash from the side. He looks up, startled, looking in the direction in which he thinks it came from, but sees nothing. He looks around him for another moment, then continues forward to his car.
N: Cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of Lawrences car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station. He gets out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaws workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with his phone and grabs him. Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still holding the phone.
C: LAWRENCE
D: That...thing. It was waiting for me. How did you know to turn off the lights?
E: His eyes distant, off in his memory He exhales sharply, then looks back up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses him.
C: ADAM
D: Who cares? It worked.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah, but how did you know?
C: ADAM
D: Instinct.
E: a slight pause His tone is far from believable.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Instinct?
E: doesnt believe a word of it
C: ADAM
D: Yeah.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You know what? Youre a terrible liar.
E: he looks down, then back up at Adam.
C: ADAM
D: You say that like you know me.
E: quiet offense
C: LAWRENCE
D: What else arent you telling me?
E: speaks calmly, but anger lies underneath the surface
C: ADAM
D: Well, um, lets see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me with a rusty nail. I didnt tell you about that. I didnt tell you that my last girlfriend, who was a feminist vegan punk, broke up with me because she thought I was too angry. Uh, I havent told you that one of my toenails is slightly...
E: cocky and sarcastic Lawrence lowers his head into his hands. Un-FUCKING-believable
C: LAWRENCE
D: Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights.
E: snaps at him, fed up
C: ADAM
D: What-ever.
E: turning away from Lawrence
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im dealing with a juvenile.
E: stands up, frustrated.
C: ADAM
D: You wanna know?
E: has had it, looks right at him
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah!
E: exasperated
N: Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds up the picture of Alison and Diana.
C: ADAM
D: Here it is.
E: with a somewhat aggressive attitude He throws it towards Lawrence, who looks down at it, then back up at Adam before getting down on the floor and pulling it towards him with the hinged box. He picks it up, sitting up as he looks upon it with shock.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Oh God... W...where did you get this?
E: very softly, shakily he turns it over, then back. Adam casts his eyes downwards, still standing but cooling off, feeling bad for Lawrence
C: ADAM
D: It was in your wallet, behind the photo of your daughter.
E: softly
C: LAWRENCE
D: W...why didnt you show me this before?
C: ADAM
D: I couldnt. Im sorry.
E: Lawrence begins to shakily sob, touching the photo. Adam goes over and sits against a pipe in his corner, lowering his head and upper body forward, holding his head in his hands.
N: Lawrence sniffles, shaking, then looks right to the surveillance camera behind the glass and screams.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What are you doing to them you bastard?! Okay...okay.. Okay, Ive got to think now...
E: He goes back to huddling over the photograph, sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, he sits up, trying to pull himself together he looks around a bit He looks down, sees the note again in the box.
C: JIGSAW
D: Think about this...you dont need a gun to kill Adam. When theres that much poison in your blood , the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.
E: VO a slow shot moving to the pool of blood from the body in front of Lawrence
N: Lawrence looks at the body, then down. Hes getting an idea. He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his head down in his hands. He dips the end of the cigarette in the blood, then puts it back in the box. He starts to get up. Adam looks up, sees him standing.
C: ADAM
D: What are you doing?
N: Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom.
C: ADAM
D: Hey! What the hell are you doing?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Adam, listen to me. I want you to play along with me on this.
E: whispering so the surveillance camera will not pick him up
N: Zep leans in, trying to hear whats being said, but the static of the video is too loud. He tries to adjust the sound, but to no avail. Shot goes back into the bathroom, where Lawrence is finishing saying something to Adam.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You got that? (he turns the lights back on, both of them again wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.
C: LAWRENCE
D: So you uh, still want that cigarette?
E: trying to be nonchalant
C: ADAM
D: Um...yeah, sure.
N: Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death in its entirety is very, very fake.
C: LAWRENCE
D: There! Ive done it! Ive killed him with the poison, just like you wanted. Now wheres my family?! Where are they?!
E: watches Adam, then turns to the surveillance camera, speaks with angry finality shouting
N: Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries out. He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted, and Lawrence looks upon him in shock. Finally, the electrocution stops, and Adam sits up slightly, gasping, eyes wide.
C: ADAM
D: Jesus Christ!!
E: he shrieks in pain and shock
N: Lawrences reaction is not one of concern; he simply cant believe that Adam just screwed up the plan.
C: LAWRENCE
D: What?
E: disbelief
C: ADAM
D: I just got electrocuted!
E: wide eyed
C: LAWRENCE
D: What? That was our way out!
E: he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. He speaks in a hushed tone.
N: Adam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think hed make something like that up.
C: ADAM
D: Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me! Get it off!
E: yelling at him he desperately grabs at the manacle around his ankle, pulling at it and shrieking
C: LAWRENCE
D: Stop acting!
E: pissed off
C: ADAM
D: You think I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade?
E: stops pulling at the manacle and chains; now hes pissed at Lawrence for his disbelief
C: LAWRENCE
D: All right, thats it! Ah, Damn it!!
E: gives up on Adam, frustrated once more He leans over and picks up his saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall, breathing heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. He gets pissed off and throws the blade down.
N: Back to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory.
C: ADAM
D: I remember everything now. I remember how I got here.
E: wide-eyed Lawrence glances over at him.
N: Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty. Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes. The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to black, industrial music playing over the shot. Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. Pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt work. He looks at it, scoffs.
C: ADAM
D: Great.
N: Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave.
C: ADAM
D: Is someone there? I can hear you.
E: he takes a picture, the flash lighting up the area in front of him. He takes another picture, the flash lighting up a living room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping away for light.
N: Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard. He startles, spinning around.
C: ADAM
D: What the...? Christ! What the...
E: his voice alarmed but confused at the same time He snaps a picture in its direction and sees the Puppet from Jigsaws workshop and video sitting in an armchair, continuing its evil laugh. He reaches down and finds a baseball bat on the floor, and starts hitting the doll as hard as he can until the laugh starts to fade and then just dies out.
N: He hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind him in a closet. He goes on alert again, holding up the baseball bat and the camera.
C: ADAM
D: Who is that?! Whos in there?! Come on out! Ill kill you, you motherfucker!
E: he moves towards the door, shaking but trying to be a tough guy He opens the door, holds the camera and takes a picture. As soon as the flash goes off we see the red-robed pig thing that originally grabbed Lawrence quickly move forward and grab Adam.
N: Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as well. Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully reaches down, picks it up and answers it. The scene will cut back and forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on the phone for the duration of the conversation.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Who is this?
E: not sure what to expect
C: DIANA
D: Daddy?
E: on the phone, sobbing
C: LAWRENCE
D: Diana?
E: he stands
C: DIANA
D: Daddy, is that you?
E: cut to a shot of her being held by Zep, the phone to her ear.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah baby, its me. Im here.
E: getting sniffly Adam watches him intently
C: DIANA
D: Im scared, Daddy.
E: sobbing
C: LAWRENCE
D: Dont worry honey, everythings going to be okay. Wheres Mommy?
E: trying his best to reassure her
C: DIANA
D: Shes here with me.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Let me talk to her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.
E: Staying as calm and collected as he can for his daughter
C: DIANA
D: The bad man from my room is here. He has us tied up and he has a gun.
C: LAWRENCE
D: W...what man?
C: DIANA
D: Please come home Daddy!
E: Zep kisses her on the top of her head and takes the phone away to give to Alison.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Hello? Hello? Diana?
N: Zep pushes some of Alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel of the gun.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Diana! Diana!
E: desperate
N: Zep puts the phone up to Alisons ear.
C: ALISON
D: Larry?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ally? Is that you?
E: We see a shot of Alison giving a threatening look through her tears to Zep.
C: ALISON
D: Is Adam there?
C: LAWRENCE
D: How do you know? Ally, what is going on?
E: surprised, looks to Adam, who continues to watch him worriedly
C: ALISON
D: Dont believe Adams lies. He knows you. He knew all about you before today.
E: through her sobs, trying to calm them and get this message to him Zep quickly takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the phone.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Hello? Ally? Ally? Hello? God damn you! If you so much as lay a finger on them, Ill kill you! You hear me? You son of a bitch! Ill kill you!
E: a dial tone is heard from the other end hanging up. Lawrence is desperate No answer, just the dial tone. He stands up. He looks to the surveillance camera, screaming He sits down, leaning forward over the floor, crying a bit. He slams his fist fiercely against the floor.
C: ADAM
D: Are they okay?
E: quietly, as though cautiously approaching a dangerous animal
C: LAWRENCE
D: My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.
E: sits up. His voice is calmer, but rage is clearly underneath the surface
C: ADAM
D: What did she say?
E: a brief Oh shit look appears in his eyes, but he acts surprised
C: LAWRENCE
D: She told me...not to believe you.
E: not looking at him yet. Speaks very firmly, trying to suppress his rage.
C: ADAM
D: Believe me about what?
E: cannot even look at Lawrence. There is no doubt hes hiding something
C: LAWRENCE
D: She told me you knew me. Who are you?
E: Finally turns to look at him, the look of 1000 deaths He stands, looming menacingly, the look stronger on his face
C: ADAM
D: You know who I am.
E: still trying to cover up and losing, still not making eye contact
C: LAWRENCE
D: Stop the lies! Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
E: snaps, shouting at him
C: ADAM
D: Im a liar? What did you do last night, Lawrence? Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital.
E: His tone changes, hes had it with hiding, had it with Lawrence Finally, he looks up, right at Lawrence. His voice is firm and accusing.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Thats because its the truth.
E: defensively
C: ADAM
D: No its not. Your wife is right, Larry. You dont recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot?
E: almost deadly Lawrence is now the one wearing the Oh shit look.
N: Brief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage, pausing and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed. We see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the shot from around a corner, ducking back behind the column. Lawrence looks up at the flash, startled. Cut back to the bathroom. Adam stands up, his stance and body language accusing of Lawrence. He speaks fiercely, disgusted with Lawrences two-faced bullshit.
C: ADAM
D: I can prove that you didnt go anywhere near a hospital last night. Its not the first time Ive done it either, Larry. Ive been taking pictures of you for a few days now.
E: He leans over and pulls out the garbage bag from the tub. Lawrence stands, staring at him in near disbelief. He has been caught. Adam takes a handful of photos from the baggie hed kept hidden inside the garbage bag, holds them up and throws them down, scattering them. Lawrence leans over to look at the photos on the floor in front of him with complete and utter disbelief, picking one up and looking down at it Shots of some of Adams pictures. Lawrence going into a building, Lawrence at an outdoor café eating lunch.
C: LAWRENCE
D: But...why?
E: still holding the photograph
C: ADAM
D: You wanna know what I do? I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels to fuck their secretaries. Last night I went to your house. I watched you leave. I followed you all the way to that shitbag hotel.
E: we start seeing more shots Adam took while following Lawrence Flashback of Adam holding his camera, then cut to several photographs of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing over his shoulder and moving down the sidewalk Lawrence in the parking garage, photographs of the exterior of the Hotel Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking on the door to one of the rooms while Adam hides around the corner with his camera Photographs of Lawrence standing outside then going into the room.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Youve uh, had these with you the whole time?
E: calm with rage just beneath the surface
C: ADAM
D: I found them, in there with the hacksaws. I dont know how they got there.
E: points to the toilet; quick flashback of Adam pulling the bag out of the top of the toilet, then Adam opening the bag and seeing the hacksaws and a glimpse of something else in the bag. Flashback of Adam tossing the bag into the bathtub while Lawrence isnt looking.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Yeah, right. Youre so full of it!
E: angry He angrily crumples up and throws the photo he was holding at Adam
C: ADAM
D: Aww, face it, Larry, were both bulls hitters. But my camera isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It only shows you whats put right in front of it. Just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room? You got out of there pretty fast.
E: scoffing tone
N: Cut to a flashback, the hotel room. Carla, the pretty Asian girl from the hospital, is inside the room, now in a black lacy top and a gray/blue skirt, waiting for him. She opens the door, taking a step back as he enters. He looks unsure of the whole situation, a changed attitude this evening from all the others. He shuts the door behind him, and Carla smiles at him. Lawrences tone when he speaks is unhappy. Not enraged, just somewhat disapproving.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Why did you um, deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?
C: CARLA
D: I didnt know if you were going to make it.
E: turns, goes and sits on the bed.
C: LAWRENCE
D: But I gave you a precise time at which to page me. You cant do that.
E: sounding very business-like He puts the briefcase on a chair by the door then goes over and sits down next to her on the bed.
C: CARLA
D: Its not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff. Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?
E: She starts unbuttoning her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand and stops her. She looks up at him, concerned.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Look, it was wrong for me to makes you come here.
E: a sigh in his voice
C: CARLA
D: But I thought we-
E: confused, hurt
C: LAWRENCE
D: -Please. Im sorry.
E: very softly He stands and heads over to the door. Carla remains sitting on the bed. She sniffles slightly but doesnt cry.
N: Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings. Carla and Lawrence both look at it, unsure, startled. Carla looks to Lawrence.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You tell anyone you were here?
C: CARLA
D: No. Hello? Its for you.
E: She stands, goes over to the phone and answers it. She listens, turns to Lawrence She holds out the phone.
C: LAWRENCE
D: For me? Hello?
E: He walks over, takes the phone.
N: The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy. It is unidentifiable; it could be either Tapp or Zep, or someone else. It is very accusing.
C: VOICE
D: I know what youre doing...Doctor.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I-
E: but the other person hangs up, and a dial tone is heard
N: Lawrence hangs up the phone, turns and moves to the door. Carla moves with him, watching, waiting for him to say who it was.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I have to go.
E: nervous
C: CARLA
D: What happened?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door.
N: Cut to the underground parking lot, the same shot as where Adam took Lawrences picture. He walks along, pauses to wince and cover his eyes, then the flash. He looks up startled. The shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against the wall in his corner, hand against a pipe. He slowly looks up at Adam, thinking of something.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Who was it?
C: ADAM
D: Who was what?
C: LAWRENCE
D: The person who paid you to follow me, who was it?
C: ADAM
D: He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money up front. Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve asked for a hell of a lot more.
E: internal shrug
C: LAWRENCE
D: What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
E: pissy
C: ADAM
D: What I saw was you get into your car. Thats it. I didnt ask your name. I didnt know who you were. I dont know how I got here, I dont know how you got here. I just took the shots and went straight home to develop the. Next thing I know Im chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at the guy Ive been taking shots of all night.
E: internal eye roll; speaks as though hes been over this 100 times before As he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam taking a picture, going up apartment stairs, then in the darkroom
C: LAWRENCE
D: Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here.
E: seeing a major break in this mystery
C: ADAM
D: Maybe.
E: they dont know that for sure
C: LAWRENCE
D: Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like?
C: ADAM
D: I dont know, he was just a guy.
E: internal shrug Shot of inside Adams apartment and an unidentifiable figure towards the back of the room, the image darkened so we cant make him out. The figure slowly takes a step towards us/Adam
C: LAWRENCE
D: Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?
C: ADAM
D: I dont take notes about his appearance.
E: Shot inside apartment, the figure moves closer
C: LAWRENCE
D: You must remember something about him.
E: aggravated, how can he not remember anything?
C: ADAM
D: I cant.
E: Shot of inside the apartment, the figure moves closer
C: LAWRENCE
D: Youre telling me you dont remember a thing about the guy?
C: ADAM
D: I told you, I-
E: inside apartment, the figure moves closer, just about close enough for identification
C: LAWRENCE
D: Oh for fucks sake! I give up!
E: enraged, throwing his hands up
C: ADAM
D: Hes a tall black guy, hes got a scar around his neck, okay?
E: gives up his playing dumb tone, gives in due to irritation with Lawrence Shot of inside the apartment, the figure moves into a viewable light; It is Tapp.
N: Lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from Adam. At hearing Adams description, he slowly moves back, turns around to face Adam.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Tapp! Detective Tapp!
E: shot of inside Adams apartment, Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our hand reaches out and takes it quickly. Then, back to Lawrence
C: ADAM
D: Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop.
C: LAWRENCE
D: No, no, he was discharged from the police force. He broke down after his partner was killed , but that didnt stop him from harassing me. The guy became obsessed. Hes convinced himself that I must have somehow been involved with the murders. Hes...hes crazy. And you helped him. You took money from him to invade my privacy. How could you do that?
E: Shot of Tapp at his desk with the Amanda video, looking at notes. Tapp and Sing sitting next to each other in Lawrences office Lawrence sitting in the car next to Tapp Tapp in his current apartment adjusting the camera in the window, then a shot of him leaning over a notebook, going over notes. Tapp at the corner desk in his apartment, giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, who points accusingly at Adam. disgusted
C: ADAM
D: Call it my need to eat.
E: bite me tone
C: LAWRENCE
D: Right, right. You know what Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, youre a part of it.
E: sarcastic Points accusingly at him as he says this.
C: ADAM
D: Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks youre the one behind it all.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I told you, hes not a cop. Hes a bottom feeder, just like you.
E: Facing into the corner of his cell, turning around slightly, internal eye roll. A slight sneer from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence turns back into his corner
C: ADAM
D: What are you more pissed off about? The fact that I took some shots of you or the fact that I took some shots of you while you were cheating on your wife?
E: getting REALLY pissed at Lawrences attitude towards him
N: Lawrence spins out of his corner, screaming in rage.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I did not cheat on her!!!
C: ADAM
D: What do you care what I think anyway? I dont give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gang bang!
N: A pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. Hes lost the last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before.
C: LAWRENCE
D: How did I get here? I had...I had everything in order. My whole life was in perfect order.
E: weakly Adam sits down on the pipe in his corner, leaning forward a bit. he lays down on his side, facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy He holds up and looks at the picture of Alison and Diana gagged.
N: Cut to the Gordons Bedroom. Zep puts Alisons gag back on her, then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she speaks softly to Diana.
C: ALISON
D: Sweetheart, are you okay? Mommy just needs you to be really, really, really strong right now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt you. You got that? Okay, thats my good girl.
E: Diana shakes her head no Diana nods She starts crying as her hands work behind her to loosen the rope around them.
N: Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance camera, sitting on the floor. Adams next line is a voice over over this shot.
C: ADAM
D: Hey, was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter?
C: LAWRENCE
D: No.
E: on camera
C: ADAM
D: Well, theres someone here.
E: still on camera He tosses the photo to Lawrence, whosits up, picks it up and looks at it. After a moment, the shot cuts back to a regular view of them, in the room.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I know him. Zep! His name is Zep. Hes an orderly at my hospital. Zep. You perverted little psychopath. Im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
E: realization We see the photo as well. It is a shot looking up into Lawrences window, with Zep standing there, looking out, completely unaware of his picture being taken. Cut to a shot of Zep listening. The shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while Lawrence makes his threats. his voice becomes a growl, furious
N: Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with a very worried look. He points up to it.
C: ADAM
D: Look. Were out of time.
E: Lawrence momentarily breaks from his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads at 6:00.
C: DIANA
D: Mommy help me!
E: crying
N: Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes his head sadly. He speaks calmly.
C: ZEP
D: Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed.
E: He undoes her gag, holds the phone to her head and his gun in front of her chest.
N: Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Is that you Zep, you bastard!? I know its you, you son of a bitch!
E: speaking quickly, the growling voice Adam gets up from his corner, moves forward slightly
C: ALISON
D: Larry?
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ally?
E: his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced with worry
T: Cut into the bedroom.
C: ALISON
D: You failed.
E: looking right at Zep, firmly
N: Quickly, she grabs Zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Hello? Hello?
E: who can only hear the sound of a struggle
N: Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one thought right now is Fuck.
C: ALISON
D: Dont move, stay on the ground. Give me the phone. Give it to me! Larry?
E: He sits up a bit, carefully slides it to her. He is watching her, looking for an opportunity to overcome her once again. She picks the phone up, still keeping her eyes and her gun at him.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ally! Honey, are you all right?
C: ALISON
D: No! No were not... Get down! Larry, where are you?
E: Zep starts to move up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens him more fiercely with the gun.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I dont know. Im being held captive in a room somewhere.
E: unsure himself
C: ALISON
D: What? What are you talking about?
E: disbelief; she sniffles a bit
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im so sorry, Ally.
E: starting to cry
C: ALISON
D: Honey, we need you here.
E: desperate Zep slowly readies himself to move forward, wide eyes still staring at Alison.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im sorry for everything. Its my fault. Please forgive me. Ive always been happy with you.
E: crying, apologizing
C: DIANA
D: Mommy!
E: cries out
N: Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues to scream.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ally!
E: panicked
N: Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window. Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ally!
E: screams Adam watches him with wide eyes.
N: The shot cuts back into the bedroom.
C: DIANA
D: Mommy, help me!
N: The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.
C: TAPP
D: Freeze!
N: Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can only imagine what hes hearing. Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.
C: TAPP
D: What the fuck?
E: trying to fix his gun
N: Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.
C: ZEP
D: Mrs. Gordon? Diana?! Im gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming.
E: drops old cartridge out of his gun, pops in a new one His breathing is fast, desperate. He clutches the wound on his leg.
N: Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he starts to panic.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence! Lawrence, get up!
E: A bit of foamy spittle comes out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution continues, and then a moment later stops. Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence is out.
T: CUT TO
N: Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can. Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what to do, panicking. Lawrence cant be dead, he cant be alone in here. He cant handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence! Get up! I need you! Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead!
E: crying out, close to tears He leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor, throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit him. He leans down, picks up another, throws it. This one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence starts to move more, reaching for his head and sitting up. Adam cries out in relief.
C: LAWRENCE
D: He...he electrocuted me...
E: sits up, dazed and confused
C: ADAM
D: I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?
N: Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. Suddenly, he snaps.
C: LAWRENCE
D: FUCK THIS SHIT!!
E: screaming
N: Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall. In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing what to do. Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall. Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing.
C: LAWRENCE
D: No!!!!
E: He lowers his head and cries loudly.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence, calm down. There must be a way out of this!
E: Frightened but trying to stay calm for Lawrence. It seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from the beginning, where Adam was the one freaking out and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, who has just lost it.
C: LAWRENCE
D: I cant be calm! My family needs me! No, God!
E: screaming He cries and screams, still cant get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage. Adams hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his cool but having a very hard time.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence, I have a family too! I dont see them, thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id like to fix!
E: Loudly trying to speak over Lawrences continued loud, primal screams.
N: Cut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
C: TAPP
D: Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
N: Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence, stop it!
E: desperate, losing his attempted calm stance
N: Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence, please calm down! Theres a way out of here, theres a way out!
E: sobs in his voice
N: Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely loses it and freaks out, screaming.
C: ADAM
D: Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you doing?!
N: Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward a bit. Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former detective. Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks at it. Adam watches him in terror.
C: ADAM
D: What are you doing?!
E: screaming/crying Lawrence crawls on farther, towards the body.
N: Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapps chest. Tapp remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding the gun up at a diagonal. Tapps eyes flutter, then finally close. Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down another hall. Back in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the gun, opens the chamber.
C: ADAM
D: What are you...
E: He suddenly realizes Lawrences intentions. His eyes go wide, and he starts to cry out and beg.
C: ADAM
D: Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! No! Lawrence, please, Im begging you! Lawrence, its not me who did this to you!
E: Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes the chamber Lawrence aims the gun at Adam
C: LAWRENCE
D: You have to die.
E: looking like Death, his voice hoarse
C: ADAM
D: No, I want to live!
E: His hands up in front of him defensively, moving side to side to try to throw off Lawrences aim
C: LAWRENCE
D: Im sorry...
E: moving the gun along with Adams movements
C: ADAM
D: I want to live!
C: LAWRENCE
D: My family...
E: he aims and pulls the trigger, hitting Adam in the upper chest area. Adam falls down forward onto the floor, his screams stop.
N: Lawrence collapses, sobbing. Then he sits up a bit, turning to the surveillance camera and screaming.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Ive done it! Now show them to me!
E: he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his forehead to the floor.
N: Cut to the Gordons neighbors living room. Alison paces back and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. Two neighbors sit off to the side on a couch with Diana.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Thank you very much, Officer.
E: OS, on phone
C: ALISON
D: Larry?
E: on cell phone
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Did you get through to him?
E: hanging up the phone and going over to Alison
C: ALISON
D: Theres still no answer.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Its all right. Ive called the police. Everythings okay.
E: reassuringly
N: Alison goes and sits on the couch. Diana comes up to her, and Alison embraces her daughter. Cut back to the bathroom, with a shot of the sliding door. The sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard. Lawrence pushes himself up into a kneeling position, a look of shock on his face. The door slides open and there stands Zep, green mist behind him in the hallway. Lawrence turns and sees him. Zeps eyes dart around the room, seeming to say What the fuck happened in here? He sees Lawrence on the floor, and an eager look comes into his eyes. He walks in, and Lawrence starts to yell at him.
C: LAWRENCE
D: You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill you! Ill fucking kill you!
E: Lawrence grabs Zeps leg as he passes but is too weak and Zep pulls away, looking down at him, moving over to the other side of the body Lawrence quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up the gun, pulling the trigger several times, but there are no more bullets. It just clicks.
N: Zep goes over to Adam, pushing his side with his foot a couple of times, but to no reaction. He then looks to Lawrence and aims his gun at him, shaking his head.
C: ZEP
D: Youre too late.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Why?
E: weakly
C: ZEP
D: Its the rules.
N: Zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly Adam comes to and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. The back of Zeps head hits the floor hard. Adam pulls him towards him, struggles to get the gun from Zeps hand, screaming. The gun goes off once off to the side. Adam moves Zeps arm back and forth, and it goes off again. Finally, Adam slams Zeps arm down and gets the gun away from him, tossing it away. He slugs Zep hard across the face, stunning him. Lawrence starts crawling towards them. Screaming like a madman, Adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto Zeps head as hard as he can. He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in half. Lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for Adams arm as Adam brings the broken lid down again. Lawrence grabs his arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. Lawrence moves in, touching his head to Adams.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Youre going to be all right. Youre just wounded in the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
E: his voice very weak and shaky Adam stops sobbing for a moment
C: ADAM
D: Dont leave me! No!
E: grasping Lawrences shirt, begging.
N: Lawrence nods, pulling away from him and starts to crawl off. Adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away.
C: ADAM
D: No!! No! No! Lawrence! Lawrence!
E: he keeps crying Lawrence crawls towards the door.
C: LAWRENCE
D: Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone back, I promise.
E: he pauses, turns to look back at Adam He continues crawling on, out the door while Adam watches him pathetically, still crying and reaching out for him.
N: Lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down the hall. Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. Adam looks to the door one more time then turns to Zeps body. He pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.
C: ADAM
D: Key...key...
E: thinking
N: He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. It is Jigsaws voice.
C: JIGSAW
D: Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called you around the hospital: Zep. I want you to make a choice. Theres a slow-acting poison coursing through your system which only I have the antidote for. Will you murder and mother and her child to save yourself? Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.
E: VO shot of Zep in the hospital with his cleaning cart, stopping at Johns room Shot of the closet doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana screaming, Alison coming in and seeing him looming over her.

Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video as he says
N: Back to the shot of Adam staring at him, shocked. Suddenly, Adam looks down, grabs Zeps gun and aims for John. But before he can pull the trigger John holds out the remote for the electricity and starts to electrocute Adam, who starts jerking around and drops the gun. As he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with a shot of Adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then Lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and ending with Adam stretched out on top of Zep, spasming still from the electrocution. Suddenly the electricity stops and he gasps, raspy loud breathing. John turns away, starts towards the door. Adam can only watch after him.
C: JOHN
D: Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
E: VO John turns off the lights at the door, only the green lighting from the hallway illuminating him and then Adam just barely. John moves out the door, slowly. Adam reaches out for him and screams. John turns around and takes the door handle, starting to slide it shut.
N: Adam SCREAMS as loud as he can in terror and despair as John pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says
C: JOHN
D: GAME OVER.
N: John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Dont!!! over and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by the ending titles and instrumental music. THE END
