M: SHOOTING DRAFT
S: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT (1970)
N: Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE JR. Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:
C: JOE STEVENS
D: Your mother okay?
C: JOE JR.
D: Yes, sir.
N: They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear me?
E: firm, without irony
N: Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: You hear me, goddam it?
E: continuing
N: The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: What do you want for Christmas?
E: continuing; charged up
C: JOE JR.
D: I don't know.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: You don't know?? You gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it.
E: light changes; he accelerates
N: A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: Wait here. This won't take a minute.
E: continuing
N: Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat. The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say..."). The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes on the glass, fogging the scene. From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE. Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then: His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't notice: The liquor store door opens behind him. A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees.
C: JOE JR.
D: Daddy!!
N: He jumps from the car, kneels by his father. The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, bleeding profusely.
C: STORE OWNER
D: Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...
E: enraged, almost to tears
N: JOE STEVENS looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.
C: JOE STEVENS
D: Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks. I'm sorry...
E: looks up at his son
N: He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at... THE STORE OWNER Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move.
C: JOE JR.
D: Please, Mister...
N: The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows. Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS EYES:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: THOSE SAME EYES -- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a paper before him. TITLE: 17 YEARS LATER CLOSEUP - THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY Hundreds of TRUE/FALSE questions... 1.) I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices. (T/F) 2.) I have often felt that strangers were looking at me critically. (T/F) 3.) When I was young I occasionally stole things. (T/F) Joe Stevens marks these TRUE, FALSE, FALSE then comes to: 4.) A person's station in life is at least partially determined by his race. (T/F) We are:
S: INT. A ROOM - DAY
N: Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, including Joe) are taking the MMPI. Some roll their eyes at the questions. Some try to copy answers. Others, like Joe, work with rapid concentration. But he gets stuck on #4. Marks it false. Erases it. Marks it true. Erases that. Ponders. Goes on to: #5. At times I hear so well it bothers me. (T/F) He marks that true.
S: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
N: GERALD CARVER, 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the ingratiating BLACK OFFICER sitting across the desk from him.
C: CARVER
D: Officer Leland? You know the difference between a black man and nigger?
N: Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the interview. He smiles weakly, shakes his head no.
C: CARVER
D: Yeah, most niggers don't.
E: continuing; pleasant smile
N: Stung, Leland tries to laugh. Carver puts his file aside, picks up another.
C: CARVER
D: Nice to meet you.
E: continuing
S: INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
N: A SECOND BLACK OFFICER is powerfully built, politically conscious, takes no shit. Carver's leafing through his file.
C: CARVER
D: So, Winston, what's the difference between a black man and a nigger?
N: Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and hisses into his face:
C: WINSTON
D: Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
N: Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist.
C: CARVER
D: Thanks for coming in.
N: Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out. Carver picks up the next file, unfazed.
S: INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
N: Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for an answer. When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds Stevens looking right back at him.
C: STEVENS
D: The nigger's the one who falls for your bullshit.
N: He says it pleasantly, without belligerence. Carver smiles: he's found his man. He offers his hand.
C: CARVER
D: Gerald Carver, United States District Attorney. Call me Gerry.
S: INT. A DARKENED ROOM - DAY/NIGHT
N: ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The light from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens. On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner.
C: STEVENS
D: He ought to be wearing a sign.
C: CARVER
D: You can tell he's a cop?
N: Stevens laughs: it's obvious. A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: "You got it?" DEALER: "In the motel, right over here..." The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.
C: STEVENS
D: He keeps looking for his back-up. Now, the other guy knows it, too.
C: CARVER
D: Then why's he taking him to the room?
C: STEVENS
D: To rip him off.
E: why else?
N: Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed. ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION. A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA wobbles after him.
C: STEVENS
D: Too late.
E: continuing
N: ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.
C: TAFT
D: Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus... Get an ambulance -- and back up. Now!
E: to the CAMERA
N: He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face.
C: STEVENS
D: Who is he?
E: focussed on Taft
C: CARVER
D: Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.
C: STEVENS
D: He's a good cop.
C: CARVER
D: He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest.
N: Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.
C: STEVENS
D: But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something new...
N: He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. Hull. No photos.
C: STEVENS
D: Who's John Hull?
E: continuing
C: CARVER
D: You are. If you want to be. Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig. I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years...
E: off Stevens indicates dead cop on TV
C: STEVENS
D: What does he have to do?
C: CARVER
D: Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information.
C: STEVENS
D: He's a snitch.
C: CARVER
D: He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side. I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher.
E: beat
C: STEVENS
D: I can't do that. I've got a wife and kids.
E: uncomfortable
C: CARVER
D: You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.
N: Stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain.
C: STEVENS
D: All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs.
E: almost a confession
C: CARVER
D: Come on, a little grass...?
E: tolerant
C: STEVENS
D: Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink. Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my life.
E: his motto
C: CARVER
D: What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that. I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.
E: off Stevens' surprise, Carver grins
C: STEVENS
D: It's not that simple.
C: CARVER
D: I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft.
E: opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly
C: STEVENS
D: I don't believe that.
N: But he does.
C: CARVER
D: You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal. "Resents authority..."
E: looks at MMPI results reading
C: STEVENS
D: I do not.
C: CARVER
D: "...Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system." Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale...
C: STEVENS
D: Let me see that...
N: Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.
C: CARVER
D: Why'd you join the force?
C: STEVENS
D: I wanted to be of use.
E: awkward, but felt
C: CARVER
D: Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting. There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...
E: sits back
N: Indicates dead body on TV.
C: STEVENS
D: Why would I be different?
C: CARVER
D: You already are, that's the point... You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this game.
E: indicates file, test scores
N: Stevens raises his eyebrows: what?
C: CARVER
D: Don't blow your cover.
E: continuing
S: EXT. WORKING CLASS CLEVELAND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
N: Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he gets out, he spots a GROUP OF KIDS (black and Hispanic) playing down the street. He's not pleased about that.
C: STEVENS
D: Joe-J, Carmen...
E: calls to them
N: A BOY, 7, and a GIRL, 5, (both light-skinned) run to him shouting, "Daddy," jump into his arms, competing for attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages.
C: STEVENS
D: What were you doing with those kids?
N: JOE-J & CARMEN Playing...
C: STEVENS
D: Your mom lets you play with them?
E: displeased
N: JOE-J & CARMEN Yes, sir... Yes, sir. His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly. Meanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other.
C: STEVENS
D: I thought we talked about this. The older brother up there's got a sheet with --
C: TERRY
D: Lay off it. They're just kids...
N: Both are ready to fight, but restrain themselves. A big Polynesian, TITO comes out the door.
C: TITO
D: Hey, Joe.
C: STEVENS
D: Tito...
N: A moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry. She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed.
S: INT. KITCHEN - FIVE MINUTES LATER
N: Stevens is trying to seem interested in Carmen's little drawings.
C: STEVENS
D: They're real nice, honey. Is that a horse?
C: CARMEN
D: Daddy! It's a bunny...
E: exasperated
N: She puts her arms around him.
C: CARMEN
D: I don't want you to go away, Daddy.
E: continuing
C: STEVENS
D: It's my work. I've got to.
N: Over her shoulder he sees Terry sitting with a subdued Joe- J. Her face seems to say, "See, I told you..." Avoiding this accusation, Stevens notices a bruise on Carmen's arm.
C: STEVENS
D: What happened to you there, baby?
E: continuing
C: CARMEN
D: Tito did it.
C: STEVENS
D: He hit you?! God damn it, what's he doing touching her? I'm gonna...
E: instantly outraged up in a fury
N: Terry intercepts him on his way out of the room.
C: TERRY
D: She was running behind his chair when he got up. It was an accident. A complete... total... accident.
E: he's uncertain
N: Stevens looks at Carmen who giggles. He's humiliated by his own temper, attempts to calm himself. Terry puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - DAY
N: The immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the blinding light. We DESCEND...
S: INT. TRAIN STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY OR NIGHT
N: People getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now known as JOHN HULL. He's carrying a suitcase.
S: INT. TRAIN STATION/EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street.
S: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY
N: South L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease, looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters.
S: EXT. TRANSIENT MOTEL - COURTYARD - DAY
N: A fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) leads Hull down a corridor.
C: BLONDE WOMAN
D: Television mostly. I was on "Sky King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle." That was a silly show. The jungle was mostly flats...
N: They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.
C: BLONDE WOMAN
D: You want my advice, I'd stay away from that bitch.
E: continuing
N: She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges in the doorway. He closes the door.
S: INT. ROOM - DAY
N: Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions. (NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he "really" is.)
S: EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT
N: On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new
T: haircut.
S: EXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY
N: Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, reciting his version of an old street toast.
C: EDDIE
D: On the day of the King's castration, all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with Georgia Tech taking turns in the back seat...
N: Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for money. Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We always recognize him, but each time he's different. He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. But he sees them and is seen.
S: INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT
N: Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts out money for him.
S: INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
N: He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little James play in the courtyard.
S: EXT. STREET - EVENING
N: Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.
C: HULL
D: Whatta you got?
C: 13-YEAR-OLD DEALER
D: Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent shit.
E: voice just changing
N: Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks off. He has gone twenty feet when... RED RANGE ROVER SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer. A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 13-year-old.
C: IVY
D: What the fuck I tell you about being here?
N: Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.
C: 13-YEAR-OLD DEALER
D: No, wait...
E: O.S.
C: IVY
D: Too fuckin' late.
E: O.S.
N: POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone on the street but Hull has hit the ground.
C: IVY
D: Get down, motherfuckers!
E: enjoying it, shouting
N: Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered around... THE 13-YEAR-OLD lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) watch with a variety of emotions.
C: CROWD
D: Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?... Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong fuckin' place... That poor boy... Get his beeper...
N: Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.
C: EDDIE
D: He done done, ain't he?
E: sadly
S: EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
N: TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.
S: INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
N: A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long red nails) greets him familiarly.
C: BARTENDER
D: How's it going, John?
C: HULL
D: I'm in there.
N: Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee. Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts.
C: EDDIE
D: "Where's the Queen," said the King. "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is that bastard still in town?... Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their utmost... Pina colada times two and a white wine.
E: to himself to the bartender
N: He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like any crankhead. He notices Hull, greets him as someone he can't place but knows he's seen around.
C: EDDIE
D: How you doin', Dudley...
E: continuing
N: Tries to remember name.
C: HULL
D: John.
C: EDDIE
D: John, man, right...
N: Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to... A TABLE where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good- looking). She gets the wine. Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.
S: INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: (NOTE: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.) More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.
C: HULL
D: Eddie something... a motormouth... he supplies the street dealers... buys from him... David Elias... who apparently buys from a guy named Barbolla or something. But I haven't seen him.
E: reads name on back of photo
N: Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins it on the board above Elias.
C: CARVER
D: Barbosa, Felix.
C: HULL
D: There was also a woman, but she's not here. I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen at the most. Turf war.
E: as Carver reaches in a drawer
N: Carver shrugs: these things happen. He hands Hull a lot of cash, much more than expected. Hull does understand.
C: CARVER
D: Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.
C: HULL
D: You can't rush this stuff.
C: CARVER
D: Rush it, please. I want art, John, not reality. Budget hearings start in April, and I need Gallegos by then. They won't give us funding for three ounce buys.
C: HULL
D: We're not just doing this for the funding, are we?
C: CARVER
D: Without funding, we aren't doing it at all.
N: TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
S: INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
N: Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year- old sits against a wall too stoned even for television. Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each other now.
C: EDDIE
D: My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...
N: Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat. The patrons are making fun of Brokaw, laughing, exchanging fives.
C: HULL
D: Eddie, man, I need...
N: Eddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait. His mind is elsewhere. His features contract in brief concentration.
C: CHORUS OF COMMENTS
D: Whatever happened to that Drug Czar motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause he finally realized he didn't know nothing about any of that shit...
N: More laughter, etc. Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off into a sigh and a smile. Eddie sings a satisfied little song... The redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a year ago. Eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, declines. The others continue to watch and comment on the speech.
C: EDDIE
D: So what is it you need so bad, blood? Need, need, need??
C: HULL
D: A whole K, quick as you can get it.
C: EDDIE
D: Comin' in the world, Dudley.
E: impressed, a trace of envy
C: HULL
D: All because of my man...
E: winning grin
N: Eddie likes that, holds out a hand. Hull hits it.
C: EDDIE
D: Give me a day.
N: Hull nods, rises.
C: EDDIE
D: Stick around, let the bitch Hoover you, too.
E: continuing
N: Indicating redhead. In all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror, but here the effort costs him. He masters his disgust with a joke.
C: HULL
D: Only if you Clorox him first.
N: Everyone laughs, even the boy.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Eddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape). He's in his mid- 40s, stocky, balding.
C: TAFT
D: Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?
E: cheerful, gregarious
N: Eddie breaks free, runs three feet before HERNANDEZ (a muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin. Eddie crumples.
C: TAFT
D: Eddie, I don't think I introduced you to my new partner, Michael Hernandez...
E: continuing
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface...
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Eddie folded over his wounded nuts. Hernandez and Taft sit on crates to either side. The drugs they've taken from him are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: You have the right to remain silent... You have the right to an attorney... You have the right to go back to Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second offense...
C: EDDIE
D: Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I just can't.
E: in several kinds of pain
C: TAFT
D: 'Course you can't, child, 'course you can't. That's why you're gonna start giving us some help.
E: soothing
S: EXT. DAVID ELIAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: A pleasant, Santa Monica neighborhood. Spanish style house.
S: INT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Pleasant, tasteful. Elias's wife, NANCY, (dressed like the attorney she is) sits in an alcove-study reading a real estate contract through half-glasses. Elias himself is helping his daughter, MIRANDA, 7, with her homework. He is 38, with the body and bearing of a powerful man.
C: ELIAS
D: Again. Three times four.
C: MIRANDA
D: Seven.
N: Elias is not a sweet Daddy. It should make us uncomfortable to watch him push his daughter.
C: ELIAS
D: No. You're adding again, you have to multiply. Three and four is seven. Three times four is...
C: MIRANDA
D: Twelve.
C: ELIAS
D: Three times five.
N: The DOORBELL.
C: NANCY
D: Can you get that?
C: MIRANDA
D: Eight.
C: ELIAS
D: Damn it.
E: getting up; more about the answer than the door
C: MIRANDA
D: Why can't I just use a calculator?
S: INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
N: Three men: FELIX BARBOSA (whose photo we saw in Carver's office). Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, unstable. With him is GOPHER, early 60s, a wizened high-voiced old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs, for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can say anything he wants without fear. Behind them is an Hispanic kid, CHINO, 17, a thug. Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his door.
C: ELIAS
D: What are you doing here?
C: BARBOSA
D: We've got a problem, David.
C: ELIAS
D: Call me on the phone.
C: BARBOSA
D: Your friend Eddie just started bending over for the cops.
N: This is very bad news. Elias murmurs a shaken, "Shit..." and steps outside, half-closing the door behind him.
C: BARBOSA
D: They busted him, and he's dealing to save his ass.
E: continuing
C: GOPHER
D: Which is how he'll lose the skinny little thing.
C: ELIAS
D: Did he give us up?
C: BARBOSA
D: Not yet, but he will if he has to, and eventually he'll have to.
C: MIRANDA
D: Daddy! I thought we were doing my homework.
E: O.S.
C: ELIAS
D: I don't think he'd talk about us. He'd try not to.
C: BARBOSA
D: If we whack him, he definitely won't.
C: MIRANDA
D: Daddy!!
E: O.S.
C: ELIAS
D: Just a second. Not yet. Let me check on this, first.
E: to Miranda to Barbosa
C: BARBOSA
D: Nobody said you had to do the dirty work, David. I'll take care of --
E: taunting
C: ELIAS
D: Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill him. I'll kill him myself.
N: He doesn't realize until it's too late that Nancy has just then opened the front door to see where he went. They look at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does, hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself for that.
C: ELIAS
D: Nancy, get out of here.
E: continuing
C: NANCY
D: For you; it's Eddie.
N: She hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door.
C: BARBOSA
D: You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder you don't want us coming here.
C: ELIAS
D: Don't talk about her that way.
E: warning him
N: Barbosa laughs.
C: GOPHER
D: He can't help it, David, it's his nature.
C: ELIAS
D: Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need?
E: into phone, chipper
S: INT. A BOXING GYM - NIGHT
N: Elias joins Eddie and Hull to one side. In the b.g. two guys sparring.
C: EDDIE
D: David, this is John, John, David. Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready?
C: HULL
D: So what's this, you want to meet me?
E: to Elias
C: ELIAS
D: I like to know the important customers.
E: charming, touch of mockery
N: Hull makes a show of weary patience, gestures: here I am.
C: ELIAS
D: You're taking a lot of weight for a guy we hardly know. Where're you moving this stuff, John? We haven't seen you around. We like to have a sense who your customers are.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the Gimbel motherfuckers?
C: ELIAS
D: Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop.
E: beat; watches him
N: He gets up, walks away. ON HULL He's blown it. He's been made. The crushing failure. He rallies himself to indignation.
C: HULL
D: What is this shit, Eddie? I thought you were the man.
N: Eddie's sickened, wants to get paid, owes Taft a bust.
C: EDDIE
D: Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your place. I'll call you.
S: EXT. GYM/INT. A VAN - CONTINUOUS TIME
N: Taft and Hernandez, watching the gym. Hull comes out, looks up and down the street carefully. Taft sits up, pays attention.
C: TAFT
D: This is our collar?
N: Hernandez grunts.
C: TAFT
D: Who is he?
E: continuing
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Some scumbag...
N: But Taft clearly thinks there's something different about Hull. He's not sure what, but it troubles him. (NOTE: Hull makes a little move that Taft will later realize was a cop's move. For now he can't quite place it.)
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS TIME
N: Eddie pleading his case to Elias.
C: EDDIE
D: He's no cop, David. He's an animal. You see his eyes? You never see a cop with those eyes. I know this shit, man, you don't.
C: ELIAS
D: What's going on, Eddie?
E: giving him an opening
C: EDDIE
D: Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We need it, David. We're behind.
N: Elias studies Eddie: is he a rat? Elias hopes not, but he's going to find out. He hands a fat Federal Express envelope through the window.
C: ELIAS
D: I want him to get it all, Eddie.
E: a warning
N: Eddie bows in gratitude, hurries off.
S: EXT./INT. HULL'S MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Hull's unlocking his door when Belinda, the hooker across the hall, comes out to talk. Her 6-year-old, James, watches, silent.
C: BELINDA
D: Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull...
E: a crackhead
C: HULL
D: What's happening, Belinda?
E: wearily
C: BELINDA
D: Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the welfare this afternoon, but the bus, you know what I'm saying?... the one bus, and then the other, and when I got there they'd gone and changed the time on me, without notification. They's supposed to give notification, ain't they? They said I got a thing in the mail, but I don't remember, I don't think they sent it, so now I'm off the welfare, plus I forgot to take James for his shot... for the school? Which otherwise they let him go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell him, so's he can better hisself.
N: Hull slouches in the doorway, fingers to his eyes.
C: HULL
D: You had any food today, James?
E: to James
C: JAMES
D: I had Ding-Dongs.
E: disclaiming any need
C: HULL
D: You go to the Mexican place over there, and get the chicken tostada or the beef and bean burrito or both. And a milk.
E: sighs, gives him money
C: JAMES
D: I don't like milk. I want a --
C: HULL
D: You get the milk! And get something for your mother, too. What do you want?
E: an order to Belinda
C: BELINDA
D: Now, Mr. Hull, if you just --
C: HULL
D: Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.
E: to James
N: Gives him another bill. The boy runs off.
C: BELINDA
D: You now, I look out for my James best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard. Now you like the boy, don't you?
N: Hull grunts.
C: BELINDA
D: I know you do. And I was thinkin' if you wanted to take care of him, that might be good for him. Give him a male figure to look up to.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Look, Belinda, I can't...
C: BELINDA
D: If you could just give me something for him. Say five thousand dollars... Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't give up my boy for less than four thousand...
E: off Hull's shock
N: Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing PAY PHONE. He runs down the hall, grabs it.
C: HULL
D: It's me. I'm here... Where?... five minutes.
N: He dashes past Belinda into his room.
C: BELINDA
D: Or you could just give me a part now...
N: He closes the door, takes the money Carver gave him out from behind the mirror, dashes back outside. As he rushes by:
C: BELINDA
D: Let me do somethin' for you, Mr. Hull. Let me do a little somethin' for you.
E: continuing
N: He keeps going. The Blonde Woman addresses Belinda.
C: BLONDE WOMAN
D: No solicitin' in the halls. I told you that before.
C: BELINDA
D: I ain't doin' shit. Bitch...
E: spunkier than we've seen
S: EXT. TACO STAND - VENICE AND LA BREA - NIGHT
N: A handful of customers under a mud sky. The THROB of a distant helicopter. Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's BMW. He climbs into the BMW, tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money spills onto his lap. Eddie does a quick count, produces the Fed Ex envelope. The usual white stuff. Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden blinding overhead light. A BULLHORN booms down like the voice of God.
C: AMPLIFIED VOICE
D: This is the police. Remain inside the vehicle. Place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible...
C: HULL
D: Christ...
C: EDDIE
D: Spread the floor, Dudley. A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga...
E: a strategy rap sound effects with rhythmic head spasms
N: Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door as the BMW races across the lot. Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand. Hull can't reach his car. He vaults a metal rail and runs off between two buildings. Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. Taft speeds the car out onto the street. HULL running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him. As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right into his face. Hull goes down hard.
C: TAFT
D: Thank you kindly...
E: into car radio
N: He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air. Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope.
C: TAFT
D: How you doin', child?...
E: continuing
N: Hull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him, the man he remembers from the videotape. He tries to speak:
C: HULL
D: You...
E: barely audible
C: TAFT
D: Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?
E: briefly puzzled
N: Hull shakes head, winces.
C: TAFT
D: Hurts, huh?
E: continuing
N: Hull tries to curse.
C: TAFT
D: Here, I want to show you something. You have kids?
E: continuing
N: He takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight.
C: TAFT
D: These are mine. Aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw?
E: continuing
N: Hull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything.
C: TAFT
D: Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you speechless. So let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could?
E: continuing
N: Hull just looks up.
C: TAFT
D: Me, too. And you're the bastard with the gun.
E: continuing
N: He takes the Fed Ex envelope from him.
C: HULL
D: You know the difference between a nigger and a black man?
E: hoarse; his first words
C: TAFT
D: Don't jive me, boy.
C: HULL
D: The nigger's the one covers Whitey's ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.
N: Taft yanks him hard to his feet; Hull cries out in pain.
C: TAFT
D: You ain't my brother.
S: INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT
N: Hull is led in with other handcuffed PRISONERS. Carver is here, catches Hull's eye. Hull shakes his head; doesn't want Carver to intercede. A woman PUBLIC DEFENDER (26, attractive, harried) addresses the prisoners.
C: PUBLIC DEFENDER
D: Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the Public Defender's office can...
N: Hull is listening to this when a BAILIFF taps his shoulder.
C: BAILIFF
D: You've got counsel. Over there.
N: Puzzled, Hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a PROSECUTOR. The suit turns. It's DAVID ELIAS who smiles, offers his hand. Hull is stunned. Elias enjoys that.
C: HULL
D: You're a lawyer??
C: ELIAS
D: I'm your lawyer.
C: HULL
D: Who hired you?
C: ELIAS
D: It's pro bono. If you don't want me, there's Shelley. She's good. She just can't provide special services...
E: smiles
C: HULL
D: Like what?
C: VOICE
D: John Hull...
E: O.S. calling the next case
C: ELIAS
D: Getting your case called first.
N: Elias addressing the court.
C: ELIAS
D: Your Honor, I believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was Mannitol, a baby laxative. We move for immediate dismissal.
E: continuing
N: Hull is surprised at this news. The Judge looks to the
T: Prosecutor who waives objection. Gavel.
C: ELIAS
D: We're out of here, Dude.
E: continuing; to Hull
N: As they walk toward the back, Taft approaches Hull. There's already a deep pull between these two, and in Taft's presence, Hull can't sustain the tough street act. We almost see the little boy inside him.
C: TAFT
D: Baby laxative, they sold you some bad shit.
E: to Hull, amused
C: DRUNKEN PRISONER
D: You have a constipated baby, and you're in jail? What kind of a father are you?
E: to Hull
C: TAFT
D: A father who don't know his own children, ain't that right?
N: A long look between them, broken when Elias takes Hull's arm, leads him away. Elias cheerfully greets a couple of hookers waiting arraignment. Hull furtively grabs his sleeve.
C: HULL
D: You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.
E: under his breath
C: ELIAS
D: If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be in jail right now... Come on, I want you to meet some people.
E: under his
S: EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
N: After hours. The place is closed. A couple of cars in the lot. Elias's BMW pulls in.
S: INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
N: Deserted except for one table where Eddie, Barbosa, Gopher and Chino are eating shrimp. They look up as Hull and Elias approach. Eddie's astonished to see Hull.
C: EDDIE
D: Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley...
C: ELIAS
D: Surprised to see him, Eddie?
N: Eddie looks around, uneasy.
C: ELIAS
D: John got busted and kept his mouth shut. Can't say that for everybody, can we?
E: continuing
C: EDDIE
D: What are you saying? Are you saying me? Are you saying something about me?
C: GOPHER
D: Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable. It's all you got left.
C: EDDIE
D: Shut up, you little faggot.
C: ELIAS
D: The cops made you give them somebody. We know it.
N: Eddie looks around. Everybody's looking at him. He considers lying, but realizes it's pointless.
C: EDDIE
D: All right, so what? I mean, so what, man? You got the money. Twenty-six G. Twenty-six, David. Count it.
C: ELIAS
D: Next time you might trade us.
C: EDDIE
D: Never. Never, Felix, never. Come on, man, you know I'd never...
E: turns to Barbosa
N: Hull observes Barbosa become the power center.
C: BARBOSA
D: I know you never will.
E: softly
C: EDDIE
D: Felix, no. Don't be... I'm worth money to you. Let me give you money.
C: BARBOSA
D: Why? You don't owe me anything.
C: EDDIE
D: Another twenty-six grand... Just to show you... Fifty.
C: BARBOSA
D: Why not a hundred?
C: EDDIE
D: A hundred??? Felix...
E: that's so much
N: Barbosa's impassive.
C: EDDIE
D: Okay, a hundred.
E: continuing
C: BARBOSA
D: Give it.
C: EDDIE
D: Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours.
C: BARBOSA
D: Now. Ten seconds.
C: EDDIE
D: Felix, I need time. I --
C: BARBOSA
D: One... two...
C: EDDIE
D: I don't have it right now. But I can --
C: GOPHER
D: Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you for what you said to me.
E: sadly
C: EDDIE
D: Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning.
E: pleading
C: BARBOSA
D: Six... seven... You want to do it, David?
E: to Elias
N: Elias looks stricken. Barbosa laughs. Eddie jumps up. Hull turns away, can't bear to watch this.
C: BARBOSA
D: Nine...
E: continuing
N: EDDIE grabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and plunges it into Barbosa's neck. As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone. Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied sack. Elias can't help gasping. Hull looks away, hiding his horror. Barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the body.
C: BARBOSA
D: Piece of shit!
N: Elias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed. Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe. Barbosa turns to Hull.
C: BARBOSA
D: What'd you think?
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: At least it was clean.
C: BARBOSA
D: What about you, bar mitzvah body? First time you saw somebody die?
E: pleased, to Elias
C: ELIAS
D: No. At camp... when I was fourteen... a friend of mine was water skiing... The motorboat ran him over... A junior counsellor was driving.
E: eyes fixed on the body catching breath
C: BARBOSA
D: You should kill a man some day, David, it's liberating... Summer camp. I'm in business with somebody who went to summer camp.
E: walking out
N: Everyone else is silent, grave.
S: INT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
N: Through sliders we see a small pool. Elias and Hull sit over uneaten omelets. Both still shaken by the previous scene.
C: ELIAS
D: Eddie, man... He was always nice to my daughter.
C: HULL
D: How'd a guy like you get into this?
C: ELIAS
D: The way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and I had to move it. Soon I was doing more dealing than law. But this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end.
C: HULL
D: Yeah. And now...?
C: ELIAS
D: The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a dying business.
C: HULL
D: Then what are we doing here?
C: ELIAS
D: People are always going to want to get high. Every society has ways to alter consciousness.
C: HULL
D: Because they can't bear reality.
C: ELIAS
D: We all need our delusions, only the means change: psychedelics, opiates, prayer, orgies, human sacrifice...
E: smiles
C: HULL
D: What's next?
N: Elias puts a finger to his lips.
C: HULL
D: Why aren't you selling it?
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: I know how to make it and market it. But I need capital. That's the only reason I'm hanging out with an asshole like Barbosa. And because I can't get to the big guys.
E: feels his hatred of Barbosa
C: HULL
D: Who are the big guys?
C: ELIAS
D: Gallegos, et cetera.
C: HULL
D: Why can't you get to them?
E: reacts to the name
C: ELIAS
D: What do you care?
N: Hull shrugs: he doesn't.
C: ELIAS
D: Anyway, designer drugs have a bad name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a limited market for Parkinson's disease. But what about completely safe, almost legal, terrific shit you can go to work on and do your job better than you ever did it straight?
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Sounds like a dream.
N: They hear someone coming.
C: ELIAS
D: In dreams begin responsibilities.
E: closing the subject
C: HULL
D: Tell me about this new shit.
C: ELIAS
D: Some other time, John, when we know each other better. Hey, bunnela. Five times two.
E: as Miranda enters kitchen she snuggles against him; Elias enjoys it
C: MIRANDA
D: It's too early. Don't bother me.
N: He hugs her, kisses her, much more openly affectionate than Hull was with his own children. Hull notices that.
C: MIRANDA
D: Seven.
E: continuing; head in her father's chest
N: Elias whispers in her ear.
C: MIRANDA
D: Oh, yeah... Ten... Who's he?
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: That's my friend, John. This is Miranda.
C: HULL
D: Hi, Miranda.
N: Miranda gives Hull a shy greeting. Nancy hurries into the kitchen, handsome, busy, ready for work.
C: NANCY
D: Come on, honey...
C: ELIAS
D: Nancy, this is John.
N: Nancy nods briefly in Hull's direction. Elias kisses Miranda who grabs the back-pack her mother proffers, and they go out. When they're gone:
C: ELIAS
D: That's not about you. It's, she's... judgmental about what I do.
E: continuing; on Nancy's chilliness
N: When they're gone, he opens louvered doors onto a washer/dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to Hull. Hull looks inside. White powder. He tastes. Real. He hefts the bag.
C: HULL
D: That's more than I bought.
C: ELIAS
D: Half we owe you. The other half's on consignment. A token of our esteem.
C: HULL
D: You're having trouble moving it.
N: Elias doesn't deny it.
C: HULL
D: Make me your partner. I'll help you get your capital.
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: I don't need a partner. I need a salesman.
S: INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Now in daylight. Two separately wrapped kilograms of crack cocaine on the green blotter.
C: CARVER
D: I can't buy this much shit. I haven't got it in the budget.
C: HULL
D: What am I supposed to do with it?
C: CARVER
D: You're a drug dealer, John. Deal drugs.
N: Hull just looks at him. Carver doesn't blink.
C: HULL
D: You know how this goes, Gerry. It won't stop here. You know what they're going to ask me to do pretty soon, to prove I'm down. What am I supposed to do then?
C: CARVER
D: Don't blow your Carver.
N: Hull: a moment of horror as he realizes what Carver is saying. MUSIC -- A DRUG DEALING SEQUENCE
S: INT. HULL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: He's filling glass vials with crack. Hundreds of them. It's tedious work. He spills some, curses. He stops. He can't believe he's doing this. He goes on doing it.
C: CARVER
D: You're still thinking like a cop, John. Forget that. Cross the line. Be what you are. You're a criminal. You don't give a shit about other people. You're just trying to survive.
E: V.O.
S: INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
N: Hull doling out vials to DEALERS seen earlier with Eddie.
C: HULL
D: I can't do this shit. I just can't.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. A STREET - DAY
N: DEALERS going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's dealers. A well-dressed Black businessman buys from his BMW.
C: CARVER
D: But you want to be of use. You want to get drugs off the street, don't you?
E: V.O.
C: HULL
D: That's why I'm here.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME
N: Another sale: Teenagers on foot.
C: CARVER
D: Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go grow flowers someplace.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. HULL'S MOTEL - ANOTHER TIME
N: He comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen above.
C: HULL
D: You can't back down with them. You've got to project strength, from inside, you know?
N: The Dealer nods. Across the street Hull sees: A blue sedan. Taft and Hernandez. Taft gives Hull a little nod and grin.
S: EXT. STREET - ANOTHER TIME
N: Hull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a notebook. Across the street he watches: A PREGNANT WOMAN (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from one of his Dealers. He kicks the dash in frustrated anger. Under the MUSIC:
C: HULL
D: Cocksucker...
N: As soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer, slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC:
C: DEALER
D: What'd you do that for?
E: hurt, confused
C: HULL
D: 'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I can.
E: walking off
S: EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME
N: A white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby in the car seat.
S: EXT. STREET - TWILIGHT
N: Two USC football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling BIJOUX, a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses. Suddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart. He's yelling, pointing a finger in their faces. Elias comes up behind, calmer. Hull is smaller than either USC kid, but they back down as he curses them. Under MUSIC:
C: HULL
D: ...Touch her again, motherfuckers, I'm gonna mess you up.
N: A brief scuffle. Hull decks one USC, and Elias pulls him off. The kids leave. Elias doubles over with laughter. Hull yells at Bijoux and walks off.
S: EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
N: Hull (looking at written address) knocks on a door. It's opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy robe. She looks at him with disarming frankness. He thinks he must be in the wrong place.
C: HULL
D: Is David Elias here?
C: ELIAS
D: Momentito...
E: O.S.
N: Through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping into his loafers, buttoning his shirt. He gives the woman along, dark kiss, caressing her body.
C: ELIAS
D: Jacqueline, ho-ney...
N: She laughs, closes the door. As he and Hull walk to the street, Elias sings happily to himself:
C: ELIAS
D: "Who's making love to your old lady... while you're out make love...?" How come I like balling black chicks so much?
E: continuing cheerful
C: HULL
D: 'Cause you're a racist asshole. You feel like you're fucking a slave, and it gets you off.
C: ELIAS
D: Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm X shit. Tell me you're not chasin' white pussy every chance you get.
C: HULL
D: I don't dig white women. Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the same thing.
E: knowing that's a lie
C: ELIAS
D: Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the master. Hegel talks about it. Just like me, but the other way around.
C: HULL
D: Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel? Some smart-ass kike that talks backwards?
N: Elias laughs, gets into Hull's car. Hull's angry, takes a beat before he gets in.
C: ELIAS
D: Everybody digs the other, John. They dig their own, and they dig the other.
C: HULL
D: Does your wife dig black guys, David? Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to fuck me?
C: ELIAS
D: Ooo... you mean with that great big purple dick of yours? I hope not. She'd never be impressed with my little thing again.
E: mock-terrified
C: HULL
D: You think what impresses her now is your dick?
C: ELIAS
D: What does impress her?
E: musing
N: Hull can't help laughing. He starts the car.
S: EXT. BETTY'S STORE - DAY
N: Elias and Hull approach. Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing a new leather jacket.
S: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
N: As they go in, Elias switches the OPEN sign to CLOSED and turns the latch. The store is filled with Latin American folk art, particularly masks which line the walls. BETTY STONE, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes out from the back. She is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for success. She's also a little strung out. She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze.
C: ELIAS
D: Betty, this is John, my new associate.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Your new Eddie. I hear the old one wore out.
C: ELIAS
D: Factory recall. John's going to be a good customer. He does a lot of wash.
N: Hull puts the satchel on a display case. Betty still won't look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count. She does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test scores.
C: HULL
D: So how's this place work?
N: Betty doesn't answer, so Elias covers the awkwardness.
C: ELIAS
D: Betty wires the money to a store in Aruba in payment for things they never sent her. They deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay. That way it doesn't turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome to the laundromat.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: David, you talk too much.
C: ELIAS
D: She doesn't trust you.
N: Hull has taken down a mask, puts it over his face, looks in a mirror.
C: HULL
D: How much is this?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: More than you can afford.
C: HULL
D: I'll take it.
N: She produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at Elias.
C: ELIAS
D: By all means.
N: She draws out six lines. Elias does two.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (offering him the straw) Come on, Eddie 2... you're up.
C: HULL
D: No, thanks.
N: NOTE: Betty is acutely attuned to Hull, and in his refusal she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things: first, that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness. Despite the seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates him.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Who is he, my mother?
C: HULL
D: Never have, never will.
E: smiles
N: Betty ignores him, does her lines.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (taunting Hull) Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I hate it and I love it. The disease is the cure. She can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her. She and Elias are stoned; he's not.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) Don't look at me. Elias, tell him not to look at me. I don't like the fucker. But Elias is too busy vacuuming up Hull's leftovers.
C: ELIAS
D: John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle bunny.
E: sniffling
C: HULL
D: Watch your mouth, David.
C: ELIAS
D: But he's got another side. You should seen him on the street the other day with these two USC kids. Do the spade bit for her, John. I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...
E: black accent
N: He sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the boys.
C: HULL
D: Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black.
N: He says it gently, but Betty hears the edge.
C: ELIAS
D: Come on, John, you do it so well. Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah ain't playin'.
E: hurt, disappointed falling into it
N: Hull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated.
C: ELIAS
D: Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka, fucka...
E: continuing
N: Elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost musical. Hull picks him up and slams into a wall.
C: HULL
D: Say it again, and I'll kill you.
N: Elias throws Hull back against a display case. He's strong and unafraid. They're ready to fight.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Grow up, assholes! This half snaps them out of it. Still glowering, they slowly relax, release each other.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story. There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may not like this job, but he knows how to do it.
C: DEALER
D: ...The guy ripped me off, man, so I don't got the money, I don't got the stuff and --
C: HULL
D: You gotta pay anyway.
E: eyes on street
C: DEALER
D: Oh, but, man...
N: As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side mirror... THE RED RANGE ROVER coming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.
C: HULL
D: Shit...
N: Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner. The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out. Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to the ground. He jumps from the car:
C: HULL
D: Bijoux!!
E: continuing
N: She turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward. Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from many wounds. Hull, standing over her, covers her face.
S: EXT. SAME - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
N: The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down.
C: ELIAS
D: It wasn't your fault. What could you have done?
E: no response
C: HULL
D: She worked for me. I'm supposed to protect her.
N: Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.
C: ELIAS
D: We have to kill him.
N: Hull looks up.
C: ELIAS
D: Or we lose all authority with the other dealers. And one of them'll kill you.
E: continuing
N: Hull looks up, startled.
C: ELIAS
D: You've got to assert now, or you're dead.
E: continuing
N: Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.
C: ELIAS
D: And if we kill Ivy, we control this whole territory.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: That guy who works for Barbosa can do it, Chino.
C: ELIAS
D: No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's territory. It's gotta be us.
E: again: his hatred of Barbosa
C: HULL
D: Right.
C: ELIAS
D: And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
N: Meaning he can't do it. Hull knows that. A long beat on Hull's face as he reaches the inevitable decision.
C: HULL
D: Don't blow your cover.
E: to himself
C: ELIAS
D: What?
C: HULL
D: If I do this, we're partners. Equal partners on everything.
N: Elias offers his hand. Hull stands up, a sudden resolve.
C: HULL
D: Let's go.
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: Now...?
E: afraid
N: But Hull is already moving.
S: EXT. STREET/INT. ELIAS'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy. Elias double parks by two prostitutes. We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps trying to warm his hands. Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes. We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh. He gets back in the car.
S: EXT. A DANCE CLUB - NIGHT
N: The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT: They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to the front of the club. They stop again.
C: HULL
D: Go wait around back.
N: Elias nods. A beat. They look at each other.
C: ELIAS
D: I want to see you in that alley.
N: Hull's so terrified he seems calm. With an air of submitting himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.
S: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
N: Crowded and BOOMING and strobe lit. Hull pays the cover and climbs a staircase to a... CIRCULAR BALCONY that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers. Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in the Range Rover the first time. Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the rear of the club. The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way through the dancers to...
S: INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT
N: leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley. MOVING DOWN THE HALL A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into...
S: INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable to look away. He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC.
C: IVY
D: What're you looking at?
N: Hull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude.
C: IVY
D: You want to suck it, bitch? Or drink it?
E: continuing offers his dick
N: Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't move.
C: IVY
D: Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't you?
E: continuing; recognizing him
N: Somebody pushes on the outside of the door. Hull holds it closed with his back.
C: IVY
D: I gotta take care of you, too, huh?
E: continuing
N: He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun. Hull is frozen. Ivy starts to draw it out. Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to the floor. Hull steps out into...
S: INT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT
N: An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes. Hull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him. A couple that had been making out, stops, looks. It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away.
S: INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
N: Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't know the person there. With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto the dresser: Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood- soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks up... PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN He smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix this in his thoughts.
S: EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - PAY PHONE - DAY
N: Hull on the phone. He's unusually excited, even moved.
C: HULL
D: ...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy...
S: INT. HULL'S HOUSE - CLEVELAND - DAY
N: Carmen on the phone, jumping up and down with excitement.
C: CARMEN
D: Daddy!!
C: HULL
D: Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you!
E: V.O. through phone
C: CARMEN
D: What?
C: HULL
D: I miss you...
E: V.O.
C: CARMEN
D: I miss you, too, Daddy...
E: thrilled
S: EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY
N: Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his emotions. GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things.
C: VOICE
D: The maze leads in two directions. At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet. At the other... ...it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum...
E: young, nasal, too smart pointer indicates each end
N: The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route.
C: VOICE
D: This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition.
E: continuing
N: ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead.
S: INT. A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT
N: A 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd. He picks up... A MOLECULAR MODEL Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels.
C: CAL TECH
D: This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner.
N: He tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones.
C: CAL TECH
D: This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface. Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab.
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: Randy's a genius. His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize.
E: to Hull, proudly
C: CAL TECH
D: Nobel prizes are for wussies.
C: HULL
D: What does this shit do to you?
C: CAL TECH
D: I'm on it now. It's like cocaine only better. Want some?
E: offers him powder on a slide
C: HULL
D: I don't take drugs.
C: CAL TECH
D: Your mistake. This is designed for the top end of the market. For people who want to master reality, not avoid it. Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or -- best of all -- import it.
E: unoffended
C: ELIAS
D: What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity?
C: CAL TECH
D: With a million dollars, I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop. But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world.
E: makes a face: fair
C: ELIAS
D: I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe. We're going to put Barbosa out of business.
E: to Hull, with a vengeance
N: Elias is very happy. He leads Hull out.
S: INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY
N: On the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's photo, as around Eddie's. A photo of Hull is now on the board beside the one of Elias. Hull stares out the window, lost in thought.
C: CARVER
D: Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 segment...
E: dismissive
N: Hull shrugs: it's not that important. Carver turns to his real interest.
C: CARVER
D: So, what was it like?
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: What was what like?
E: still looking out
C: CARVER
D: Popping Ivy...
C: HULL
D: You knew.
C: CARVER
D: I'm God, remember?
C: HULL
D: Then you should know how it was.
E: looks back out
N: Carver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment.
C: CARVER
D: You didn't clear it with me. You're getting independent. That's good.
N: Hull smiles.
C: CARVER
D: How're we coming on Gallegos?
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: He supplies Barbosa. To get to him we'll have to take quantity.
C: CARVER
D: Then you've got to --
C: HULL
D: That's what killing Ivy did. I'll get to him soon.
N: Carver's impressed.
C: HULL
D: Is that it?
E: continuing
C: CARVER
D: I want you to get a new apartment. Something expensive.
E: seeing him to the door
C: HULL
D: I like where I am.
C: CARVER
D: That shithole? You're big time now. Act it. And get some clothes. Spend money. Have fun. That's an order.
S: INT. HULL'S MOTEL - OFFICE - DAY
N: Hull in a new, expensive suit, gives the big Blonde Woman cash.
C: HULL
D: Whether I'm here or not, no one else uses that room. And change the linen twice a week, just like now. And make sure James gets what he needs. And something for you.
E: starts to go, stops, more money
N: He adds another bill. She smiles.
S: INT. A RENTED CONDOMINIUM - DAY
N: Views, open space, expensive furnishings. Hull (in another fancy suit) is hanging a couple of Betty's masks. He's meticulous about their placement. Elias wanders out from the other rooms, looking around.
C: ELIAS
D: Nice place. Nice suit.
E: impressed, envious
N: Hull has a moment of self-consciousness about the suit, checks himself out in a mirror -- a private moment. Elias flops on a couch, puts his feet on an antique coffee table.
C: HULL
D: Hey...!
N: He hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor. Hull brushes the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries... Elias is amused.
C: ELIAS
D: You pick all this shit out yourself?
C: HULL
D: A Jewish lady in the store helped me.
C: ELIAS
D: Aw... Very nice. Understated. I'm impressed.
E: mock touched by racial harmony
N: Hull starts to place stacks of cash in a briefcase. He's momentarily mesmerized by all the money.
C: HULL
D: Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks...
E: to himself
C: ELIAS
D: You sold it all?
N: Hull nods.
C: ELIAS
D: I'll order a couple more keys from Barbosa.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Order ten.
C: ELIAS
D: Ten??
C: HULL
D: Better twenty.
C: ELIAS
D: I don't want to push it.
E: afraid of that
C: HULL
D: I do. We've got a bigger territory, we need more product. I want to deal directly with Gallegos. It would save us money.
C: ELIAS
D: Barbosa'll never let us near him.
N: Hull closes the briefcase, ushers Elias toward the door. He's going out, too.
C: HULL
D: If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come to us himself.
C: ELIAS
D: How do you know?
C: HULL
D: When I bought a key from Eddie, you came to me.
N: Elias laughs, surprised, afraid.
C: HULL
D: Who's above Gallegos?
E: continuing
C: ELIAS
D: Guzman, but he's... Don't ask so many questions.
C: HULL
D: How else will I learn? Call Barbosa, David, put in our order... Because we have to split this, and there isn't enough here for both of us.
E: hint of a threat
N: Elias feels the threat.
S: EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT
N: Despite the CLOSED sign, a light's on inside. Hull knocks. No response. He keeps knocking without let-up until:
C: BETTY'S VOICE
D: Nobody's home, go away.
E: annoyed
N: He knocks harder. Finally she appears in the doorway, stopping short when she sees it's him. She's immediately aware of white streaks on her grey suit. she tries to brush them off.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (doesn't want to let him in) Look, I'm tired, why don't you... Hull holds up the briefcase. She sighs, unlocks the door.
S: INT. BETTY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
N: A bill counter toting up the cash. She watches it fixedly to avoid looking at him, but she feels the chemistry.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Why do you look at me like that?
C: HULL
D: How do I look at you?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Like you know something I don't. Like you're better than me. That catches Hull off-guard, and he responds with a candor she didn't expect.
C: HULL
D: I don't think I'm better than you. I don't think I'm better than anybody.
N: She's startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to him.
C: HULL
D: But I do know something... You can't stop thinking about me.
E: continuing
N: Embarrassed, she looks away. He takes her hand, and at his touch something yields to her. She lets him draw her to him. His kiss is strangely tender, searching. It turns Betty on incredibly. She melts into him.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Let's go back here... She leads him into... THE SMALL OFFICE She's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her. He's all over her, but she pulls back for a moment. There is a couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a plate.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (indicates coke) Do this... do it with me. She offers him a straw. He doesn't take it.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) This is where I'm at. You want to be with me, it's gotta be there.
C: HULL
D: I don't do that.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Never have, never will.
C: HULL
D: It's for fuck-ups.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: What do you think, you're not a nigger? You're a nigger as much as me.
C: HULL
D: More.
N: She's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he won't let her, or she won't let herself. It's torment. Finally she's released by a KNOCK on the door. She goes out to... THE FRONT OF THE STORE Lets in Elias. He smells the tension.
C: ELIAS
D: Having fun? I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us now.
E: amused, jealous neither answers; to Hull
N: Hull turns to Betty. Both want to go that way instead of this, but events are leading somewhere else. He follows Elias out.
S: EXT. A SALSA CLUB - NIGHT
N: MUSIC pouring into the darkness.
S: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
N: Kids dancing to a live STAGE ACT. High in a wall: a lit window.
S: INT. THAT ROOM - NIGHT
N: Very different from the club. A comfortable room with a bar, tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below. Barbosa and Gopher at the bar with Elias and Hull. Chino and other SHADOWY FIGURES lurk in the room's depths.
C: BARBOSA
D: Ten kilos? You're always late on two.
C: HULL
D: Not ten... twenty.
N: Barbosa's impressed.
C: HULL
D: The more we have, the more we can move. There're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory.
E: continuing
N: Barbosa's coked to the eyeballs, mean and dangerous.
C: BARBOSA
D: Finally some balls on this team... Come work for me, John. I'll give you your own franchise. You can supply Elias, lean on him when he's late.
E: taunting Elias
C: ELIAS
D: Go fuck yourself.
N: Barbosa laughs.
C: HULL
D: I'm with David.
C: BARBOSA
D: Why? He give you his "designer drugs" pitch. He's never going to do it. He's a shmuck.
C: ELIAS
D: Don't talk to me that way.
C: BARBOSA
D: I'm not talking to you at all. I'm talking to John.
C: GOPHER
D: It's the cocaine. Don't listen to him. Felix, you've had enough...
C: BARBOSA
D: Shmuck.
N: Elias goes for him. He's fast and strong, and it takes Chino and Hull to pull him off.
C: GOPHER
D: Praise God they don't let guns in here.
C: CALMING VOICES
D: "None of that in here..." "Take it outside..."
N: Barbosa's laughing, but his cheek is flecked with his own blood, and his eyes are dead.
C: BARBOSA
D: David, you've been working out, you're getting strong. Are you quick, too? Come on, I'll give you a shot at me.
E: shadow boxes
C: ELIAS
D: Any time, any place.
C: BARBOSA
D: Right here, right now. Do this.
N: He puts his hands out, palms up.
C: ELIAS
D: This? What is this?
C: BARBOSA
D: You know, you slap me, I slap you. Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp.
E: mimes that game
N: It doesn't look fun. Elias glances at Hull for guidance.
C: HULL
D: Don't waste your time.
C: BARBOSA
D: Stay out of this. Come on, you can do it, David, you're not a shmuck.
E: to Elias
N: Elias puts his hands out, palms up. Barbosa covers them with his own. ON THE HANDS: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding band and a slim watch.
C: BARBOSA
D: Slap my hands. Just slap them.
E: continuing
N: Elias looks Barbosa in the eye. He's trying to be a snake, but he's more the mouse. He looks away and as he does tries to... Slap him with both hands but hits only... Air. The room breathes. Barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down.
C: BARBOSA
D: Now it's my turn.
E: continuing
C: GOPHER
D: It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill the white boy.
C: ELIAS
D: One more.
C: BARBOSA
D: No, you went, Davey, now it's my turn. First to four wins, like the World Series.
N: Elias covers Barbosa's palms with his own.
C: GOPHER
D: Oh, God, I can't look.
N: ON THE HANDS: Barbosa tenses his hands. Elias yanks back. Barbosa's hands haven't moved.
C: BARBOSA
D: You remember the rules? If you flinch, I get to hit you.
N: He slaps Elias across the face. Hull starts forward. A knife appears. He stops.
C: BARBOSA
D: Again, shmuck.
E: continuing
N: Elias covers Barbosa's hands. Barbosa tenses. Elias holds firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. Elias doubles over, holding his hands in pain.
C: GOPHER
D: One.
C: ELIAS
D: That was two.
C: BARBOSA
D: No, this is two.
N: He slaps him again, a stinging crack. Elias looks to Hull, but they're across a canyon. Hull lowers his eyes.
C: GOPHER
D: Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.
N: ON THE HANDS. Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias flinches again. Barbosa smacks him across the face. The sound reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he doesn't move.
C: GOPHER
D: Three.
E: continuing
C: A VOICE
D: Felix! No mas. Finito.
N: A MAN steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied by a guard we'll know as MOLTO. Someone murmurs to someone else:
C: SOMEONE
D: Gallegos...
N: Hull reacts. Their eyes meet.
C: GOPHER
D: The fight is over! The Ambassador from the South has spoken!
C: ELIAS
D: One more.
E: refusing any mercy
N: Barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of Gallegos.
C: ELIAS
D: One more! We're not finished! Four was the match.
E: continuing people are silent
N: He holds out his hands. Barbosa resumes the stance, then waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.
C: BARBOSA
D: Four.
C: HULL
D: Okay, that's it. Get away.
N: Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos. Their gazes meet again. As they go out they hear Gallegos BERATING Barbosa in furious Spanish.
S: INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
N: Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.
C: ELIAS
D: Look at me. Look at me, damn it!
N: He barely whispers, but it's like a shout. Hull, who'd been avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. Elias's humiliation is so profound it almost ennobles him. Finally:
C: HULL
D: Why did you do it?
C: ELIAS
D: I needed it. They taught me what I needed to know. That I'm not part of them, and I never will be. That they don't respect me. That I don't deserve respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John. I'm a shmuck...
N: He laughs a terrible laugh. The door behind them opens, and Barbosa appears with Gopher. Everyone is ready for death, but:
C: BARBOSA
D: David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, and... you know... I'm doing a little too much coca... I'll buy your kid a pony... anything you want... Let's forget about it.
N: He comes down the stairs, offers his hand. Elias will never forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them in his own bloody paws, looking directly into Barbosa's face. Barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand. Elias and Hull continue down and out the door. Gopher gushes to Barbosa.
C: GOPHER
D: I am so proud of you. You can be cruel, and you can be kind. And just now you were kind. Proud, proud, and more proud. That's me.
C: BARBOSA
D: Shut up.
S: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
N: Barbosa, Gopher with Hernandez, Taft's partner. Now we know Hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew Eddie was talking.
C: BARBOSA
D: I got nothing to give you, my man. I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Felix, I keep telling them, "I have informants down there, I'm working guys, I can't say who..." If you don't have money, give me busts, or they're gonna start wondering about me.
C: GOPHER
D: They're already wondering.
C: BARBOSA
D: You can have Gopher.
E: deadpan
C: GOPHER
D: Oh Gawd...
C: BARBOSA
D: How about a lawyer?
C: GOPHER
D: Felix, don't do this.
E: knows who he means
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is best. But I need spades, too. The politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote Republican.
E: he knows, too
C: BARBOSA
D: Lawyers and spades; I got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: You're my man. And afterwards...
N: Hernandez rubs thumb against fingers.
C: BARBOSA
D: When this is over, I'll send you to Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in Maui, it's a very spiritual place.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: I just want money.
N: And he's gone.
C: GOPHER
D: I wouldn't trust that man when he's out of rifle range.
N: Barbosa looks tired.
C: GOPHER
D: Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong. Kill Elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this. It damages your prestige.
E: continuing; premonition of disaster
N: Barbosa faces his cocaine. He tries to resist the pull, then yields. He does another line. It's his friend. He loves it. He picks up a cellular phone, dials.
C: BARBOSA
D: David, you're awake, I'm impressed... I'm sorry about what happened... Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes, like you wanted. You were right, you should have what you need... Tomorrow night... Bring your partner and that girl with the store, Betty... I need her advice on something. I want us to have fun, like we used to. We'll go to that shrimp place, okay?... Good... Me, too, David. Yes!
E: hangs up; does another line; drawing it deep into him
S: INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - BEFORE DAWN
N: Hull jacked up, excited, pleased with himself. As he paces, Carver observes his beautiful suit, shoes, expensive watch. He looks much better than Carver.
C: HULL
D: We're getting twenty kilograms tomorrow. Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed Elias, now he doesn't make a move without me.
E: notes the lightening sky
C: CARVER
D: You run Elias.
C: HULL
D: I control him. Barbosa's selling it to us because he thinks I can move it... And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.
E: now the big news
N: Carver sits up fast. Hull likes that.
C: HULL
D: We're getting the dope from him; it's still coming through Barbosa, but Gallegos will approach me soon on his own. We're going to get him, Gerry. We're going to bring him and the whole thing down.
E: continuing
N: Carver sits back, grimaces.
C: HULL
D: What's your problem?
E: continuing
C: CARVER
D: My problem? My problem is that you don't really know what's happening.
E: looking out window
C: HULL
D: Oh, so, tell me what's happening, Gerry.
E: sardonic
C: CARVER
D: Barbosa is setting you up tonight.
C: HULL
D: Bullshit.
C: CARVER
D: He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez. You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs. They're putting together the arrest team right now.
N: That rocks Hull. He is up, pacing.
C: HULL
D: What do we do?
C: CARVER
D: You stay away. We're going to take them down.
C: HULL
D: Who? Elias and Betty? Don't be silly.
C: CARVER
D: My boss wants a bust right now. He goes before the oversight committee next week. He needs something to justify the budget.
C: HULL
D: I'll get him something. Give me ten days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a plate.
E: imploring
C: CARVER
D: Too late. The whole thing's set up.
C: HULL
D: Gerry, what are you telling me? I need Elias... and Betty. You arrest them, and you're throwing away everything I've set up.
C: CARVER
D: It's out of my hands.
N: Hull walks out.
C: CARVER
D: John, don't go near that bust.
E: continuing
S: EXT. 96TH STREET NEAR THE AIRPORT/INT. A CAR - NIGHT
N: Elias (no sleep) driving. Betty in front. Hull in back.
C: HULL
D: We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them come to us.
C: ELIAS
D: He wouldn't.
N: They pull into the lot of a boarded up restaurant where Barbosa and Chino stand outside of a limousine.
S: EXT. BEHIND AN AIRPORT MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Taft and Hernandez in the same van that was outside the gym earlier. They're watching THROUGH BINOCULARS, night scopes. They spot Elias's car.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Here they are. Nobody move until we see the green suitcase.
E: whispering into radio
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The two groups meeting. Barbosa gives Betty a courtly kiss.
C: BARBOSA
D: I'm sorry for dragging you out so late, but I have to be careful.
E: flirtatious
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: It gives me confidence. HULL watching planes descend into the airport, nervous. He knows what's coming, but how does he handle it?
C: HULL
D: Let's see what we've got.
N: Elias takes a satchel out of the rent-a-car trunk. Chino opens the limousine's trunk. Inside is an over-sized day-glo green plastic suitcase. He is about to pick it up.
C: HULL
D: Don't touch it.
E: continuing; spotting the police van in the adjacent lot
N: Everyone looks at him, then the direction he's looking.
C: BARBOSA
D: What is this?
C: HULL
D: Something's wrong. What's that van doing there?
N: Everyone looks. They can barely see the van. Hull pulls a gun.
C: HULL
D: This is a bust. The minute we take the stuff, they'll be over us.
E: continuing
C: BARBOSA
D: He's crazy, David. I thought you were the crazy one, but it's him.
N: Hull puts the gun to Barbosa's head, addresses Chino:
C: HULL
D: Chino, pick up the suitcase and give it to Elias. I'll only kill him if something goes wrong.
N: Chino moves to pick up the suitcase.
C: BARBOSA
D: No!!
N: Everyone looks at Hull amazed, even Chino.
C: ELIAS
D: Fucking A, John...
E: softly
C: HULL
D: Okay, everybody in the car.
N: He throws the money in the limo truck, slams the lid. He's running the show now, and everyone knows it. He's winging it, but confident and strangely calm. Elias, energized by Hull's command, grabs Barbosa and throws him toward the limo. HERNANDEZ'S POV THROUGH NIGHT SCOPE
C: TAFT
D: We have a problem.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: Shit! Shit! Shit! Enough of this...
E: aiming rifle; Hull in sights
C: TAFT
D: No!
S: EXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT
N: Hull shepherding everyone into the limo. He glances toward the van. On instinct. He pulls Chino to him. A RIFLE SHOT Chino's head explodes. Betty screams.
C: BARBOSA
D: Don't shoot... Don't shoot...
E: screaming at van
S: INT. VAN - NIGHT
N: Taft hurling Hernandez against the wall.
C: TAFT
D: Goddam it, what the hell are you doing?
S: EXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT
N: SIRENS. GUNFIRE. Elias drags Barbosa into the limo. Hull throws Betty into the front seat. The limo takes off.
S: EXT. STREET/INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT
N: Hull driving, Betty up front. Elias with a gun on Barbosa in back. Hull slaloms the limo through police GUNFIRE. Windows are blown out. Glass everywhere.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (weeping) I asked for this... I asked for it... It's my fault...
C: HULL
D: Relax. We'll make it.
E: calm, eyes on road
N: She looks at him, stunned yet soothed by his certainty.
C: BARBOSA
D: He's a cop. He has to be. How else would he have known?
C: HULL
D: If I was cop, you'd be face down back there.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: How did you know?
C: HULL
D: The whole thing smelled. Changing his mind about the stuff. Meeting us way out here. And I'd seen cops in that van before. Hernandez is dirty, that's who he's using.
C: ELIAS
D: Get out of the car.
E: to Barbosa
N: He starts to open the door.
C: HULL
D: David, not now.
C: ELIAS
D: Yes, now!
S: INT. TAFT AND HERNANDEZ'S CAR - NIGHT
N: Racing. Taft at wheel, raging at Hernandez.
C: TAFT
D: Who are you, man? Who the fuck are you?
C: HERNANDEZ
D: I'm me.
E: stonewalling
S: INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT
C: ELIAS
D: He traded us to the cops. Just like Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my daughter, had to die because that's the rule. And you were vulgar about my wife, Felix, so at the very least the same rule applies to you.
C: BARBOSA
D: I'll give you money. I'll give you a million. Anything you want.
C: ELIAS
D: I want you to get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Out of the fucking --
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (near tears) No, no... we can't do this.
C: HULL
D: Stop it, David, or we're...
E: turning around from front seat
N: Elias wheels on him, sticks the gun in his face:
C: ELIAS
D: Look at my hands!
E: in a fury
N: He holds them up: swollen, black and blue, cut up.
C: ELIAS
D: Get out of the car.
E: continuing; to Barbosa, softly
N: Barbosa's frozen. Elias grabs his hand, SHOOTS a bullet through. Barbosa screams...
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: No!
C: HULL
D: Goddammit!
N: Elias wheels on them, swinging the gun from one to the other.
C: ELIAS
D: Stay out of this, or you'll die. You'll both die. Everyone'll die.
N: His fury makes anything seem possible. He pushes open the door. Trembling, Barbosa starts to climb out. The limo enters a tunnel, police still in pursuit. Halfway out, Barbosa stops.
C: BARBOSA
D: I can't...
N: Elias SHOOTS him in the butt. He shrieks, jerks forward. The cops are getting close behind. Other cops waiting at the far end of the tunnel. Hull hits the brakes, spins a 180 into the opposite lane. Barbosa is flung out of the car and plastered by a succession of fishtailing vehicles. Hull speeds back the other way. They're going straight at:
S: INT. VAN - COMING STRAIGHT AT THEM - NIGHT
N: Taft and Hull, the two drivers, lock eyes. It's chicken, but more than that. Two men set against each other who, for some reason, want to be friends. At the last instant, the van swerves away, but: ELIAS AIMING AT TAFT Taft sees the gun too late. He can do nothing. Hull's gaze follows Taft's. He sees Elias, deliberately swerves, sending the SHOT wild.
S: INT. LIMO - RACING - NIGHT
C: ELIAS
D: I had him!
C: HULL
D: You want to kill a cop?? Don't be stupid.
N: The limo speeds away.
S: EXT. STREET/INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT
N: The windows shot out. Hull and Betty silent, shaken. Elias charged up, happy.
C: ELIAS
D: Everything is different. We're the Colombians now. This is the greatest night of my life. Terrible but great. Felix was right...
E: radiant
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (appalled) About what?
C: ELIAS
D: He said I should kill a man. He was right.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: My God.
C: ELIAS
D: Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss him? Will anybody in the world miss him?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Are you a roach, too?
C: ELIAS
D: Yes. Thank God.
E: happily
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (to Hull) What about you? He's silent, keeps driving. She's had enough.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) Stop the car. Hull looks at her.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) Stop it! He brakes to a stop. She jumps out, leans back in.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) No more laundering, no more anything. I'm finished with this. And she disappears into the night. Elias watches her go. Hull resumes driving.
C: ELIAS
D: She knows too much. We have to kill her.
C: HULL
D: No! She's with me. She's not going to talk. You touch her, I'll kill you.
E: looks at Elias
C: ELIAS
D: She's your responsibility then.
N: Hull accepts it.
C: ELIAS
D: We're going to get the money now, John. Enough for the new drug. We're going to be rich. We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm. I mean that.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: They're going to come after us.
C: ELIAS
D: It's a hardball game. We're hardball players.
E: matter-of-fact
S: EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - EAST L.A. - NIGHT
N: Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH.
C: HERNANDEZ
D: It wasn't my fault.
C: MOLTO
D: It never is.
N: He SHOOTS him in the head. Hernandez slumps against the wheel. The woman screams. Molto walks away.
S: EXT. AN APARTMENT COMPLEX/INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - DAWN
N: Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through the glass. She's afraid of him.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. I swear. Please. Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on him.
S: INT. HER BEDROOM - DAWN
N: Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away from him, she feels so exposed.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Don't look... She hides her face in his neck.
S: INT. SAME - LATER
N: They lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first time. A wonderful, unprotected openness.
C: HULL
D: Tell me about you.
E: softly
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (half-kidding) Everything worth knowing you just found you. He laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. Another in her face. Guns all around.
C: HULL
D: Don't hurt her.
N: Hands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone. We see Molto, two or three others.
S: EXT. A CEMETERY - MORNING
N: RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself. He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.
C: ELIAS
D: Who's grave?
N: An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed despite the guns held on him.
C: GALLEGOS
D: My wife's. She died of leukemia three years ago. I like to be among the dead. They never interrupt you. Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee businessman in Bogata hotels. He grew up. He made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him. So he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place. Now we'll see if you can do as well.
E: looks around turning to them
N: A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves.
C: GALLEGOS
D: Felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars.
E: continuing
N: He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out.
C: GALLEGOS
D: When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did. You have three days.
E: continuing
N: Gallegos turns to leave.
C: HULL
D: Who did Barbosa collect from?
C: GALLEGOS
D: If you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him.
N: He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it.
C: GALLEGOS
D: Cute... Can I have that?
E: continuing
N: Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross.
S: EXT. A GHETTO STREET - NIGHT
N: A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent to the club.
S: INT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed.
C: GOPHER
D: I don't want you in here. You killed the man, and I loved him. I don't want to have anything to do with you.
N: Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC.
C: GOPHER
D: I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man? Would you hit your own grandfather?
E: continuing; apoplectic
C: ELIAS
D: Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know. Tell us or --
E: slaps him against wall
N: Hull pulls him off. Elias is angry. They struggle.
C: HULL
D: He'll tell us. Gopher, just...
N: Meaning: deal with me or deal with Elias.
C: GOPHER
D: You can't tell anyone it was me.
N: The MUSIC continues OVER the following sequence:
S: INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
N: Elias arguing with a dealer. He slaps him around. TIGHT ON HANDS Money is exchanged. The money is stuffed in a satchel.
S: INT. A LAW OFFICE - DAY
N: A well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a distinguished couple in their 60's. The door BANGS open and a secretary is unable to restrain Hull and Elias as they charge into the room. The lawyer is up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely explains to the clients that this will only take a moment. TIGHT ON SATCHEL Hull's hands thrust more money in. It's getting full.
S: INT. A MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT
N: A biker in leathers on hands-and-knees spitting blood onto the cement floor. Hull stands over him, fists clenched.
S: INT. A CAR TRUNK
N: A satchel stuffed with money is latched, set next to another latched one. A third is opened, money and jewelry dumped in.
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Hull looking into the trunk. Elias is beat.
C: HULL
D: Where the hell is all the money? We're still a million short.
C: ELIAS
D: I gotta get laid.
C: HULL
D: David, we've got thirty-six hours.
C: ELIAS
D: Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the morning.
E: slams trunk, moves toward door
C: HULL
D: Sooner than that.
N: Elias gets in the car and drives off. Hull turns and a dark American sedan pulls up alongside. Carver behind the wheel.
C: CARVER
D: Get in.
E: an order
S: INT. CAR - NIGHT
C: HULL
D: What are you doing here? You're going to get me killed.
E: as he gets in
N: Carver peels away fast. He's very angry, frightened, too, but that's hidden.
C: CARVER
D: Where the hell have you been?
C: HULL
D: Doing my job.
N: There's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't heard before. Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is.
C: CARVER
D: You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust. As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered.
C: HULL
D: I didn't blow my cover.
C: CARVER
D: Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.
C: HULL
D: Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money. We can set him up right now.
E: NOTE: Carver arrives somewhere and parks. To be discussed, but let's say, for now, that we are:
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA PARKING STRUCTURE - OVERLOOKING OCEAN -
N: NIGHT They get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to Hull who declines.
C: CARVER
D: Never have, never will. I want you to give me your gun. You're coming in right now.
E: puts the flask away
C: HULL
D: Coming in where?
E: doesn't understand
C: CARVER
D: Your assignment has been terminated. You're not going out there again. If I have to, I'll put you in custody.
C: HULL
D: I'm going to have Gallegos in two days.
E: uncomprehending
N: Carver says nothing. Suddenly Hull understands.
C: HULL
D: You're protecting him. You're protecting Gallegos.
E: continuing
N: Carver snorts: ridiculous.
C: HULL
D: No, of course. That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then... What is he, the new Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. Two birds with one stone.
E: continuing
C: CARVER
D: You violated orders, so you're through. Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it.
C: HULL
D: I'm through...? Then, I might as well have a drink after all.
E: laughs
N: Surprised, Carver reaches for the flask. As he does, Hull grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building, holds him there.
C: HULL
D: Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you.
E: continuing
N: Carver struggles. Hull pushes him out farther. Carver dangles.
C: CARVER
D: You're insane.
C: HULL
D: All the more reason to do what I say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble holding on...
C: CARVER
D: All right!
C: HULL
D: Say it!
C: CARVER
D: It's the State Department.
N: Hull pulls him back in. Carver slumps against the wall, drinks greedily. Hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask away.
C: CARVER
D: I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Guzman.
C: CARVER
D: Guzman, right. Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate. That's a right-winger who's pro-U.S. If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there. It's politics, John, not drugs.
E: he doesn't like it either
C: HULL
D: Drugs is politics. Politics is drugs... Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed a man. Others died. What did I do all this for? For nothing.
E: sickened
C: CARVER
D: I'm going to Washington, John. I'll bring you with me. We'll have clout, money...
C: HULL
D: I didn't do this for clout or money. You said we were gonna do some good.
E: outraged
C: CARVER
D: We tried.
C: HULL
D: Trying's for college boys. If all there is is power and money... If all there is... then what am I doing here? 'Cause I can get more power and money out on the street, I got more there already, than I'd ever get kissing your ass in Washington...
E: his head on fire
C: CARVER
D: But you can't do that, John. It's not you.
C: HULL
D: Me? There is no me. We took care of that. First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. Why not stop pretending...? Quit the force. Be a dealer.
C: CARVER
D: It's not that simple.
C: HULL
D: My assignment's already terminated. All I have to do is quit. I hereby quit. My first one. Not so bad.
E: lifts the flask drinks
N: He slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts engine.
C: CARVER
D: Don't blow your cover.
N: Hull drives off, leaving Carver alone on the roof.
S: INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: She lets him in, sees the distress in his face.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: What's the matter? He shakes his head, drops onto the couch. He takes out the flask, offers it to her. She shakes her head.
C: HULL
D: Who are you, my mother?
N: He laughs, takes a drink. She's surprised, says nothing.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Tell me.
C: HULL
D: Tell you what?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: What you came to say.
C: HULL
D: What did I come to say?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Then tell me anything. Something about you. Something real.
C: HULL
D: When I was young, I occasionally stole things. My father died when I was ten. Right in front of me.
E: long beat; another drink laughs to himself
N: The revelation is so sudden it surprises Hull as much as Betty.
C: HULL
D: Heart attack. He just fell down. He said, "I love you," then died in my arms.
E: continuing
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Oh, baby... She holds him, and he lets himself be held.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) Tell me what's going on, John?
C: HULL
D: You're not doing the stuff anymore, are you?
E: doesn't want to talk about that
N: Pulls playfully at her nose.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: No. Don't change the subject.
C: HULL
D: How is that?
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: It's hard. John...!
C: HULL
D: Things are getting, they're getting a little... confusing. I had certain plans, and people haven't come through exactly as they promised.
E: trying to tell without telling
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: What do you expect with those people?
C: HULL
D: It's not just those people. It's... it's bigger than that. It's of everybody. Present company excluded.
E: laughs
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: You've got to stop this, John, you know that. You gotta get out.
C: HULL
D: I can't.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Of course, you can.
C: HULL
D: No! This is what I'm supposed to do.
E: almost angry
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Supposed to? Who said you're supposed to?
C: HULL
D: The whole fuckin' world. You think I didn't try something else? But everything funnels you right back here. Like it's where you had to go all along.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: But you know what you're doing, don't you, selling this stuff? Doing to our own.
C: HULL
D: If I tried to get out now, they'd kill me.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (tortured) I can't be with somebody's who involved in drugs. He nods. He knows. He's even happy about it. But she won't yield. Finally he gets up and walks back out the door.
S: EXT. GOPHER'S BUILDING - 4 A.M.
N: The neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens Sr. was killed. The rap club still pumps MUSIC onto the 4 A.M. streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime anywhere else. Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless and hoping stare at... HULL Everyone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car. They don't remember when he was just another hustler making street buys. Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him, not caring what it entails. Every eye follows as... He and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door. Hull's eyes don't go right or left. He's a driven man now.
S: INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Gopher has just been roused from sleep. A light in his face, Hull and Elias looming over him.
C: HULL
D: There've got to be more. We have a million two, we owe Gallegos one eight.
C: GOPHER
D: I told you everyone. Everyone who owed him, everyone he... One eight? He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him a million.
N: Hull and Elias look at each other.
S: INT. BETTY'S STORE - MORNING
N: Taft is showing her photocopies of phone bills, bank transactions, invoices. She's obviously upset.
C: TAFT
D: I got every money transfer, every phone call, all your laundry tickets.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (miserable) What do you want?
C: TAFT
D: John Hull.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: I can't!
C: TAFT
D: Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried up old woman, and when you come out, ain't nobody gonna want you.
N: She covers her face.
S: EXT. EAST L.A. STREET/INT. CAR - DAY
N: Elias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to himself at some private joke.
C: HULL
D: What are you laughing at?
N: Elias shakes his head: nothing. He laughs. They pull into the lot beside a movie theater.
S: INT. THEATER - DAY
N: A Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. A door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto. Molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money satchels, make them wait a moment until... The movie ends. The house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the only spectator in the theater. He beckons. Molto and the guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him. Gallegos looking in the satchels. A tense moment.
C: HULL
D: It isn't one eight. It's a million one. That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying.
E: off Gallegos
N: Gallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs.
C: GALLEGOS
D: Big brass balls. Collecting money makes you strong.
N: Everybody relaxes. Gallegos scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax machine.
C: ELIAS
D: What's that?
C: GALLEGOS
D: I'm telling our suppliers they got paid. They'll be very happy. I'm happy.
C: ELIAS
D: And we're happy. Everybody's happy. It's a happy world.
N: Elias seems a bit mad, but no one minds. He and Hull are ready to go. He gestures to Molto, wants his gun back.
C: GALLEGOS
D: So, how can I express my gratitude for a job well done?
C: ELIAS
D: We want Barbosa's business.
N: Gallegos gestures to Molto to give them the guns.
C: GALLEGOS
D: Done. Of course.
C: ELIAS
D: And, also, your business. All this. Your money, your dope, everything.
N: Hull looks at Elias; what's going on?
C: GALLEGOS
D: You're tougher than I thought, but not that tough.
E: smiles
C: ELIAS
D: How tough is enough?
N: He brings up the gun and SHOOTS Gallegos in the head. Hull and the guards are frozen. Then everyone goes for a gun. Elias SHOOTS the guard. Hull has his gun to Molto's head and screams at Elias:
C: HULL
D: No!
N: Meaning don't shoot him. But Elias has no intention of doing so.
C: ELIAS
D: Thank you, John. I couldn't have done that without you.
E: breathless
C: HULL
D: Jesus Christ...
E: barely able to speak
N: He can't believe it: the guy he's been after the whole time is dead on the floor.
C: ELIAS
D: You taught me to take my work seriously.
C: HULL
D: What's going on here, David?
C: ELIAS
D: We're taking over.
C: HULL
D: You're doing too much stuff.
C: ELIAS
D: No, I'm very clear. I'm very, very clear. Ahora, usted nos assistamos. Enteindo?
E: to Molto
N: Molto nods.
S: EXT. THEATER PARKING LOT/INT. CAR - DAY
N: Hull, Elias and Molto getting into their car. Molto is recalcitrant. Elias pistol whips him. Hull stops him.
S: EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/INT. CAR - DAY
N: The car passes through a development of suburban homes. They enter a driveway. Two boys play in the yard.
C: ELIAS
D: Donde esta?
E: to Molto
N: Molto is silent. Elias FIRES a bullet right between his feet. Molto jumps. The boys turn. Hull grabs the gun away. We feel the toll Elias's madness is taking on him.
C: HULL
D: What the fuck's the matter with you?
C: ELIAS
D: It works, John. It works.
N: And, indeed, Molto is pointing to a Winnebago parked at the rear of the property.
S: EXT. REAR OF PROPERTY - DAY
N: Winnebago. With a tire iron, Hull snaps off the padlock that holds the rear door closed. He opens the door. Money gushes out. He slams it closed.
C: HULL
D: Jesus...
N: He, Elias and Molto are on hands and knees scooping it up. SAME - LATER Molto tied to a tree. Elias is giving him instructions while, strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks.
C: ELIAS
D: Disce a Senor Guzman que... ...that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town. We'll know how to reach him. Okay?
E: to Molto his Spanish isn't good enough
N: Molto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind.
S: EXT./INT. A PARKING GARAGE/INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING
N: The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, "Hey, Frank." Frank waves him in. The garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations.
C: ELIAS
D: Approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills, it's somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars. Right back there.
N: As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head through the open window. Elias finishes his money report, and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but:
C: ELIAS
D: Think I'm crazy?
E: continuing; not turning around
C: HULL
D: Yes. I can't believe you got us into this. All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses, including Renaldo Guzman who's friends with fucking George Bush.
E: blowing up, gun still on him
C: ELIAS
D: I know they're coming after us. I want them to. We'll give them the money, but we'll make a deal for ourselves. We'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs. I've thought it all out. I've been thinking it out for years.
N: Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias turns around, embraces him.
C: ELIAS
D: We're going to have everything. Don't you want everything, John?
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: They're going to get your family, David. They'll kill your wife and daughter.
C: ELIAS
D: Nancy and Miranda left the country two days ago.
E: serene
C: HULL
D: You knew about this then?
N: Elias smiles.
C: HULL
D: What about Betty?
E: continuing
S: EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY SHOP - EVENING
N: A car SQUEALS to a stop. Molto and three thugs smash through the glass door. They disappear into the store where things can be heard BREAKING. They emerge a moment later, jump into the car.
S: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING
N: Hull's car races up. He jumps out, dashes toward the building.
S: INT. SYNAGOGUE SOCIAL HALL - EVENING
N: Forty PEOPLE on folding chairs. Hull enters on a dead run. He stops short when he sees: BETTY at the front. He signals to her, but she's already saying:
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Hi, my name is Betty.
C: EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
D: Hi, Betty!
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict. And I've been clean for nineteen days. The room bursts into APPLAUSE. She sees Hull at the back; he signals to her, but she goes on.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) I've been using drugs and selling them, and I've wanted to stop for a long time, and the only way I did was because I met a man I loved and who loved me. I know that's not what I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to say there was a higher power, and maybe there was, behind it all, but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that I could start, or at least think about a life that didn't have drugs in it... She's looking right at Hull as she speaks. He's torn between the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's saying.
S: EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING
N: Hull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: I've got to get clothes.
C: HULL
D: You can't go back.
S: INT. HULL'S CONDO - EVENING
N: Molto and men pouring through it. In frustration, Molto smashes the table Hull had fussed over when Elias put his feet up.
S: EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - NIGHT
N: Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags, a newly bought suitcase. They see... COPS They freeze, turn, ready to bolt. But more cops behind them. A panic, yet no one's coming after them. They walk on. The cops are going into and coming out of Belinda's room.
S: INT. BELINDA'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: The fat Blonde Woman is talking to a policewoman. James sits on the bed staring at... BELINDA who lies dead on a floor littered with crack vials. Hull picks up a vial, holds it up to the Blonde Woman with a question.
C: BLONDE WOMAN
D: She got a fever and just burned up. She just burned up all of a sudden. It must have been bad stuff.
E: nodding
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (indicating James) He shouldn't be here.
C: BLONDE WOMAN
D: Come on, James, we'll go get a burrito.
E: takes his hand
N: The boy allows himself to be led out. Betty looks at Hull who's in a private hell.
S: EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
N: Hull and Betty are about to enter Hull's room. The door is ajar.
S: INT. HULL'S ROOM - NIGHT
N: Taft stands at the dresser. He's found Hull's collection of memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children.
C: TAFT
D: Cute kids...
C: HULL
D: Give me that.
E: angry at the invasion
N: He snatches away the photo, but not before Betty sees it. She reaches out her hand. He reluctantly turns it over to her.
C: TAFT
D: Tell me something, who the fuck are you?
N: Hull doesn't answer, collects the rest of his things, including the bloody money, stuffs it back in the envelope.
C: TAFT
D: 'Cause I don't think you're quite the asshole you're trying to be.
E: continuing
C: HULL
D: Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name, right? Leave me alone. I got things on my mind.
C: TAFT
D: I'd think you would. You better have your goddamn life on your mind, or it's gonna get away from you. It's gonna burn up like that poor woman across the way. Like all of you's gonna burn...
C: HULL
D: And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner, never catching anybody important?
C: TAFT
D: I do what I can. Do you do what you can? Maybe my partner was dirty. Maybe the chief's dirty. And the mayor. And the President. Maybe God Himself's taking something on the side. That's their problem. But I'll bust 'em if I can.
E: Hull says nothing
C: HULL
D: Get out of my room.
E: without force
C: TAFT
D: Don't deny who you are.
N: He leaves. Hull turns to Betty who is still holding the photo of his children. He gently takes it, looks at it, seems to draw both succor and pain from it. He gets out Carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty.
C: HULL
D: They're my children. They live in Cleveland with their mother. I'm divorced from her. I haven't seen them in... some time. I want to, but I haven't been able to arrange it.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: How much else don't I know about you?
C: HULL
D: Everything else... Everything else is... I don't know.
E: trying to make a joke
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Taft has all the evidence about my laundering. Hull's upset.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: He's going to put me in jail for a long time unless I give you up.
C: HULL
D: Do it.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: I can't. So, I've got to get away. Far away. But I need money.
C: HULL
D: Money? I got money...
E: laughs
N: He empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the Winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow.
S: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
N: Hull putting Betty into an airport limousine.
C: HULL
D: International terminal. I'll meet you there in a week.
E: to the driver to Betty
N: She kisses him. He's about to close the door. She stops it.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: You know the first time, when I saw you in the bar...?
C: HULL
D: You wouldn't even look at me.
E: smiles at the memory
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: 'Cause I knew what you were thinking. You were judging me.
C: HULL
D: No, I wasn't, I was...
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: You were. Your eyes were like an angel in my heart telling me I should be good, and I didn't want to hear it. This news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, and the sweetness is more than he can bear.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: (continuing) That's you, too. Maybe this is you, I don't know, but I know that's you. She closes the door. The car pulls away. In an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio.
S: EXT. A LATIN AMERICAN CONSULATE - DAY
N: A limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges RENALDO GUZMAN, 55, and his wife, 25. They're shown into the consulate. The limousine pulls out onto the street and parks. Gopher appears, knocks on the driver's window. It comes down. They chat briefly in Spanish. Gopher opens up a cellular phone.
S: INT. A HOTEL ROOM - SANTA MONICA - DAY
N: Overlooking the ocean. Hull pacing nervously, Elias relaxed, reading the paper.
C: HULL
D: What if we forget all this? Take ten million each and disappear. Leave the country. New identities, new lives...
C: ELIAS
D: What's the matter, John? Having doubts?
C: HULL
D: Yeah.
N: A phone RINGS. Elias picks up his own cellular.
C: ELIAS
D: Yes... Where?... No! No way... We pick the time and place... Otherwise no meet... Got a pencil?
E: looks to Hull who nods his agreement
S: EXT. CONSULATE - LIMO - DAY
N: Gopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver. He walks away... AROUND THE CORNER As he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him. Gopher is surprised and not pleased.
S: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Where Hull and Elias left the Winnebago. Guzman's limo approaches. Frank, the attendant, waves it on.
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
N: The limo climbs the ramps until it comes to Elias's car, parked where the Winnebago was; the Winnie is nowhere in sight. The limo pulls alongside. Hull and Elias get out. Molto gets out of the limo. Then Renaldo Guzman.
C: ELIAS
D: We have a proposal to make. We regret what happened to your nephew...
C: GUZMAN
D: Say what you have to say.
C: ELIAS
D: We all know that your cousin's business is coming to an end. Costs have climbed while profits and the market --
N: Guzman waves: get to the point.
C: ELIAS
D: We have developed a new product: simpler, cheaper to manufacture, superior quality and completely synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no refining, no peasants, no importing, no customs agents... Here's a detailed prospectus with anticipated cash flow and so forth.
E: continuing
N: He hands a copy to Guzman and the lawyer.
C: GUZMAN
D: The racist Americans just want to cut us poor Hispanics out of the market.
E: to Molto, teasing Elias
C: ELIAS
D: There are no Americans anymore, Mr. Guzman, you know that. No Hispanics, no Japanese, no blacks, no whites, no anything. There are only rich people and poor people. We're rich, so we're on the same side.
S: EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Taft with Gopher in his car.
C: TAFT
D: Do they have money in there?
C: GOPHER
D: I don't know.
C: TAFT
D: They wouldn't meet here otherwise.
N: Gopher shrugs; a decision: Taft picks up his radio.
C: TAFT
D: Okay, everybody, here's the play...
E: continuing
S: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
C: ELIAS
D: We're prepared to give you 80% of the money. The remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there.
N: He indicates the prospectus that Guzman has been looking through.
C: GUZMAN
D: This looks interesting. I'd have to confirm everything, of course. Do you have a sample of the product?
N: Elias produces one. Guzman gestures to Molto. Molto samples it. Molto's eyes widen.
C: MOLTO
D: Buy it!
C: GUZMAN
D: Where is our money?
N: Elias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago. Molto takes the key, unlocks the back: money. He signals okay to Guzman. Suddenly: SIRENS. Police cars wail into the garage. The THWACK- THWACK and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the roof (though we never see the copter).
C: GUZMAN
D: You set this up.
E: continuing; anger
C: HULL
D: They're after us, not you.
N: Everybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.
S: INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Molto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE.
T: He's cut down.
C: TAFT
D: Where are the rest of them?
E: screaming
S: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
N: Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops. Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...
S: EXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT
N: Strolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy.
C: ELIAS
D: We did it. Twenty million. Twenty fucking million. We're going to have synthetics. We're gonna be rich. We're gonna...
N: Hull stops walking and just stands there.
C: ELIAS
D: What's the matter, John? Be happy. Your whole life has just been solved.
E: continuing
C: VOICE
D: Stop! Police!
E: behind them
N: In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES. The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him. Hull starts toward the figure.
C: ELIAS
D: John, where are you going?
E: heading the other way
N: Taft -- on the ground.
C: HULL
D: Oh, Jesus, no...
N: He drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest.
C: ELIAS
D: John, what the hell are you doing? Let's get out of here.
N: Hull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.
C: HULL
D: He's dying.
E: distraught
C: ELIAS
D: Let him die. Let him die twice. Come one.
N: He pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth. Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him.
C: HULL
D: [Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained policeman would say in this situation.] Get help.
E: to Elias
C: ELIAS
D: Are you kidding me?
C: TAFT
D: Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop, aren't you?
E: to Hull, getting it
C: HULL
D: Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...
E: with difficulty, as if against his will
C: ELIAS
D: Oh, really? Where's you badge?
E: laughs
C: HULL
D: I don't have one. I'm undercover. Get help, David.
C: ELIAS
D: John, that's a cop. He tried to kill you.
C: HULL
D: He didn't know.
C: ELIAS
D: Oh, he didn't know. I don't know. Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think you're a cop because... because...
C: HULL
D: Drop the gun, put your hands against the car. Spread your legs... Police!
N: Taft grunts once, stiffens.
C: HULL
D: My God! Please...
E: continuing
N: The pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR.
C: ELIAS
D: Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a cop.
N: Hull keeps doing CPR.
C: ELIAS
D: We've still got the money. We put it into Randy's chemistry set. In five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum. You'll be one of the richest black men in America. Richer than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you got it? You think the white ones were honest?
E: continuing
N: Hull keeps working on Taft.
C: ELIAS
D: Is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness? Let me do you a favor.
E: continuing
N: He puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street.
C: ELIAS
D: Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme reaction.
E: continuing
N: Hull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man. Hull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off, beating him with a gun.
C: POLICEMAN
D: Fucking nigger...
S: INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY
N: Hull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver.
C: HULL
D: What about Guzman?
C: CARVER
D: He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo. At least you got Gallegos.
C: HULL
D: Elias did. And everything goes on as before.
C: CARVER
D: That's the drug game. Plus a change... I want you to come back to work for me. You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were.
C: HULL
D: Who was I, Ger?
C: CARVER
D: Does anyone really know?
C: HULL
D: I have other things to do.
C: CARVER
D: Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?
N: Hull looks at him; how did he know?
C: CARVER
D: I'm God, remember?
E: continuing
N: He beckons him. He walks him over to a cell. Through a one- way window they see: BETTY alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched.
C: CARVER
D: Go back to work, she walks out of here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple counts, and I'll see to it the judge runs them consecutively.
N: Hull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically.
S: INT. ANOTHER ROOM
N: Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. The only deviation is Hull in prison blues. The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being watched.
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: They want me to testify against you. I said I wouldn't.
C: HULL
D: You have to. It's all set up. That's how you're getting off.
N: She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult it is to get back to an honorable life. He takes her hand.
C: HULL
D: My father didn't have a heart attack.
E: continuing; with difficulty
N: She looks at him.
C: HULL
D: He was shot robbing a liquor store. Trying to rob it. I lied about that.
E: continuing
T: MCCUTCHEON
N: Baby, why are you telling me this?
C: HULL
D: I had to start somewhere... There're other things you don't know...
N: AN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY Silent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of tissue in the iris, blocking our view.
S: EXT. ROOM - DAY
N: Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.
S: EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY
N: A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party. When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot. He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, they walk together.
C: CARVER
D: Betty walked out of court free this morning. That's my side of the deal.
C: HULL
D: You two run on ahead.
E: to the children
N: They do. Hull watches them go.
C: CARVER
D: Her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up. I want you to stay away from her altogether.
C: HULL
D: You know the difference between a black man and a nigger?
N: Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.
C: HULL
D: The nigger's the one who'd even think about doing what you tell him.
E: continuing
N: He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver whispers after him:
C: CARVER
D: Don't blow your cover.
T: FADE OUT.
N: THE END
