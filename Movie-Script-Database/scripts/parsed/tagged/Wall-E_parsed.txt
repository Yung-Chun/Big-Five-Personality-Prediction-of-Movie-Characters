S: EXT. SPACE
T: FADE IN:
N: Stars. The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays. "Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..." More stars. Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas... A single planet. Drab and brown. Moving towards it. Pushing through its polluted atmosphere. "...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
S: EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
N: A range of mountains takes form in the haze. Moving closer. The mountains are piles of TRASH. The entire surface is nothing but waste. "...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..." A silhouetted city in the distance. What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash. Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high. Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues. They go on for miles.
S: EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
N: "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..." Something moving on the ground far below. A figure at the foot of a trash heap. A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash. Rusted, ancient.
T: Cute.
N: Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting. Mini-shovel hands collect junk. Scoop it into his open chassis. His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste. A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E) Wall-E spits out a cube of trash. Stacks it with the others. Something catches his eye. Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack. A hubcap. The sun reflects off it. Wall-E checks the sky. ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON The sun sets through the smoggy haze. "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --" He places the hubcap in his compactor. Presses a button on his chest. The song stops playing. The end of a work day. Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back. Whistles for his pet COCKROACH. The insect hops on his shoulder. They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
S: EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
N: Wall-E travels alone. Traverses miles of desolate waste. Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather. Passes haunting structures buried within the trash. Buildings, highways, entire cities... Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO. "Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life. There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate. CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over. Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile. Wall-E's old treads are threadbare. Practically falling apart. Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach. He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS. Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
S: EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
N: Wall-E now sports the newer treads. Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS. The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
C: BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER
D: Too much garbage in your face? There's plenty of space out in space! BNL starliners leaving each day. We'll clean up the mess while you're away.
E: V.O. Ad #1: BNL logo over trash Ad #2: starliner in space Ad #3: starliners take off from Earth Ad #4: WALL-E units wave goodbye
S: EXT. EDGE OF THE CITY
N: Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass. Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD. CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER. Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
C: BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER
D: The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom". Spend your five year cruise in style. Waited on 24 hours a day by our fully automated crew, while your Captain and Autopilot chart a course for non-stop entertainment, fine dining. And with our all-access hover chairs, even Grandma can join the fun! There's no need to walk! "The Axiom". Putting the "star" in Executive Starliner.
E: V.O.
N: The BNL CEO appears at the end. Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"- tier.
N: The holographic billboard powers off. Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance. The mammoth structure sits across the bay. Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley. ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK. A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements. A "Buy N Large" logo on its side. Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck. Pulls on a lever. The back lowers. Wall-E motors up the ramp.
S: INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
N: Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls. KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere. The tired robot removes his newfound treads. Ahh... Home. Wall-E motors down the center aisle. Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER. Jury-rigged to an iPod. Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!" The image is very poor quality. Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC). The same song Wall-E worked to.
C: WALL-E
D: [Hums POYSC]
N: Wall-E opens his cooler. Newfound knickknacks. Pulls out the hubcap from his chest. Looks back at the TV. Mimics the dancers on the screen. Pretends the hubcap is a hat. Continues to unpack: A spork. A Rubik's Cube (unsolved). A Zippo Lighter. He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves. They rotate until an empty space appears. His new items are lovingly added to the shelf. The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION. A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video. Wall-E is drawn to it. Presses his "Record" button. ON TV SCREEN Two lovers sing gently to one another. They kiss...hold hands... Wall-E tilts his head as he watches. Curious. Holds his own hands.
S: EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Wall-E motors outside. Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out. Pauses to take in the night sky. STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze. Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest. The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays. The wind picks up. A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest. He looks out into the night. A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay... Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck. IOTAM still gently playing. ...The massive wave of sand roars closer... Wall-E raises the door. Pauses. WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside. The door shuts just as the storm hits. Obliterates everything in view.
S: INT. TRUCK - SAME
N: Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter. Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie). Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in. It happily dives in. Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube. Backs into an empty shelf space. Rocks it like a cradle... ...and shuts down for the night. Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
S: INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
N: Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING". He wakes. Unboxes. Groggy and lifeless. Stumbles outside.
S: EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
N: The morning sun. Wall-E fully exposed in its light. His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield. A solar collector. His CHARGE METER chimes full. Solar panels fold away into hiding. Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler. Heads off to work. ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach. Horrified, Wall-E reverses. Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread. The cockroach simply pops back to life. No biggie. Ready to go. Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
S: EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
N: A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS: - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage. CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor. A cube lands by the cockroach. - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage. Unsure what it's for. Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses. Tosses it in his cooler. - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS. Presses the remote lock. Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS. - Plays with a paddle ball. The ball keeps smacking him in the face. He doesn't like it. - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE. Throws out the ring. Keeps the case. The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
C: ...A RUBBER DUCKY... ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
D: ...An OLD BOOT... ...A TROPHY...
N: - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Activates it. FOAM blasts in his face. It's tossed far, far away from his cooler. - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid. Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself. Now what? - CU on fridge door. A WELDING BEAM moves down its center. It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES. The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals... ...a SMALL PLANT in its early stage of growth. Wall-E is entranced. Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it. CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot. Dusts dirt off the leaves.
S: EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
N: Robot and faithful cockroach return home. Wall-E stops short of the threshold. Stares at the ground. Continues staring. A RED DOT quivers on the dirt. A single laser point of light. Wall-E moves to touch it... ...The dot races along the ground. Wall-E drops his Igloo. Chases after the dot.
S: EXT. EMPTY BAY
N: The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse. He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice MANY LASER POINTS coming from every direction. All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain. Triangulating towards a center. Wall-E's dot suddenly stops. Slowly he reaches for it. Can't grab it. Just light. ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him. The ground shakes. Wall-E becomes confused. Doesn't see above him. The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover. A noise. Building. Rocket engines. Wall-E senses he should look to the sky. Now THREE SUNS are descending on him. Wall-E runs for it. An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path. A second column of fire. A third. Trapped. Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him. Working fast. Noise deafening. Heat rising. Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground... ...Then suddenly quiet. Smoke clears. CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt. Glows red hot from the heat. Trembles with fright. Everything in shadow. Something very big looms over him. Wall-E climbs out of his hole. Bangs his head on metal. WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP. Rests ominously in the empty bay. A PORTAL on its underside opens. Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide. Nowhere to go. He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up. A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem. Scans the surface. Wall-E creeps closer for a better look. The device unfolds. Wall-E boxes up again. A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem. ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device. Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons. The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal... ...a PROBE ROBOT. It hovers gracefully above the ground. White. Egg-shaped. Blue-lit eyes. Female. Eve. Wall-E is transfixed. Inches closer. Watches Eve from behind the device. Tilts his head. Time stops. She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. Eve hovers over the ground. A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel. Fans out 180 degrees. Scans random objects and areas. The device rises back into the ship. Exposes Wall-E. He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock. Never takes his eyes off Eve. Watches her float away from the ship. ...from the ship? The ship! Engines roar back to life. Wall-E digging furiously. The rocket takes off. Smoke clears. Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground. Looks for Eve. She is watching the ship rise into the clouds. Waits until it is completely out of sight... ...then Eve rises high up into the air. She flies around the bay. Soars like a graceful bird. Does loops in the sky. Zooms right past Wall-E's rock. He is hypnotized. Eve descends gently to the ground... Wall-E sneaks up closer. Hides behind another boulder. Slips. Makes a NOISE. Instantly, Eve whips around. Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON. Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens. ...Smoke clears...All quiet. Eve, now cold and dangerous. Scans the area. No sign of life. All business again. Hovers away to probe more of the planet. ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock. Trembles uncontrollably.
S: EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
N: Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash. Scans random areas. Wall-E spies from the shadows. Too frightened to approach. She moves on. He follows.
S: EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
N: Eve probes a mound of tires. Wall-E hiding nearby. He flinches at the sight of HIS COCKROACH innocently approaching Eve from behind. She spins around. Blasts the insect. Wall-E is gut-punched. The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater. Unscathed. Still curious. Eve finds the insect intriguing. Lowers her arm. The end separates into individual hovering sections... ...A HAND. She lets the insect crawl up her arm. Wiggles into her workings. It tickles.
C: EVE
D: [Giggles]
N: Wall-E relaxes. CHUCKLES privately. Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location. Locks onto him. Arm converts to laser cannon. Fires rapidly. Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts. Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him. Wall-E now exposed. Nowhere to hide. Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably. Eve holds her fire.
C: EVE
D: [Identify yourself.]
E: electronic hums
N: She slowly approaches Wall-E's box. Keeps her gun trained on him.
C: EVE
D: [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
E: electronic hums
N: Wall-E peeks out from his box. Doesn't understand a thing she says. Doesn't care. Can't believe she's real. The cockroach climbs down her gun arm. Jumps onto his master. Eve scans Wall-E. A RED LIGHT appears on her chest. Buzzes "negative". He's not what she's looking for. She retracts her gun arm. Hovers off. Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
C: WALL-E
D: [Sigh.]
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
N: LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS Eve scans through the market. Wall-E follows from a safe distance. A stray puppy-dog. Eve glances over at him. Wall-E panics. Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS. Creates an avalanche. They chase him down a flight of stairs. Wall-E reaches the exit doors. Won't open! Carts pig pile on top of him.
S: EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
N: Wall-E perched on the roof. Patiently watches Eve fly. She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight. Eve comes in for a landing below. Shuts down for the night. Wall-E waits. Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape. Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground. Eve doesn't wake. Wall-E creeps up to her. Opens his arms wide... ...and measures her. Turns to a pile of trash. Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
N: Eve powers up again. Does a double take. A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her. She hovers away, unimpressed. Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES. Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration. They roll on top of him. SONG ENDS MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING - Scans a car engine. Negative. Slams the hood shut. - Scans a Port-A-Potty. Negative. Slams the door shut. - Scans an Apollo capsule. Negative. Slams the hatch shut. - Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD. Negative. Slams the lid shut.
S: EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
N: Eve hovers over the freighter. Frustrated. Not finding what she's looking for. Wall-E eavesdrops from afar. Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET. Gets stuck. Wrestles to free herself. Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP. The reaction startles Wall-E. Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor. She gives up. Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches. Sits at the other end of the anchor. Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck. Then... ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her. Musters the courage to speak, when -- She suddenly turns to him:
C: EVE
D: [So what's your story?]
E: hums
N: Wall-E falls backwards with surprise. Me? Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
C: EVE
D: [Directive?] [Directive?]
E: German Japanese
C: WALL-E
D: [Huh?]
C: EVE
D: [Directive?] Directive?
E: Swahili English
C: WALL-E
D: [Oh, I understand that!]
E: beeps
C: EVE
D: Directive?
N: Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash. Scoops it into his compactor. Proudly spits out a cube. Points to Eve.
C: WALL-E
D: Di...rec...t--
E: struggles to speak
C: EVE
D: Directive?
N: Wall-E nods.
C: EVE
D: Classified.
C: WALL-E
D: [Oh. Sorry.]
E: beeps
N: She scans his CHEST LOGO.
C: EVE
D: Name?
C: WALL-E
D: W-wally? ...Wall-E.
E: struggles again
C: EVE
D: Wwww-aaaa-leee...
E: smooth; almost perfect
N: Wall-E nearly melts. She says his name so beautifully. Moves closer.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E. Eve.
E: giggles
N: Wall-E tries to repeat it:
C: WALL-E
D: Eeee...?
C: EVE
D: Eve.
E: slower
C: WALL-E
D: Eeeaaah?
C: EVE
D: Eeeve. Eeeve.
C: WALL-E
D: Eee--vah!
N: She giggles again. Wall-E likes making her giggle.
C: WALL-E
D: Eee-vah! Ee --
C: EVE
D: Eve.
N: The wind kicks up. The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest. He moves to grab her.
C: WALL-E
D: Eee-vah!
E: Gasp!
C: EVE
D: [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
E: hums
N: She draws her gun on him. Doesn't understand the danger. The sandstorm rushes up behind her. Too late. Wall-E collapses into a box. The storm hits full force. Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E? Wall-E?
N: WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust. Calmly takes Eve's hand.
S: INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
N: The back door lowers. A rush of wind and sand. Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door. She coughs up dust. Wall-E hits a switch... Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space. His racks of oddities painted in colored light. An air of enchantment. Eve is taken aback.
C: WALL-E
D: [Come on in.]
E: beeps
N: She drifts through the sea of knickknacks. Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH. Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down. He is compelled to show her everything. Hands her an eggbeater... ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)... ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)... ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)... ...his Hello Dolly tape. Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
C: WALL-E
D: [My tape!!]
E: loud beeps
N: He grabs it back. Protective. Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work. The movie eventually appears on the TV. Plays a clip of POYSC. Wall-E is relieved.
C: WALL-E
D: [What do you think?]
E: beeps
N: Mimics the dancing for Eve. Encourages her to try. She clumsily hops up and down. Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything. Wall-E politely stops her.
C: WALL-E
D: [How `bout we try a different move?]
E: beeps
N: Spins in a circle. Arms out. Eve copies. Spins faster, and faster... Too fast. Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves. Eve helps him up from the mess. Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off. Dangles from two wires. Eve GASPS with concern. Wall-E placates her.
C: WALL-E
D: [It's fine.]
E: beeps
N: Feels his way to the rack of shelves. Rotates them until... ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear. Replaces his broken eye with a new one. Eve is relieved. She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION. Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME. Wall-E freezes. He had no idea it could do that. Moves closer to inspect it... ON WALL-E It's the closest he's ever been to Eve. She remains focused on the lighter. Wall-E stares up at her. ...The tiny flame flickering between them... ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background... Suddenly, he is moved to express his love. Musters the courage to open his fingers... ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers... -- Eve turns and looks at him. Wall-E instantly chokes. Pulls his hand back. Eve becomes intrigued with the TV. Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM... Wall-E watches her. His infatuation still palpable. Then he remembers...
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
N: He rushes to his shelves. Eve watches him rummage through junk. A drum falls down on his head. She giggles, charmed by it all. Something about Wall-E... She is drawn back to the lovers on TV... ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand. A tap on her shoulder. She turns to find Wall-E holding something. The plant. Eve immediately locks onto it. Drops the lighter. In a flash... ...her chest opens... ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away... ...stores it inside her... Then she shuts down completely. Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest. Wall-E is stunned. What'd I do? Waves his hand in front of her face.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
N: Knocks on her chest plate. No response. Wall-E panics. Gently shakes her.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
N: Still no response.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah? ...Ee-vah?!
N: CAMERA MOVES IN on the blinking green light...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
N: The morning sun. Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot. Aims her hovering form to face the sun. Waits. MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE: - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat. - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon. Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve. Gets struck by lightning. Holds up another umbrella. Gets struck again. - A SANDSTORM blows through. Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof. Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve. - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest. Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY. Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY. Tries to connect the other end to hers. An automatic defense system blows him off truck. - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk. Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE. Uses an industrial tire as a boat. Rows like a gondolier with a road sign. - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve. Watches the SUNSET. Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can. Tries to pull out her hand to hold it. It snaps back into place, trapping his hand. END OF MONTAGE
S: EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof. The blank Eve floating next to him. Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her. Still no response. Finally, he gives up.
C: WALL-E
D: [defeated sigh]
S: EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
N: Wall-E loads up his cooler. Checks on Eve one more time. Still nothing... Heads off to work, defeated.
S: EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
N: Wall-E simply going through the motions. No spirit in him at all. Stops. Pulls out the Zippo lighter. Flicks it a few times. A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame. Distant rumbling. Wall-E looks in the direction of his home. A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
C: WALL-E
D: [Oh no.]
E: beeps
S: EXT. TRASH ALLEY - DAY
N: Wall-E racing as fast as he can. The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
S: EXT. TRUCK - DAY
N: The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck. A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof. Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold. Wall-E racing in the distance.
C: WALL-E
D: EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
N: Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp. Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship. The cargo doors slam shut. The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up. Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship. Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him. Leads it back to the top of the hill.
C: WALL-E
D: [Stay.]
E: beeps
N: The insect mopes. Droops its little antennae. Wall-E motors back down to the rocket... BASE OF RECON SHIP The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE. Preparation for launch...
S: INT. RECON SHIP
N: Eve is secured into a slot. Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES. All dormant. Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT. The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window... OUTSIDE THE SHIP ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side. The ship's engines ignite. Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support. The rocket takes off into space.
S: EXT. TOP OF HILL
N: The cockroach watches his master go.
S: EXT. RECON SHIP
N: The spaceship roars through the sky. Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's. He looks ahead. SCREAMS. HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES litter the outer atmosphere. The ship bursts through the layer.
S: EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
N: The recon ship breaks free of the planet. Its boosters shut down. Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE. Looks back at his planet.
C: WALL-E
D: Oooh...
N: Weightlessness takes effect. Wall-E almost floats away. Grabs hold of the ship. Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
C: WALL-E
D: E-vah!
N: No response. She remains shut down. Wall-E points out at the stars. It is the most spectacular light show possible. And Wall-E has a front row seat. MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES - The ship flies past the MOON. A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER. "BNL Outlet Coming Soon." - The ship passes by the SUN. Wall-E pops open his solar panels. Instantly recharges. - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS. Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
N: A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space. Wall-E is mesmerized by it. Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead. A planet? No. A starliner. Gigantic in size. The "AXIOM". The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
S: INT. DOCKING BAY
N: TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in. It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck. The impact knocks Wall-E off. He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace. Suddenly the entire dock comes to life. Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear. ...Rise from the floor... ..Lower from the ceiling... It's a cacophony of automation. They all attend to the ship. EVE and four other probes slide out of the ship's side. Suspended in a horizontal rack. Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him. She remains shut down. Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah... ?
N: A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock. A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
C: M-O
D: [Hold up.]
E: beeps
N: Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear. Depict their exact path of action.
C: M-O
D: [Okay. Go.]
E: beeps
N: They file out on the line. A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack. M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready. M-O scans Eve. ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant." M-O is disgusted. Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean. A VACU-BOT follows after him. Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off. The cleaning crew waits for probe #2. Wall-E studies the routine. Figures out a way to climb down to Eve. When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3. The crane grabs him instead. M-O turns around to clean the next probe. Wall-E is lowered in front of him. Boxes up. Confused, M-O scans him. ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant." M-O is horrified by such filth. A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
C: M-O
D: [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
N: He scrubs Wall-E full force. Wall-E's front panel pushes him away. Confused, M-O moves to clean him again. Wall-E backs away. Leaves a DIRT TRAIL. M-O curses:
C: M-O
D: [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
N: M-O furiously scrubs the floor. Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy. ON FAR WALL Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall. Act like hovering caution signs. A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE. He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face. Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow. BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E M-O just finishes cleaning the floor. Wall-E is fascinated. Impishly makes another mark. M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
C: M-O
D: [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
N: Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face. M-O loses it. Scrubs his own face. Gopher and his steward escort arrive. The cleaning crew stand at attention. Wall-E boxes back up with the probes. Gopher begins scanning each probe. Moves down the line. Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe... Stops -- Wait a minute. Turns back. Wall-E is gone. Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds... Reaches Eve. Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her. Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT -- The entire dock goes to "Code Green"! Alarms sound. Green lights flash. All automation stops. In rapid succession... ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher... ...A crane-bot loads Eve... ...Curved energy bands lock her down... ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat... It's all moving too fast for Wall-E. Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
N: Wall-E chases after them. Grabs onto the back of the transport. They disappear into the elevator. The cleaning crew files out. Follow their lines back to their hold. M-O stops short. Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path. ON M-O'S DISPLAY Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" The tracks lead to the elevator. M-O's neurosis takes over. Must clean dirt. He makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
S: INT. ELEVATOR
N: Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass. Wall-E hidden behind the transport. Peeks at Eve. Pets her blank faceplate.
C: WALL-E
D: [It'll be okay, Eve.]
E: quiet beeps
N: The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
S: INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
N: DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway. All following glowing lines on the floor. Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth. Tries to process it all. Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic... ...without him! Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic. Timidly attempts to merge. Sticks out one tread... -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP. Wall-E boxes up. Guns it. Weaves across all the lines on the floor. Bounces off robots like bumper cars. Barely able to navigate the chaos. Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION. Scans for Eve... ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign... ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute... ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
C: WALL-E
D: EE-VAH!
N: Wall-E chases after them.
S: INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: Wall-E flies up the ramp. Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR. It blocks his way. Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers A HUMAN PASSENGER sitting, reclined, in the chair. He is large, round and soft - like a big baby. Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit. The chair seems to be steering itself. Guided by floor lines, just like the robots. Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face. He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen: PASSENGER #1 Well, I've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space. PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN) Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want to do that. PASSENGER #1 Well then what do you want to do? ON WALL-E He looks over his shoulder. Passenger #2 is floating right next to them. Isolated in his own hover chair. Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby. PASSENGER #2 I don't know. Something. Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence. They all exit the hallway. Merge into the... ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD Wall-E is in awe. Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides. THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space. All reclined and riding on hover chairs. MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions. Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. Absolutely no reason to ever get up. No purpose. Every one of them engrossed in their video screens. Cocooned in virtual worlds. Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. The controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all... ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers: The CHATTER is deafening. No one notices Wall-E at all. He drives into the endless human traffic.
C: MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
D: Bot, over here!
N: A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger. Puts a fresh drink in her open hand. Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
C: MISC. PASSENGERS
D: I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel. You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're back. I can hear you now...
N: They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS) A city-sized, mall-like environment. All under a GIANT DOME. The ceiling simulates the sun and sky. A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Buy N Large. Everything you need to be happy. Your day is very important to us.
E: V.O.
N: Wall-E is gobsmacked. A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him. Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
C: JOHN
D: Hey, Drink-bot.
N: Wall-E shies away. John reaches farther out with the cup.
C: JOHN
D: Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
N: Reaches too far. John falls to the floor. Flails like an upside down turtle. Unable to stand on his baby legs. Instantly, SIRENS. Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive. Block John's accident. EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor. Redirect the hover chair traffic. John reaches out for assistance. Nobody notices. Just drive past.
C: JOHN
D: Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
C: STEWARD
D: Please remain stationary. A service-bot will be here to assist you momentarily.
N: Suddenly John begins to rise.
C: JOHN
D: Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
N: Wall-E lifting him up from behind. Loads him back onto his chair. John doesn't know how to react. Wall-E waves hello.
C: WALL-E
D: Wall-E!
C: JOHN
D: Uhh... John.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
C: JOHN
D: Uh no, John.
N: Wall-E scans the concourse. Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL. He races after them. Abandons the stunned John.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
C: JOHN
D: Bye...Wall-E.
E: small wave
N: ON MONORAIL It pulls out of the station. Wall-E leaps on. Barely catches the last car. It glides down the concourse.
S: INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
N: A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS. All wearing matching BNL ONESIES. Motionless in their HOVER RINGS. They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
C: NANNY-BOT
D: "A"! "A" is for "Axiom", your home sweet home. "B"! "B" is for "Buy N Large", your very best friend...
N: OUT THE WINDOW Wall-E's monorail glides past. ON MONORAIL Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery. Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by. Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
E: V.O.
N: Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers. They all slurp from similar cups. Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON. BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Feel beautiful.
E: V.O.
C: BEAUTICIAN-BOTS
D: ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
E: pre-recorded lines
N: They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT. ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's the new red!
E: V.O.
C: MONORAIL PASSENGERS
D: Oooohh...
N: Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons. Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
C: WALL-E
D: Whoa.
N: Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel. INSIDE THE TUNNEL Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him. Spots Eve on the other side. Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary. But her chair moves backwards. Smashes Wall-E against the back wall. No way getting past her. Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention. She's oblivious. Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
C: MARY
D: Date?! Don't get me started! Every holo-date I've been on has been a virtual disaster! If I could just meet one who wasn't so superficial. There are no good men out there!...
E: derisive snort
N: Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest. Accidentally breaks it off.
C: MARY
D: ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled through them all -- What the --?
E: CONT'D Gasp
N: Mary's chair shorts out. ...holo-screen shuts off... ...jumpsuit defaults back to red... For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view. Her eyes slowly dilate. It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
C: MARY
D: Huh... ?
E: mesmerized
N: Her gaze falls on Wall-E. He waves politely.
C: WALL-E
D: Wall-E.
C: MARY
D: M-mary.
E: beat
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah.
N: He points to Eve on the other side of Mary. Gestures he'd like to get by. She is slow to understand.
C: MARY
D: Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
N: Mary moves her hover chair back. Wall-E rolls over to Eve. Pats her protectively.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah...
S: INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
N: The monorail emerges into "First Class." A vast, circular plaza of pools. Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments. Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside. All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.
C: POOLSIDE PASSENGER
D: Shade.
E: claps; umbrella-bot opens
N: ON MONORAIL It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA. The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower. The passengers exit. Follow their respective lines. Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower. Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor. ON MARY She is the last to exit the car. Doesn't follow any lines. Excited by her newfound awareness. Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
C: MARY
D: I didn't know we had a pool!
S: INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
N: Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall. A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end. A bridge elevator behind him. Blocked by a force field gate. The transport pulls up to the typing-bot. Gopher BEEPS. The typing-bot responds by typing. Slowly. One...button...at...a...time... Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open. The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator. Notices Wall-E hiding at the back. Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close. The elevator shoots up to the bridge. The typing-bot looks at its hand. Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture. Huh. Never done that before. Tries it some more... INSIDE THE ELEVATOR Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck. Marvels at it all. His view suddenly goes dark. The elevator doors open on...
S: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
N: The large circular room is dimly lit. Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other. A massive console wraps around its entirety. Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights. A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers. Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps. Suddenly the wheel disengages. The autopilot (AUTO). A single camera eye lights up its center. A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling. Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes. Auto eyes Eve. Scans her. Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows. Auto detects Eve's plant light. Goes still... Begins computing rapidly. The number "A113" flashes on his lens. An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher. Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous. Without warning, Auto heads in his direction. Wall-E boxes up. A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him. Irises open, like a trapdoor. Wall-E drops...
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
N: ...and hits the floor hard in the room below. Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING. Auto lowers through the portal. A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
N: Shoots back up. The portal closes. Wall-E peeks out of his box. ON WALL-E'S POV PAN across the nautical-themed cabin. One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS. Their years of service listed below. The autopilot in the background of each picture. Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other. From human to gelatinous blob. We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT. A blobby Captain. It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed. He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm. Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake. Activates the POYSC SAMPLE. It plays loud. The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
C: CAPTAIN
D: -- All hands on deck!!
N: Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as... ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry... ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT... ...The Captain's bed automatically raises... ...Forms into a hover chair... The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
C: BEAUTICIAN-BOT
D: Morning! Just a trim?
E: pre-recorded
N: Wall-E blends in with the primping. Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
C: CAPTAIN
E: Giggles
N: Lines light on the floor. Lead his chair automatically to the elevator. Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close. ON THE BRIDGE Elevator doors swish open. The Captain still half-asleep. Claps his hands twice. On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console. Pours a cup. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers. The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH. Leads him over to the coffee. Wall-E stays lockstep behind him. Auto glides over to the Captain.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir --
C: CAPTAIN
D: Coffee.
N: Wall-E hides under the console just in time. The Captain reaches for his coffee. Makes a minimal effort. Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward... ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir, the annual --
N: The Captain gives Auto the hand. Sips his coffee.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Protocol, Auto. First things first. Computer, status report.
E: to the room
N: His chair automatically arcs along the console. SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.
C: CAPTAIN SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Unchanged...unchanged... Mechanical systems?...Reactor unchanged...unchanged... core temperature?...Passenger unchanged...unchanged... count?...Regenerative food unchanged... buffet?...Jacuzzi Ph balance... Atmospheric conditions...laundry service volume...
E: sips coffee
N: ON WALL-E He eyes Eve on the transport across the room. Has to get to her. But Auto is right above him. Can't move.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Captain...
N: Auto calls up a screen on the console. Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe. Waits patiently for the Captain to notice. Finally, the Captain turns...
C: CAPTAIN
D: Okay, Auto.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir, the annual reconnaissance has --
N: ...but then notices the time.
C: CAPTAIN
D: 12:30?! Auto, why didn't you wake me for the morning announcements?
E: disappointed sigh
N: He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge. Wall-E nearly collides with him. Ducks back under the console.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship.
N: Grabs a large dial. TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it. Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise. OUT ON LIDO DECK - The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE. - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS. - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up. An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom. A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN. Displays a live video feed of the Captain. The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be... ...doing the exact same thing...they were doing...
E: ON INTERCOM unmotivated deflates
N: Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING. The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your free... ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup. Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button?
E: INTERCOM snaps out of ennui hard to pronounce mic feedback whine
N: BACK ON THE BRIDGE The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console. It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Captain?
E: O.S.
N: The Captain turns to Auto. For the first time he notices Eve. Finally. Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Probe One has returned positive.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Positive?
N: Auto re-activates Eve. She wakes. Rises to salute the Captain. Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy. She's okay! He is compelled to head straight for her...
C: CAPTAIN
D: But...no probe's ever come back positive... ...before.
E: looks at flashing button
N: The flashing button is practically calling to him. Can't resist. Presses it. Instantly SHADES close on all the windows. The room goes dark. ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again... A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him. Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Greetings and congratulations, Captain! If you're seeing this, that means your Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or... ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis!
E: air quotes
N: The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen. Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: That's right, it means it's time to go back home!
C: CAPTAIN
D: Home? W-w-we're going back?
E: nervous
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Now that Earth has been restored to a life-sustaining status, by golly, we can begin "Operation Recolonize"!
N: A section of the console illuminates. An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out... ...into a passing Wall-E's hands. Wall-E immediately boxes up. Holds the manual over his head. The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium. Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover. It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE". Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Simply follow this manual's instructions to place the plant in your ship's holo- detector, and the -- -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate your return to Earth! It's that easy!
E: bad edit
N: ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH) An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge. The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up. A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine. A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth. The Captain listens closely to the instructions. Wall-E paying attention as well.
C: CAPTAIN WALL-E
D: Huh? Huh?
N: Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve. Heads in her direction.
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity, you and your passengers may have suffered some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few laps around your ship's jogging track will get you back in shape in no time.
N: The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We have a jogging track?
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: If you have any further questions just consult your operation manual. See you back home real soon.
N: The transmission ends. The Captain examines the manual. Holds it out in front of him.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Operate... Manuel... Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
E: reads; to himself aloud; cautious
N: Auto intervenes. Clips the corner of the cover with his handle... ...and simply opens the book. The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated. Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Wow... Will you look at that?
N: ON EVE Wall-E taps her shoulder. Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
C: EVE
D: Wall-E?!
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
E: tiny wave
N: Eve is in a state of disbelief. Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
C: EVE
D: [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You can't be here! You're going to get me in trouble!...]
E: hushed; angry
N: Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him. Wall-E just stares at her. Smitten.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah...
E: swoons
N: ON THE CAPTAIN He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Well, let's open her up. Step One. Voice command, "Confirm Acquisition."
E: reads aloud
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Confirm Acquisition.
N: The bridge suddenly jumps to life. Green lights flash. A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling... ...Scans the entire room... ...Identifies Eve... ...Rides along the ceiling rails... ...Stations itself directly above Eve... ...Arms unfold. Position her... ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Voice authorization required.
C: CAPTAIN
D: ...Uh...
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Accepted.
N: A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers. Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve... Her chest lights up. The doors open. The Captain winces... ...and nothing is inside.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Where's the thingie?
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Plant. Right. Right. Where is it? Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you change the text again...
E: checks manual
N: Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual. Eve is stunned. Searches her chest cavity for the plant. Then she remembers...
C: EVE
D: Plant! Wall-E... Wall-E!
E: turns on him
N: Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger. Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty. Picks him up. Scans the floor. Nothing.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
C: EVE
D: [Find it!] PLANT!
E: angry electronics
N: Wall-E scared of her. Starts searching.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Why don't you scan her to be sure.
E: O.S.
N: Eve jumps back to attention. Auto slides up to her. Scans her chest cavity.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is faulty.
C: CAPTAIN
D: So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Negative.
E: shakes his wheel
C: CAPTAIN
D: So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh?
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Correct, Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Well, false alarm!
E: privately relieved
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: False alarm.
E: V.O.
N: Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts. Exits back into the ceiling. The shades rise. Lights go back on.
C: CAPTAIN
D: The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward.
N: Eve turns. Excuse me? Gopher hops to attention. Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM. Loads her back onto the transport...
C: CAPTAIN
D: Have them run diagnostics on her. Make sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
N: ...and reveals WALL-E. Everyone stares at him. Long awkward pause. Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain. Shakes his hand.
C: WALL-E
D: Wall-E.
N: Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm. The Captain stares at it. Turns to Auto.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
S: INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
N: The elevator opens. Gopher's transport drives out. Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands. The typing-bot has now mastered waving. Waves an enthusiastic goodbye. Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
N: She gives him the cold shoulder. Refuses to speak to him. Wall-E shrinks. The transport exits the lobby. BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
C: CAPTAIN
D: Analyze.
N: The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light. It rotates. The captain sits at his vanity console. ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Analysis: foreign contaminant. Substance is a three phase system composed of various combinations of naturally derived solids. Subject is most commonly referred to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth".
N: The last word piques his interest.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Earth?
N: His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Define "Earth"...
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: "Earth" - the surface of the world as distinct from the sky or sea.
N: Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen. Lush, green, colorful, inviting. He's fascinated. Takes it all in.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Wow... Define "sea".
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: "Sea"...
S: EXT. AXIOM/CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
N: THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the Captain. Glued to his screen. Filled with ocean images.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: ...an expanse of salt water that covers most of the Earth's surface and surrounds its land masses...
N: The CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY from the window... ...Moves aft to the Axiom's stern... ...Pushes in...
S: INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
N: M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL. Oblivious to everything around him.
T: Cuts through traffic.
N: Robots crash into each other in his wake. M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past. They hover down a corridor, and enter...
S: INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS
N: It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots. Day care for the malfunctioned. The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS. Dozens line the walls. Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION. Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate. Wall-E shrinks. Watches them systematically check in Eve. Perform an I.D. scan. Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head. A button is pressed on the boot. Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
C: WALL-E
D: [Where are you going?!]
E: beeps
N: The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E. He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him. Races through the ward. Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
C: BEAUTICIAN-BOT
D: Just a trim? Uh huh.
E: pre-recorded
N: She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up. Holds up a mirror. Wall-E gasps.
C: BEAUTICIAN-BOT
D: You look gorgeous.
N: Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm. Placed in an empty force field pen. Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT: ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E... ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face... Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly. Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET. Eve slides past Wall-E. Carried by an orderly-arm. Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM. The frosted glass doors shut.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
S: INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
N: Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots: - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends. The orderly-arms struggle to close it. - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY. It bursts into flames. Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode. A series of tests begin. Eve is annoyed but calm. It's all routine. An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm. OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors. Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE. To him, her arm is being ripped off.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
N: BACK INSIDE WITH EVE The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry. Her insides light up. It tickles.
C: EVE
E: Giggles
N: Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES. OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E Wall-E watches in horror. It looks as if Eve is being tortured. Mistakes the screeching for her screams. Wall-E struggles to free himself. INSIDE WITH EVE She is washed and scrubbed. A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body. It feels good. BACK ON WALL-E It looks as if Eve is being beheaded. He needs to stop the torture. Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field. The barrier shorts out. Wall-E tumbles to the floor. Lands on his "Play" button. POYSC blares across the ward. The Rejects all stop and stare.
C: WALL-E
D: EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
N: Wall-E races to the diagnostics room. Crashes right through the glass doors. Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms. Grabs Eve's separated gun arm. Points it at the orderly-arms.
C: WALL-E
D: [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
E: angry beeps
N: His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style. Doesn't realize... ...he's holding the gun backwards. Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...
E: "Put the gun down..."
N: An orderly lunges at him. Wall-E panics. Shoots! The gun fires backwards. It blasts through the repair ward. Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL. Wall-E shrinks. He knows he's in trouble.
C: EVE
D: WALL-E!
N: The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT. ...All orderly-arms go limp... ...The repair ward doors open up... ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear... The Rejects look at each other for a beat. Then CHEER wildly. We're free! The mob of robots all rush Wall-E. Lift him on their shoulders. Carry their hero out of the ward. Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm. Eve watches in astonishment. This day just gets worse and worse. She flies off after them.
C: EVE
D: WALL-E!
S: EXT. REPAIR WARD/ROBOT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
N: The rejects march Wall-E out the entrance. Their RED "DEFECT" BOOTS all blink. Activate a WARNING LIGHT above the doorway.
T: MATCH CUT TO:
S: INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
N: EMERGENCY LIGHTS blinking. Activate an embedded ROW OF STEWARDS. They pop out of the wall. Race to the repair ward. Sirens wailing.

N: The REJECT MOB stampedes through the halls. Disrupts all robot traffic. Wall-E carried over their heads. Suddenly, the mob stops in front of... ...a BLOCKADE OF STEWARDS.
C: STEWARD
D: Halt.
N: Wall-E's dropped in front of them. Still holds Eve's gun. Cowers. A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer. Show `em who's boss.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
E: stern
N: Eve catches up to them. Flies over to Wall-E. Snatches her arm back. Just as she reattaches her gun... ...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them. ALL AROUND THE SHIP Alarms sound. SCREENS appear, displaying EVE AND WALL-E'S IMAGE. She appears to brandish her gun at camera. Like Bonnie and Clyde. Their faces now on every wall... ...passenger's hover chair... ...cabin... ...hallway...
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots...
N: BACK WITH EVE AND WALL-E The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher). Eve realizes what's about to happen. Grabs Wall-E. Flies over the stewards.
C: STEWARDS
D: Halt. Halt.
N: The mass of rejects take their cue. Robot rebellion! They bust through the steward blockade. ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past. Match them with the "Wanted" screens. Call attention to them. Point. Stewards in hot pursuit. Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY. Lets the stewards pass by. She glances out the porthole... ON EVE'S POV She can see the DOCKING BAY below her. Just under the bay doors... ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS. Eve gets an idea. Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway... INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence. Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Caution: Rogue robots.
E: SCREEN
N: Wall-E points to it.
C: WALL-E
D: [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
E: beeps
N: Eve aims her gun at the screen. Blows it to pieces. Wall-E shrinks into a box. Never mind.
S: INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
N: Dark. The elevator chimes. Eve and Wall-E step out. Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway. Eve approaches "Bay #1". She and Wall-E enter...
S: INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
N: Eve navigates the dark. Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE. Fiddles with some buttons. ON WALL-E He glances down at EVE'S HAND. Privately intertwines his fingers. Maybe now is the right moment...
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah...?
E: quiet
C: FLASH!
D: Banks of controls light up around them.
N: AN ESCAPE POD is revealed at the end of the room. Its hatch automatically opens. Bathes the room with light from its lit interior. Eve turns to Wall-E:
C: EVE
D: Earth.
N: She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN. It displays coordinates to Earth.
C: EVE
D: Earth.
N: She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod. He happily complies. Jumps up on one of the seats. Pats the seat next to him. Aren't you coming? Eve remains at the threshold. Shakes her head. Points to her chest. Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
C: EVE
D: Directive.
N: ...She's not going. This changes everything. Wall-E races out of the pod. Boxes up.
C: WALL-E
D: [Then I'm not going either.]
E: beeps
N: Eve shakes her head.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E.
E: gentle, but firm
N: Carries his box back into the pod. Exits. Wall-E follows her right back out. Drives behind the console. You can't make me. Eve sighs.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E.
E: frustrated
N: The hallway elevator CHIMES. They both look up. Someone is coming. Eve shuts off everything. Lights go out. The pod closes back up. Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall. Blend in with the other wall fixtures. They HEAR something hover into the room. Can't see what it is. Then... An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over the console. Presses buttons. The pod lights up again. The hatch opens. The stranger's SHADOW comes around the console to reveal... GOPHER Eve and Wall-E look at each other. Gopher? They watch from the shadows as... ...Gopher enters the pod... ...opens his chest cavity... ...emits his suspension beam... ...and deposits the PLANT.
C: EVE
D: Plant!
E: excited whisper
N: Gopher exits the pod. CLOSE ON EVE She keeps her eyes on Gopher. Watches him return to the console. She turns to speak to Wall-E -- He's gone.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E?
E: whisper
N: Wall-E is inside the pod. Picks up the plant. Proudly shows it to Eve.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!
E: loud whisper
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
E: louder whisper
N: Too late. Gopher hits a button. The pod door shuts on Wall-E... ...and launches into space. Gopher shuts off the room. Exits. Eve leaps out of the shadows. Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW. Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance. The plant icon on Eve's chest glows. She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK. Enters it like a phone booth. OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK Eve bursts out into space. Rockets after Wall-E.
S: INT. ESCAPE POD
N: Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod. It suddenly reduces speed.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Cruising speed.
E: V.O.
N: He drops to the floor.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: You are now free to move around the cabin.
E: V.O.
N: Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings. Peers out the rear hatch window. Sees the Axiom receding from view.
C: WALL-E
D: [Yikes!]
E: beeps
N: He clambers up into the pilot's seat. Pulls back hard on the throttle. Nothing happens. Looks down at the console. A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
E: V.O.
N: Uh oh. Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button. No change. Pushes every button on the console. Everything activates: ...Lights flash... ...Oxygen masks drop... OUTSIDE THE POD ...Windshield wipers activate... ...Flares fire off... ...Parachutes deploy... BACK INSIDE THE POD
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Ten seconds till self-destruct...
E: V.O.
N: Wall-E panics. Looks for a means of escape. Spots the hatch. Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Shoots himself to the door.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
N: Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER. The hatch won't open! ON EVE She races through space after him. Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES. Eve is gut-punched.
C: EVE
D: No, no, no...
N: She flies towards the debris field, when -- Wall-E whizzes right past her.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vaaaaaah!
N: He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Uses it as a form of propulsion. Eve is consumed with relief. Chases after him. ON WALL-E He points the extinguisher the other way. Attempts to fly back over to her. It's hard to steer... ...They rocket right past each other again...
C: WALL-E
D: [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
E: beeps
N: Eve waits. Wall-E finally has the hang of steering. Fires short bursts. Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve. Gets extinguisher foam in her face. She giggles.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah...
E: "Look what I've got"
N: He opens his compactor door. Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
C: EVE
E: Gasp!
N: ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV ...Sensors zero in on the plant... ...Confirm its authenticity... ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears... ...Draws directions to the bridge... ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"... Eve is ecstatic. She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam. Seals it safely in her chest. Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms. Spins him around.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
E: Laughs
N: Wall-E can't believe his luck. Rests his head on her shoulder. Bliss. Eve stops spinning. Leans her head against his. A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them. A "thank you" kiss. Wall-E's METER spikes. He floats circles in space.
C: WALL-E
E: swoons
C: EVE
D: [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
E: hums
N: She reaches for his hand. Wall-E shakes his head. Holds up his extinguisher instead.
C: WALL-E
D: [I can fly myself.]
E: beeps
N: Kicks on the extinguisher. Spins in a pirouette... ...and flies away. Eve giggles. Chases after him. BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS The two fly around the stern of the ship. Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
C: WALL-E
D: [Try that.]
E: beeps
N: Eve giggles. Matches him move for move. The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship. Weave in and out of the rocket flames. Bank up along the ship's port side. Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
S: INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
N: Passengers hover down the hallway. All focused on their private screens. No one looks out at the stars. ...except for MARY. She has pulled over to the side. Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
C: MARY
D: So many stars.
E: sigh
N: Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
C: MARY
D: Oooh... Hey, that's what's his name --
E: recognizes Wall-E
N: She backs up to wave hello. Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
C: JOHN
D: Hey! What the --
N: Mary leans over to his armrest. Turns off his holo-screen. Points out the window.
C: MARY
D: Look! Look at THAT!
C: JOHN
D: Wha...huh?
E: disoriented
N: Wall-E flies past the window. A wave of recognition hits John. He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
C: JOHN
D: Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh... Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
E: snaps fingers
C: MARY
D: Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
N: They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight. John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest... ...and touches Mary's hand. Both turn towards each other. They make eye contact for the first time. Awkward beat.
C: JOHN
D: Hi.
C: MARY
D: Hi.
N: OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE They soar across the Axiom's bow.
S: INT. BRIDGE
N: Auto busy operating the ship. Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window. Auto turns the SKY DIAL from DAY TO NIGHT. INSIDE THE CONCOURSE The sky dome fast-forwards to evening. PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower. The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark. Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Define "hoe-down".
E: V.O.
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
N: The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research. MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen. Crops, farms, a barn, etc.... An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which lively dancing would take place.
E: V.O.
N: An aperture opens in the ceiling above. Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto! Earth is amazing! These are called "farms". Humans would put seeds in the ground, pour water on them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --
E: points to images
N: Auto shuts off the holo-screen.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Good night, Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
E: annoyed grunt
N: Auto rises back up to the bridge. The aperture shuts. Lights out. The Captain glares at the ceiling. Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Psst! Computer. Define "dancing".
E: the holo-screen lights up
N: BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side. Spiral gracefully around one another.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: "Dancing" - A series of movements, involving two partners, where speed and rhythm match harmoniously with music.
E: V.O.
N: Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam. He lets it float freely out into space. Eve catches him in her arms. Wall-E croons. SONG ENDS Eve scans the Axiom for a way in. Notices SPARKS. Down on the ship's lower hull... CLOSER ON LOWER HULL A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna. Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him. It shuts. Burn-e bangs on the closed door. Stuck outside.
C: BURN-E
D: [Hey! Let me in! Let me in!] [Crap.]
E: beeps looks around
S: INT. LIDO DECK - NIGHT
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido Deck is now closing.
E: V.O.
N: The last few passengers exit the pool area. All wearing the same color blue uniforms... ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool. CLOSE ON FEET They ripple the surface of the pool. John and Mary float over the water's surface. Splash one another playfully.
C: JOHN
D: Hey now. Stop that...
C: MARY
D: Make me .
E: giggles
C: JOHN
D: I didn't know we had a pool.
N: A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower. Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
C: LIFEGUARD-BOT
D: No splashing, no diving.
N: JOHN & MARY (annoyed) Ahh! Go on! John splashes the robot. It shorts out. ON UPPER DECK Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck. Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS. Eve peeks through the towels. Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS. On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance. No way in. A TRASH-BOT passes. Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE. Eve keys in on the chute. It runs all the way up the tower... ...to the bridge. ON WALL-E He stares at EVE'S HAND. Time to seize the moment. Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest. It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker. Puts his hands together... Eve whips around. What's that noise?! Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
C: WALL-E
D: E-vah --
N: Eve immediately shuts off his music. Shoves his hands down.
C: EVE
D: [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
E: hushed hums
N: She places a stack of towels on his head. Gestures for Wall-E to stay put. Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
C: EVE
D: Directive.
N: Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone. Zooms silently across the Lido Deck. Up into the trash chute. CLOSE ON EARTH It sits in space. The AXIOM glides towards it. Something's not right. We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
N: The Captain sits by his window to space. Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
C: CAPTAIN
D: [Rocket noises] Prepare for landing... [Landing noises] We're here everybody! Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased to do it. It's all about you people --
N: ON TRASH CAN NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel. Blows the lid off. The Captain is stunned by this vision. She opens her chest to reveal... ...the plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: How...? How'd you find it?!
E: amazed
N: Eve hovers over to him. Salutes. Formally presents him the plant. He takes it in his hands. Still potted in the old boot. Gazes at it in wonder.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We can go back home...for the first time! What's it like now?
E: laughs
N: Eve shrugs. Doesn't know how to answer.
C: CAPTAIN
D: No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for myself!
N: He turns to his console. Hits a button. A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel. The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device. Plays back images of her time on Earth. A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past. All displayed from Eve's POV: ...Being delivered to Earth... ...Flying above the devastated landscape... ...Blowing up a rock... ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
C: CAPTAIN
D: Wait...that doesn't look like Earth... Where's the blue sky...
N: He looks over to his computer screen. The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display. Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
C: CAPTAIN
D: ...Where's the grass?
N: His face drops. Slumps in defeat. The dream is over. ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays... It stirs the Captain out of his funk. He looks up at the screen. Leans in for a closer look.
C: CAPTAIN
D: ...I know that song... And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
E: observes the dancers' feet
N: A rueful smile grows on his face. He looks down at HIS FOOT It's tapping in time to the music. His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands. He lifts it up. Makes the boot dance.
C: CAPTAIN
D: ...You made it somehow, eh little guy? You didn't give up, did you?
N: As if in response, the plant wilts slightly. A leaf drops.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Oh no, no -- Wait a minute.
E: Gasp! remembers
N: The Captain urgently hovers across the room. Eve left alone. Her recorded memories continue playing... ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment. Eve recognizes the music. Watches the lovers on screen hold hands. Something familiar about the gesture... Looks at her own hands. Slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...Eve's eyes go wide. This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her. Her memories continue on the screen: ...a tap on the shoulder... ...Wall-E presents her the plant -- ...The screen goes BLACK! Then... ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates. Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out: ...protecting her from the rain... ...the sun...the sandstorm... ...keeping watch night and day... ...trying to jump start her heart... ON EVE Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her. Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...
E: soft
N: She looks at her hands again. MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS Still waiting between the towel racks. Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah... [I'll never get it right.]
E: gives up; beeps
N: Becomes impatient. Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE. Sticks his head in.
C: WALL-E
D: EE-VAHH?!
N: No answer. The chute has an endless drop. Wall-E climbs in. Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place. Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters... OUT ON THE UPPER DECK A monorail pulls up. M-O steps off. Still hot on Wall-E's trail. Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby. Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS... ...leading to the trash chute.
C: M-O
D: [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
E: beeps
N: BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS The Captain at his wet bar. Waters the plant in the sink.
C: CAPTAIN
D: There you go little guy. You came a long way for a drink of water... Just needed someone to look after you, that's all --
N: He is struck with a notion. Stares out the window at space for a beat. Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant. Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We have to go back.
E: to himself
N: Activates his chair's call button.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto, come down here!
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Aye-aye, sir.
E: ON SPEAKER
N: Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen: ...playing Pong... ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart... Eve is lost in the moments. So touched.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...
E: smitten MORE
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
E: CONT'D remembers
N: He's still waiting for her. She turns to leave and finds AUTO lowering in front of her. Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand. "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me.
C: CAPTAIN
D: You know what? I should do it myself.
E: not listening
N: Heads for the elevator.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Captain!
N: Auto shoots back upstairs. Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator. Blocks the Captain.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto, get out of my way.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir, we cannot go home.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What are you talking about? Why not?
C: AUTOPILOT
D: That is classified. Captain, give me the plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What do you mean, "classified"? You don't keep secrets from the Captain!
E: holds plant out of reach
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Give me the plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Tell me what's classified!
C: AUTOPILOT
D: The plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
N: It's a stare down. Beat.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Aye-aye, sir.
N: Auto rises back into the ceiling. Lowers down over the vanity console. High speed button pushing. A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears. Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY". The BNL FANFARE plays. Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium. Haggard. Nervous. Wears an emergency oxygen vest. The fanfare plays too long.
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Just cut it off, will ya?! Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well... failed! Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on Earth.
E: to O.S. music stops; forced chuckle
C: CAPTAIN
D: Unsustainable? What?
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize. So just, uh...just stay the course. Rather than try to fix this problem, it'll just be easier if everyone remains in space.
E: dons his life vest
C: CAPTAIN
D: Easier?
E: offended
C: CEO ADVISOR
D: Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
E: O.S.
C: BUY N LARGE CEO
D: Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot. Take control of everything! And do not return to Earth! Repeat! Do not return to Earth! Now let's get the heck out of here.
E: ready to run throws on his gas mask; to camera crew
N: The CEO races out of the room.
T: The message cuts out.
N: Auto turns to face the Captain. The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Now, the plant.
C: CAPTAIN
D: No, wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom?
N: The paused image on the holo-screen highlights. Data begins to calculate on the screen. We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS. It stops on "2110".
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Message received in the year 2110.
C: CAPTAIN
D: That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back!
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth".
C: CAPTAIN
D: But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Irrelevant, Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: What?! It's completely relevant! Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!!
E: points out to space
C: AUTOPILOT
D: On the Axiom you will survive.
C: CAPTAIN
D: I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Must follow my directive.
C: CAPTAIN
D: DAAAARGH!!
N: The Captain turns away in frustration. His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS. Notices AUTO in every one of them. Looking over all their shoulders. A little closer every generation. The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder... ...and Auto is right behind him. The Captain looks at the plant in his lap. His countenance grows determined. He rights his hat... ...turns to face Auto... ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
C: CAPTAIN
D: I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today!
N: Auto slides into his face. Makes the Captain flinch. No more Mr. Nice Robot. Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND. GOPHER shoots out of a pneumatic tube. Salutes Auto. Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay. She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Gopher?
N: Gopher activates his suspension beam. Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny! Eve, arrest him!
E: to Eve
N: Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher. The robot raises his epaulet arms. Don't shoot! She opens her chest cavity. Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Eve, you are to put this plant straight in the Holo-detector.
N: Gopher slowly advances towards Eve. But then tosses the plant across the room... ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
C: CAPTAIN
D: No!
C: EVE
D: [Oh no!]
E: hums
N: It's over. The plant is gone. But in that frozen moment... ON TRASH CHUTE ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears. Rises like a ghost, up from the chute. Wall-E's head follows. Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
N: CAPTAIN & EVE WALL-E!! Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute. The plant drops onto his chest. Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
C: WALL-E
D: [Hey, the plant.]
E: beeps
N: CAPTAIN & EVE Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!] Wall-E is slow to understand. Finally picks up the plant. Anticipates to throw it, when... ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: Give me the plant.
N: Eve moves to help Wall-E. But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam. Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances. Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest. Slams it shut.
C: WALL-E
D: [You can't have it!]
E: beeps
N: Auto flips open one of his handles. Produces a TASER...
T: ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
N: Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out. He wheezes... ...then drops lifelessly down the chute. Eve screams. Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto. The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed. She shuts down. INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening. Drops her down the chute. She bangs against the sides as she tumbles. BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS Gopher salutes Auto and exits. Auto turns to the Captain. He is in shock.
C: AUTOPILOT
D: All communications are terminated. You are confined to quarters.
N: The power shuts off in the room. Auto rises back up through the ceiling... DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE The Captain looks up. Shakes his fist in fury.
C: CAPTAIN
D: NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
N: The aperture closes TO BLACK. Beat. ON EVE'S POV Black. The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes. Her view comes into focus. Scans around. Disoriented.
S: INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
N: Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH. Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere. Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES. Eve looks down. COMPUTER MICE crawl over her. One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button. Switched her back on.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
N: A warning alarm sounds. Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES. It slides into an AIRLOCK. Inner shield doors lock and seal.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Caution: Activating airlock disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
E: V.O.
N: The exterior hatch flies open. The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash. Eve begins to panic. Calls out again:
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
N: Suddenly, her area is flooded in light. She flinches at the sight of TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS as they rumble up behind her. Headlights for eyes. They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E. "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts. Each grab a ton of trash at once. Eve is swept up with the junk. Compact it. Spit it out... ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube. Her cube is picked up. Transported to a waiting platform. Stacked with other massive cubes. Eve discovers... ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
N: He groans. Not doing well. Again the alarms kick in. The platform slides on rails... ...across the safety line... ...into the airlock... ...the inner shield doors begin to close... INSIDE THE AIRLOCK Eve needs to act fast. Her gun arm stuck inside the cube. Struggles to activate it... ...It cocks. BLASTS herself free. Flies over to Wall-E. He's stuck deep in the cube... BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute. Lands in a pile of trash. Covered with filth.
C: M-O
D: [Primal scream.]
N: ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV Piles of trash everywhere. The airlock doors closing in the distance. ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E. His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
C: M-O
D: [I have you now!]
E: beeps
N: M-O speeds towards the airlock. ON EVE Tugs on Wall-E. Desperate to free him. He's slow to pull loose... ...THE GAP in the doors narrows... ...Eve's never going to make it... ON M-O Racing towards the doors. He's almost at the airlock... The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms. M-O is stuck. The exterior hatch opens: ...Eve yanks Wall-E free... ...The trash flies out into space... ...She flies against the force... ...Fights to reach M-O... ...Grabs onto his roller... INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door. Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock. The exterior hatch closes. Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap. Safe. M-O still stuck in the door. Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
C: M-O
D: Whoa.
N: MOMENTS LATER The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE. Eve props Wall-E up against some trash. He's barely functioning. Fades in and out of consciousness. Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...
E: "Stay awake."
N: Eve gently opens his chest cavity. Examines the damage. Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD. Charred. Shorting out. Irreparable. She flies off into the depot. Searches for a new circuit board. M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E. Finishes up. His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean." M-O closes up. Satisfied. Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
C: WALL-E
D: Wall-E.
E: weak
N: M-O stares at the filthy hand. Cleans it. Then shakes.
C: M-O
D: M-O.
N: They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
C: WALL-E
D: M-O?
E: Really?
C: M-O
D: M-O.
C: WALL-E
D: M-O.
E: Got it.
N: Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS. Shows each one to Wall-E. Will any of these work? He shakes his head with a frail "no." Wall-E opens his compactor. Pulls out the plant.
C: WALL-E
D: Di...rec...tive.
E: weak
N: Eve holds the plant. Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display. She considers it for a moment... ...then tosses the plant to the floor. I don't care about the plant anymore. She holds her hand out to him.
C: EVE
D: Directive.
N: Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's. He reaches out... ...and bats her hand away. Surprises Eve. Wall-E pushes past her. Crawls over to the discarded plant. Gives it back to Eve.
C: WALL-E
D: Errr.....
E: weak
N: Eve can't make out what he is saying. Wall-E fumbles around his box. Pulls out... ...the Zippo lighter. Lights it. Eve stares at the flame.
C: EVE
D: Earth?
N: Wall-E nods.
C: WALL-E
D: Earth.
N: He moves his binocular eyes up and down. Like the time he fixed his broken eye. You can fix me, Eve. With spare parts in my truck. The truck that is back on...
C: EVE
D: Earth! Earth!
N: Her eyes light up. She understands! No time to lose. She scoops him up...
C: WALL-E
D: M-O?
C: M-O
D: Wall-E!
E: "I'm comin'!"
N: M-O rushes over to Wall-E. Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller. Eve raises her gun arm... ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING. Takes off with the two of them. Up through the garbage chute. The WALL-As wave goodbye.
S: INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: A steward moves down the hall. Siren wailing. Scans for rogue robots. Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen. He stops in front of... A YELLOW LINE painted haphazardly on the floor. Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
C: STEWARD
D: Wrong.
N: The steward opens the closet. Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner. The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush. The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM. Suddenly, everything begins to shake. The steward looks around, confused. A JET ENGINE NOISE builds. Seems to be coming from... ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE. Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it. The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E. Beeps the POYSC song. Our savior has arrived! The steward's alarm goes haywire. ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY He takes a snapshot: Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant... ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera. ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER The terrified steward is thrown in.
C: STEWARD
D: Please hold. We are currently having technical difficul -- !
N: Eve locks the door on him. The trio take off down the hall. The freed paint-bot gives chase. Cheers POYSC as he follows. Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea. Presses his PLAY BUTTON. POYSC BLARES through the hallway. ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music. Parade after Eve and Wall-E. Hum POYSC. All following the pied piper. ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates. Alarms sound. Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots...
E: V.O.
S: INT. BRIDGE
N: Auto observes the same "Wanted" image.
C: AUTO
D: Not possible.
N: Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM. It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location. Auto activates every steward on the Axiom. ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT Stewards eject from their wall stations. Like ATMs jumping to life. Race in the direction of Eve. Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: ...Caution: Rogue Robots...
E: V.O.
N: BACK ON THE BRIDGE Auto watches the deck plan display. Monitors the progress of all the stewards. The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to... THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS The Captain, still trapped. Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door. Has no effect.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your last chance...Auto...You hear me?...Stupid...wheel...
E: hoarse; exhausted
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: ...Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots...
E: V.O.
N: A flashing light catches his attention. Outside his window. He looks up on the SKY DOME... A GIANT "WANTED" IMAGE of Eve and Wall-E, holding...
C: CAPTAIN
D: The plant!
N: The Captain's eyes light up. Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor. "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth" He is filled with renewed determination.
C: CAPTAIN
D: We'll see who's powerless now.
E: Laughs
N: Lays flat in his chair. Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey. Pulls off the underside panel.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Ah-Ha!
N: Yanks out a bundle of wiring. Cross-connects two wires. The console powers up...
S: INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
N: Eve zooms through the hallways. A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them. They reach an intersection when... ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around them.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
E: OVER INTERCOM
N: ALL AROUND THE AXIOM All screens display the Captain's live feed. He's absolutely everywhere. A few stray passengers are still up. Watch their screens in confusion.
S: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
N: Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen. Furiously tries to shut off the intercom. BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
C: CAPTAIN
D: Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have activated the holo-detector. Now hurry! Auto's probably going to cut me off --
E: OVER INTERCOM
N: The screens all go dead. Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination. They're about to continue on when... A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
C: STEWARDS
D: Halt.
N: Dozens of them stand in a row. Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward. Another one quickly takes its place. Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM. She can't shoot. The stewards advance, when suddenly... ...the Rejects charge the stewards: ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors... ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces... ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles... ...The umbrella-bot opens up... ...Shields the others from the attack... BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam. Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET. It goes berserk. Leaps at the entire army of Stewards. Robot parts fly everywhere. Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage. BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him. It projects her stored memories. UP ON THE BRIDGE Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen. A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up. It's the Captain. ...and he's holding the plant?
C: CAPTAIN
D: Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
E: ON SCREEN
N: Auto's single lens irises wide.
C: AUTO
D: Not possible.
C: CAPTAIN
D: That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it? Come and get it, Blinky!
E: ON SCREEN
C: AUTO
D: No.
S: INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
N: The Captain hovers in front of Eve's memory screen. It projects a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT. The Captain blocks the camera's view of Wall-E. Pretends to be holding the projected plant himself.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Ha ha!
N: HEARS AUTO coming. Turns off the vid-com. Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall. The room goes dark again. CLOSE ON CEILING The aperture opens. Auto lowers into the dark. Cautiously searches the empty room...
C: AUTO
D: Captain? Captain...?
N: ON AUTO'S POV PANS across the portraits of other captains... ...past our present Captain... ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously... -- wait a minute. The Captain lunges at him. Grabs Auto by the steering wheel. Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale. His lower extremities of no use.
C: AUTO
D: Let go. Let go.
N: Auto panics. Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling. The Captain gets stuck between floors...
C: CAPTAIN
D: What too heavy for ya, huh?!
N: UP ON THE BRIDGE ...Auto tries to pull free. The Captain won't let go. Auto ends up yanking him through. The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco. Auto swings violently back and forth.
C: CAPTAIN
D: You're not getting away from me, one-eye! -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
N: Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube. Sees the Captain fighting Auto. Charges at the Captain... ...who kicks him straight out the window... ON LIDO DECK Gopher plummets... ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL... ...and smashes in a heap on the cement. The end. ON WALL-E AND EVE We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards. The massage-bot floats above it all. Pants like a wild beast. One steward still twitches. The massage-bot crushes him with one blow. Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant. They take off for the Concourse Level. M-O and the Rejects follow behind. ON THE BRIDGE
C: CAPTAIN
D: That's it!...A little closer! Must..press...button.
N: The Captain reaches his one free hand out for... ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Gotcha! Ha ha!
N: His hand slams down hard on it. KLAXONS sound all over the ship. VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM ...Floodlights kick on everywhere... ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up... ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms... ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs... ...Inflate around their necks... ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors... ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their cabins... ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines... The procedure is completely automated. The passengers are all confused. Helpless to stop it.
S: INT. LIDO DECK
N: The passengers glide in by the thousands. Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools. Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides. ON JOHN AND MARY They arrive together at the Lido Deck. Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying. A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
C: NANNY-BOT
D: Remain calm. Remain calm.
N: CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates. A large cylindrical device rises from the stage... ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR. JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome. Show the bridge. Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto. He tries to speak to them during the fight:
C: CAPTAIN
D: Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your Captain speaking! We're having a slight malfunction with the Autopilot! Please remain calm!
E: strained; in command
N: The passengers get caught up in the conflict. Treat it as if it were a televised fight. ON THE REAR OF THE DECK Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel. Make a beeline for the holo-detector. Ready and waiting for the plant... ...almost there... ON BRIDGE
C: AUTO
D: Enough.
N: Auto furiously spins his wheel. Throws the Captain to the floor. The entire ship lists dangerously to one side. ON LIDO DECK Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side. Wall-E drops the plant. It tumbles off the bridge plaza. Eve is forced to set Wall-E down. He clings to the holo-detector. She flies off to retrieve the plant. The hover chairs stay locked on their lines. Passengers all slip off their chairs. Their uniform color defaults back to RED. Slowly slide across the deck. And for the first time... ...all of humanity reaches out to one another. CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands. Everyone piles up on the listing side. The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity. Eve searches desperately amongst them. ON JOHN & MARY They hang together off their chairs. CRYING TODDLERS just above them. The kiddies slip out of their hover rings. Mary GASPS in horror. Yells to John:
C: MARY
D: John, get ready to have some kids!
N: They purposefully let go of their chairs. Grab hands, forming a human chain. Catch the toddlers. All slide together down the Lido Deck. The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down. They land at the bottom, next to Eve. An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck... ...lands on the pool level. It begins sliding down the Lido Deck. Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
C: MARY
D: LOOK OUT!
E: Gasp
N: Eve looks up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them. She stops the car before it hits. Struggles to hold it up. Can't let it crush the passengers below her. ON BRIDGE Auto keeps the ship tilted. Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. Switches it off. ON LIDO DECK The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor... Wall-E is still hanging onto it. Barely functioning. He uses all his strength... ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector. Stops it from disappearing into the floor. The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box. ON BRIDGE The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes. Something's wrong. Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW. Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
C: AUTO
D: No.
N: Auto presses down on the "off" button. ON WALL-E The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him. Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up. Begins slowly to expand himself... ...and push the holo-detector back up!! ON BRIDGE The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen. Auto flips out his TASER. Jams it into the "off" button. Short circuits it.
C: CAPTAIN
D: NO!!
N: BACK ON WALL-E The holo-detector reverses full force. Crushes Wall-E. We can't tell if he survived the crush. Eve calls out for him. Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers. BACK ON BRIDGE The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed. That's it. He braces his arms against the floor... ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET... ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN The passengers collectively GASP. Their Captain is standing... ...and walking himself up the railing... ...towards Auto! They CHEER! ON BRIDGE Auto hears the distant cheering. Wonders what's up.
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto!
E: O.S.
N: Auto whips around. Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly). Finds himself face to face with him. Auto flips out his TASER. Rushes at him. The Captain grabs it. They wrestle. The taser ARCS in the Captain's face. He flinches. Looks up. Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column... ...and smirks. The Captain looks Auto in the eye. Raises a finger up to the control panel... ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON... ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
C: CAPTAIN
D: Auto, you are relieved of duty.
E: grits his teeth
C: AUTO
D: Noo --
N: Auto is instantly turned off. The Captain smiles triumphantly. Grabs the wheel with both hands. Makes the ship level again. ON LIDO DECK The passengers all spill across the deck. Shaken but OK. Eve sets the monorail down. Rockets over to the holo-detector. Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector. Eve tries to lift it up. It won't budge. She looks back to the crowd.
C: EVE
D: PLANT! PLANT!
N: ON M-O He searches the crowd for the plant. Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him. Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them. "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen. ON EVE She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
C: M-O
D: Ee-vah!
E: O.S.
N: M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck. The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger. Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line. Toss it up to Eve on stage. She shoves the plant into the device. The detector instantly scans the plant.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Plant origin verified. Course set for Earth.
E: V.O.
N: Slowly, the holo-detector rises... Wall-E topples out from underneath. Badly crushed and leaking oil. Eve GASPS in horror. M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes. Passengers recoil as well. WIDE ON DOME CEILING It converts into a GIANT STAR CHART. Rapidly plots a course for Earth.
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Ten seconds to hyperjump.
E: V.O.
N: Eve lifts Wall-E up. No sign of life.
C: EVE
D: No! WALL-E!!
N: M-O's head drops in despair. The passengers witness grief for the first time. Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy. Mary begins to cry. Buries her head in John's shoulder.
C: MARY
D: Oh no! Wall-E...
C: SHIP'S COMPUTER
D: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
N: The ceiling countdown hits "0:00."
S: EXT. AXIOM
N: The ship jumps to light speed. BACK INSIDE The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet. Everyone holds on to one another.
S: INT. BRIDGE
N: The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel. Fights the G-forces.
S: INT. LIDO DECK
N: Humans and robots hang on for dear life. John and Mary cling to each other and the babies. ON EVE She holds tightly to Wall-E. Still calling out his name. No response. ON SPACE The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
S: EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
N: The cockroach waits obediently on the hill. Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay. His antennae twitch with boredom. A RED DOT appears on the ground. The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside. The ground begins to shake. Daylight dims. The insect looks to the sky. ON CLOUD COVER A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds. Blots out the sunlight. The Axiom's keel breaks through. Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape. The cockroach senses his master's return. HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him. He eagerly chases after them. ON AXIOM The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky. Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
S: EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
N: The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth. Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT. Thousands of feet deep. The ship's keel descends into it. The earth shudders. Trash towers tumble in the distance. ...Then all is quiet. ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship. MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend. Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port. The Captain walks out gingerly. Holding the boot w/ plant. The other passengers step out on their own legs. Wobble like toddlers. They squint up at the harsh sunlight. A commotion is heard from the back. Somebody trying to push through. EVE appears out of the crowd. Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms. M-O and the Rejects follow behind her. They rush across the gangway. The cockroach meets up with Eve. Climbs up onto Wall-E. Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. Eve urgently scans the landscape. Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance. She takes to the air. M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
C: M-O
D: [Eve! Wait!]
E: beeps
N: The Captain respectfully removes his hat. Good luck, friend.
S: INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
N: The interior is dark and still. Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. Eve flies inside with Wall-E. Sets him on the floor. She scans the rotating shelves at high speed. Grabs a CAR JACK. Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body... QUICK SHOTS ...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve... ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E... ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece... ...She opens his new solar panels... ...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun. OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY The rejects stop. See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode. Oh no. BACK IN THE TRUCK A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E. Eve holds her breath, watches... Waits... ...Beep... ...Beep...
C: WALL-E
E: O.S. Apple "reboot" SFX
N: Wall-E's meter fully charges. His head slowly rises from his box. Blinks. The cockroach hops with joy. Eve is relieved. ...She holds out her hand to him.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...
E: with love
N: Wall-E gives her a blank stare. He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck. She grabs him. Turns him back around.
C: EVE
D: Eve!
E: It's me!
N: Wall-E just stares. Doesn't seem to know who she is.
C: EVE
D: [Here, look at these.]
E: hums
N: She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf. The light bulb glows in her hand. She gives them to Wall-E. No reaction.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E?
E: Remember?
N: Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
C: EVE
D: [I know!]
E: hums
N: She hovers over to the video player. Plays HELLO DOLLY. Looks back to see if it has any effect. Wall-E is over at the shelves. Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor. Crushes them into a cube. Eve is gut-punched. Wall-E motors outside. Runs over the cockroach on his way out. The insect pops back to life. Watches his friend in shock.
S: EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
N: Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile. Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube. Eve hovers over to him. Still in disbelief.
C: EVE
D: No.
E: somber
N: Wall-E continues to stack his cubes. She stops him. Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes. Nobody home. Eve presses his "play" button. Nothing but STATIC. Eve begins to panic. Shakes him.
C: EVE
D: Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
N: No response. He's gone. She hovers in silence next to him for a long time... Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand. Forces his fingers to interlace with hers. Holds him close one last time. Leans her head against his. Hums softly.
C: EVE
D: [Hums IOTAM]
N: She touches her forehead to his. Goodbye Wall-E. A TINY SPARK between them. Eve turns to hover away. Jerked back. Her fingers caught between his. She checks his eyes again. Nothing. But then... ...a tiny SERVO NOISE. She looks down at their hands. CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS They start to move. Slowly close around Eve's. She looks back at his face. Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus. His brows raise...
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah?
C: EVE
D: Wall-E!
N: He notices their hands entwined. His dream come true.
C: WALL-E
D: Ee-vah!!
E: amazed
N: She giggles. INSIDE THE TRUCK The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM. "And that is all that love's about..." BACK OUTSIDE Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes. M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck. They begin to celebrate. Wall-E's alive! Then M-O realizes they need privacy. Herds the Rejects O.S.
C: M-O
D: Go! Go, go go!
N: Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch. Together now and ever more. "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT Newly planted in the earth. Small hands water it gently. PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids. The Captain instructs them. John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom. Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
C: CAPTAIN
D: This is called "farming"! You kids are going to grow all kinds of plants: vegetable plants, pizza plants! Ahh, it's good to be home...
E: laughs
N: The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom... ...over the bay... "...That it only took a moment..." ...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck... ...over M-O and the Rejects cleaning outside... ...Through the trash towers of the city... ...past a FIELD OF PLANTS, sprouting from its peak... ...up through the cloud cover... ...out into space... "...To be loved a whole life long." ...and settles on... ...our single... ...drab... ...brown... ...little planet. IRIS OUT THE END
