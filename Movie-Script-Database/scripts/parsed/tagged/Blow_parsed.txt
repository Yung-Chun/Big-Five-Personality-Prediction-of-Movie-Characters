S: EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
N: A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the Columbian highlands. A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and then another. WHOOSH. WHOOSH. The view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation. WHOOSH. CLOSER We realize the dots are people. Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm. WHOOSH. WHOOSH. WE SEE the South American Indian MEN clearly now. Their tar stained teeth. Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet. Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest.
S: EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY
N: Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized bales speed along the narrow road.
S: EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY
N: The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves. Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire. The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky. Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution.
S: INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY
N: A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment. The machinery. The solutions. The over-sized vats. Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry. The coca is now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.
S: INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
N: A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine hydrochloride. The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

S: INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
N: George stands in line to register for college, wearing his Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair. The room is crowded and the line is long. Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's transistor radios. George looks around the room. He is uncomfortable. He catches his reflection in the shiny glass partition and stops. He doesn't like what he sees. Something is not right. He looks like everyone else. Same cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie cutter faces. He's a carbon copy.
C: REGISTRATION WOMAN
D: Next.
N: It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it. "Twenty years of schooling and they put you on a day shift." The words hit him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own reflection.
C: GEORGE
D: I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know? And then I looked around the room and it hit me. I saw my whole life. Where I was gonna live, what type of car I'd drive, who my neighbors would be. I saw it all and I didn't want it. Not that life.

D: I know.
C: FRED
D: Alright. You want me to get your old job back? Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
C: GEORGE

D: I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

C: BARBARA
D: You're Italian?
C: KEVIN
D: Yeah, right. Gonzales. What is that, Sicilian?
C: TUNA
D: As far as I'm concerned, we're on fucking vacation.
N: He grabs Maria, runs and does a huge belly-flop into the water. They all laugh. SERIES OF SHOTS. George and Barbara with local musicians on the beach. George and Derek at a cab stand. George talks with a bellboy in the lobby of a local hotel.

C: GEORGE
D: Very nice. I'll take it.
C: SANTIAGO

D: All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.
C: SANTIAGO
D: Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back.
C: GEORGE
D: I don't need a little. I need a lot.
C: SANTIAGO
D: Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.
C: GEORGE
D: What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
C: SANTIAGO
D: Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.

C: TUNA

N: George reads from a flight manual.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright, pull back the throttle...
N: The engine screams.
C: GEORGE
D: Not that far, only halfway. You sure you know what you're doing?
E: CONT'D
C: KEVIN
D: Relax. I've flown with my old man a million times. And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
S: EXT. SANTIAGO FARM - MEXICO - 1968 - DAY
N: The plane tries to land. It's a clumsy one. The Cessna is tipping and touching, first one wheel, then another, almost sideways before straightening out and stopping. George and Kevin hop out of the plane. They are greeted by Santiago and the Mexican contingency.
C: AMIGOS
D: Hola, George! Bienvenido!
N: George hands out presents to everyone. He's like Santa Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child. They love him. Santiago pumps George's hand.
C: SANTIAGO
D: Good to see you, Jorge. You are a man of your word.
C: GEORGE
D: Actually, I've got some news. That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.

S: INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - NIGHT
N: It's on the water and beautiful. The furnishings are distinctly Derek Foreal. It's a surreal scene. The holiday decorations are up, TOPLESS WOMEN in elf outfits sip champagne, and a thousand pounds of cannabis lays on the living room floor.
C: GEORGE
D: Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
C: DEREK
D: Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.

S: INT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - NIGHT
N: George is taking Barbara and his parents out to dinner. The Buggy Whip is Ermine's favorite.
C: ERMINE
D: I just can't get over the size of that ring. I just love it. Fred, look at it. Tell me you don't love that ring.
C: FRED
D: I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
C: ERMINE
D: Yes. Of course. But, I'm talking about that ring. It's something else. Let me tell you.
C: BARBARA
D: George has exquisite taste.
C: ERMINE
D: What is that, two carats? That's got to be two carats.
C: BARBARA
D: I don't know.
C: ERMINE
D: Yes. It's at least two carats, darling. Treasure it.
C: FRED
D: Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring like that on a construction salary.
N: All eyes turn to George, who fumbles.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, you know. It's um...
C: ERMINE
D: Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth. You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
C: FRED
D: Layaway shmayaway.
C: ERMINE
D: That's right. Layaway. Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
C: FRED
D: Who's the cheapskate?
C: ERMINE
D: You, you big old tightwad. He still has his communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, layaway.
C: ERMINE
D: The boy is happy, Fred. Don't be such a killjoy.
C: FRED
D: Killjoy?
N: George looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding.
C: GEORGE
D: Honey, your nose!
C: BARBARA
D: Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
C: ERMINE

D: Thanks. I'll be okay.

N: George and Barbara exit the restaurant.
C: GEORGE
D: Are you sure you're okay? You're pale.
C: BARBARA
D: I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
C: BARBARA
D: Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
C: GEORGE
D: No, not at all. Sure. You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
C: BARBARA
D: Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
C: BARBARA
D: Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
C: GEORGE
D: Promise me that we'll never be like them. I don't want to wind up like that.

E: V.O.
S: INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY
N: George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the JUDGE at the arraignment.
C: GEORGE
D: Rule one: don't fight. A trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter.
E: V.O.
C: JUDGE
D: George Jung, you have been accused of possession of six-hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute. How do you plead?
C: GEORGE
D: Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail.
E: V.O.
C: GEORGE
D: Your honor, I'd like to say a few words to the court.
E: CONT'D
N: The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.
C: JUDGE
D: By all means.
C: GEORGE
D: In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison. None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars. I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do? Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants? You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief?
N: George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot. The court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.
C: JUDGE
D: Those are very interesting concepts you have, Mr. Jung. Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real, the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did constitutes a crime.
N: The judge slams his gavel.
C: JUDGE
D: Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT
N: George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for him. She doesn't look so good.
C: BARBARA
D: Surprise.
C: GEORGE
D: Baby, you didn't have to come.
C: BARBARA
D: What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
C: GEORGE
D: Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years. I'll serve two.
C: BARBARA
D: Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
C: GEORGE
D: What? You're not going to wait for me?
C: BARBARA
D: George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
C: GEORGE
D: Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. RENT-A-CAR - 1972 - DAY
N: George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.

S: EXT. CEMETERY - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - DAY
N: Everyone is there. All in black. Barbara's casket is lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to push the first dirt on the grave.
C: GEORGE
D: Time is such a funny thing. I look at where I am now, and in here, time inches along. So slow, it hardly seems like it moves. But back then, time went fast.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY
N: George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root. Still planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing locks. George raises his hand and makes a small wave. Barbara opens and closes her hand. Bye bye.
C: GEORGE
D: It went too fast.
N: George looks down and Barbara is gone. No Barbara.
S: EXT. JUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - WEYMOUTH - 1973 - NIGHT

C: GEORGE
D: Hi, Mom.
N: Ermine just keeps looking at him.
C: GEORGE
D: Surprised to see me?
E: CONT'D
C: ERMINE
D: Take your boots off. You're tan.
C: GEORGE
D: Mexico.
C: ERMINE
D: Yeah. We heard all about it. I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
C: GEORGE
D: Barbara.
C: ERMINE
D: Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.
C: GEORGE
D: Thank you. Have you been getting the money I sent you?
C: ERMINE
D: You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.
N: Ermine's hands are trembling. She is emotional. She hugs George ferociously, not letting go.
C: ERMINE
D: G-d, son.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Okay, Mom. It's okay. Where's Dad?
N: George turns around to see Fred's beaming face.
S: INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
N: George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits between them. The glasses are raised.
C: GEORGE
D: May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
C: FRED
D: ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
C: BOTH
D: ...to dance with the stars.
N: The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down.
S: INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: The bottle is dwindling. George and Fred are feeling it.
C: FRED
D: You alright?
N: George nods.
C: GEORGE
D: Just low.
C: FRED
D: You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
C: FRED
D: Tough spot.
N: The glasses are refilled.
C: GEORGE
D: You mad at me?
C: FRED
D: Not mad.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.
C: FRED
D: I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for you.
C: GEORGE
D: I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great.
C: FRED
D: Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything.
N: Something outside catches George's eye. A light. A reflection. A movement. George is up and on the move.
C: FRED
D: Where are you going?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.

N: George is up the stairs in a flash.
C: ERMINE
D: George!
S: INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window, and opens it. Cops everywhere. He's trapped. Out of options, he folds. He moves to the corner and sits down, turns on the train set. A KNOCK on the door is heard. FBI Agent, JAMES T. TROUT.
C: TROUT
D: George Jung, you are under arrest.
C: FRED
D: Open the door, son.
S: EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER
N: They lead George outside in handcuffs. Ermine and Fred watch.
C: ERMINE
D: I had no choice.
N: George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time realizing her betrayal.
C: ERMINE
D: Don't look at me like that. What was I supposed to do? You're in our house. What, was I supposed to be an accomplice?
E: CONT'D
N: As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.
C: ERMINE
D: You don't think people know you're a drug dealer? Everyone knows. It's no secret. How do you think that reflects on me? Every time I go out, I'm humiliated. I see the stares. I hear the whispers. How do you think that makes me feel? Did you ever once stop and think of me?
E: CONT'D
N: George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car. He looks up at his mother.
C: ERMINE
D: So you go to jail. It's for your own good. You need to straighten your life out.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: George is being led through a series of gated corridors.

N: As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates. He arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE.
C: GUARD
D: Prisoner in.
E: CONT'D
N: The cell door opens and George steps inside. There are books and papers spread out over both bunk beds. George watches as his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk. Apparently, the papers are private. George puts his things down and the little man proffers his hand. He is dark, polite and Colombian.

S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - 1974 - DAY

C: GEORGE

C: DIEGO
D: Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
C: GEORGE
D: Not really, no.
C: DIEGO
D: No?
C: GEORGE
D: I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
C: DIEGO
D: Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here?
N: George says nothing. He keeps eating his food.
C: DIEGO
D: Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Murder.
C: DIEGO
D: Ah, yes. The murder.
S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT
N: George lays on his bunk, smoking. Diego is on the bottom bunk, furiously writing on a notepad. He flips through his books and rustles his papers. George peeks over the side to see what Diego is doing.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you got there, Diego?
C: DIEGO
D: Nothing. Just a little project.
C: GEORGE
D: What kind of project?
C: DIEGO
D: Never mind. Not for you to worry.
C: GEORGE
D: I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
C: DIEGO
D: You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have?
C: GEORGE
D: Twenty-six months.
C: DIEGO
D: Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
C: GEORGE
D: I've got to get out of here, Diego.
C: DIEGO
D: Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
C: GEORGE
D: What's the other one?
S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - CLASSROOM - DAY
N: George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates. The room, mostly black and hispanic, is hostile. They don't want to learn.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright, let's open our books.
N: INMATE #1 Man, fuck you. INMATE #2 We ain't opening shit. INMATE #1 You just the warden's boy. We on to you. You just trying to knock some time off, asskissing motherfucker. Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter. This ain't going to be easy.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright. You're right. I want to get out of this shithole as fast as I can. And I don't want to do this any more than you do. But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate. You, forget about it. You're hopeless, go to sleep.
N: The room laughs again. INMATE #3 Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.
C: GEORGE
D: But the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when you're on the outside.
N: The room looks at him. They ain't buying it. INMATE #1 Shit, I'm in for life. INMATE #2 I'm a criminal. I ain't getting no motherfucking job.
C: GEORGE
D: We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal. What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs?
N: INMATE #2 Man, you don't know dick about smuggling no drugs.
C: GEORGE
D: I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass. I think that qualifies me.
N: Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested. INMATE #1 How did you get a hold of six-hundred and sixty pounds of dope?
C: GEORGE
D: Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna. Now, do we have a deal or not?
N: They react. They're in.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy. The DEA are a bunch of losers. They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse. They don't know what the fuck they're doing...
E: CONT'D
N: Diego watches George winning over the room. He listens intently to George's every word. His wheels are turning.
S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT
N: Lights out. Diego and George lay in their cots. George is tired. Diego is not.
C: DIEGO
D: George? Hey, George? I listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling. You are a magico, ah?
N: George doesn't respond.
C: DIEGO
D: I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.
C: DIEGO
D: You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah?
C: GEORGE
D: Good night.
C: DIEGO
D: In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George?
C: GEORGE
D: I would if I could get some sleep.
C: DIEGO
D: Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
C: GEORGE
D: Because I got caught.
C: DIEGO
D: No, my brother.
C: GEORGE
D: Because they caught me?
C: DIEGO
D: You failed because you had the wrong dream.
N: Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye.
C: DIEGO
D: George? What do you know about cocaine?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive.
C: DIEGO
D: No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
N: George's interest is piqued.
C: GEORGE
D: That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
C: DIEGO
D: And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
C: GEORGE
D: Oh my G-d.
C: DIEGO
D: Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
C: GEORGE
D: Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.
C: DIEGO
D: Now do you see what I am saying?
C: GEORGE
D: Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get?
C: DIEGO
D: Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.

D: Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The women. It's better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I would like you to meet.
S: EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY
N: Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most notably, a man named CESAR ROZA. The mood is not friendly.
C: DIEGO
D: Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
C: GEORGE
D: Okay.
C: CESAR
D: Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.
C: GEORGE
D: What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
C: CESAR
D: Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make and the color?
C: DIEGO
D: Samsonites. Red. No tags.
N: Cesar thinks about it.
C: CESAR
D: Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
C: GEORGE
D: What? Yeah, sure.
C: CESAR
D: Whose cloths? Your clothes?
C: GEORGE
D: My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
C: CESAR
D: I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
C: GEORGE
D: What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes.
C: CESAR
D: I demand to know everything. I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
C: GEORGE
D: It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.
C: CESAR
D: The coca is my responsibility!
C: GEORGE
D: You're a fucking amateur!
C: DIEGO
D: Gentlemen, please. There is no need to be impolite. Cesar, this will be fine. You have my word. George, Cesar is just being thorough. That's all.
C: CESAR
D: Very well. But just remember, Mr. Jung. I will be with you the whole way. And I will be watching.
S: INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY
N: George carries the two Samsonites over to customs inspections. It's a long walk. George's heart beats hard. The sound is audible and grows with every beat. BA-BUMP. BA BUMP. Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.
C: GEORGE
D: When you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm. The way I do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph. A sexual encounter. I actually project myself to that place. Anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases.
E: V.O.
N: George stands in front of the customs agent. He tries his best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: On vacation?
C: GEORGE
D: Yes.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: On vacation for only one day?
N: BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. The heartbeats are very loud.
C: GEORGE
D: My brother's wedding. Imagine that, huh?
E: weak smile
N: George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex doesn't seem to be working. Cesar passes through, eyeballing George the whole time.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: Open your bags, please.
N: George opens the Samsonites. Super dry mouth. BA-BUMP. BA BUMP. The beats are deafening now. Cesar nervously monitors the situation from the payphones.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: Whose clothes are these?
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Mine.
N: The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment. Cesar throws up his hands in frustration.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: And this?
C: GEORGE
D: What can I tell you? Different strokes.
N: George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before finishing the inspection.
C: CUSTOMS AGENT
D: Alright, go ahead.
S: EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS
N: George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases, and pretends to make a call. Not inconspicuously, Cesar grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.
S: INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY
N: Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired executive type, lounge around the mini-suite. Cesar still has that crazy look in his eye.
C: DIEGO
D: Three-hundred kilos it is, then.
N: A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and Cesar. Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.
C: DIEGO
D: Has everyone met Inez? This is George. I've told you about him. And this is friend, Jack Stevens.
E: CONT'D
N: The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like ants before sitting down next to Diego.
C: DIEGO
D: Try to be more respectful, darling. My apologies. But she is mistrustful of Americans. Shall we proceed? Let's hear it again, Mr. Stevens.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVENS
D: I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the Bahamas, and then to Medellin.
C: INEZ
D: Friday?
N: Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only. She speaks in Spanish. The conversation is about "Why Friday?" Inez has some problem with it. Diego explains. And Inez is reassured.
C: DIEGO
D: Please, continue.
C: GEORGE
D: We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
C: CESAR
D: Why are you speaking?
C: GEORGE
D: Excuse me?
C: CESAR
D: You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that.
C: GEORGE
D: I see. How much?
C: CESAR
D: Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.
N: He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.
C: CESAR
D: There is no negotiation. Three-million dollars. That is all.
E: CONT'D
C: STEVENS
D: I want two.
C: GEORGE
D: Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it.
C: STEVENS
D: No way. I'm doing all the work. Taking all the risk, and it's my plane.
N: Diego and George look at each other.
C: STEVENS
D: Hey, you guys don't have to do shit. Just sit back and collect your money.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: You good with this?
N: Diego nods.
C: GEORGE
D: Alright.
E: CONT'D
N: This is too much for Inez to handle. She starts screaming machine gun Spanish. Something about a "lousy two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward" to give away all his money. Diego is embarrassed but tries to remain calm.
C: DIEGO
D: You will watch what you say. Especially around George. He is my brother and he speaks as good Spanish as you.
N: But Inez is wild. She starts in again, a log of "Putos (SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)." Even Cesar is uncomfortable. Diego stands.
C: DIEGO
D: Okay. That's enough.
E: CONT'D
C: INEZ
D: Get your hands off me.
N: Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the face. Time stops in the room. Question. What will Diego do? Answer: SMACK! Diego swings back and a full scale is on. Cesar continues the conversation. It's surreal. As if Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other right in front of them.
C: CESAR
D: Do you have pictures of your kids?
C: STEVENS
D: What?
C: CESAR
D: I'll need to see them. Also need their names and the names of their schools. We are trusting you with ninety million dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens. Without your children, there is no deal.
N: Stevens thinks about it. Kids as collateral. Inez and Diego are still duking it out. But Diego finally gets the upper hand and drags her into the bedroom.
C: STEVENS
D: Fine. So if that's all, I'll be leaving now.
N: Cesar walks him to the door.
C: CESAR
D: Don't forget the pictures.
N: Diego calls from the other room.
C: DIEGO
D: George. George, come in here.
E: O.S.
S: INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER
N: Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door closed. She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but he pays no attention.
C: DIEGO
D: What's the matter, George?
C: GEORGE
D: What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
C: DIEGO
D: A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
C: GEORGE
D: It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed.
C: DIEGO
D: I know.
C: GEORGE
D: And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
C: DIEGO
D: That's my George, always thinking.
N: The door is yanked open to reveal Inez. She is in a rage. Diego slams it in her face.
C: DIEGO
D: This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
C: DIEGO
D: I need you to go to Miami.
S: EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY
N: George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN hanging around outside an apartment. He checks the address and moves over to the men.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm George. Friend of Diego's?
N: The Colombian men are not impressed. They grab George and pull him inside.
S: INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS
N: George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all start screaming at him in Spanish. There seems to be a problem. A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward. He is the one who speaks English.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: QUIET! Callate! Where's Diego?
C: GEORGE
D: I don't know. He sent me. I'm George.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: Oh, I see. George. Well, that explains everything. Open your mouth, George.
N: George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his face. Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: Now, you listen to me. Are you hearing me?
E: CONT'D
N: George nods.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: You see this?
E: CONT'D
N: He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of cocaine.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks. You tell Diego I don't appreciate it. You tell him I want my money by Friday. Can you do that?
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Um-hmm.
S: INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY
N: George sits on his bed, reading. Two duffel bags are tucked away in the closet. Ermine pokes her head in.
C: ERMINE
D: You have a phone call.
N: George picks up the phone.
C: DIEGO
D: George.
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
C: DIEGO
D: Bad news, George. I'm in Colombia.
E: O.S.
C: GEORGE
D: Well, you better get here fast. I'm sitting on...
N: George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway, eavesdropping.
C: GEORGE
D: Hi, Mom.
E: CONT'D
N: George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys. Get your ass up here.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS
N: It's a South American prison. Diego is on the pay phone.
C: DIEGO
D: It's a little hard to get away right now. I'm afraid you're on your own.
S: INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT
N: George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie ish looking professor. On the table sits various paraphernalia. Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box. George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.
C: MR. T
D: What we're doing is measuring the purity. Pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety degrees. Cutting agents melt much lower. About a hundred degrees. Quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees. That's what I'm hoping for.
N: Mr. T turns the dial. 120. 130. 140.
C: MR. T
D: Good.
E: CONT'D
N: 150. 160.
C: MR. T
D: Jesus Christ.
E: CONT'D
N: 170. 180.
C: MR. T
D: Holy fucking Mary! Jesus, fuck me running! Where did you get this shit!
E: CONT'D
N: At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.
C: MR. T
D: Damn! Can I do a fucking line?!
E: CONT'D
N: Mr. T puts his nose in the powder. George pulls Foreal aside.
C: GEORGE
D: What did I tell you?
C: DEREK
D: It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
C: GEORGE
D: Sell it?
C: DIEGO
D: Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
C: GEORGE
D: Just sell it, Derek.
C: DEREK
D: Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.
S: INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT
N: Money everywhere. All over the floor, the counters, the chairs, and even in the sinks. George and Derek count the money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a rubber band.
C: DIEGO
D: Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
C: GEORGE
D: I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
C: DIEGO
D: Touche.
C: GEORGE
D: But to the victor belong the spoils.
N: George divides the money. There's a hell of a lot.
C: GEORGE
D: Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.
E: CONT'D
C: DEREK
D: Nice doing business with you, George.
C: GEORGE
D: Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
S: INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY
N: Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George walks with two aluminum cases. He is greeted by Alessandro and his thugs.
C: ALESSANDRO
D: Greetings, Mr. George.
C: GEORGE
D: Where do you guys want to count?
C: ALESSANDRO
D: On the plane.
C: GEORGE
D: What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on?
N: They usher him away.
S: EXT. OLAYA HERRERA AIRPORT - MEDELLIN - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA The lear jet lands.
S: EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - LOS RIOS, COLOMBIA - DAY
N: The blazer pulls into a long driveway. They approach a gate where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard. The gate opens. YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine. They frisk him top to bottom. Diego is leaning against another Jeep and waits for George to be released.
C: DIEGO
D: George, good to see you, my brother.
C: GEORGE
D: What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
C: DIEGO
D: Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
C: DIEGO
D: Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
C: GEORGE
D: Just a friend.
C: DIEGO
D: Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah. You do the talking.
N: The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard in the distance. From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges. He is singular in purpose. He is handed a pistol and moves quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words. And then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head. George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch. Escobar is handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his hands, as he moves back.
C: LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
D: He will see you now. Not you.
E: to Diego
C: DIEGO
D: There must be some kind of mistake.
C: LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
D: No mistake. Mr. Escobar will see Mr. Jung alone. You are to wait here.
N: George hesitates.
C: DIEGO
D: It's alright, George. You go.
C: LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
D: This way, please.
N: The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where the maleton was just shot. George looks back at Diego as he is led away.
C: ESCOBAR
D: So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
C: GEORGE
D: Actually, it was three.
C: ESCOBAR
D: The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
C: GEORGE
D: It would be my pleasure.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
N: Escobar moves over to embrace George. George returns it, and their hands come together. George can't help it. He reflexively looks at his hands. Escobar understands.
C: ESCOBAR
D: The man in the garden. He was full of courage.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Un sapo?
C: ESCOBAR
D: Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
C: GEORGE
D: Yes.
C: ESCOBAR
D: But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems.
C: GEORGE
D: With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him.
N: Escobar looks at him with a cold stare. But George doesn't flinch. His face reveals nothing. Finally, a smile breaks across Pablo's lips.
C: ESCOBAR
D: I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, it is.
C: ESCOBAR
D: So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
C: ESCOBAR
D: As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about.
N: Diego watches the two men walk outside. Escobar throws an arm around George's shoulder. Pablo hops into a Jeep and motions for George. The bodyguards come running. But Pablo waves them away.
S: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY
N: Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it. Before them is a stunning panorama.
C: ESCOBAR
D: I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature.
C: GEORGE
D: It's beautiful.
C: ESCOBAR
D: People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
N: Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to respond in full.
C: GEORGE
D: What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
C: GEORGE
D: I want money.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
C: GEORGE
D: Freedom.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Power?
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, maybe.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Family.
C: GEORGE
D: Sure.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Beautiful girls?
C: GEORGE
D: Keep them coming.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
C: GEORGE
D: Money.
C: ESCOBAR
D: And Diego?
C: GEORGE
D: Diego is my brother.
N: Escobar looks at George a long time. He's inscrutable.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Good. Take care of him, George. I'm fond of him, but he is sometimes like a baby. Keep an eye on him, okay?
S: EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY
N: Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long. He taps his foot and picks at his fingernails. Escobar and George pull up in the Jeep. Diego leaps to his feet.
C: DIEGO
D: Padrino.
N: Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.
C: ESCOBAR
D: Diego, mijo. I've made a decision. We are going into business and I would like to start right away.
N: MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money dropping through frame. CLOSE SHOTS of George and Diego on the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and lines being drawn off mirrors. The effect is surreal and dreamy.
S: INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
N: A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of cocaine. Each marked with a "P." A knife punctures one of the bricks. A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's nose. It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the man he is doing business with. The shot widens TO REVEAL all the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags. A handshake seals the deal. STILL PHOTOS Handshake after handshake after handshake.
S: INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT
N: George and Diego counting cash. It's everywhere. All over the floor, in two-foot stacks. MORE STILL PHOTOS Various transactions completed.
S: INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT
N: George and Diego count. It's ridiculous how much money there is. The stacks are now waist high and spill into other rooms. Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire talking on the phone. MORE STILL PHOTOS George and Diego, the Banditos. Cigars. Champagne. Arms around each other in camaraderie. In Diego's yellow Ferrari. With Inez, sunning on a yacht. More coke and more transactions. When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is always notably absent.
S: INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT
N: The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling. There is nowhere to put it. George and Diego sit at the coffee table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills. There is a discrepancy in the count.
C: GEORGE
D: Three million. I counted it twice.
C: DIEGO
D: It's two-point-five, George. I am sure.
N: George starts to pick up the money.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm calling it three.
C: DIEGO
D: We're half a million off.
C: GEORGE
D: Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
C: DIEGO
D: Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
C: GEORGE
D: I don't give a shit. Close enough.
N: George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the money, but there is no more room.
C: GEORGE
D: Where do I put this!?
E: CONT'D
C: DIEGO
D: Try the back bedroom.
N: George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall money. It's packed.
C: GEORGE
D: There's no room.
C: DIEGO
D: Try the closet.
N: No luck there, either. George drops the money on the floor and moves back into the living room.
C: GEORGE
D: We've got to do something about this.
S: INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge wall safe. Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard. The Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the proceedings.
C: GEORGE
D: Are you comfortable with this?
C: DIEGO
D: George, we've got sixty-one million dollars. It's either here or someplace else. We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
C: GEORGE
D: And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.
C: DIEGO
D: Then relax. It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us?
S: INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY
N: George and Diego sign papers. The bank president congratulates them and hands them documentation.
C: GEORGE

C: BANK PRESIDENT
D: I'm sorry.
C: GEORGE
D: I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book.
N: MORE STILL PHOTOS Diego and Inez's wedding. The ceremony. The ring. The kiss. The lineup with all of the bridesmaids. George is the best man, and the only American.
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT
N: A huge reception. All the pomp and circumstance Colombian money can buy. Politicians. Policemen. And every smuggler north of Colombia. George sits with Diego and Inez at the table of honor. Inez is opening presents. Diego's tipsiness is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone. He drunkenly throws his arm around George's shoulder.
C: DIEGO
D: I'm married, George. Me. I can't believe it. Can you believe I'm married, George?
C: GEORGE
D: You're a lucky man, Diego.
C: DIEGO
D: I love you, my brother, do you know that?

N: He kisses her.
C: GEORGE
D: Mirtha.
C: CESAR
D: Diego needs to see you right away, please. Excuse us, Amorcito.
N: They leave. George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more teeth. George arrives at the table. Various greetings.
C: AUGUSTO
D: Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am Augusto Oliveras.
C: GEORGE
D: My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much about you.
C: RAMON OCHOA
D: Congratulations on your conquest of the West Coast. How much bigger can we get?
C: GEORGE
D: Sky's the limit. We're just beginning to tap the market. If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow.
N: They all agree. Mirtha still gives George the teeth from across the room. Diego returns to the table.
C: AUGUSTO
D: We are talking about George's West Coast operation.
C: DIEGO
D: Ah, George's mystery man.
C: RAFAEL OJEDA
D: Yes, where is this man? When do we meet him?
C: DIEGO
D: You don't meet him. George keeps this a secret. He's here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but still keeps his secrets. Even from his brother.
C: JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO"
D: Come on, George, we're all in this together.
C: EMILIO OCHOA
D: Yes, George, there's enough for everybody.

D: I think Padroni is happy with the current situation. Will you please excuse me?
N: George exits after Mirtha.
S: INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha. He can't find her. She appears from the shadows and startles him. George embraces her and plants one on her.

C: MIRTHA
D: What do you think, Dad?
C: FRED
D: Yeah. Nice.
C: ERMINE
D: Look at this credenza. If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that? It's got to cost a fortune.

N: They move along the rear of the house. Classic cars line the driveway.
C: FRED
D: You come from my body, remember? You're my baby boy. The same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldn't do it. You haven't changed much. I know the things you do. Not everything. But I get the picture and I don't care. I don't like it. It's not what I would have chosen for you, but it's your life. It doesn't have anything to do with me.

S: INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY
N: Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker. His eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants. He knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside. George is on the porch, smoking a cigarette.
C: DIEGO
D: Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
C: GEORGE
D: Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.
C: DIEGO
D: I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.
C: GEORGE
D: What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
C: DIEGO
D: What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.
N: George doesn't have time for this. He checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind. But Diego won't get off the soap box.
C: GEORGE
D: Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy.
C: DIEGO
D: I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?
N: A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the room. George and Diego greet them and lead them inside. It's game time. The atmosphere is charged with danger and everyone is acutely aware of everything. The guys sit down, their guns bulging through the inside of their suits. The suitcases are opened. The rules are the same. No English. No raising voices. No sudden movements. George offers their leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined. The count starts. George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles. Diego is still acting pissy. He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around. The guys keep a close eye on him. Diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground. The conversation is in Spanish unless otherwise indicated.
C: TONY
D: Algun problema?
C: GEORGE
D: No no no... no problema, amigo. El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo contaremos. Okay? No problem.

D: You embarrassed me, George. You make me look very bad.
E: English

D: Nothing. Todo esta bien.

D: You fucked me in front of my whole family!
E: English
C: GEORGE
D: Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

C: TONY
D: Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?
C: DIEGO
D: Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le importa.
N: The guns are out and pointed. It's out of control now.

D: Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
N: George steps forward with the keys.
C: GEORGE
D: Take the fucking keys!
N: BLAM! Courtesy of Benny, George is hit. The shoulder, the collarbone. It's hard to tell.
C: GEORGE
D: Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright. There's no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is. Do it now.

N: Augusto lets out a big laugh.
C: AUGUSTO
D: Norman Cay is not a person. He is an island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
C: GEORGE
D: What?
N: Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.
C: AUGUSTO
D: Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
C: GEORGE
D: Motherfucker works fast.
C: AUGUSTO
D: The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
C: GEORGE
D: He what?
C: AUGUSTO
D: Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy man. Along with many others. You shouldn't stay away so long.
C: GEORGE
D: That's impossible. We can't be up and running. Who's distributing?
N: Augusto says nothing. But the ball is dropping in Times Square. 10, 9, 8, 7...
C: GEORGE
D: Oh, no.
E: CONT'D
N: Happy New Year. Streamers, confetti, and champagne. George marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone. He's steaming. The music is up, so he has to scream.
C: GEORGE
D: Hello, Derek? This is George. Am I wearing lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick? Because when I'm getting fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty. You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch?
E: CONT'D

N: Waiting for him is Cesar.
C: CESAR
D: Good to see you, George. It's been a long time.
S: INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET
N: The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the water. The crimson sky streaks the windows. Diego looks like Che Guavera. His hair is long, and a graying beard sticks through his gaunt face. The bar has been taken over by Diego's BANDITOS. Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES accent this drunken setting. George is escorted through the door by Cesar, and the room quiets. All eyes on Diego and George. Diego rises.
C: DIEGO
D: George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
C: GEORGE
D: No more brothers, Diego.
C: DIEGO
D: Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.

D: You went behind my back and you cut me out.
C: DIEGO
D: No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
C: GEORGE
D: I talked to Foreal, Diego.
N: There is a pause. Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.
C: DIEGO
D: Maybe you are right. I did betray you a little bit.
N: One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs. George is furious. He starts to tremble and his face turns red.
C: DIEGO
D: Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo. So sad, George. I stole your California connection. So what? Who introduced you to Pablo Escobar? Me. Who introduced you to your fucking Colombian wife? Me. Who protected you when my friend Cesar Roza wanted to slice your fucking throat, huh? Who mad you millions and millions of dollars? Me. And what do I get in return? This? Accusations? I have always given you everything, George, but that is over now. This is my operation. My dream. So go home, George. Go back to your stupid little life. You can sell half grams to your fucking relatives for all I care. Because you are out!
E: CONT'D
N: George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.
C: GEORGE
D: You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.

N: They lead him away.
S: EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS
N: George is getting the shit kicked out of him. His teeth broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin. His arm stomped. Blood and broken bones. It's a king size beating. The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with a haymaker. CRACK. George's nose is broken. Blood spurts everywhere. George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and left for dead.

C: ESCOBAR
D: I see. I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad. You now know who your Brutus is.
C: GEORGE
D: You know why I'm here. You know what I have to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
C: ESCOBAR
D: It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher.
C: GEORGE
D: You're saying life will take care of Diego?
C: ESCOBAR
D: Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you. It is the teacher.
C: GEORGE
D: I get it. I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
C: ESCOBAR
D: I'm sorry, George.
C: GEORGE
D: Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and me, Pablo? Are we good?
C: ESCOBAR
D: Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.

C: GEORGE
D: Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out.

S: INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY
N: Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain. She's crowning. George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask. He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort. The baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts the cord. Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs hysterically. But something is wrong with George. The color drains from his face. He grabs his chest and falls over onto the floor. The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.
C: GEORGE
D: Watching my baby girl born did something to me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn't believe in religion. But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me changed. I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love anything but my daughter ever again. It sounds sappy, but it was like, click, I knew what I was put on this planet for. It was the greatest feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had.
E: V.O.
C: NURSE

C: DR. BAY
D: I've reviewed your toxicology report three times, George. I've never seen anything like it. Eighteen grams. The lethal dose is a gram and a half. You should be in the Guiness Book.
N: George cracks a faint smile.
C: DR. BAY
D: It's not funny, George. You should be dead right now. Absolutely. I cannot come up with one logical explanation for why you're still breathing. I'm not here to give you lectures, I've got no moral interest in what you do. But, take it easy, George. Stay with us a while. You've got a daughter now.

You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this conversation.

D: I never met Pablo Escobar. Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia...
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank. Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace. In 1977, there was no other real competition.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us. It was an expensive operation. Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation...
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: he was very anti-government. He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money. I was just looking for money.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state. He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach. It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles. When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out.
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: I'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial. I mean we're here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?
E: CONT'D
C: CALIBANOS
D: Yes, we are Mr. Jung.
N: We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.
C: CALIBANOS
D: Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
E: CONT'D
C: GEORGE
D: Yes, I am.
C: CALIBANOS
D: Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
C: GEORGE
D: No, I cam here out of my own volition.
C: CALIBANOS
D: Excuse me?
C: GEORGE
D: Something about vengance being best served cold.
C: CALIBANOS
D: Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
C: GEORGE
D: Excuse me?
C: CALIBANOS
D: Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
C: GEORGE
D: I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
C: CALIBANOS
D: So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
N: George can't respond. Looks to Diego. Looks from the jury, the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable. He feels suddenly sleazy.
C: CALIBANOS
D: I thought so. No more questions.
E: CONT'D
N: Silence. The judge tells George he can step down. Calibanos laughs quietly with associates. George is bummed. He walks by Diego. They look at each other.
C: GEORGE
D: You shouldn't have taken the 30 million, Diego, I was out.
N: George is lead away.
C: CLERK
D: The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.
N: Jack Stevens is lead to the stand. WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY
N: The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a brown Mazda moves along Highway 19. Behind the wheel is a beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses. She drives absently, her mind somewhere else.
S: INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - 1999 - DAY
N: The woman is buzzed through the double doors. She moves to the MAN behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses.
C: KRISTINA
D: I'm here to see my father.
C: ADMISSIONS OFFICER
D: Name?
C: KRISTINA
D: Kristina Sunshine Jung.
S: EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - LATE AFTERNOON

S: INT. VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

C: ADMISSIONS OFFICER
D: Belongings in here.
E: CONT'D
N: Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions into a locker box. She is handed a key.
C: ADMISSIONS OFFICER
D: Feet on the blue line.
E: CONT'D
N: Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions officer buzzes open the giant metal door. But Kristina doesn't move.
C: ADMISSIONS OFFICER
D: Miss?
E: CONT'D
N: He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there.
C: ADMISSIONS OFFICER
D: Miss? Something wrong?
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS
N: George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.
C: GUARD
D: George? George, come on. You've got a visitor.
N: George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the gate. She moves through the open area and onto the grass quickly. SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at last in a long embrace.
C: GEORGE
D: I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
C: KRISTINA
D: It's alright, Dad.
C: GEORGE
D: I didn't mean to...
C: KRISTINA
D: I know, Dad. I know...
N: He hugs her hard.
C: GEORGE
D: I fucked up.
C: KRISTINA
D: Shhhh.
C: GEORGE
D: I love you. I love you so much. You've got to know that. You've got to know.
C: KRISTINA
D: I know, Dad. I love you too.
C: GEORGE
D: After everything. After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
N: Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears. There was no Kristina. The guard continues to tap.
C: GUARD
D: George? George, come on. It's getting dark.
N: George looks up to find a prison guard. His name is GUS, and he helps George to his feet.
C: GEORGE
D: But I have a visitor.
C: GUS
D: Not today, George. Time to go back.
C: GEORGE
D: But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow. My daughter.
C: GUS
D: Okay, George.
C: GEORGE
D: Because she's visiting me.
C: GUS
D: We'll do that tomorrow, okay? It's lockdown time.
N: The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement path that cuts through the grass. The huge structure of Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take the long walk back.
S: EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK
N: Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as she watches her father being led away. After a few moments, she turns around, walks to her car and gets in. Time to go home. And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they finally disappear. THE END.
