N: OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY
N: It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens.
S: EXT. BUS STOP - DAY
N: A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers. We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
S: INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Can I help you?
C: ADAM
D: I have an appointment.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Name?
C: ADAM
D: Adam Schwartz.
N: The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again. Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
C: ADAM
D: Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
E: CONT'D CONFUSED
N: With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.
C: ADAM
D: Oh, should I go sit?
E: CONT'D
N: The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine. Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time, Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Adam Schwartz.
N: Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Adam Schwartz.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Yeah, that's me.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Follow me.
N: The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown.
C: RECEPTIONIST
D: Put this on.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Do I need to take off all my clothes?
N: The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
C: ADAM
D: I'll figure it out.
E: CONT'D
N: The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right. Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.
C: NURSE JOANNE
D: Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you.
N: Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin.
C: ADAM
D: You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?
C: NURSE JOANNE
D: Cotton. You're funny.
E: LAUGHS
N: Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line.
C: NURSE JOANNE
D: Now I'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine. You think you can do that?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: You want me to fill this entire cup.
C: JOANNE
D: Yup.
N: Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
C: ADAM
D: It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. Can I take it home?
C: JOANNE
D: Take it home. You're so funny.
E: LAUGHS
N: The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to the next room:
S: INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOM
N: Adam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a knock on the door.
C: JOANNE
D: You okay in there Adam?
E: O.S.
C: ADAM
D: Just another minute.
N: Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
S: INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOM
N: Adam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the air, then the other, and so on. Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
S: INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM
N: Joanne pulls out a giant needle.
C: JOANNE
D: Here comes the choo-choo!
N: In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
S: INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM
N: Adam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
C: TECHNICIAN
D: Now make sure you lie completely still. Otherwise we'll have to do it all over again. Which we're not going to have to do, right?
E: AUTHORITATIVELY
S: INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATER
N: Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.
C: ADAM
D: Hello? Is anybody out there?
N: There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.
C: ADAM
D: I have to pee.
E: CONT'D
N: The Med Students continue to take notes. END OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING
N: Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets to night, then rises to morning...
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNING
N: SUPER: JUNE It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean. About a mile inland, we come upon:
S: EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAY
N: Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is Southern California Suburbia. The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and louder as we PUSH IN ON:
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences. Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up. The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up. Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion. After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -
C: RACHEL
D: Make it stop.
E: asleep and incoherent
C: ADAM
D: It won't turn off.
E: WHISPERS
N: Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head.
C: ADAM
D: Sorry.
E: CONT'D WHISPERS
N: Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself. Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.
C: RACHEL
D: Mmmmm.
N: Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair. Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair. She holds it up.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh my god.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: What?
C: RACHEL
D: I think you have a gray hair.
C: ADAM
D: Really?
C: RACHEL
D: I'm gonna pull it out.
C: ADAM
D: No! Don't touch it.
N: Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel rolls back to sleep.
S: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.
S: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair. He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.
S: INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
N: Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.
S: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
N: SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's put the Christ back in Christmas." Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment.
C: SETH
D: Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
N: The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave to Adam.
C: ANDREW
D: Hey Adam.
C: ADAM
D: Hey Andrew.
E: SEEMS ANNOYED
C: ANDREW
D: Sorry about the noise last night.
N: Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy giggle as they get into their car.
S: INT. SETH'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam gets into the car.
C: SETH
D: Yo.
C: ADAM
D: Yo.
C: SETH
D: ...What's that smell? Are you wearing perfume?
E: SNIFFS ADAM
C: ADAM
D: No.
C: SETH
D: Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias.
C: ADAM
D: I ran out of shampoo. I had to use Rachel's.
E: SMELLS HIMSELF
C: SETH
D: For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.
N: Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.
C: ADAM
D: Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air.
N: Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.
C: ADAM
D: Seriously, my allergies are flaring up. It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire.
E: CONT'D ANNOYED
N: Adam begins to clear his throat, Seth turns the music even louder.
C: SETH
D: Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER
N: We see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other.
C: SETH
D: I don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...He's wearing Capris!
C: ADAM
D: Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat... I guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down. Sex every three weeks is normal? Right?
E: THINKS BEAT
C: SETH
D: You haven't had sex in three weeks?
E: IN SHOCK
C: ADAM
D: You think maybe she's mad cause I haven't asked her to move in?
E: SHRUGS
C: SETH
D: What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons.
N: Seth laughs at his own joke.
C: SETH
D: But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: It's not that big a deal.
C: SETH
D: So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off...4 days. That's when I begin to worry.
C: ADAM
D: Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel?
C: SETH
D: Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.
C: ADAM
D: But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.
C: SETH
D: My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.
N: Adam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.
C: BARISTA
D: Morning gentlemen.
C: SETH
D: Would you sleep with my friend.
E: TO BARISTA
C: BARISTA
D: Like, right now?
C: SETH
D: No just in general.
C: BARISTA
D: Yeah, I'd fuck him.
N: The Barista yells to DEMETRI, the other Barista.
C: BARISTA
D: Hey Demetri, Fuckable?
E: CONT'D RE: ADAM
N: Demetri examines Adam. He's not impressed with what he sees.
C: DEMETRI
D: I'd let you blow me.
C: SETH
D: See this is what I'm saying.
E: TO ADAM
N: The Barista hands Seth and Adam two cups of coffee, they each leave a dollar.
S: INT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - LATER
N: Adam and Seth enter the museum. They pass JENNY (30) at the information desk.
C: SETH AND ADAM
D: Good morning Jenny.
N: Jenny ignores them.
C: SETH
D: I love you.
E: UNDER BREATH
N: PHIL (60), the museum's vivacious director approaches.
C: PHIL
D: Salutations gentlemen.
N: Phil sniffs the air and looks at Adam.
C: PHIL
D: Are you wearing perfume?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: It's Rachel's shampoo.
N: Phil goes in for a closer sniff. Then an even closer sniff. Adam looks uncomfortable.
C: PHIL
D: Fructis by L'oreal. My wife uses that. What are you wearing?
E: DECLARATIVE IMPRESSED TO SETH
N: Seth's eyes open wide as Phil goes in for a sniff.
C: PHIL
D: What is that?
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: Ah, mothballs?
N: Seth spots a GROUP OF SECOND GRADERS with their TEACHER assembled by the entrance.
C: SETH
D: Looks like my group is here.
E: CONT'D
N: Seth slaps on a button that reads "DOCENT" and rushes off to greet the students.
C: SETH
D: See you guys later.
E: CONT'D
N: Phil turns to Adam.
C: PHIL
D: How's the Origins exhibit coming along?
C: ADAM
D: We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic.
C: PHIL
D: I'm counting on you not to screw up. You're the only one I can trust.
E: looks into Adam's eyes BEAT MORE
C: PHIL
D: The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors...We're a dying art Adam.
E: CONT'D
N: Phil stares into Adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity. It's incredibly awkward.
C: ADAM
D: Phil?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah?
C: ADAM
D: I should probably get to work.
C: PHIL
D: That's probably a good idea.
N: Phil looks at the clock - 10 a.m.
C: PHIL
D: I think I'm gonna go to lunch.
E: CONT'D
N: Phil wanders off.
S: INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - LATER
N: Adam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.
C: ADAM
D: Greg. What are you doing?
C: GREG
D: It's a velociraptor.
C: ADAM
D: Where did it come from?
C: GREG
D: The dinosaur exhibit. Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...People love dinosaurs.
E: off Adam's look
N: Adam cringes in frustration.
C: ADAM
D: Greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it.
N: Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam. Seth leads his tour of second graders. He speaks like a tour guide at Universal Studios.
C: SETH
D: Coming up here on our left is the "Origins of Man" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it. Adam!
E: SPOTS ADAM
N: Adam looks up. He hates this part of his job.
C: SETH
D: Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam gives a reluctant wave.
C: ADAM
D: Hey kids.
C: SETH
D: Why don't you tell us what we're looking at.
E: TO ADAM
C: ADAM
D: This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago...
E: BEGRUDGINGLY
N: In excitement, the kids move in for a closer look. Unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails.
C: ADAM
D: ...these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans...
E: CONT'D
N: KID 1 touches the Cro Magnon father. Still talking, Adam steps in and moves Kid 1's hand off.
C: ADAM
D: ...What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick.
E: CONT'D
N: KID 1 (TO SETH) This is lame! I thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs.
C: GREG
D: See, I told you.
E: TO ADAM
N: Damage control. Seth points to a life sized NEANDERTHAL MAN holding a spear.
C: SETH
D: Who wants to hear about the caveman?
E: IN EXCITEMENT
N: Seth picks up the spear and pretends to charge Adam.
C: SETH
D: Caveman. RRRRRR!
E: CONT'D
N: The kids cheer. Annoyed, Adam takes the spear out of Seth's hand.
C: ADAM
D: This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe. But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone.
C: GREG
D: What happened?
C: ADAM
D: Greg you know what happened.
C: GREG
D: I do?
C: SETH
D: Come on! Tell us what happened to the caveman.
C: ADAM
D: Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.
C: SETH
D: That's quite a story. Thank you Adam.
E: game show voice
N: Seth and Adam look at the kids, they look bored.
C: SETH
D: You really know how to win a crowd.
E: CONT'D Quietly to Adam
C: ADAM
D: But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now. And by the looks of this guy HERE - I'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders.
E: to the kids points at Neanderthal
N: Adam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero response from the kids. KID 1 This sucks ass. Adam and Seth look at each other in shock...Seth chimes in -
C: SETH
D: I see dinosaurs.
N: Seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. The kids follow in excitement. The teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group.
S: EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - LATER
N: Adam enters the hospital...
S: INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOM - LATER
N: Adam leafs through a pamphlet on Incontinence. The pedantic DR. ROSS enters and completely ignores Adam. Instead, he looks over Adam's chart, examines his MRI scans, and pulls out a DICTAPHONE -
C: DR. ROSS
D: Patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats. Blood tests and urine analysis are normal. MRI indicates a massive intraduaral extradural
E: into the dictaphone
C: MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA
D: neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion.
N: We see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Growth extends from the L2 to L5. Cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended.
E: CONT'D
N: Dr. Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Yes. Questions?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I have no idea what you just said. Is there something wrong with me?
E: DUMBFOUNDED
C: DR. ROSS
D: If you look here on your MRI, you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column?
E: points to MRI
N: Adam squints. It all looks the same.
C: DR. ROSS
D: That is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I still have no idea what you're talking about.
C: DR. ROSS
D: It's a malignant tumor.
C: ADAM
D: What?!...A tumor? No.
C: DR. ROSS
D: I'm afraid so.
C: ADAM
D: How is that possible?...I don't smoke. I don't drink. I eat healthy...I even recycle.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Well Adam it's actually quite fascinating. Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. In your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine.
N: Adam looks at himself in the mirror.
C: ADAM
D: But, look at me. I don't look sick.
E: still in denial
C: DR. ROSS
D: Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. We're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes.
E: MORE
C: DR. ROSS
D: I'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. It's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work.
E: CONT'D BEAT
N: This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature figurines. Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.
C: ADAM
D: Can't you just cut it out of me?
C: DR. ROSS
D: Yes, that is an option. But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. Cutting it out now would be risky.
C: ADAM
D: Well what are my chances of beating this?
N: Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but. DR. Ross Listen, you're in good hands. The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...Let me do the worrying. Alright? Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Maybe you should talk to someone.
E: CONT'D
N: Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai Psychology Group".
C: DR. ROSS
D: We have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital. They specialize in cases...in these...sort of matters. They'll be able to help you.
E: CONT'D
N: Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch, looks back to Adam, and moves to the door.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Hang in there champ.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. SAN DIEGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - EVENING
N: CLOSE ON a computer screen: "Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma. Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation offer negligible success rates. Surgical resection proven to be most effective. Risks of surgery: Amputation of limbs. Paralysis. Death. 2 Year survival rate: 50%. If tumor metastasizes systemically, 2 year survival rate: 0%." Adam sits staring at the screen. This is not good. The LIBRARIAN, a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the shoulder.
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Hey bro, time's up.
N: Startled. Adam looks up at the librarian.
C: ADAM
D: Can I have just a few more minutes?
C: LIBRARIAN
D: Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit. Rules.
E: EMBARRASSED
N: The librarian motions to the LONG LINE of mostly HOMELESS CUSTOMERS waiting to use the computer.
S: INT. BUS - EVENING
N: Adam sits deep in thought.
S: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
N: The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a deep breath...
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam? Is that you?
E: O.S.
N: Adam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her. God she looks sexy. Rachel turns -
C: RACHEL
D: Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made vegetarian goulash.
E: CONT'D in a Hungarian accent
N: Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another story.
C: RACHEL
D: What is wrong?
E: CONT'D still using accent
C: ADAM
D: Nothing.
C: RACHEL
D: Liar.
E: still using accent
N: This is not going to be easy.
C: ADAM
D: We need to talk.
N: Rachel drops the accent. This seems serious.
C: RACHEL
D: Why? What's going on?
C: ADAM
D: I had a doctor's appointment today.
C: RACHEL
D: What kind of doctor's appointment?
E: WORRIED
N: Adam has no idea what to say.
C: ADAM
D: Have you ever seen the movie "Beaches"?
C: RACHEL
D: You mean with Bette Midler?
C: ADAM
D: Yeah that one.
C: RACHEL
D: Not as good as "The Rose", but good.
C: ADAM
D: Remember the end of "Beaches"?
C: RACHEL
D: Yeah. Sad....What does that have to do with you?
E: CONFUSED
N: Adam just looks her in the eyes...Rachel gets it.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh. Oh my god.
E: CONT'D
N: In total shock, Rachel covers her mouth.
C: RACHEL
D: What kind?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I don't know.
C: RACHEL
D: You don't know?
C: ADAM
D: Well I do know, but I can't pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or something.
C: RACHEL
D: Well how bad is it?
C: ADAM
D: It's not good.
N: Rachel hugs Adam. Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck. He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing running through his mind is sex. After a beat Rachel pulls away.
C: RACHEL
D: You have cancer.
E: begins to cry
N: Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry. She reaches back as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. She sticks her hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American Spirits. Adam looks at Rachel disapprovingly.
C: RACHEL
D: Not now.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam I'm 24 years old! You're 25.
E: CATCHES HERSELF
N: Rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on the stove and takes a drag.
C: RACHEL
D: What are we going to do? I don't know what to do.
E: CONT'D
N: Rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette. Adam takes the cigarette out of her hand. He goes to put it out, but takes a drag instead. He then hugs Rachel with one hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.
C: ADAM
D: Sshhhh. Everything's going to be alright Yammy. I'm going to start chemo in a few days. We're going to get through this.
E: POSITIVE
N: They embrace in total silence...A beat. And then Adam groans with the realization -
C: ADAM
D: Ugh...and my parents are coming over for dinner.
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: Do they know?
N: Adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents.
C: ADAM
D: No.
N: PRE LAP: The sound of a doorbell...
T: SMASH CUT:
S: INT. FOYER - ADAM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Rachel and Adam stand in front of the door.
C: ADAM
D: 3...2...1...
N: Rachel opens the door.
C: ADAM
D: Hey.
E: CONT'D BIG SMILE
N: Adam's mother, EDITH SCHWARTZ (55) enters. Edith is a short, portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt bearing a cross-stitched cat on it. If the borough of Queens and the city of Milwaukee had a child, it would be Edith.
C: EDITH
D: There they are!
E: EXCITED
N: Edith gives Rachel a big hug, and grabs for her left hand.
C: EDITH
D: I can't wait to hear the big news.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Where's dad?
N: ART SCHWARTZ(58) enters the house carrying a CAT. Due to a stroke 10 years prior, he carries a limp and is a little out of it.
C: ART
D: I found your cat playing in the neighbors yard.
C: ADAM
D: Dad, I don't have a cat.
N: Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door.
C: EDITH
D: So what's for dinner?
S: INT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER
N: Everyone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at.
C: RACHEL
D: If I had known you were coming I would have made something else.
C: EDITH
D: I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son... So this isn't meat?
E: looks at her plate
C: RACHEL
D: No it's called sei-tan.
C: ADAM
D: It's made of wheat gluten.
N: Edith looks more confused.
C: EDITH
D: But it's not meat.
C: RACHEL
D: No, but it has a texture just like meat.
N: Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash.
C: EDITH
D: Mmmmm. It's Good.
E: INSINCERE
N: Edith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art.
C: EDITH
D: Art, take your pills.
E: CONT'D
N: Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow.
C: EDITH
D: Swallow.
E: CONT'D
N: As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel.
C: EDITH
D: So? Did you set a date?
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: A date?
E: CONFUSED
C: EDITH
D: Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was? Schlepping around in the heat like that. Plus the bugs and the gnats.
E: TO ADAM
C: ADAM
D: What is she talking about?
E: whispers to Rachel
C: EDITH
D: And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert?
C: RACHEL
D: She thinks we're getting married.
E: whispers to Adam
C: ADAM
D: Mom. We're not getting married.
C: EDITH
D: Oh thank god. No offense. So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here.
E: TO RACHEL TO ADAM
N: Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news...
C: ADAM
D: Have you ever seen "Terms of Endearment"?
C: RACHEL
D: Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.
C: EDITH
D: Tell me what?
C: ADAM
D: Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm.
C: EDITH
D: Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic.
C: ADAM
D: Mom, just promise me. Okay?
C: EDITH
D: I promise...You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon.
N: Here goes nothing.
C: ADAM
D: I have cancer.
E: MUMBLES
C: EDITH
D: What?
C: ADAM
D: I have cancer.
E: MUMBLES
C: EDITH
D: What is he saying?
E: TO RACHEL
C: ADAM
D: I have cancer.
E: takes a deep breath
C: EDITH
D: Cancer? What do you mean you have cancer?
C: ADAM
D: I - HAVE - CANCER.
C: EDITH
D: I don't understand.
C: ADAM
D: Mom, I have a giant tumor in my spine.
N: Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. The only indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy, tying to anticipate his mother's next move.
C: ADAM
D: Mom?
E: CONT'D
N: Edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen. Adam follows after her.
C: ADAM
D: Mom, what are you doing?
E: CONT'D
N: Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea.
C: EDITH
D: I'm making you green tea.
C: ADAM
D: Please, will you come sit down.
N: Edith holds up the package of Green Tea.
C: EDITH
D: I saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent.
C: ADAM
D: Mom, I already have cancer.
N: Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack.
C: EDITH
D: Here take these.
N: Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a large number of prescription pills.
C: EDITH
D: Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor, Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Mom, please, stop. I don't need these.
C: EDITH
D: Just take the god-damn pills.
E: YELLS
N: Adam take Edith's hand.
C: ADAM
D: Mom.
N: Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical.
C: EDITH
D: How could this happen?
C: ADAM
D: It's genetic.
C: EDITH
D: Genetic? It must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick. Your uncle Bobby just got Crohns.
N: Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash...
C: ART
D: That's a disorder of the bowels, son. How are your bowels?
C: ADAM
D: The problem is not with my bowels.
C: ART
D: You're a lucky man.
C: ADAM
D: Thanks dad.
C: EDITH
D: I'm moving in.
C: ADAM
D: What? No. Absolutely not.
C: EDITH
D: Adam, I'm your mother, and I need to be close to you in your time of need.
C: ADAM
D: That's a terrible idea.
C: EDITH
D: Well who's going to take care of you?
C: ADAM
D: Mom, I'm fine.
C: EDITH
D: I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer.
C: ADAM
D: It's nothing. Really.
C: EDITH
D: Nothing! You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing.
N: Adam looks to Rachel for support.
C: RACHEL
D: Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But I promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. I'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son.
C: EDITH
D: You're a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl. You know that? You don't deserve her.
E: TO ADAM
N: Adam looks at Rachel and smiles.
C: ADAM
D: I know.
S: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
N: Adam and Seth stand on an endless line of BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN waiting for their morning coffee. Greg is at the front of that line - he's taking forever to decide what he wants. Adam impatiently looks at his watch.
C: ADAM
D: What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee?
N: Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN behind him.
C: SETH
D: Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - "I have these things and I want the world to see them."
E: quietly to Adam
N: Greg looks up at the menu of endless options.
C: GREG
D: What about that frozen drink, what's that like?
C: BARISTA
D: The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute heaven.
E: ENTHUSIASTIC
C: GREG
D: I don't know. Does it have a lot of sugar?
C: ADAM
D: We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car?
N: Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.
C: SETH
D: Why are you in such a rush?
N: Adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations.
C: ADAM
D: Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place?
N: Greg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps.
C: ADAM
D: I don't believe it. Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning.
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: Relax. We have plenty of time.
C: ADAM
D: No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite.
C: SETH
D: What the fuck is wrong with you?
C: ADAM
D: I have cancer.
E: QUIETLY
C: SETH
D: Yeah right.
E: LAUGHS
C: ADAM
D: I'm serious.
C: SETH
D: Get the fuck out of here. You have cancer?
N: People in line look at Seth.
C: ADAM
D: Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement.
C: SETH
D: When did this happen?
E: QUIETLY
C: ADAM
D: Yesterday. They found a tumor in my spine.
C: SETH
D: Who?
C: ADAM
D: What do you mean who?
C: SETH
D: Who found the tumor?
C: ADAM
D: Lewis and Clark...The doctors found it.
C: SETH
D: When were you going to tell me?
C: ADAM
D: I'm telling you now.
C: SETH
D: If I had cancer I'd tell you right away.
C: ADAM
D: What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up.
C: SETH
D: Holy shit!
N: Seth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his face...he quickly shakes it off.
C: SETH
D: Okay, let's relax here. I think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side.
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: ADAM
D: The bright side of what?
C: SETH
D: This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. This is it. This is your time to live it up. Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get?
E: EMPHATICALLY A BEAT
S: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital.
S: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. In Adam's hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group" written on it. He finds the office and knocks on the half opened door. The office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about. An attractive young woman, KATIE (26), sits behind a desk reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich. Katie takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student. Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich.
C: KATIE
D: Can I help you?
E: mouth full of food
C: ADAM
D: I have an appointment with Dr. McRae.
N: Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake Adam's.
C: KATIE
D: Please call me Katie.
C: ADAM
D: You're Dr. McRae?
E: CONFUSED
C: KATIE
D: You were expecting someone else?
N: Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.
C: ADAM
D: Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters?
C: KATIE
D: Why? Did someone say that's what I look like?
E: SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE
C: ADAM
D: No, no, no. I was just expecting someone older.
C: KATIE
D: Sorry to disappoint you.
C: ADAM
D: No believe me, you're fine. Better than fine, you're Dr. McRae...you're a doctor? How old are you?
C: KATIE
D: Twenty-six.
C: ADAM
D: Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser?
C: KATIE
D: Who?
C: ADAM
D: Doogie Howser...
N: Off Katie's blank look.
C: ADAM
D: ...The teenage doctor.
E: CONT'D
C: KATIE
D: Does he work here?
C: ADAM
D: No. Nevermind...but aren't you young to be a doctor?
C: KATIE
D: I'm actually in my final semester of medical school. This is a training hospital.
E: off Adam's look
C: ADAM
D: So have you had many patients?
C: KATIE
D: You're actually my first.
N: That did not help to ease Adam's anxiety.
C: ADAM
D: Oh.
C: KATIE
D: Please sit.
N: Adam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from it as possible. Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.
C: KATIE
D: Dr. Ross filled me in on your situation. Tell me, how have you been feeling?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Honestly. I feel fine.
C: KATIE
D: I think that's great considering what you're going through.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah, but I tend to internalize everything so, who knows.
C: KATIE
D: You mean you repress as a coping mechanism.
C: ADAM
D: Is that what I do?
C: KATIE
D: That's what you just said.
C: ADAM
D: The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. When you say it, it's like an indictment. The word "repress" - sounds so harsh.
C: KATIE
D: It's actually quite common.
C: ADAM
D: Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm anything but an emotional sheep.
C: KATIE
D: Don't think of it in those terms. It's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.
C: ADAM
D: So how do we do that?
C: KATIE
D: The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. This is your chance to correct that.
C: ADAM
D: You're not in a cult are you?
C: KATIE
D: Now, why do you say that?
C: ADAM
D: I don't know, it was a bad joke.
C: KATIE
D: But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel.
N: Katie is losing Adam.
C: KATIE
D: In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy.
C: KATIE
D: So today what I want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy.
E: CONT'D
N: Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion.
C: ADAM
D: Huh?
C: KATIE
D: I want you to lay back and close your eyes.
N: Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.
C: ADAM
D: Lay here?
C: KATIE
D: Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go.
C: ADAM
D: Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call girl?
C: KATIE
D: Another joke?
C: ADAM
D: Oh come on. Nothing? That was funny.
E: SHRUGS
C: KATIE
D: Ssshhhhh...
N: Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention. He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain.
C: KATIE
D: Close your eyes and relax. Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam closes his eyes.
T: FADE TO BLACK:
C: RACHEL
D: Keep your eyes closed. No peeking.
E: O.S.
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed.
C: ADAM
D: I can't believe you got me a present. Is it that Prada handbag I've been eyeing?
E: BEAT
C: RACHEL
D: Even better.
E: O.S.
C: ADAM
D: What is it?
C: RACHEL
D: Keep your eyes closed.
E: O.S.
C: ADAM
D: You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted.
C: RACHEL
D: You're not adopted.
E: O.S.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was.
N: Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam.
C: RACHEL
D: Okay. Open your eyes.
N: Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair.
C: RACHEL
D: Surprise!
E: CONT'D
N: Adam stares in confusion.
C: ADAM
D: What is it?
E: DISAPPOINTED
C: RACHEL
D: It's Noodle.
C: ADAM
D: It's so small. What do you do with it?
C: RACHEL
D: Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable...Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process.
E: ANNOYED
C: ADAM
D: Why, did it go to medical school?
C: RACHEL
D: I thought you'd be happy...
E: PISSED
C: ADAM
D: It looks like a gremlin. What happens if you get it wet after midnight?
N: Rachel looks furious. Adam backtracks.
C: ADAM
D: They're a lot of work.
E: CONT'D REASONING MORE
C: ADAM
D: I can barely take care of myself, I don't think I can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life.
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: I didn't realize it would be such a big deal. I can bring him back to the shelter in the morning.
E: PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE
C: ADAM
D: I know what you're doing.
C: RACHEL
D: No, you're right, it's not a good idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized.
N: The dog looks at Adam. It's hopeless, there's no way Adam's going to win this one.
C: ADAM
D: Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog.
C: RACHEL
D: Really?
C: ADAM
D: Really.
N: Rachel's face lights up. She hugs Adam.
C: RACHEL
D: This is going to be so good for you.
N: Adam turns to see the dog shitting on the carpet.
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING
N: The sun sets over the San Diego skyline.
S: INT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - NIGHT
N: It's Adam's going away party. Draped across the entrance is a "Bon Voyage" banner with an image of a Cruise Ship. Adam, Rachel and Seth enter to find a crowd of mostly unfamiliar faces. Phil, who has had one too many vodka tonics, approaches Adam - drink in hand.
C: PHIL
D: There he is, the man of the hour.
E: ANNOUNCES
C: ADAM
D: Here I am.
N: Phil takes a sip from his glass, and then offers it to Adam.
C: PHIL
D: Martini?
C: ADAM
D: No thanks.
N: Phil puts his arm around Adam and gestures wildly - causing his drink to splash on Adam.
C: PHIL
D: So cancer?
C: ADAM
D: Yup. The Big C.
C: PHIL
D: Man!
N: Phil tugs on Adam's hair.
C: PHIL
D: Are you wearing a wig?
E: CONT'D WHISPERS
C: ADAM
D: Nope, this is my real hair.
C: PHIL
D: I'm gonna miss you so much buddy.
E: SENTIMENTAL
C: ADAM
D: I'm going to miss you too.
E: UNCOMFORTABLE
N: Phil puts his head on Adam's shoulder.
C: ADAM
D: Excuse me for a moment, I think I see someone over there from a previous life.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO:
N: Adam is talking with his co-worker JOE.
C: JOE
D: Have you started chemo yet?
C: ADAM
D: No, not yet.
C: JOE
D: Don't do it man. It'll fuck you up. That's like some Nagasaki shit.
T: CUT TO:
N: Adam stands with SUSAN.
C: SUSAN
D: You want to know the secret?
C: ADAM
D: Ah, okay.
C: SUSAN
D: Eat nothing but green foods.
C: ADAM
D: Like a specific kind of green food?
C: SUSAN
D: No, any green food. It works, my sister's friend survived lung cancer.
T: CUT TO:
N: Adam stands with TED.
C: TED
D: So what kind of cancer do you have?
E: SUSPICIOUS
C: ADAM
D: Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas.
C: TED
D: Never heard of it.
C: ADAM
D: It's pretty rare.
C: TED
D: Yeah well, you don't look sick.
C: ADAM
D: Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick.
C: TED
D: Huh.
E: SUSPICIOUS
T: CUT BACK TO:
N: Adam with Susan again...
C: SUSAN
D: There's spinach, zucchini, broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi, Zucchini,
C: ADAM
D: I think you already said zucchini.
C: SUSAN
D: Zucchini...
E: ANNOYED
N: From across the room, Adam and Rachel lock eyes. He gives her a defeated look, as if to say "help me." Rachel gives a sympathetic smile.
C: SUSAN
D: Are you paying attention?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Uh huh.
E: caught off guard
C: SUSAN
D: Cause I'm only trying to help save your life.
N: From across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile.
T: CUT TO:
N: Adam is talking with EDDIE.
C: EDDIE
D: There's this guy on the beach who injects oxygen into your blood.
E: SECRETLY

E: CRYING
C: SETH
D: I know, it's crazy.
C: JENNY
D: I've seen him every day for the past two years and I've never once made an effort to talk to him.
C: SETH
D: Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him.
C: JENNY
D: Oh what does it matter? It's too late.
N: Jenny walks away crying. Seth follows after her.
C: SETH
D: Wait. It's not too late.
T: CUT TO:
N: Adam makes himself a drink at the bar. Greg approaches.
C: GREG
D: Hey Adam.
C: ADAM
D: Hey Greg.
E: less than excited
C: GREG
D: My uncle had what you have.
C: ADAM
D: Really?
C: GREG
D: Man that was the worst.
C: ADAM
D: Your uncle had Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas.
C: GREG
D: Yeah, I think so. It's the thing with the toe and the screaming, and everything tastes like olives? Right?
N: Adam looks perplexed.
S: INT. RACHEL'S CAR - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
N: Rachel and Adam drive home from the party. They're in completely different moods.
C: ADAM
D: Well that was a nightmare.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam, those people just threw you a party...They love you.
C: ADAM
D: Half those people don't even know me.
N: The car stops at a red light. Rachel looks at Adam. She finds his pouting adorable. He sees her staring,
C: ADAM
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: Nothing.
C: ADAM
D: What?
E: SMILES
C: RACHEL
D: I love you.

T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Adam and Rachel make-out as they enter the house.
S: INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: They make their way into the bedroom and clumsily undress one another. Adam looks at Rachel's naked body.
C: ADAM
D: You are so unbelievably sexy.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm totally yours,
N: Suddenly there's a loud scratching at the bedroom door, followed by a loud whimpering. Rachel stops.
C: RACHEL
D: Noodle.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: What?
C: RACHEL
D: The dog.
N: Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
C: ADAM
D: Ignore him.
C: RACHEL
D: I think he needs to go out.
C: ADAM
D: I'll do it after.

S: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog to do his business.
C: ADAM
D: Come on. Today...If I don't get laid tonight because of you, I'm going to take your little bow and make a noose...

N: The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot.
C: ADAM
D: Please! I need this.
E: CONT'D PLEADING
N: ADAM'S NEIGHBOR walks by with A GIANT MASTIFF. He sees Adam yelling at the little Shi Tzu in ribbons. Adam looks up...

C: NEIGHBOR
D: Nice dog.
N: Once the neighbor is out of sight-
C: ADAM
D: Will you please just finish.

S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes. He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps it tight against her chest.
C: RACHEL
D: Hold me.
C: ADAM
D: Mother fucker.
E: UNDER BREATH
N: The two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's body. A beat.
C: ADAM
D: Do you...want to move in?
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: Do you want me to?
C: ADAM
D: I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo starting...
N: Rachel turns to Adam.
C: ADAM
D: You're here all the time anyway.
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: Okay.
E: SMILES
N: Rachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest.
C: ADAM
D: You wanna have sex?
E: WHISPERS
C: RACHEL
D: In the morning.
E: ASLEEP
S: EXT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MORNING
N: Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop as it parks in the last empty space. Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before they realize Art is still in the car.
C: EDITH
D: Art come on.
C: ART
D: I'm coming.
N: Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car.
C: EDITH
D: We're late.
N: Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car.
S: INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Edith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. The service led by RABBI JACOBS (75) has already begun. Edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row. Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since the service has begun - getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people. The USHER approaches.
C: USHER
D: Please take your seats.
N: The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back.
C: EDITH
D: What about those seats up there in the front?
C: USHER
D: The service has begun.
C: EDITH
D: Please. My son has cancer.
N: Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam couldn't be more uncomfortable.
C: USHER
D: Please, follow me.
N: The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through. Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by.
C: EDITH
D: Sorry, my son has cancer.
E: QUIETLY
N: Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past.
C: ADAM
D: Hi. Nice to see you.
E: QUIETLY
S: INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE. ATRIUM - LATER
N: Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing and conversing after the service. ROSE (60) approaches.
C: ROSE
D: Edith. How are you?
E: CONCERNED
C: EDITH
D: Oh Rose. Things are not well.
E: OVERDRAMATIC
C: ROSE
D: I heard about the cancer.
E: WHISPERS
C: EDITH
D: I can't tell you how hard it's been on me. My only child. God only knows what terrible thing I did to deserve this. I've got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer. Not to mention my arthritis. I don't know how I'll ever get through it.
N: As Adam walks through the atrium, he notices everyone whispering and pointing at him. Rabbi Jacobs (75) exits the bathroom, pulls up his fly and spots Adam. Jacobs has the face of a leather couch from all the tanning and face lifts. He spots Adam.
C: RABBI
D: Ladies and gentleman, Adam Schwartz!
C: ADAM
D: Rabbi Jacobs.
C: RABBI
D: How are you son?
C: ADAM
D: Oh you know, just trying to live by the Covenant.
C: RABBI
D: Don't bullshit me. You were the worst student I ever had. I bet you haven't even spoken a word of Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah.
C: ADAM
D: I don't like to brag, but I couldn't speak it then.
C: RABBI
D: Your mother told me about your situation.
N: Adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of having a son with cancer.
C: ADAM
D: I'm sure she did.
C: RABBI
D: It's not easy for a mother to see her son go through something like this,
C: ADAM
D: Nothing is easy for my mother.
C: RABBI
D: Have you thought about trying to reconnect with the Torah?
C: ADAM
D: Honestly, I'm just here to make my mother happy. It was either this or I had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatre's adaptation of "You've Got Mail".
C: RABBI
D: Well think about it. I'm always here.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: ALAN ALDA looks directly into the camera. The year is 1970.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: Hi there, I'm Alan Alda...
N: Alan Alda walks down the hospital corridor.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: So you've been told you have cancer. Well, you're not alone. 1 in every 3 people living today will experience some form of the disease...
E: CONT'D
N: A shot of people walking in Times Square, arrows slowly pop up over the heads of every third person.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: You may be wondering what is cancer? Well, cancer is a group of more than 100 different diseases characterized by the abnormal growth of cells. These cells form a lump or mass called a "tumor".
E: CONT'D
N: A reddish freckle dissolves into massive tumor.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: Cancer is treated through the use of a revolutionizing medicine called Che-mo-therapy.
E: V.O. CONT'D

C: ALAN ALDA
D: It works by destroying cancer cells; unfortunately, it cannot tell the difference between cancer cells and healthy cells.
E: CONT'D
N: Shot of a poorly designed diagram of the human body. A milky substance runs through the body destroying all the various cells in it's path.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: As a result, it's going to make you feel tired...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Image of yawning kitten.

C: ALAN ALDA

E: CONT'D
N: A shot of a girls volleyball team. One of the players serves up a pass and another spikes it down. All the girls high- five.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: It's important that you talk openly with your health care providers. Ask questions so you can know all the facts. Being prepared is half the battle...
E: V.O. CONT'D
N: Back on Alan Alda.
C: ALAN ALDA
D: Toward helping yourself begin to feel in control again...On behalf of all the great folks at Mount Sinai Hospital, I'd like to thank you for your time...make it a great day.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: A small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching the video. The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around baffled by both the video and the clapping. GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the room.
C: GEORGE
D: Adam Schwartz.
N: Adam stands.
C: GEORGE
D: Come with me my baby.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward. Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms. A sick, fat, BALD ELDERLY WOMAN coughs as she passes. Adam winces in disgust.
C: GEORGE
D: This way my baby.
E: CONT'D
N: George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room.
S: INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER
N: Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years. Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like state helps Adam relax. Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator. Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall. Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices.
C: MITCH
D: That's Henry.
C: ADAM
D: Is he okay?
C: MITCH
D: He's always like that.
C: ADAM
D: Is that going to happen to me?
E: TERRIFIED
C: MITCH
D: Best not worry about these things.
N: ALAN (84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch chimes in.
C: ALAN
D: Want a hit?
E: TO ADAM
N: Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding a ONE HITTER full of weed.
C: MITCH
D: It makes it all a little easier to handle.
C: ADAM
D: What if someone sees us?
E: PARANOID
C: ALAN
D: Don't be such an old man. Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do.
N: Adam reluctantly takes a hit.
C: MITCH
D: How old are you?
C: ADAM
D: Twenty-five.
C: ALAN
D: You're lucky. Life only gets worse anyway.
C: MITCH
D: Alan, stop it. Don't listen to him, he's just messing with you.
E: TO ADAM
C: ALAN
D: No I'm not. It's all downhill from here. Trust me. First your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink. You'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal Miata. Then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up.
E: TO ADAM
C: MITCH
D: You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time.
C: ALAN
D: I'm just being realistic. You want some advice?
E: TO ADAM
C: ADAM
D: Not really.
C: ALAN
D: Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be.
C: ADAM
D: I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better.
N: Alan and Mitch laugh.
C: ALAN
D: I like this kid. I'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma. Pleased to meet you.
E: TO MITCH TO ADAM
C: MITCH
D: Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate cancer.
C: ADAM
D: Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.
C: ALAN
D: What the fuck is that?...Sounds like the greek dish I had for lunch.
N: Adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed.
C: ADAM
D: ... man this pot is really strong.
C: MITCH
D: Medicinal.
C: ALAN
D: Good shit eh.
N: Adam stares off into space. He's really high, almost like he's tripping. The walls start spinning.
T: FADE TO:
S: EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY (DREAM)
N: Adam is standing on line for a Roller Coaster. He gets to the front of the line when the CARNIE stops him.
C: CARNIE
D: Hey you! What do you think you're doing?
N: Everything Adam says is in German and subtitled in English.
C: ADAM
D: I want to ride.
C: CARNIE
D: Read the sign.
N: The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer."
C: ADAM
D: I don't have cancer.
C: CARNIE
D: Then what's that?
N: The Carnie points out Adam's T-shirt, it reads "I'M WITH CANCER." Adam turns around to see a GIANT BALD FAT MAN eating cotton candy, his shirt reads "CANCER". Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat Bald Guy via an umbilical cord. The Giant Fat Bald Guy reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him. END DREAM SEQUENCE
S: INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: Adam jolts out of bed. His clothes are drenched in sweat. He looks down to see Rachel sleeping peacefully next to him. He quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom. And by the sound of it, throws up. A lot. Rachel mutters something incoherent and then sprawls out, consuming the entire bed.
S: INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
N: Adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo. He's never felt worse.
C: KATIE
D: So how do you feel after your first treatment?
C: ADAM
D: I feel like I was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club.
C: KATIE
D: Is everything with you going to be a joke?
C: ADAM
D: I'm serious. Have you heard their horn section?
C: KATIE
D: Adam, you have a responsibility to your mind and body.
C: ADAM
D: I was just injected with three pints of kryptonite. Can we please hold off on the new agey stuff.
C: KATIE
D: You can't just sit there and ignore what's happening to you...You need to stop bottling everything up.
C: ADAM
D: What I need is for people to stop telling me what I need.
C: KATIE
D: Have you considered that this cancer is nature's way of telling you to change the way you live your life? ...There's an old saying - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.
E: off Adam's look
C: ADAM
D: They teach you that in medical school?
N: Katie's patience is waning.
C: KATIE
D: I know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet.
C: ADAM
D: An outlet for what? I have cancer.
E: FRUSTRATED
C: KATIE
D: And how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own emotions?
N: Adam snaps, rasing his voice.
C: ADAM
D: Well excuse me. You'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life.
N: Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst. She stays firm.
C: KATIE
D: You don't have to be here.
N: Adam knows he went too far. Plus, that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.
C: ADAM
D: I'm sorry, I know you're only trying to help.
E: MORE
C: ADAM
D: This is all too much for me. I don't know what to do. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.
E: CONT'D
N: Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical.
C: KATIE
D: I want you to do some homework. Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy. They should help you get started.
N: Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it. WE PUSH IN ON THE LIST OF BOOKS:
S: INT. BOOKSTORE. SELF HELP SECTION - DAY
N: WE PULL OUT ON THE LIST OF BOOKS: Adam and Seth browse through shelves of books. Seth is reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's list.
C: SETH
D: "Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'. Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness"... You're actually going to read this shit? This guy is a fucking tool.
E: IN EXCITEMENT
N: Seth ditches the New Age book and picks up one on Mardi Gras.
C: SETH
D: Let's go to Mardi Gras!
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Why would we go to Mardi Gras?
C: SETH
D: Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest.
C: ADAM
D: I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it.
C: SETH
D: We need to go see the world.
C: ADAM
D: This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here.
C: SETH
D: Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste.
E: FRUSTRATED
N: Adam takes the book from Seth's hands and puts it down.
C: ADAM
D: I'm not going anywhere.
N: From across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE (30), an attractive employee stacking books.
C: SETH
D: Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I will.
N: Seth yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire.
C: SETH
D: Excuse me.
E: CONT'D
C: CLAIRE
D: Yes, how can I help you?
C: SETH
D: I'm looking to buy a few books -
N: Seth hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads.
C: CLAIRE
D: Oh. Are these for...I'm sorry it's none of my business.
E: CONCERNED
C: SETH
D: No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam.
N: Seth nods towards Adam across the room.
C: SETH
D: He's pretty sick.
E: CONT'D
N: Claire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying puppy. Adam looks on in confusion.
C: CLAIRE
D: How awful.
C: SETH
D: Yeah. Cancer, not cool.
C: CLAIRE
D: Poor guy.
C: SETH
D: I know it's been really hard.
N: Claire leans in.
C: CLAIRE
D: It's bad isn't it?
C: SETH
D: Honestly? Sometimes I just wish it was me instead of him...to relieve some of the burden, you know? I just...I just want to help.
E: FEIGNING SADNESS
S: INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER
N: Adam and Seth exit the bookstore. They pass Claire who gives Seth a big smile followed by the "call me" motion.
C: ADAM
D: What just happened?
C: SETH
D: I'll tell you what happened. Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train.
E: TO ADAM
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Adam and Seth smoke a joint as they watch "Planet Earth" on a brand new 50" flat screen TV. There are a dozen oversized boxes marked "Rachel" scattered throughout the house. Rachel yells from the bedroom.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam do you know where the dog leash is?
E: O.C.
C: ADAM
D: Are you going to the park again?
N: Rachel enters the room with the dog cradled in her arms.
C: ADAM
D: This is the third time today.
E: CONT'D
C: RACHEL
D: He likes running around with the other dogs.
C: ADAM
D: He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself.
N: Rachel finds the leash and then smells the joint.
C: RACHEL
D: Are you smoking weed?
E: TAKEN ABACK
C: ADAM
D: Yeah.
C: RACHEL
D: Since when do you smoke?
C: ADAM
D: It's medicinal.
N: Rachel's shocked, this is way out of character for Adam.
C: RACHEL
D: You got a prescription for medicinal marijuana?
C: SETH
D: No, I did.
C: RACHEL
D: What's wrong with you?
C: SETH
D: Night blindness. Rods and cones are off.
N: Rachel rolls her eyes. Seth is ridiculous. Then she notices the new flat screen TV on the wall and just like that, her demeanor switches. She looks pissed.
C: RACHEL
D: Where did that TV come from?
C: ADAM
D: The store. (off Rachel's furious
C: LOOK)
D: It's medicinal?
C: RACHEL
D: I thought we already agreed that my painting was going there.
C: ADAM
D: Why can't we put up both?
E: trying to reason
C: RACHEL
D: You want me to put my painting next to a television?
C: ADAM
D: Yes?
E: SHRUGS
C: RACHEL
D: Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do whatever you want. I'm taking your dog to the park!...And open a window. This isn't a dorm room.
E: YELLS
N: Rachel walks to the door, scoops the dog up in one arm and a bag of garbage in the other.
C: ADAM
D: Love you.
E: calls out to Rachel
N: The door slams.
C: ADAM
D: I don't get it, they spend all day at the dog park.
E: CONT'D
C: SETH
D: Great. Maybe she'll move there.
C: ADAM
D: Can you not talk about her like that?
N: Seth nearly chokes as he inhales.
C: SETH
D: Are you joking? Do you see the way she treats you?
C: ADAM
D: She's got some kind of creative block...It's her process.
C: SETH
D: You have cancer for fuck's sake! If I was your girlfriend, I'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. Instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. Her art sucks. You don't want to put that on your wall. It looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the Berlin Wall.
C: ADAM
D: We're going through a rough patch. That's what happens in relationships.
C: SETH
D: Bullshit. She's fucking you in the ass Adam. This is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. If you want to smoke weed, then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat screen TV, then get the fucking TV! And if you want to go to Mardi Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!
E: SERIOUS
C: ADAM
D: We're not going to Mardi Gras.
N: Seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to Adam.
C: SETH
D: You're totally missing my point.
E: as he exhales
S: INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Adam sits in Katie's office.
C: ADAM
D: I've been reading your books, and you know it actually makes sense...Some of it.
E: MORE
C: ADAM
D: I'm not gonna lie, I don't really get the "Dark Night of the Soul" stuff. But I get it, years of anxiety have taken over my body. I'm blocked...emotionally.
E: CONT'D
C: KATIE
D: Adam! This is fantastic.
E: EXCITED
N: Adam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response.
C: KATIE
D: You know if you're interested, there are some more advanced forms of therapy that I think could be really useful.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Sure, if you think it'll help.
S: INT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY
N: Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus.
N: The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid.
C: SETH
D: What are they laughing at?
E: quietly to Adam
C: ADAM
D: Just go with it.
E: quietly to Seth
N: Seth and Adam laugh along with the others.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter.
E: to Adam and Seth MORE
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life.
E: CONT'D
N: The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: We don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth - and we laugh at that truth.
E: CONT'D
N: The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: So let us share. Adam, why don't you tell us what brings you here?
E: CONT'D
N: Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: We're all friends here in the Laughter Pagoda.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I, ah, have cancer.
N: The entire class laughs hysterically.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share -
C: BEVERLY
D: Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times.
N: The class laughs.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: Paul, share,
C: PAUL
D: My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister.
N: The class laughs.

N: The class laughs.
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST
D: SETH -
C: SETH
D: My best friend is a giant pussy.
N: The class laughs.
C: ADAM
D: My best friend's favorite band is Abba.
N: Everyone laughs except for Seth.

E: DEFENSIVE
C: LAUGHTER THERAPIST

D: Fake.
C: ADAM
D: Fake.
N: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an INSANELY HOT WOMAN with giant breasts in a hospital gown walk by the three men.
C: ALAN
D: You're both wrong. I think I know real when I see it.
N: The hot woman scratches her head, revealing that she's wearing a WIG.
C: ALAN
D: God damn it.
E: CONT'D
N: Alan hands Adam and Mitch each a five dollar bill. Mitch notices Adam watching one of the OTHER PATIENT's sitting and laughing with HIS WIFE. There's a longing in Adam's eyes.
C: MITCH
D: How come we've never met Rachel?
C: ALAN
D: Yeah. What the fuck?
C: ADAM
D: She's been really stressed lately,
N: Adam looks around at all the sick people.
C: ADAM
D: If I brought her here, she'd probably freak out.
E: CONT'D
C: ALAN
D: Smart man. Save yourself the headache.
C: MITCH
D: Don't listen to him Adam. It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these.
C: ALAN
D: Bullshit. Women are nothing but trouble.
E: MORE
C: ALAN
D: They're selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life. You want to talk about a cancer.
E: CONT'D
C: MITCH
D: Listen to me Adam, I've been married 40 years and it's my Margaret who keeps me going.
N: Mitch pulls out his wallet. He holds out a picture of his wife MARGARET (80).
C: MITCH
D: She's my reason to live.
E: CONT'D
C: ALAN
D: That's precious Mitch, I almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it. Honestly, I don't give a shit. You can do whatever you want. It's your life. All I know is that I'm not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman. The day my wife left me was the best day of my life.

S: EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

C: ADAM
D: Just waiting for Rachel to pick me up.
C: KATIE
D: What time is she coming?
C: ADAM
D: Uh, four.
N: Katie looks at her watch.
C: KATIE
D: It's six thirty.
C: ADAM
D: She must be stuck in traffic.
C: KATIE
D: You want a ride?
S: INT. KATIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
N: Adam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives. The car is filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc. Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.
C: KATIE
D: Sorry about the mess.
N: Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success," which is lying on the floor.
C: ADAM
D: I think you should ask for a refund.
C: KATIE
D: I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached.
C: ADAM
D: Yeah, I can see.
N: Changing the subject.
C: KATIE
D: So you don't drive?
C: ADAM
D: Nope.
C: KATIE
D: But you have a license?
C: ADAM
D: Nope. I actually failed my test.
E: BEAT
C: KATIE
D: No!
C: ADAM
D: It's true.
E: EMBARRASSED
C: KATIE
D: But, I thought you can re-take the test.
C: ADAM
D: Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I didn't.
N: Katie stares at Adam in shock.
C: KATIE
D: What did you do?
C: ADAM
D: I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment...Into the Balboa cactus garden.
C: KATIE
D: The garden with all the endangered plants?
C: ADAM
D: They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane.
N: Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.
C: KATIE
D: I'm sorry. That's terrible.
N: Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature.
C: ADAM
D: Stop the car.
E: ABRUPT
N: Katie looks at Adam nervously.
C: KATIE
D: Why what's wrong?
C: ADAM
D: Just stop the car.
N: Katie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage and gets out.
C: KATIE
D: What are you doing?
C: ADAM
D: I can't handle all this mess.
N: Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car.
C: KATIE
D: Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner.
N: Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath.
C: ADAM
D: You can drive.
S: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
N: Adam and Katie arrive at Adam's house.
C: ADAM
D: Thanks for the ride...
N: Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie.
C: ADAM
D: Do you want to come in. For a beverage? Or something?
E: CONT'D
C: KATIE
D: It probably wouldn't be very professional of me.
C: ADAM
D: Come on, I'll let you analyze my Id.
N: Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that Adam is more than a patient.
C: KATIE
D: Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - LATER
N: Adam and Katie sit on the couch playing an ultra-violent video game. Katie is destroying Adam.
C: KATIE
D: You know you are terrible at this?
N: Adam is totally lost. He has zero sense of how to play.
C: ADAM
D: I've never played before.
C: KATIE
D: This is your Playstation.
C: ADAM
D: Doesn't mean I play it. Games these days today are so complicated.
E: RE: CONTROL MORE
C: ADAM
D: There's too many buttons. I can't keep track of what does what.
E: CONT'D
C: KATIE
D: Perhaps you'd prefer something a little more simple. Maybe a nice game of Connect Four or Bingo.
E: LAUGHS
C: ADAM
D: She has a sense of humor.
N: Katie's face lights up. She's proud of herself for that one.
C: ADAM
D: Duck Hunt, now that was a game. You know why? One button.
E: CONT'D
N: Katie laughs.
C: ADAM
D: You think I'm kidding. My dad and I used to have Duck Hunt tournaments. He was actually really good. Until he had his stroke.
E: CONT'D BEAT
C: KATIE
D: That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that.
N: This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam.
C: ADAM
D: Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest.
N: Katie feels for Adam.
C: KATIE
D: You've never talked about your dad.
C: ADAM
D: Well whose fault is that? Doctor?
C: KATIE
D: Hey!
N: The two continue to play. Adam wildly pushes every button as Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground. Game over. Katie pats Adam on the shoulder.
C: KATIE
D: Rematch?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend wheat grass shots.
C: ADAM
D: You ever had this stuff.
C: KATIE
D: No, but it's supposed to be really good for you.
C: ADAM
D: Well it smells like my grandmother.
C: KATIE
D: You complain a lot.
C: ADAM
D: You haven't met my mother. It's a miracle I do anything but complain.
C: KATIE
D: I try not to look at the world like that.
C: ADAM
D: The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.
C: KATIE
D: Hmmm. I really don't like it when people at work finish all the coffee and don't refill the pot.
E: FISHING
C: ADAM
D: It's infuriating right?
C: KATIE
D: I wouldn't say infuriating. It's just not good work place etiquette.
N: Adam is far more excited by this revelation. He hands Katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink. He raises his glass to make a toast.
C: ADAM
D: To complaining.
N: Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. Katie follows, and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over Adam's face.
C: KATIE
D: Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so sorry.
N: Katie grabs a towel as Adam stands speechless.
C: KATIE
D: Hold on. I'm so sorry.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam keeps his eyes closed as Katie wipes his face.
C: ADAM
D: Is it all gone?
N: For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look. Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam?
E: O.C.
N: Feeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave.
C: KATIE
D: I should probably be going.
N: Rachel enters the kitchen.
C: RACHEL
D: Adam?
C: ADAM
D: Finally. Where have you been?
C: RACHEL
D: I hope I'm not interrupting.
E: MAD
C: ADAM
D: Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my therapist.
C: RACHEL
D: This is your therapist?
E: SUSPICIOUS
C: KATIE
D: Please, call me Katie.
C: RACHEL
D: OK. Katie. What are you doing here?
E: SUSPICIOUS
C: ADAM
D: She drove me home. Ring a bell?
C: RACHEL
D: Ugh. Shit. Thank you so much for doing that. Life's been a little crazy lately, which I'm sure Adam has told you all about. I love those shoes.
E: SWEET/NERVOUS
C: KATIE
D: Thanks...
N: Awkward silence. The tension is thick.
C: KATIE
D: I'm going to go. I'll see you at our next session Adam.
E: CONT'D
N: Katie leaves.
C: ADAM
D: Where have you been?
C: RACHEL
D: I was at the gallery.
C: ADAM
D: You were supposed to pick me up. 8 hours ago.
E: PISSED
C: RACHEL
D: I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place.
E: off Adam's look MORE
C: RACHEL
D: Don't look at me like that. You know this is a hard time for me.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around!
E: DEFENSIVE
C: ADAM
D: And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility.
C: RACHEL
D: And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for?
C: ADAM
D: This. Us.
C: RACHEL
D: I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife.
C: ADAM
D: You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on.
N: Rachel begins to cry.
C: RACHEL
D: You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this? The past few months have been hard on me too. It's not always about you.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I know.
E: RELENTS
N: Adam tenderly wraps his arms around Rachel. A beat.
C: RACHEL
D: Why are you so good?
C: ADAM
D: You're my Yam.
S: INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
N: Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops.
C: RACHEL
D: What's wrong?
C: ADAM
D: I can't.
C: RACHEL
D: Why?
N: Adam looks down.
C: ADAM
D: I don't know what's wrong. It won't work.
E: DEFEATED
N: Adam rolls over onto his back. He and Rachel lay silent - neither making contact with the other.
T: FADE TO:
N: SUPER: SEPTEMBER
S: INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT ROOM - MORNING
N: Adam sits down next to Mitch, but notices there's no Alan.
C: ADAM
D: Where's Alan?
N: Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his head. Tears roll down Mitch's cheek. Adam's face goes white.
S: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
N: Adam and Mitch stand next to the RABBI. The tombstone reads "ALAN LIEBOWITZ (1923-2007) FINALLY." THE CAMERA TILTS up to the sky, and then DOWN to reveal:
S: EXT. BOCA RATON RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY (DREAM)
N: A healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board, bridge, etc. Adam looks on in confusion as an OLD MAN wearing an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart.
C: ADAM
D: Excuse me.
N: The old man stops his cart.
C: OLD MAN
D: How can I help you?
C: ADAM
D: Where am I?
C: OLD MAN
D: The After Life.
C: ADAM
D: This is Heaven?
N: The old man scratches his balls.
C: OLD MAN
D: Pretty great huh? They've even got a frozen yogurt machine.
N: The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar. A sign in front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".
C: ADAM
D: There are lines in Heaven?
C: OLD MAN
D: It's worth it.
N: End Dream.
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Adam jumps from bed in cold sweat.
S: INT. SYNAGOGUE. RABBI JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Adam is seated in the Rabbi's office, he looks despondent.
C: RABBI
D: So you want to know what's going to happen when you die?
C: ADAM
D: I think it's a fair question.
C: RABBI
D: Fair yes, but impossible for me to answer. Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of God's plan. How should I know what God has planned for you. Maybe if you came to service once in a while...
C: ADAM
D: Well am I going to go to Heaven?
C: RABBI
D: Probably.
C: ADAM
D: What if I want to just die? That's it. No Heaven.
C: RABBI
D: That's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going. The Afterlife is where the fun begins.
C: ADAM
D: How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun. I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now I'm going to have to spend an eternity with them.
C: RABBI
D: Adam, you can not look at death as a curse. Even in death we are all still part of God. Life on Earth is just the beginning.
C: ADAM
D: But that's not what I want.
C: RABBI
D: Oy. Then find another religion. I don't make the rules.
E: FRUSTRATED
S: INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY
N: Adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling. There is total silence.
C: KATIE
D: You're being awfully quiet today. Is everything okay?
C: ADAM
D: I'm going to die aren't I?
C: KATIE
D: What are you talking about?
C: ADAM
D: It's true.
C: KATIE
D: We don't know that.
N: Adam sits up and looks at Katie.
C: ADAM
D: I'm not getting any better.
C: KATIE
D: Don't say that, you're doing so well.
C: ADAM
D: Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to live?
C: KATIE
D: What are you talking about?
E: TOTALLY BAFFLED
C: ADAM
D: Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do.
C: KATIE
D: This is really good Adam. Let it out.
C: ADAM
D: Will you stop! I can't do this anymore. It doesn't matter. None of it. I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life. 100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer. That's it.
E: BEAT
C: KATIE
D: This helplessness you're feeling is normal. These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life. Look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away...Talk to me.
E: BEAT
C: ADAM
D: I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore. I'm sorry.
E: BEAT
N: Adam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed.
S: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
N: Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
S: INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MORNING
N: TIME LAPSE: Adam's stares at himself in the mirror. His health deteriorates even more. SUPER: NOVEMBER Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man. There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and he knows it. Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head. Rachel enters and steps up on the scale. She examines herself in the mirror.
C: ADAM
D: I need a new lint brush.
C: RACHEL
D: Okay, I'll pick one up.
C: ADAM
D: And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday...The big one.
N: Rachel continues to examines her waist.
C: RACHEL
D: Am I getting fat?
N: Adam stares at Rachel.
C: RACHEL
D: What?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Are you listening to me?
C: RACHEL
D: Yes.
E: ANNOYED
C: ADAM
D: So you'll take me?
C: RACHEL
D: Of course.
N: Rachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall, smashing it.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
N: Adam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks unhinged. He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make room for Rachel's painting. Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored. Adam crosses to the answering machine. It reads "10 Messages." He presses play. All the messages are from his mother. He hits delete. Adam reads through a stack of unopened letters. He comes across a postcard from the Museum advertising "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man".
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY
N: CLOSE ON: the "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man" poster in the Museum's main entrance. Adam enters the museum and walks up to the sign. People stop and stare, stunned by Adam's gaunt appearance - like a ghost haunting the grounds. Adam carries a wide smile, he's overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job.
S: INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Phil and Adam sit in Phil's office.
C: PHIL
D: You look great.
C: ADAM
D: Really?
C: PHIL
D: Yeah, look at you.
E: INSINCERE
C: ADAM
D: I want to come back to work.
C: PHIL
D: You want to come back? Here?
E: IN DISBELIEF
C: ADAM
D: What's so crazy about that?
C: PHIL
D: You could be anywhere right now, and this is that place?
C: ADAM
D: Yeah.
C: PHIL
D: Are you sure that's a good idea?
N: Phil is treading a fine line...
C: PHIL
D: ...Given...your current health?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: You said I look great.
C: PHIL
D: Yeah for a guy with cancer.
N: Adam looks dejected. Phil feels bad, he went too far.
C: PHIL
D: Alright, what the hell? I'd love to have you back. Let's be honest this place is falling apart without you.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Thank you Phil.
C: PHIL
D: So you're really okay? I mean, the cancer, is-
E: SYMPATHETICALLY 
C: ADAM
D: Oh it's really good. We've come to an understanding. It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and I let it.
N: Phil, second-guessing his decision-
C: PHIL
D: Welcome back.
S: INT. MUSEUM. POMPEII EXHIBIT - LATER
N: Seth leads a tour of FOREIGN TOURISTS through the museum. He speaks as he did earlier - like a game show host.
C: SETH
D: And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city.
N: Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.
C: SETH
D: This here is Adam, one of our curators. Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like.
E: UPBEAT
N: Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror. People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model devours a villager.
C: ADAM
D: According to Pliny the Younger - "You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world."
E: CONT'D
N: The tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles the group away.
C: SETH
D: Ok. Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon.
N: Seth looks back at Adam like he's lost his mind.
S: INT. MUSEUM. HALL - LATER
N: The sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the men's bathroom. A crowd of Museum guests walk past in horror. They look at each other in fear. The toilet flushes. Adam walks out. Everyone stares. Adam smiles in embarrassment.
C: ADAM
D: I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs me.
E: AWKWARD
N: Adam walks back to the Pompeii exhibit. Phil approaches.
C: PHIL
D: You feeling okay? You don't look so good.
C: ADAM
D: Could be worse. Right?
N: Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit.
C: PHIL
D: Jesus!
E: STARTLED
N: Phil feels terrible about what he's going to say next.
C: PHIL
D: Listen Adam...I don't know how to say this...
E: CONT'D
N: Phil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder.
C: ADAM
D: Don't worry...I get it. You're a good guy.
C: PHIL
D: Come back when you're better. You know you'll always have a home here.
S: INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER
N: Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in time. He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man. He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match. He continues down the hall towards the exit.
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON
N: Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He looks like a raisin among grapes.
S: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Adam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch and then dials his phone.
C: RACHEL
D: Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay!
E: V.O.
N: Adam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back.
C: ADAM
D: Hey, it's Adam. Where are you? Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today. So call me back.
E: SWEET
N: Enraged, Adam hangs up.
C: ADAM
D: Fuck!
E: CONT'D
N: Adam picks up his phone and dials again.
C: SETH
D: Yoooooo.
E: V.O.
C: ADAM
D: Hey man, I need you to do me -
C: SETH
D: Not around. Leave a message.
E: V.O.
N: Adam hangs up and dials again.
C: EDITH
D: Hello,
E: O.S. YELLING
N: Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of regret runs through his body.
C: ADAM
D: Hi mom.
S: INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER
N: Edith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters.
T: CUTE NURSE
N: The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright?
C: EDITH
D: It's very cold in here. Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Conditioning?
T: CUTE NURSE
N: Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat.
C: EDITH
D: My son has cancer.
T: CUTE NURSE
N: (FEELS BAD) I'm sorry, really, if I could I would, but there's nothing I can do. Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him.
C: ADAM
D: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
E: smiles to the Nurse Scowls at Edith
T: CUTE NURSE
N: Are you sure? I could get you a blanket.
C: ADAM
D: No, really, I'm okay. But thank you.
C: EDITH
D: I'd love a blanket.
C: ADAM
D: We're fine.
E: to the Cute Nurse
T: CUTE NURSE
N: Okay, but you let me know if you need anything. The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The
T: Cute Nurse exits.
C: EDITH
D: I don't like her.
E: Re: the cute nurse
N: Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.
C: EDITH
D: You feel warm.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I'm fine.
N: Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.
C: EDITH
D: Take these.
C: ADAM
D: You're like some kind of deranged pusher.
E: ANNOYED
C: EDITH
D: Do you know what it's like to fear losing your son? No. You don't. When you have children of your own we can discuss it. Now take the pills.
N: Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow. Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns away, Adam spits the pills into his hand. Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various degrees on the wall. Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Edith closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination.
C: EDITH
D: Huh.
E: CONT'D DISAPPROVING
C: ADAM
D: What?
C: EDITH
D: Oh nothing.
C: ADAM
D: What?
E: ANNOYED
C: EDITH
D: It's nothing, he went to a state college.
C: ADAM
D: You're unbelievable.
C: EDITH
D: I just worry that you're not getting the best care possible.
N: Adam can't take it anymore.
C: ADAM
D: Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack?
C: EDITH
D: You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? You think I don't know what's best for you? I birthed you. You came out of me. I am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it. You don't like this, well I'm sorry. It's my own way of caring.
E: Re: fanny pack
C: ADAM
D: Well stop! You're driving me crazy. With the comments and the pills every five minutes. Just stop. I'm not dad. I can take care of myself.
E: SNAPS
N: Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt.
C: ADAM
D: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
E: CONT'D
N: Edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek.
C: EDITH
D: Yes you did. I drive you crazy.
N: Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder.
C: ADAM
D: Mom.
N: Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared.
C: EDITH
D: You're all I've got. Look at your father.
N: We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose.
C: EDITH
D: I've lost him. My true love, gone. I'm never going see him again, at least not in this life. He spent his whole life priding himself on his independence, always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch. You happy? You like shitting yourself?
E: CONT'D BEAT TO ART
C: ADAM
D: Mom!
C: EDITH
D: He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. And then I had you, and that was even greater. So if I hover and threaten your independence, so what? You have a mother who loves you more than anything. Is that so awful?
C: ADAM
D: No. It's not.
N: Adam and Edith share a moment...Dr. Ross storms in the room carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Sorry to keep you folks waiting. It's been one of those days...car got towed. Wife double parked it.
N: Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares.
C: DR. ROSS
D: Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The cancer's not responding to the chemo.
E: CONT'D
N: Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.
C: DR. ROSS
D: As you can see...The tumor is continuing to grow here, along the nerve.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but see nothing.
C: ADAM
D: So what do we do?
C: DR. ROSS
D: We need to operate. If we don't remove it soon we risk metastasis.
C: ADAM
D: But you said surgery was too risky.
C: DR. ROSS
D: We're out of options.
N: Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand.
C: EDITH
D: But he's going to be okay, right? You're going to fix it.
N: Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.
C: DR. ROSS
D: This surgery is no guarantee. The risks are tremendous. And, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that Adam, you'll never be able to walk again.
N: Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand.
C: ADAM
D: Does that mean...I can get handicap parking?
N: Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across Edith's face.
S: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Distraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the smell of a home cooked meal. He walks through the house.
S: INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
N: He stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel cooking. Rachel turns around. She's in high spirits.
C: RACHEL
D: Hey you.
N: Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on the cheek.
C: ADAM
D: Smells good.
C: RACHEL
D: The girls and I are having a movie night. I somehow got suckered into cooking. Don't worry I left you some.
E: off Adam's look
N: Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces. Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She quickly types a reply.
C: ADAM
D: Who's that?
E: SUSPICIOUS
C: RACHEL
D: Susan. She wants to know what time I'm coming over.
C: ADAM
D: That's what she just texted?
E: even more suspicious MORE
C: ADAM
D: She wants to know what time you're going over to her house?
E: CONT'D
N: Rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her cooking.
C: RACHEL
D: Uh huh.
C: ADAM
D: Alright, well I'm gonna go lie down.
C: RACHEL
D: I might be out late so don't wait up.
N: Adam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room. He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages.
C: ADAM
D: What the fuck?
E: TO SELF
N: Rachel enters the kitchen.
C: RACHEL
D: What are you doing?
C: ADAM
D: Who's James?
C: RACHEL
D: My art partner.
C: ADAM
D: He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night? Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine. That's funny. It seems as though you've double booked yourself.
E: re: text message CONTINUES READING LOOKS UP
C: RACHEL
D: I can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that.
C: ADAM
D: Oh, you just got another text from him. He says "Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted...
E: READING PHONE
N: Rachel reaches for the phone. Adam pulls away.
C: RACHEL
D: Give me back my phone.
E: FUMING
C: ADAM
D: "Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon." He seems sweet.
E: READING A BEAT
C: RACHEL
D: Adam, it's not what you think.
C: ADAM
D: Well now how do you know what I'm thinking?
C: RACHEL
D: Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong.
C: ADAM
D: You've been cheating on me.
E: SERIOUS
C: RACHEL
D: Adam you're being ridiculous.
C: ADAM
D: Am I?
N: Adam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel naked, covered in red paint.
C: ADAM
D: What's this?
E: CONT'D
N: Adam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of Rachel - all ridiculously artistic.
C: ADAM
D: And this? And this? And this? There are over a dozen naked photos of you in here.
E: CONT'D
N: Suddenly the back door swings open. Oblivious, Seth enters.
C: SETH
D: Hey guys.
N: Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth can tell he just walked into some major shit.
C: SETH
D: Bad time?
E: CONT'D
N: Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth takes a peak at Rachel's iPhone.
C: SETH
D: Whoa! Nice! Now that I would put on the wall. I can see you're in the middle of something. I'll just be in the other room.
E: CONT'D IMPRESSED off Adam's look
N: Seth crosses to the living room. Rachel picks up the conversation where they left off.
C: RACHEL
D: It's a portrait series, commenting on post-colonial patriarchy in the Congo. ...That's it. Nothing more.
E: off Adam's look
C: ADAM
D: Have you lost your mind? I had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your "art partner"...And what the fuck do you know about Africa?
N: Rachel totally forgot about his appointment. The guilt runs through her body.
C: RACHEL
D: Oh shit. I forgot. Please, Adam, I'm so sorry. What did the doctor say?
E: CONCERNED
C: ADAM
D: Did you cheat on me?
C: RACHEL
D: Adam stop. Tell me what the doctor said.
E: CRYING
C: ADAM
D: DID-YOU-CHEAT-ON-ME!?
N: Like a child being scolded, Rachel's face says it all.
C: RACHEL
D: Are you going to break up with me?
E: POUTING
C: ADAM
D: No. I'm going to pretend you never existed.
E: BEAT
C: RACHEL
D: Please. I don't want to break up.
E: CRYING HYSTERICALLY
C: ADAM
D: You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment.
C: RACHEL
D: I told you I couldn't handle this!
N: Rachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes. She takes his hand.
C: RACHEL
D: I'm sorry...I love you.
E: CONT'D
N: They embrace. A beat. Adam lets go. He looks Rachel in the eyes.
C: ADAM
D: I want you out my house.
N: Adam walks out the back door. Seth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face. He stares her down.
C: SETH
D: Shame on you.
N: Seth exits out the back door.
S: EXT. YACHT CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Adam and Seth sit on the bow of a docked sail boat. The two have had a lot to drink. Adam is understandably upset.
C: SETH
D: Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted?
C: ADAM
D: I know.
E: DISGUSTED
C: SETH
D: Is "dreams" a metaphor, for-
E: BEAT
N: Seth makes a masturbating motion with his hand.
C: ADAM
D: You remember the last time we came out here?
C: SETH
D: Prom night. How could I forget? Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting.
C: ADAM
D: That memory is so far from me,
C: SETH
D: Jen giving me a blow job?
C: ADAM
D: No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago... I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory.
N: Adam stares out at the ocean. Reality check.
C: SETH
D: You okay?
N: Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean.
C: ADAM
D: I can't believe this is all actually happening.
C: SETH
D: The girl or the cancer?
C: ADAM
D: Both.
C: SETH
D: It's some pretty fucked up shit.
C: ADAM
D: You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel...granted that might not be so far off. What a waste.
E: shakes his head
N: Seth puts his arm around him.
C: SETH
D: We need to get you laid.
C: ADAM
D: Don't you ever give up?
E: ANNOYED
C: SETH
D: No.
C: ADAM
D: Seriously, who's going to have sex with me?
C: SETH
D: Some girls are into it?
C: ADAM
D: I look like Powder. Plus I have erectile dysfunction...temporary. I hope.
E: BEAT
C: SETH
D: Then let's go get me laid.
N: Seth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk.
C: ADAM
D: I think I should drive.
C: SETH
D: You don't have a license.
C: ADAM
D: You're drunk.
C: SETH
D: Do you even know how to drive?
C: ADAM
D: How hard can it be?
C: SETH
D: Hard enough that you don't have a license.
C: ADAM
D: This might be my last chance.
E: SOMBER
C: SETH
D: Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!...Forget it, I give up. Drive.
N: The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car. Adam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant statue of Neptune riding a sea horse.
C: SETH
D: Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going?
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: What? I didn't see it.
C: SETH
D: That's what the mirrors are for.
N: Adam pulls out of the parking lot.
C: SETH
D: Turn right.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I know what I'm doing.
N: Adam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way.
C: SETH
D: Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!
N: An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision.
C: SETH
D: Adam! Turn the car around.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: No. I'm driving and I want to go this way.
N: Another car swerves out of the way.
C: SETH
D: What the fuck is wrong with you?
C: ADAM
D: For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal.
N: Seth pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.
C: SETH
D: You're an idiot.
N: A beat.
C: ADAM
D: Get out.
C: SETH
D: This is my car.
N: Adam looks like he's about to erupt.
C: ADAM
D: GET! OUT!
N: Seth looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.
C: SETH
D: You're being a real douche.
N: Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then proceeds scream at the top of his lungs. 25 years worth of suppressed emotions come out. Adam pulls out his cell phone. Seth notices. He tries to open the door. It's locked.
C: SETH
D: Adam, open the door.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam ignores Seth and begins to dial.
C: SETH
D: Don't you dare call her. Not after everything she's done to you.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam gives Seth the finger.
C: SETH
D: You're a pussy.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: Well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend.
N: Seth looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.
S: INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)
N: The phone rings. A dark figure in bed sits up and turns on the bedside lamp. It's not Rachel, it's Katie.
C: KATIE
D: Hello.
E: ASLEEP
C: ADAM
D: I don't want to die.
C: KATIE
D: Adam?
N: Katie sits up. She's awake now.
C: ADAM
D: I'm 25 years old and I've never even been to Canada. I haven't lived my life! I'm really, really scared.
E: BEAT
C: KATIE
D: I know.
C: ADAM
D: I'm sorry for the way I acted. I should have never stormed out like that.
C: KATIE
D: It was wrong of me to push you the way I did. I wasn't listening.
E: MORE
C: KATIE
D: I could never have handled all of this the way you have.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: You mean like a complete asshole?
N: Katie laughs. And then silence, she really cares about him.
C: KATIE
D: I think you're really brave.
C: ADAM
D: If I don't die, I think we should go on a date.
C: KATIE
D: Adam, I'm not sure if that's a good idea.
C: ADAM
D: Why not?
C: KATIE
D: Not only am I your therapist, but you're also my first patient, ever. What kind of precedent would I be setting?
C: ADAM
D: It makes for a nice incentive.
C: KATIE
D: I can't date you.
C: ADAM
D: Yes you can.
E: PLAYFUL
C: KATIE
D: No I can't.
C: ADAM
D: Yes, you can.
C: KATIE
D: No I can't.
C: ADAM
D: A wise person once told me - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.
C: KATIE
D: Adam I can't date you.
E: LAUGHS
C: ADAM
D: That's what you think.
E: COY
N: Suddenly Adam passes out. His head slams into the steering wheel. The Horn blares.
C: KATIE
D: Adam? Adam? Adam?
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
N: Seth and Adam stagger into the building.
S: INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam and Seth enter the dingy studio apartment - it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Adam scoops up some dust with his finger. Seth is unusually quiet. Both guys are being distant. Seth pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye contact as they undress. Adam climbs into bed. He notices a book called "Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer" on Seth's bedside table. The book is worn and has multiple book marks - indicating it's been read. Adam looks at Seth, he had him pegged all wrong. Seth claps his hands. The lights turn off.
C: ADAM
D: Good night.
C: SETH
D: Night.
N: Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him.
C: ADAM
D: What are you doing?
E: UNCOMFORTABLE
C: SETH
D: Watching you sleep.
C: ADAM
D: It's a little creepy.
C: SETH
D: I know. I can't help it.
N: Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future.
S: EXT. FOX MEADOW GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY
N: Seth's car enters the Mall parking lot and parks.
C: VOICE MALL OPERATOR

E: V.O.
S: INT. MEN'S WEARHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

D: Adam, this is Dr. Ross. Good news, I was able to expedite the wait for your surgery. Your scheduled for tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with Dr. Lamb. Please call my office if you have any questions.
E: V.O.
S: EXT. FUNERAL HOME/CEMETERY - LATER
N: A MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds.
C: MORTICIAN
D: Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased. We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care...A funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so I ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you.
C: SETH
D: What about a Viking funeral?
C: MORTICIAN
D: I'm not familiar.
E: INTRIGUED
C: SETH
D: You know, we put him on a boat... cover it with...dirt and...branches...whatever you can find. We push it out...into the sea...or the ocean...and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire...And that's it. It's awesome.
E: talking out of his ass
N: The Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to dignify Seth with a reply. A beat.
C: MORTICIAN
D: Here you are, the Schwartz family plot.
E: points to grave plot
N: Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones. Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we:
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL PRE-OP ROOM - EARLY MORNING
N: Adam lies on a gurney. DR. LAMB, the neurosurgeon performing Adam's surgery enters. He's wired on Espresso. Behind him is NURSE WONG who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else.
C: DR. LAMB
D: Good morning Adam, how are you feeling? Good. Good. Good. Good.
N: Despite Dr. Lamb's already thick glasses, he holds Adam's medical chart right up to his to his face.
C: DR. LAMB
D: So we're going to be removing your kidney? Right? Or is it the left? Just kidding. That's doctor humor.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam forces a small chuckle. He's completely terrified.
C: DR. LAMB
D: Nurse Wong here needs you to sign a few papers, so I'm going to leave her to do her job, and I'll see you after the surgery.
E: CONT'D
N: Dr. Lamb exits. Nurse Wong hands Adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign.
C: ADAM
D: What is all this?
C: NURSE WONG
D: Hospital liability and disclaimer forms...in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs. You know, the usual.
C: ADAM
D: Oh, great.
E: TO HIMSELF MORE
C: ADAM
D: Glad to hear there's nothing unusual about removing organs.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam signs the documents and hands them back to Nurse Wong.
C: NURSE WONG
D: You have some visitors.
N: As Nurse Wong exits, Edith and Art enter.
C: EDITH
D: There he is.
N: Edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack. She hands them to Adam like she's slipping him illegal drugs.
C: EDITH
D: Here take these. They're special. I got them from Canada.
E: CONT'D
N: Adam looks closely at the pills - they read "NUPRIN."
C: ADAM
D: Mom, this is Nuprin.
E: PERPLEXED
C: EDITH
D: I know isn't it great?
N: Adam looks at his mother, perplexed by her logic.
C: ADAM
D: What the hell.
E: SHRUGS
N: Adam downs the pills. Art whispers closely into his ear.
C: ART
D: I gotta new coat.
C: ADAM
D: That's great dad.
C: ART
D: Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets. Feel.
N: Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Art's coat.
C: ART
D: Feel.
E: CONT'D
C: ADAM
D: I am feeling.
N: Art grabs hold of Adam's hand and stares at his son. A beat.
C: ART
D: I love you son.
C: ADAM
D: I love you too dad.
N: Katie knocks on the door.
C: KATIE
D: Hello?
N: Katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers. Edith examines her. This is too awkward.
C: ADAM
D: Egh em. Mom. Mom.
N: Adam nods for his mother to leave.
C: EDITH
D: Alright. Come on Art, let's go to the waiting room.
N: On her way out, Edith turns to Katie and notices a CROSS around her neck.
C: EDITH
D: Hmmm.
E: CONT'D DISPLEASED
N: Edith and Art exit. Adam is left alone with Katie. They're both nervous.
C: KATIE
D: I brought you flowers. Not sure why, I didn't know what else-
C: ADAM
D: They're great, thank you.
N: Katie sits on the bed next to Adam.
C: KATIE
D: So how you doing?
C: ADAM
D: I'm a little freaked out.
N: A small GERMAN ANESTHESIOLOGIST enters. There is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent.
C: ANESTHESIOLOGIST
D: Hello Adam, I am the Anesthesiologist. I will give you shot to make you sleep.
N: Adam holds Katie's hand.
C: ADAM
D: Will you be here when I wake up?
C: KATIE
D: I'm not going anywhere.
C: ANESTHESIOLOGIST
D: Now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect.
N: The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV.
C: ADAM
D: About how long?
E: TERRIFIED
C: ANESTHESIOLOGIST
D: Relax, you will soon begin the sleeping.
C: ADAM
D: Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I-
N: Just like that, Adam's out cold.
S: INT. HOSPITAL SURGICAL AMPHITHEATER - LATER
N: Adam is face down on the operating table. Two Neurosurgeons, Dr. Lamb and DR. HENRY are in mid surgery. Alongside the two doctors are Nurse Wong and NURSE SCOTT.
C: DR. HENRY
D: I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake was a Buccaneer.
C: DR. LAMB
D: No he was a privateer.
C: NURSE SCOTT
D: I thought he was a pirate.
C: DR. LAMB
D: A pirate works for no one but himself. A privateer has a mandate from a government.
C: DR. HENRY
D: I thought that was a buccaneer.
C: DR. LAMB
D: No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned pirate.
C: DR. HENRY
D: Then what's a mercenary?
C: DR. LAMB
D: Nurse Wong. Will you Google it?
E: FRUSTRATED
N: Standing to the side of the operating table is the group of Med Students from earlier. They're still taking notes.
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Edith, Art and Seth sit impatiently watching the clock. Katie paces up and down the hall. Hours go by. Time can't seem to go by quick enough.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER
N: Dr. Lamb finds Edith, Katie and Seth in the waiting room.
C: DR. LAMB
D: We were successful in the extraction of the tumor. However, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude...there were some unforeseen complications. The bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated. We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle. We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk...He's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go.
S: INT. HOSPITAL ICU - MOMENTS LATER
N: Adam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. A NURSE comes in to change his IV. Adam slowly awakens. He is high on morphine. He stares, mesmerized by the nurse.
C: ADAM
D: That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it?
N: Dr. Lamb enters.
C: DR. LAMB
D: Adam, I see you're awake.
C: ADAM
D: I'm here.
C: DR. LAMB
D: How are you feeling?
C: ADAM
D: I feel wonderful.
C: DR. LAMB
D: That would be the morphine.
N: Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in Adam's hand.
C: DR. LAMB
D: I want you to push this little button any time you feel pain. It'll trigger the morphine. You think you can do that?
E: CONT'D
N: Adam moves his hands really slowly in the air -
C: ADAM
D: Magic!
N: Art and Edith enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid being picked up from pre-school.
C: ADAM
D: Mommy! Daddy!
E: CONT'D
C: EDITH
D: My little boy.
E: CRYING
C: ADAM
D: Remember the time you walked in on me masturbating?...That was so awkward...What hotel is this? We need to go on more vacations.
N: Katie pops her head out from behind Adam's parents.
C: ADAM
D: You're here too! You're soooooo awesome... Katie McRae, Katie McRae, Katie McRae. Mic-Rae, Dr. Awesome Mic- Rae...I'd love to make you pancakes sometime.
E: CONT'D SING SONG
N: Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body causing him to scream in agony.
C: ADAM
D: PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN!
E: CONT'D
C: KATIE
D: Squeeze the morphine trigger!
N: Adam squeezes the trigger. The morphine offers immediate relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then...
T: FADE OUT TO WHITE LIGHT.
S: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
N: SUPER: NOVEMBER A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers. The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands on the porch of a small beach bungalow. The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing. She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.
C: MARGARET
D: Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah down there.
E: STARTLED
N: There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more jovial than we've ever seen.
C: ADAM
D: You must be Margaret.
C: MARGARET
D: Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.
C: ADAM
D: That's me.
C: MARGARET
D: You're Adam? The way Mitch described you, I always assumed you to be much older. About 50 years older. But, you're just a baby...
E: face lights up
N: Adam blushes.
C: ADAM
D: I'm so glad you could make it. I'm really sorry about Mitch.
E: SOLEMN
C: MARGARET
D: Me too.
C: ADAM
D: Please come inside. You're just in time.
N: Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.
C: ADAM
D: Sorry about the mess. I just moved in...The ocean air is supposed to be good for my recovery.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Adam and Margaret enter the living room. Everyone's there: Edith, Art, Katie and Seth. Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith sets food on the table.
C: ADAM
D: We're having a Duck Hunt tournament. You play?
E: TO MARGARET
C: MARGARET
D: Me? Oh I don't know how to play video games.
E: LAUGHS
N: Adam holds up the controller - an old Nintendo Gun.
C: ADAM
D: It's really easy. One button does everything.
N: Edith chimes in from across the room.
C: EDITH
D: This food's not going to eat itself.
N: Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain. Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.
C: SETH
D: I got it.
N: Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back. Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange a smile. Adam notices and open window.
C: ADAM
D: You mind?
E: TO SETH
