S: INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN
N: A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate. This is HENRY. He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light out. There's snow on the ground. He's neither asleep nor awake.
S: INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
N: HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.
C: A CAR
D: Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE... Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there.
C: A CLOCK
D: flips to 6:00.
S: INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER
N: Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning. He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to build.
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING
N: Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous, abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING
N: The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt-box houses.
S: EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING
N: Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.
S: INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks. It's clean and ordinary in here. His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.
C: HENRY
D: Smells good.
C: DEBBIE
D: Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.
C: HENRY
D: Wow. Thanks. He digs in.
C: DEBBIE
D: How was your night?
C: HENRY
D: Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.
C: DEBBIE
D: Good. She sets it down.
C: HENRY
D: This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.
C: HENRY
D: Your shift's at eight thirty? She nods.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: You not eating?
E: CONT'D
C: DEBBIE
D: I already did. He takes another bite.
C: HENRY
D: You okay?
N: Pause.
C: DEBBIE
D: Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday?
C: HENRY
D: Sure. What time? Pause.
C: DEBBIE
D: For the baby shower.
C: HENRY
D: Right. She just stares at him...
C: DEBBIE
D: Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's.
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: DEBBIE
D: I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here.
C: HENRY
D: Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Pause.
C: DEBBIE
D: Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating.
C: HENRY
D: You're talking about kids.
C: DEBBIE
D: Of course I am.
C: HENRY
D: Okay.
C: DEBBIE
D: 'Okay' you want kids? Pause.
C: HENRY
D: I love kids. He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.
C: DEBBIE
D: Henry? He looks up again.
C: DEBBIE
D: Do you still love me? He's still as a stone.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Of course I do. She looks at him.
C: DEBBIE
D: Because I know you did once. A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now. She's crestfallen.
C: DEBBIE
D: What happened, Henry? He just sits.
E: CONT'D
C: THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
D: Henry gets up, heads to the door. Debbie watches him go...
S: EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more GUYS sit in the back of the car. Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking friend is JOE.
C: EDDIE
D: Henry Torne.
C: HENRY
D: Eddie Vibes.
C: EDDIE
D: So how you doin', man?
C: HENRY
D: I'm okay. What's going on?
C: EDDIE
D: Listen, I got a man down here.
N: Eddie glances up and down the street.
C: EDDIE
D: Mind if we come in for a second?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform. She touches his forehead.
C: DEBBIE
D: He's hot. He starts to retch.
C: JOE
D: I'm sorry.
E: holding it in
C: DEBBIE
D: You better come with me. Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom.
C: EDDIE
D: Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: EDDIE
D: So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see...
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Eddie stares at him. Smiles.
C: EDDIE
D: So, what do you say?
C: HENRY
D: What do I say what?
C: EDDIE
D: You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe?
C: HENRY
D: It's November.
C: EDDIE
D: Yeah. They keep the field in perfect shape.
C: HENRY
D: Oh. Beat.
C: EDDIE
D: So what do you say? Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open. She's tending to him, caring for him... Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.
C: EDDIE
D: Henry?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. IMPALA - LATER
N: Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform. Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They grimly stare out the windows.
C: EDDIE
D: Appreciate you driving, man.
C: HENRY
D: So where's this game?
C: EDDIE
D: Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.
T: CUT TO :
S: EXT. MAIN ST - DAY
N: The car turns a corner on to Main Street.
C: EDDIE
D: Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM. The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST
C: BUFFALO BANK.
D: Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.
C: EDDIE
D: Just hang tight. We'll be right back. Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.
E: CONT'D
N: After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs his sleeve.
C: BEHIND HIM
D: In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on SKI MASKS...
C: HENRY'S POV
D: A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his store and enters. He says good morning to all the animals. It's a strange one man show.
N: LOUD ALARMS BLARE -- Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming FROM : THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK GUARD chases them. ON HENRY, confused. A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :
C: FRANK
D: You! Henry turns forward again.
E: O.S.
C: A GUN
D: Is pointing at him through the windshield.
C: FRANK
D: Freeze! Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel. Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder. Holding on Henry's stunned expression...
E: CONT'D
S: INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
N: Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we never see, paces back and forth.
C: DETECTIVE
D: Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.
N: Henry just listens.
C: DETECTIVE
D: All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple. Henry's still silent.
E: CONT'D
C: DETECTIVE
D: Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care?
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) All you have to do is say something. Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first time.
C: JUDGE
D: ...in light of the fact that this is a first offence...
E: V.O.
S: INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY
N: Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery. A JUDGE stares at Henry.
C: JUDGE
D: ...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.
C: WHACK!
D: The gavel goes down. Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with the sentence. He pats Henry, well done. Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...
C: CLANK!
D: A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...
S: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
N: Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard locks the door in front of him.
C: MAX
D: So. What're you in for?
E: O.S.
N: Henry turns.
C: HENRY
D: Huh.
C: MAX
D: I said what are you in for? A beat.
C: HENRY
D: Bank robbery. MAX pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.
E: 60s
C: MAX
D: Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches.
C: HENRY
D: But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.
C: MAX
D: Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.
C: MAX
D: I'm Max.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Henry.
C: MAX
D: Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed.
C: HENRY
D: So...what are you in for?
C: MAX
D: Life. A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...
C: MAX
D: Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING
N: All the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max is already dressed.
C: MAX
D: Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented.
C: MAX
D: Breakfast. A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
N: Max and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for their food.
C: MAX
D: `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.' Henry's lost in thought...
C: MAX
D: What are you thinking about?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Nothing.
C: MAX
D: You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray.
C: MAX
D: How do you think any of us got here?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: I'm not sure.
C: MAX
D: I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.
C: MAX
D: See him?
E: CONT'D
N: Henry nods.
C: MAX
D: Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) Bad choices, see. Henry does.
C: MAX
D: By the way, I recommend the potatoes.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Max and Henry sit down at one of the long tables.
C: MAX
D: That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. They begin to eat.
C: MAX
D: So what's yours?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: My what?
C: MAX
D: Your dream.
C: HENRY
D: Not sure I ever had one.
C: MAX
D: Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that?
C: HENRY
D: I don't know. A pretty good one?
C: MAX
D: Henry, you're in jail. Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.
S: EXT. YARD - DAY
N: Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.
C: MAX
D: But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.
N: (MORE)
C: MAX
D: Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is. Max takes his arm :
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Your dream is your truth is your destiny. Henry looks at him.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: I told you. I'm here by mistake. Max shoots a look back at him.
C: MAX
D: There are no mistakes. Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.
C: HENRY
D: What? Several convicts are making their way towards them... He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :
C: MAX
D: But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry.
C: HENRY
D: I am.
C: MAX
D: You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests!
C: HENRY
D: What tests?
C: CRAACK!
D: Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab him, throw him to the ground next to Max.
C: MAX
D: This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down. He gives it everything he's got. They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps fighting...but it's hopeless. GUARDS rush in. Max watches.
S: INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHT
N: Henry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised.
C: MAX
D: You did good, Henry.
C: HENRY
D: I don't feel good.
C: MAX
D: You're doing better than you feel. Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.
C: MAX
D: Go to sleep, Henry.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) Sleep is for the blessed.
S: INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT
N: One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast string of cells.
T: FADE OUT :
S: INT. VISITING AREA - DAY
N: Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort. A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits.
C: DEBBIE
D: Hi.
C: HENRY
D: Hi. You look beautiful.
C: DEBBIE
D: Thank you. How are you doing?
C: HENRY
D: I'm okay. How about you?
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm good. A beat.
C: DEBBIE
D: Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Okay.
C: DEBBIE
D: I fell in love. Henry takes that in.
C: HENRY
D: Oh. Pause.
C: DEBBIE
D: I just...I mean it just happened. Pause.
C: HENRY
D: Okay. Wow...
C: DEBBIE
D: I'm sorry, Henry.
C: HENRY
D: It's alright.
C: DEBBIE
D: You're not mad? He thinks.
C: HENRY
D: No. He looks at her.
C: HENRY
D: I want you to be happy.
E: CONT'D
C: DEBBIE
D: You too, Henry. No one moves.
S: EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY
N: Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty. Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a hand around his shoulder.
C: MAX
D: I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him.
C: MAX
D: I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Henry thinks.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Books and covers.
C: MAX
D: Right. Books and covers.
T: CUT TO:
N: TWO YEARS LATER
S: INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY
N: There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard. Their cell has temporarily been converted into a makeshift BARBERSHOP. CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by Max the Barber. Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.
C: MAX
D: Clean as a whistle.
C: FINK
D: Max, I think you missed your calling.
E: checking himself out
C: MAX
D: Thank you.
N: (THEN) Who do we got next, Henry? Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.
C: HENRY
D: Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.
C: HECTOR
D: Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?
C: MAX
D: October.
C: HECTOR
D: Show us what you did for the board last time.
C: MAX
D: I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.
C: OTHER INMATES
D: Show us!
C: MAX
D: Leave me alone.
C: INMATES
D: Come on! Show us. Max finally puts his clippers down.
C: MAX
D: All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so... Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back a little bit...
C: MAX
D: I get this twitch! and then I give him my answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball! Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a mad man...
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't want THIS. Not out THERE. The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up his clippers and smiles :
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Believe me, I'm not going anywhere. They crack up. A beat.
E: CONT'D
C: HECTOR
D: Hey, White Shadow. When's your review coming up?
C: HENRY
D: Next month.
C: HECTOR
D: You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?
C: HENRY
D: Nope.
C: HECTOR
D: What, you don't like it around here?
C: MAX
D: Everyone knows Henry's innocent. Laughter.
N: HECTOR (TO HENRY) The board don't like it when you deny the crime.
C: HENRY
D: I didn't do the crime.
C: HECTOR
D: Hey, but you got the time...so you may as well have done it. Everyone laughs.
C: MAX
D: I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!' Everyone laughs again.
C: MAX
D: Now that's funny, Henry.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Yeah, you're right. Henry ponders.
S: INT. SHOWERS - DAY
N: INMATES shower. Alot of noise and steam. Henry and Max at the end of a row.
C: HENRY
D: You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max.
C: MAX
D: I'm living it.
C: HENRY
D: Really?
C: MAX
D: Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.
C: HENRY
D: This place is horrible, Max. Max thinks, lathering his hair...
C: MAX
D: So why didn't you just say something?
C: HENRY
D: When?
C: MAX
D: Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.
C: HENRY
D: I thought maybe this was my way out.
C: MAX
D: And was it?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: MAX
D: See. There are no mistakes.
S: INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNING
N: It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a sports bag, zips it up. Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to his neck.
C: MAX
D: You got everything, kid?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Henry, silent for a moment.
C: HENRY
D: Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for. The cell door slides open.
C: PRISON GUARD
D: Torne! Let's go! Henry starts to leave.
E: O.S.
C: MAX
D: Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth. Pause.
C: HENRY
D: I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.
C: MAX
D: Just testing. Henry continues...stops at the door.
C: HENRY
D: I'm going to miss you.
C: MAX
D: Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again. Henry smiles.
C: HENRY
D: I'm still gonna miss you.
C: MAX
D: Get out of here, Henry.
S: EXT. PRISON - DAY
N: It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's cold. We see his exhale. He starts to walk.
S: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
N: Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York countryside streaking past him in a blur...
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY
N: Henry turns onto his old street.
S: EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before ringing the bell. A beat. The door opens. It's --
C: JOE
D: The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a suit and tie now.
C: JOE
D: Henry. How you doing?
C: HENRY
D: Hey.
N: JOE (CALLING OUT) Debbie! Henry's here. (TO HENRY) Come on in. Make yourself at home.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks.
S: INT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
N: Henry enters. His old house looks more or less the same. Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in the living room.
C: JOE
D: Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer?
C: HENRY
D: Sure.
N: JOE (CALLING OUT) Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer? As Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles.
C: DEBBIE
D: Hi.
C: HENRY
D: Hi. It's not so awkward.
S: INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER
N: Debbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's name on it.
C: DEBBIE
D: I think that's everything you wanted.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks. A beat. They just stand there for a moment.
C: HENRY
D: Are you happy?
E: CONT'D
C: DEBBIE
D: I am, Henry.
C: HENRY
D: I'm glad. He means it. Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.
C: DEBBIE
D: So what are you going to do now?
C: HENRY
D: I don't know yet. Joe enters.
C: JOE
D: Honey, they're starting to arrive. Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products.
N: DEBBIE (TO HENRY) We're having a meeting. It's his new business.
C: JOE
D: Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi. They all head out of the garage.
C: JOE
D: It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice Henry walking out carrying his box.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: You mean like a pyramid scheme?
C: JOE
D: No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm.
N: (HENRY'S LOOK) Anyway, why don't you give it some thought? Henry nods, starts to head out.
C: JOE
D: Henry.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Yeah?
C: JOE
D: Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up my name. A beat.
C: HENRY
D: I don't know your name.
C: JOE
D: Sure you do. It's Joe. A beat.
C: HENRY
D: Right. You're welcome Joe.
N: (TO DEB) I'll see you Deb.
C: DEBBIE
D: Take care of yourself, Henry. He leaves.
S: EXT. STREET NEAR HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Henry walks down the street with his box. A NEIGHBOR approaches, recognizes him.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Henry! How are you? Henry looks over.
C: HENRY
D: I'm good. How are you?
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Great. How was Greece?
C: HENRY
D: Greece?
C: NEIGHBOR
D: Debbie told us all about your trip. A beat.
C: HENRY
D: I was in prison.
C: NEIGHBOR
D: In Greece?
S: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: A shitty apartment. Tiny. A bed. A desk. The TV is on low. Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his legs, its contents spread out over the bed. Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico with Debbie. A Baseball glove. A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos. He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST
C: GUY"
D: He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover, graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes" Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He finishes putting everything back.
N: A distinctive JINGLE! on the TV. Henry looks over. An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a PRETTY YOUNG BLONDE in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera. PRETTY BLOND (ON TV) Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffalotto! Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it.
S: INT. PAROLE OFFICE, BUFFALO - DAY
N: Henry sits at a desk. He's handed a cup of coffee by his FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER -- whose face we never actually see.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: Is it okay? Henry takes a sip.
E: O.S. re: the coffee
C: HENRY
D: Good. Thank you.
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: So what do you think?
E: O.S.
C: HENRY
D: About what?
C: PAROLE OFFICER
D: About building your life from the ground up.
E: O.S.
C: HENRY
D: Sure. Sounds good.
S: EXT. FIELD - DAY
N: A grass field. It's raining. Henry steps into frame with a SHOVEL. Behind him an OLDER MAN in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow. IN THE DITCH - LATER From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs. He's a few feet down. The wheelbarrowman still watches silently.
S: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His mind turns. He's starting to think...O.S. the sound of the `BuffaLotto' jingle on the TV.
S: EXT. DITCH - DAY
N: It's snowing. The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as Henry digs another small ditch.
S: INT. BUFFALO SIX MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
N: Henry sits in the back row. We watch him as he eats popcorn. The movie flashes across his face. There are guns involved...
S: EXT. FIELD - DUSK
N: A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch. Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's hand. He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower poking through the dirt.
S: INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY
N: The female PAROLE OFFICER sets down a cup of coffee. Henry drinks. We still don't see her face.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks. She sits down at her desk.
C: FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
D: Seems like yesterday you walked through that door.
C: HENRY
D: It does?
C: FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
D: Henry, You've done your time. You are now a free free man.
N: (THEN) How does it feel? Henry takes a breath.
C: HENRY
D: Good.
N: She signs a document and hands it to him.
C: FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER
D: So, What's next? Henry doesn't answer. The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION, staring, as we
T: CUT TO :
N: HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with purpose... We follow them. After a while, the boots stop.
S: EXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY
N: HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :
C: THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK
D: Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he contemplates the place... Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in. There's something happening, he's not sure what it is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing.... A moment of revelation. He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --
C: SCREEEECH!
D: A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down. A GIRL Rushes out of the car.
E: 30s
C: JULIE
D: What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay.
E: into cell phone
N: She hangs up.
C: JULIE
D: You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? Henry's a little delirious.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: I think I'm okay. He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.
C: JULIE
D: No. Stay on the ground. The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.
C: FRANK
D: Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.
C: HENRY
D: No, don't. I think I'm okay.
E: Starts to stand
N: FRANK (RECOGNIZING HIM) You! HENRY (RECOGNIZING HIM) Yeah. Me.
C: JULIE
D: Is he alright?
E: to Frank, confused
C: FRANK
D: Are you alright?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Fine.
C: JULIE
D: He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere.
C: FRANK
D: I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention.
C: JULIE
D: Yes. I was. I know how to drive. Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk.
C: JULIE
D: What are you doing? Get back on the ground!
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe. She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side. Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.
C: FRANK
D: They let you out, huh.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: FRANK
D: Let's get you a seat in here.
S: INT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS
N: Frank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by the door.
C: FRANK
D: Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks. Julie comes in.
C: JULIE
D: Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance.
C: HENRY
D: It's okay. I really am fine.
C: FRANK
D: Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. Lucky I guess. Frank leaves.
E: sucks his teeth
C: JULIE
D: I think we should call a doctor. Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.
C: JULIE
D: What? Are you okay? He keeps staring...
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? A beat.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: No. You look familiar.
C: JULIE
D: What? It takes Julie a moment.
C: JULIE
D: Oh. That.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: What?
N: JULIE (SINGS) 'Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffa-lotto'? A beat.
C: HENRY
D: Oh, that's why. An awkward moment.
C: JULIE
D: Well, I guess you seem to be okay.
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. I'm okay.
C: JULIE
D: Okay. So you're okay?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: JULIE
D: Great.
N: (THEN) So I can go now?
C: HENRY
D: Sure.
C: JULIE
D: Bye.
N: (THEN) And be more careful.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks.
N: She leaves. He watches her go.
C: WAITRESS
D: Anything else I can get you?
C: HENRY
D: A bathroom?
C: HENRY
D: Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.
S: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
N: Henry peeing. His eyes drift to the photos on the wall to his right. He zeroes in on a prohibition-era newspaper framed FRONT
C: PAGE.
D: A photo of COPS IN TRENCH COATS posing in front of THE
N: FIRST BUFFALO BANK WITH CRATES OF SEIZED BOOZE. `WHISKY IN THE VAULT!'
C: ON HENRY'S FACE
D: The sound of Henry's Pee STOPS. He takes a step closer to the next urinal over. Reads the rest of it... A COP IN A TUNNEL, smiling as he points up to a HOLE :
C: `TUNNEL DISCOVERED'
D: After a moment Henry starts peeing again. Thinking about what he's just read...
S: EXT. ORPHEUM CAFE - DAY
N: Henry comes out. Stares at the bank across the street. Looks both ways and then crosses the road.
S: EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY
N: Henry stands in the back alley behind the bank, feeling the place out...his head turns between the back door of the bank and the back of the building opposite...then looks down at his feet. He looks up again, notices the : `BACKSTAGE DOOR' He goes over to it. It's locked.
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAWN
N: Henry's still in his clothes, lying on his bed, his mind reeling, the TV on low.... He gets out of bed. Puts his foot in his boot.
C: PRISON GUARD
D: Max! You've got a visitor.
E: V.O.
S: INT. VISITOR'S AREA - DAY
N: Henry sits at a visitor's table, waiting. A moment passes, a DOOR CLANKS open and --
C: MAX
D: Emerges with a guard.
C: MAX
D: I thought I told you I didn't want to see your face again. Henry smiles.
C: HENRY
D: Nice to see you too. He goes to hug him.
C: GUARD
D: No contact. They sit. They look at each other a moment.
C: HENRY
D: I figured it out.
C: MAX
D: What?
C: HENRY
D: My destiny.
C: MAX
D: Good. What is it? A beat. Henry leans in.
C: HENRY
D: The bank.
C: MAX
D: The bank is your destiny?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: MAX
D: What bank?
C: HENRY
D: The one I didn't rob. Pause.
C: MAX
D: But you went to jail for it.
C: HENRY
D: Exactly.
C: MAX
D: What are you talking about Henry? Henry looks around. Closer --
C: HENRY
D: I did the time, I may as well have done the crime.
C: MAX
D: Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.
N: (THEN) I still don't get it. Pause.
C: HENRY
D: I need your help.
C: MAX
D: What for?
N: HENRY (A WHISPER) To rob the bank. Pause.
C: HENRY
D: So what do you say?
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: I'm in Jail. That's what I say.
C: HENRY
D: You've got your review coming up --
C: MAX
D: -- So?
C: HENRY
D: So you can get of here. If you want to.
C: MAX
D: No. It's not as simple as that.
C: HENRY
D: Yes, it is.
C: MAX
D: No, it's not.
C: HENRY
D: Yes. It is.
C: MAX
D: No, it's not.
N: HENRY MAX --
C: MAX
D: I'm happy here. This is my home.
C: HENRY
D: This is not a home. This is a prison.
C: MAX
D: Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.
C: HENRY
D: Max. You can't die in this place.
C: MAX
D: I can die wherever I want.
C: HENRY
D: You really want to die here?
C: MAX
D: What do you want, Henry?
C: HENRY
D: I'm asking for your help.
C: MAX
D: To rob that bank?!
C: HENRY
D: I've thought about it. It's the right thing.
N: (THEN) For both of us. A long beat. Max gets up :
C: MAX
D: Henry. I got cards.
N: HENRY MAX --
C: MAX
D: Great to see you, kid.
C: HENRY
D: Max! Max exits.
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY
N: Henry stares at the bank again...then walks down Mecca Road glimpses the marquee of `THE ORPHEUM' theatre. DAREK MILLODRAGOVIC's `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' by Anton CHEKHOV OPENS NOVEMBER 23 Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming
C: PRODUCTION:
D: Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry- shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it, including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as Madame Ranevsky. A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk of the cherry tree with bloody roots. Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre door. This one's open.
S: INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY
N: Henry enters the lobby. The light is low. There's something almost magical about this place. Henry hears VOICES drifting in from the main theatre as he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds..
C: JULIE
D: Is it really me sitting here? I want to dance and clap my hands!
E: O.S. As Madame Ranevsky
S: INT. MAIN THEATRE - CONTINUOUS
N: Henry enters the back of the theatre...sees the girl on STAGE :
C: JULIE
D: The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :
C: JULIE
D: I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much.
E: CONT'D as Madame Ranevsky
N: (SHE'S TEARFUL) But...I must drink my coffee...thank you Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so glad to find you still alive. Henry's transfixed. She's good. ARNOLD, regional actor extraordinaire, plays Lophakin :
C: ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN
D: Your brother Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart. A Money grubber! He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit. He chews up the scenery.
E: O.S. marching to and fro
N: ARNOLD AS LOPHAKIN (CONT'D) I just want you to believe in me like the old days. I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did THEN --
C: DAREK
D: Stop! Stop! DAREK, the CZECH DIRECTOR -- greasy-haired, balding and smoking -- stands up in his seat in the stalls.
C: DAREK
D: Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your `safe face' --
E: CONT'D
C: ARNOLD
D: -- But I was --
C: DAREK
D: Not you. You're doing the best you can. You. He points to JULIE.
C: DAREK
D: What are you doing?
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: I'm...listening.
C: DAREK
D: Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action. Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.
C: DAREK
D: What is that?
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?
C: DAREK
D: No, Djula.
C: JULIE
D: Then what do you want? They stare each other down.
C: DAREK
D: I want you to be more. I want you to be better than that. He snatches the cup from her hand.
C: DAREK
D: Now go drink coffee. And don't think about what I want, think about what you want!
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Fine. I'll go drink coffee. Julie marches off stage...
C: DAREK
D: I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go drink coffee'.
N: (SHOUTS) Ten minutes everyone! (to his Eastern European
C: ASSISTANT)
D: Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll all have coffee Djula! Every single one of us! And think about what we want!
C: HENRY
D: Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.
C: JULIE
D: What are you doing here? She doesn't wait, just walks right past... Henry follows.
C: JULIE
D: Are you here to sue me?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: No.
C: JULIE
D: Then what are you doing here?
C: HENRY
D: I saw your picture outside. The door was open. I came in. She exits.
S: EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - OUTSIDE
N: Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the traffic. Henry follows.
C: HENRY
D: Is it always like that?
C: JULIE
D: What?
C: HENRY
D: (gesturing back to the
C: THEATRE)
D: That.
C: JULIE
D: You mean rehearsal?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: JULIE
D: It's a process.
C: HENRY
D: Looks complicated.
C: JULIE
D: It's all pain.
N: (THEN) Chekhov, right? They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :
C: HENRY
D: I thought you were listening. She looks at him, curiously.
C: HENRY
D: I'm Henry by the way.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Julie.
S: INT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY
N: They enter. It's busy.
C: PIERRE
D: Madame Julie!
C: JULIE
D: Coffee, Pierre. She points at Henry.
C: JULIE
D: You want one?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Sure.
N: SHE SIGNALS :
C: JULIE
D: Two. They stand right there at the bar. Silence. Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her photo to the live person.
C: JULIE
D: What? She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: So what do you think?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Doesn't look like you.
C: JULIE
D: No, I meant the poster.
C: HENRY
D: Oh. It's funny.
C: JULIE
D: Actors on a tree is funny?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.
C: JULIE
D: That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.
C: JULIE
D: He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. Henry's interested.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. "You are the country of apocalypse."
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN ) That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway.
C: HENRY
D: Oh.
C: JULIE
D: The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right?
N: (WHISPERS) But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. I guess. Pause.
C: JULIE
D: But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe.
N: (THEN) He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway... She drinks her coffee.
C: JULIE
D: You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. She thinks. He listens.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: It's perfect.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Why?
C: JULIE (CONT'D
D: It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.
C: HENRY
D: You're leaving? She downs the last of her coffee.
C: JULIE
D: Right after we're done.
N: (THEN) I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not suing me. I'll see ya. She leaves. He watches her through the glass as she walks across the street...right past the bank on her way back to the theatre.
S: INT. PRISON - MORNING
N: MAX's cell door opens. He walks, happy and confident this morning. INMATE (CALLING OUT) Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?
C: MAX
D: Right.
C: ANOTHER CONVICT
D: Give `em hell!
C: MAX
D: I always do, Felipe! As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens the next steel door for him.
C: GUARD
D: Morning, Max. Here we are again.
C: MAX
D: How's your grandson?
C: GUARD
D: Just started first grade.
C: MAX
D: That's great. The socialization begins! The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD ROOM at the end of another long corridor. They stop at the door.
C: GUARD
D: How many more of these you think you got in you, Max? Pause.
C: MAX
D: As many as it takes. The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.
S: INT. PAROLE REVIEW ROOM, PRISON - DAY
N: A PAROLE BOARD OFFICER is reading Max's file as he enters.
C: HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER
D: Good afternoon, Mr. Saltzman. Take a seat. The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of the Board stare at Max. The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the years of his life going by, taking it in...
N: HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER (CONT'D) Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole? They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent. HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER (CONT'D) (HALF AMUSED) Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got for us this time? Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at any moment.... HEAD PAROLE REVIEWER (CONT'D) (o.s.) Mr. Saltzman?
C: MAX
D: Well...
S: EXT. PRISON GATE - DAY
N: The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s. Max looks a little less sure of himself.
C: HENRY
D: Appears. Smiling.
C: HENRY
D: I knew you could do it. Max looks around nervously.
C: MAX
D: Where's the car?
C: HENRY
D: I don't have a car.
C: MAX
D: You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up.
C: HENRY
D: Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.
C: MAX
D: I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake. Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to POUND on them.
C: MAX
D: Dave! Carl!
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Max, it's okay. You're free.
C: MAX
D: Open up! DAVE! No response. Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.
C: HENRY
D: Come on, Max.
C: MAX
D: I don't like this.
C: HENRY
D: Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk. Max starts to hyperventilate :
C: MAX
D: I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe... Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...
C: HENRY
D: You're going to be alright.
C: MAX
D: I'm going to die right here. I told you!
E: nearly on his knees
C: HENRY
D: Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. Henry helps Max back up again.
S: EXT. BUS - DAY
N: A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside.
S: INT. BUS - DAY
N: Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy.
C: HENRY
D: You hungry? He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to him. Max doesn't say anything.
C: HENRY
D: It's pastrami. On rye. A beat. Max opens one eye...
E: CONT'D
N: A KEY GOING INTO A LOCK...
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Henry opens the door for Max. They enter.
C: HENRY
D: Here we are. Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room. There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky.
C: HENRY
D: That one's yours.
E: CONT'D
N: Max goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed.
C: MAX
D: Thanks.
C: HENRY
D: Anything else you need? A beat.
C: MAX
D: Yeah.
S: INT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER
N: Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and relaxes. After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side.
C: MAX
D: Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath.
E: reads the label
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY
N: As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the other side.
C: MAX
D: What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen?
C: HENRY
D: I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.
S: INT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY
C: THE PROHIBITION-ERA PHOTO
D: Henry looked at earlier when he was pissing. Max is staring at the thing now too...
C: MAX
D: Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?
C: HENRY
D: It's a start.
C: MAX
D: A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir?
C: HENRY
D: It's an article.
C: MAX
D: Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way?
C: HENRY
D: No. No guns.
C: MAX
D: What?
C: HENRY
D: Someone could get hurt. Pause.
C: MAX
D: That's sweet, kid.
C: HENRY
D: Maybe it's still there, Max. A beat.
E: the tunnel photo
N: MAX (SURE) Uh-huh.
C: HENRY
D: Maybe it is. Max looks at him.
C: MAX
D: Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours?
N: (THEN) At least we know that's still there. Henry looks at him.
S: INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY
N: Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall.
C: MAX
D: Money is a mistress with a hard heart.
C: FRANK THE GUARD
D: observes Max and Henry. Henry glances over at him too. Doesn't react. Frank watches them as they walk toward the CASHIER.
C: MAX
D: I'd like to speak to your manager please. I'm interested in opening an account.
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO :
N: A NAME-PLACARD : `HOWARD TUTTLE, Assistant Manager'.
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: And which kind of account would you like to open?
E: O.S.
C: ON MAX AND HENRY
D: Sitting in front of his desk.
C: MAX
D: What kind do you have?
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: Savings. Interest only. Commercial --
N: MAX (INTERRUPTING) You know my uncle put all his money in that vault when I was a kid, after we came from Europe, before the war...the Brownshirts. He said that vault will be there for three hundred years!
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: We hope he's right!
C: MAX
D: He was never wrong. How long's it been there already Mr. Tuttle?
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: Since 1891.
C: MAX
D: And in the very same spot, correct?
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: That's right. On the very same spot.
N: MAX. (TO HENRY) See, my boy!. History. It's all about history.
C: MR. TUTTLE
D: Now. As I was saying. We have savings. Interest only. Commercial --
N: MAX (INTERRUPTING) You'll have to give us some time to think about which one. Max gets up.
C: MAX
D: Thank you. You've been very helpful.
E: CONT'D
N: MR. TUTTLE (CONFUSED) No. Thank you. Henry and Max walk out past Frank. He watches them leave...
C: FRANK
D: Have a nice day, gentlemen.
S: EXT. ALLEY, BEHIND THE ORPHEUM - A MINUTE LATER
N: MAX AND HENRY stand in the alley. Henry touches the back of the bank wall.
C: HENRY
D: The vault is here. He walks across the alley...
C: HENRY
D: The tunnel runs under here... He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: And ends up somewhere in there. He turns to Max.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: It's virtually robbing itself! Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it SWINGS open.
C: JULIE
D: Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit!
N: She storms out, punches the air, screams : JULIE (CONT'D)
C: AHHHH!!
D: Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there.
C: HENRY
D: Hi.
E: rubbing his head
C: JULIE
D: Jesus. Henry? She looks at Max.
C: HENRY
D: Julie, Max. Max, Julie.
C: MAX
D: Hiya.
C: JULIE
D: What are you doing here?
C: HENRY
D: Oh, we were, you know --
C: MAX
D: I was just showing Henry the place I used to perform. Henry shoots Max a look.
C: JULIE
D: Oh. What? The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.
C: SIMON
D: That's lunch, Julie.
C: JULIE
D: Thank God.
C: MAX
D: Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel stomach.
C: JULIE
D: You know Chekhov?
C: MAX
D: Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. She laughs. Max approaches her.
C: MAX
D: Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. She considers the request.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Sure. She gestures them inside.
C: JULIE
D: Sure. Yeah. Come on in.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Thank you. As Henry passes :
C: HENRY
D: How you doing?
C: JULIE
D: Great. I'm in hell.
S: INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME
N: Max walks to centre stage front like he's been there before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little emotional all of a sudden.
C: MAX
D: Home again.
C: JULIE
D: So what productions were you in?
C: MAX
D: Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats.
N: (A SMILE) And the not-so-greats! Simon arrives. SIMON (TO JULIE) Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry.
C: JULIE
D: Fuck him.
C: SIMON
D: Got it. Max and Henry exchange a glance.
C: MAX
D: Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake?
C: JULIE
D: He used to perform here.
C: SIMON
D: I don't see why not. We're on a break.
C: MAX
D: That okay, Henry?
C: HENRY
D: Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go.
C: JULIE
D: Is that your dad?
C: HENRY
D: No. He's a friend.
C: JULIE
D: He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it.
C: HENRY
D: It's peaceful out here. Beat.
C: HENRY
D: Is it fun?
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: What?
C: HENRY
D: Pretending to be other people. She thinks.
C: JULIE
D: It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character.
C: HENRY
D: So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.
C: JULIE
D: Yes. Exactly. In a way.
C: HENRY
D: So what part of `you' are you playing now?
C: JULIE
D: That's the question you always have to ask yourself.
S: INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME
N: Max follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING
C: ROOMS.
D: They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing very glamorous.
C: MAX
D: Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.
S: INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C: ARNOLD
D: People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up... Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces. Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper -
C: MAX
D: Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days?
C: SIMON
D: Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!
C: MAX
D: I know.
C: SIMON
D: And there was a tunnel too!
C: MAX
D: I know!
N: (THEN) I forget. Where was it?
S: INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME
N: Henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room set. Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's pulled out of her bag. She watches him a moment.
C: JULIE
D: So what's your story, Henry?
C: HENRY
D: My story?
C: JULIE
D: I mean, like...what do you do? Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair opposite her.
C: HENRY
D: I'm figuring that out.
C: JULIE
D: Does that mean you don't have a job? A beat.
C: HENRY
D: I just got out of jail. ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.
C: JULIE
D: Jail!
C: HENRY
D: Sounds worse than it is.
C: JULIE
D: Really? Jail sounds bad.
N: (THEN) Why were you in there? She takes a big bite of her sandwich.
C: JULIE
D: Are you a murderer or something?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: No. Do I look like one? She studies him.
C: JULIE
D: No.
C: HENRY
D: What do I look like? She studies him some more.
C: JULIE
D: I don't know. A criminal. He laughs.
C: HENRY
D: I do? She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :
C: JULIE
D: Yeah.
S: EXT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME
N: A taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside.
C: SIMON
D: We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: A costume on hangers. A wig and beard in front of the mirror. Simon walks into the room. Places his hand on the far wall. SIMON (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) It was right here. Max comes up. Feels it now too.
C: MAX
D: Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it.
C: SIMON
D: They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre. Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing it...searching...
C: SIMON
D: Times have changed.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: All good things must come to... ...an end. Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :
E: he hits a hollow spot
C: MAX
D: Do you need volunteers?
E: CONT'D
S: INT. STAGE - SAME TIME
N: Henry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard that's on one of the chairs.
C: HENRY
D: The Cherry Orchard. So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny? Julie gets up out of her chair.
E: leafing through it
C: JULIE
D: A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe.
C: HENRY
D: I guess it's not funny. She looks at him.
C: JULIE
D: It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Max's voice booms :
C: MAX
D: That was great! This place is full of treasures. Max comes right up to them.
E: O.S.
C: MAX
D: Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Tomorrow?
C: SIMON
D: Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre!
C: JULIE
D: Oh.
C: MAX
D: Henry, let's get out of these people's way! Henry turns to Julie.
N: HENRY (TO JULIE) What are you doing after rehearsal?
C: JULIE
D: Why?
C: HENRY
D: Do you like Chinese?
C: JULIE
D: Yeah.
C: HENRY
D: Golden Dragon?
C: JULIE
D: It's okay.
C: HENRY
D: Eight o'clock?
N: SHE DECIDES :
C: JULIE
D: Sure. They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage. DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.
C: DAREK
D: Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!
N: (SEES HER) Even you Djula... Max grabs Henry --
C: MAX
D: Let's go.
C: HENRY
D: See you, Julie.
C: JULIE
D: Stay out of jail. Henry waves.
S: EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
N: Max and Henry exit the back stage doors.
C: MAX
D: You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound!
C: HENRY
D: You found it?
C: MAX
D: Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room.
C: HENRY
D: Who?
C: MAX
D: Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette. He glares at them as they pass...
S: INT. APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATER
N: Henry gets ready for his date. Max keeps talking, sitting on the side of the tub as he draws the bath...
C: MAX
D: I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order!
N: (THEN) The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go?
C: HENRY
D: What about the vault?
C: MAX
D: First things first. I'm on the dirt.
C: HENRY
D: Okay. How do I look?
C: MAX
D: Like Henry.
N: (THEN) We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup. (MORE)
C: MAX
D: (he starts to take off his
E: CONT'D
C: CLOTHES)
D: Go have a nice supper.
C: A CHOPSTICK
D: Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking them together like...a tunnel...
S: INT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Henry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt.
C: JULIE
D: Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :
C: GUY
D: Julie.
C: JULIE
D: Bruce. The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.
C: JULIE
D: That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. She studies the menu.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Hi. How was rehearsal? She puts it down. No answer.
C: JULIE
D: I feel like duck.
S: INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
C: PLATES ARE CLEARED
D: It's the end of the meal. Henry listens.
C: JULIE
D: I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo.
C: HENRY
D: Where then?
C: JULIE
D: Don't laugh.
N: (THEN) Hollywood. He doesn't.
C: HENRY
D: I guess that's where people go.
C: JULIE
D: I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here.
N: (THEN) Before it's too late.
C: HENRY
D: Sounds like a plan. The waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies.
C: JULIE
D: I hate fortune cookies.
S: INT. JULIE'S CAR - LATER
N: Julie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from the ashtray. Henry watches her. Julie knows she's being watched. She's enjoying herself.
C: HENRY
D: We going anywhere in particular?
C: JULIE
D: Want some? Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.
E: hits the joint
T: CUT TO :
C: HENRY AND JULIE
D: Walk along a precipice near some railings. They move closer to the ROAR. They look out at the flood-lit NIAGARA FALLS. Stand there a moment...
C: JULIE
D: You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current.
E: CONT'D
N: (BEAT) They all took the risk and look what happened to them. Same in death as they were in life. Imagine that. You kill yourself and nothing changes. They both stare down into the roaring water.
C: JULIE
D: All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) I got to get out of here.
C: HENRY
D: I get it. They start to walk...
C: JULIE
D: So what did you do before jail, Henry?
C: HENRY
D: I worked at a toll booth.
C: JULIE
D: Which one?
C: HENRY
D: Rainbow bridge.
C: JULIE
D: No!
C: HENRY
D: Yes.
C: JULIE
D: I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times! He nods. She's probably right.
C: JULIE
D: Wow. So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. She laughs.
C: HENRY
D: What's so funny?
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere.
C: HENRY
D: That's funny?
C: JULIE
D: Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.
C: HENRY
D: I worked nights. It gave me time to think.
C: JULIE
D: About what?
C: HENRY
D: About where I wasn't going.
C: JULIE
D: See, that's funny.
N: (THEN) What about now? Where you going now?
C: HENRY
D: I'm working on it.
C: JULIE
D: What'd they send you to jail for Henry?
C: HENRY
D: For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.
C: JULIE
D: What!
C: HENRY
D: I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. Pause.
C: JULIE
D: Sounds like it. He looks at her. Decides :
C: HENRY
D: But now I'm going to rob it for real.
C: JULIE
D: You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: JULIE
D: Ha!
C: HENRY
D: There's a tunnel.
C: JULIE
D: What tunnel?
C: HENRY
D: Runs from the bank to the theatre.
C: JULIE
D: My theatre?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah.
C: JULIE
D: Ha! She looks out the falls.
C: JULIE
D: You're fucking hilarious, Henry.
E: CONT'D
N: HENRY (SERIOUSLY) Thank you. A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking...
C: JULIE
D: You know what?
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: JULIE
D: I'm hungry.
C: HENRY
D: What for?
C: JULIE
D: Ice cream.
E: as the thought occurs
S: INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Henry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g. They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big spoonful.
C: JULIE
D: I can't believe I'm sitting here.
C: HENRY
D: Neither can I. She gets up.
C: JULIE
D: I want to dance and clap my hands. She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.
C: JULIE
D: I think I must be dreaming! She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. She sits down.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Henry's not sure what she's talking about. She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the coffee table.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Page twenty one. Henry opens it.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) Read Lophakin. She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly :
C: HENRY
D: `I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you.
N: (TO HER) You're as wonderful as ever....' He stops, looks at her :
C: JULIE
D: Read the next line!
C: HENRY
D: `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.'
C: JULIE
D: Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. Henry takes a beat. This time he makes it his.
C: `HENRY
D: Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' She laughs like a little girl.
C: JULIE
D: You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around!
C: HENRY
D: `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.'
C: JULIE
D: Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! He laughs.
C: HENRY
D: `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!'
E: the text again
C: JULIE
D: Don't stop --
E: pulling him around the room
C: HENRY
D: `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.'
C: JULIE
D: Again! Henry's getting into it.
C: HENRY
D: `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' She laughs some more. Comes closer.
C: JULIE
D: I'm glad I ran you over. Henry puts the book down.
C: HENRY
D: Me too. They kiss...
S: INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
N: Henry and Julie asleep in the bed. She opens her eyes. Realizes he's there with her...as if sensing her, he opens his eyes too. They look at one another. JULIE (SOFTLY) Good morning.
C: HENRY
D: Good morning. She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.
C: HENRY
D: Good morning.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
N: Sun streams in through the window. Tchaikovsky plays on a tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading `Future Shock' on the toilet. The sound of the front door of the apartment opening --
C: MAX
D: Henry!
C: HENRY
D: Max.
E: O.S.
C: MAX
D: I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof!
E: pulling up his boxers
N: HENRY MAX --
C: MAX
D: (rushing out into the front
C: ROOM)
D: That bank doesn't stand a chance. HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white. He's in his underwear.
C: MAX
D: Ah. Company.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Good morning, Max.
N: Max is frozen.
C: HENRY
D: It's alright. She knows.
C: MAX
D: She does?
C: JULIE
D: I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof. She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the fuck?'
C: HENRY
D: We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.
C: JULIE
D: It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.
C: MAX
D: Hold on. Max follows Henry into the kitchen.
S: INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
N: Henry unpacks the groceries.
C: MAX
D: You told her?
N: (A WHISPER) About what we're doing?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. I did.
C: MAX
D: It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret.
C: HENRY
D: It's okay, Max.
C: MAX
D: No. It's not kosher. Pause.
C: HENRY
D: How do you like your bacon?
N: MAX (PISSED) Crispy. Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's waiting, amused by the whole thing. Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing her up.
C: MAX
D: Okay. I'll get dressed.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. APARTMENT - LATER
N: They eat.
C: JULIE
D: So what were you in prison for, Max? Max slurps his coffee.
C: MAX
D: I'm a confidence man.
C: JULIE
D: You mean a `con' man?
C: MAX
D: I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief.
N: (THEN) That's what I'm about. She considers this.
C: JULIE
D: You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off?
C: MAX
D: Yes. He glances at Henry.
C: MAX
D: But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) Hence, the prison.
C: JULIE
D: Aren't you guys worried about getting caught?
C: MAX
D: Not really. For me it's a win-win situation.
C: JULIE
D: How?
C: MAX
D: I like jail. Three hots and a cot. Julie looks at Henry now...
C: JULIE
D: You too, Henry? You like jail?
C: HENRY
D: No. I like it out here.
C: JULIE
D: So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.
C: JULIE
D: It must be the money. Henry smiles.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...
E: washing the plates
N: (THEN) ...but I don't care a bit'. He turns to her.
C: HENRY
D: `I just want you to believe in me like the old days.'
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: You remember!
C: MAX
D: What is that?
C: JULIE
D: It's Chekhov!
C: MAX
D: Chekhov?!
C: HENRY
D: We read it last night.
N: JULIE (TO HENRY) You really are good. (TO MAX) He's a natural.
C: MAX
D: I thought you were on a date.
C: HENRY
D: We were.
C: MAX
D: Reading Chekhov's a date? Beat.
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. She downs her coffee. Stands.
C: JULIE
D: I got to get to the theatre --
C: MAX
D: Can you give me a ride there?
C: JULIE
D: Why?
C: MAX
D: I'm a volunteer! She regards him a moment.
C: JULIE
D: You weren't in any of those plays, were you?
C: MAX
D: No.
N: (THEN) But can you give me a ride?
S: INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY
N: Julie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her daughter VARYA are also on stage.
C: JULIE
D: All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you...
N: (MORE)
C: JULIE
D: Oh, if only I could be free of the stone that weighs me down! If only I could forget my past!
E: CONT'D
C: REVEAL HENRY
D: Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi- darkness. He's transfixed. Max watches too. He wears his volunteer badge.
C: GAYEV
D: Yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts, which seems impossible...
C: JULIE
D: Look! It's mamma walking in the orchard...in a white dress! There she is.
E: laughing with joy
C: GAYEV
D: Where?
C: VARYA
D: Momma, don't! A PROJECTION OF THE MOTHER FLOATS ACROSS THE SCREEN and dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees... Henry and Max speak in hushed voices :
C: MAX
D: This is driving me crazy.
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: MAX
D: We could be digging right now!
C: HENRY
D: We could?
C: MAX
D: If we were in that dressing room.
C: HENRY
D: It's rehearsal. There are people everywhere.
C: MAX
D: This is pissing me off. Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he is...freezes... ...then turns back to Henry...
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: MAX
D: I got an idea.
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: MAX
D: You have to be Lophakin!
C: HENRY
D: What?
C: MAX
D: If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.
C: HENRY
D: I'm not an actor.
C: MAX
D: You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that.
C: HENRY
D: Max. Come on.
C: MAX
D: She said you were a natural. That means you can do it.
C: HENRY
D: No, it doesn't.
C: MAX
D: Yes, it does Henry.
N: (SHAKES HIM) You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life. (POINTS) A man who's in love with her! Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage.
C: MAX
D: Your dream is your truth is your destiny! Henry thinks...
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: I can't be Lophakin. They have a Lophakin. Max thinks...
C: MAX
D: What if they didn't?
C: HENRY
D: There has to be another way. Max, frustrated :
C: MAX
D: Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you. And I'm going to goddamn help you. But you got to help me help you. Now I need to know... ...do you want this bank or not? On Henry...
E: a fierce stare
C: HENRY
D: Yes. I want it.
C: HENRY
D: Then you're gonna be Lophakin!
E: CONT'D
T: CUT TO :
C: ARNOLD
D: Walks down the street. It's snowing. He approaches the theatre.
S: INT. THEATRE, BACKSTAGE - MORNING
N: Arnold enters, shivering, shaking the snow off his coat...
C: ARNOLD
D: Good morning, everyone! None of the actors pay him much attention. He pours himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his dressing room.
S: EXT. DRESSING ROOM - MORNING
N: Arnold opens the door with his key.
S: INT. THEATRE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: Arnold enters, hangs up his coat. There is a FORMAL ENVELOPE leaning against his make-up mirror. He approaches. Opens it. Starts to read... As he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp.. and...falls into his chair. After a moment he puts down the letter and stares at himself in the mirror.
C: ARNOLD
D: You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya. He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep...
S: INT. THEATRE - MORNING
N: CLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead pulsate with rage...
C: DAREK
D: Unprofessional shit!
C: ARNOLD
D: Mr. Millodragovich --
N: DAREK (HISSING) Shit!
S: INT. THEATRE - MORNING
N: Julie stands in the wings. Max joins her.
C: MAX
D: What's happening?
C: JULIE
D: Arnold's leaving the production.
C: MAX
D: Oh. Gosh.
C: DAREK AND ARNOLD
D: on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in
N: ARNOLD'S FACE :
C: ARNOLD
D: But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! A Ken Waterstone production!
E: brandishing the letter
C: DAREK
D: OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.
N: (MORE)
C: DAREK
D: Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it.
E: CONT'D
C: ARNOLD
D: Good-bye, Darek.
N: (THEN) I'm sorry. Arnold marches off the stage with his case.
C: DAREK
D: Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.
N: (CALLING OUT) I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE!
C: SIMON
D: We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list -- Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate :
C: DAREK
D: I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster.
C: SIMON
D: What do we do?
C: DAREK
D: I must think. He moves stage left past Julie...
C: DAREK
D: Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow. And with that he disappears with Olga out the door.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Perfect. Beat.
N: MAX (A SHRUG) It is Ken Waterstone. She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes...
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
N: Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as she approaches her car.
C: JULIE
D: Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening...
N: (SHE LISTENS) I don't know, he's `thinking'... She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window. She looks up. It's MAX.
C: JULIE
D: What? He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Sorry, I can't give you a ride --
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: You said he was a natural.
C: JULIE
D: Stan. Let me call you back. What?
E: she hangs up, to Max
C: MAX
D: Henry.
C: JULIE
D: Henry what?
C: MAX
D: Henry would be perfect for it.
C: JULIE
D: Perfect for what?
C: MAX
D: For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.
C: JULIE
D: You mean Henry should play Lophakin?
C: MAX
D: Yes. She laughs.
C: JULIE
D: He's not even an actor!
C: MAX
D: Exactly. He'd be playing himself. Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.
E: off her shocked look
N: (MORE)
C: MAX
D: A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him. A man who's in love with you...Madame Ranevsky. A beat. She does think about it.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet?
C: MAX
D: Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room.
N: (BEAT) Can you get him in to see Darek? She hesitates...
C: JULIE
D: What's going on here, Max? What are you doing?
C: MAX
D: Nothing. She regards him. Suspiciously.
C: JULIE
D: You made this happen, didn't you?
C: MAX
D: Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good. He smiles. A beat : She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.
C: MAX
D: Fair enough. They just sit there for a moment...
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: What am I supposed to do now?
C: MAX
D: He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may.
C: JULIE
D: What if it doesn't work?
C: MAX
D: They'll get someone else. She thinks...
C: MAX
D: Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm asking, Julie. She thinks some more...
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Okay, confidence man.
S: INT. DAREK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Julie sits, looking at Henry who stands in the middle of the living room of Darek's apartment...
C: DAREK
D: Circles HENRY...walking around him...an animal tracking its pray...he's chain-smoking...
C: DAREK
D: ...you've never had any training...you've never been in a production...you don't even know the play...
C: HENRY
D: I read it. I think I know the scene.
C: DAREK
D: Think. He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.
C: DAREK
D: Start.
E: CONT'D
N: HENRY (READING) `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'
C: DAREK
D: How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!
N: HENRY
C: ANDREYEVICH.
D: Darek nods, continue :
C: HENRY
D: Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm an upstart, a money grubber --
E: CONT'D
C: DAREK
D: A what?
C: HENRY
D: A money-grubber!
C: DAREK
D: Are you?
N: HENRY NO!
C: DAREK
D: Convince her. Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie. She stands :
C: HENRY
D: Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart, a money grubber. He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --
C: DAREK
E: into his ear
C: NEITHER DO I.
D: Henry ignores him and with twice the passion --
C: HENRY
D: I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.
N: JULIE WHISPERS :
C: JULIE
D: Show me, tell me. Darek laughs, circling... Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...
C: HENRY
D: Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.
C: HENRY
D: I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.
E: CONT'D
C: DAREK
D: You piece of shit! Yes! Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable. A beat.
C: DAREK
D: Good.
E: CONT'D
N: Henry looks up.
C: HENRY
D: Good?
C: DAREK
D: Yes. Darek considers him.
C: DAREK
D: Tomorrow. Be more good. Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING
N: She drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the road ahead. In silence. After a while...
C: JULIE
D: Does this make me an accessory?
C: HENRY
D: I think so. A beat.
C: JULIE
D: Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up.
C: HENRY
D: You mean since you ran me over... She smiles.
S: INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
N: They make love. It's more intense than before. They climax. They lie there, breathless, looking at each other...
S: INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT
N: She makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her.
C: JULIE
D: So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer.
C: JULIE
D: It's not just about the money, is it?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: No.
C: JULIE
D: So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer.
C: HENRY
D: I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life.
C: JULIE
D: You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles.
C: HENRY
D: Yeah, I was.
N: (THEN) It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth.
C: JULIE
D: Which was?
C: HENRY
D: That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it.
N: (THEN) So now I'm changing it.
C: JULIE
D: Robbing the bank is changing it?
C: HENRY
D: It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her tea.
C: JULIE
D: What was your wife like?
C: HENRY
D: Nice. A beat.
C: HENRY
D: Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. She turns to him.
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Not for a girl like me, Henry.
S: INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING
N: Darek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side.
C: DAREK
D: This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please. He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges
N: IT:
C: HENRY
D: Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.
C: DAREK
D: Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes! Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him...
S: INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING
N: Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on. They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall aside. Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the sound. Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag :
C: WHACK!
D: He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN...
S: INT. TUNNEL - LATER
N: The blanket is pulled aside to reveal MAX AND HENRY on the other side looking in. Max shines his flashlight REVEALING : THE EMPTY OLD TUNNEL BEYOND It's dusty. Max climbs through the hole, disappears down the tunnel. Henry follows, counting his steps...
S: INT. OLD TUNNEL - DAY
N: Max and Henry, stooped over, make their way down the dank, dark passage. Max's flashlight combs the floor. A glint of light now as something FLASHES.
C: MAX
D: Tracks! Trolley tracks! The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten feet ahead. They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick, turns to Max.
C: HENRY
D: There's still twenty feet to go. He turns back to him :
C: HENRY
D: We're going to need another pair of hands.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT
N: It's cold out. Max and Henry walk inside.
S: INT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT
N: A giant screen showing the game. Henry and Max arrive at the bar.
C: LOUD VOICE
D: No! No! NO! You got to be kidding me! You suck! You SUCK! Could you possibly SUCK anymore?
E: 0.S.
C: HENRY
D: That's him.
C: MAX
D: That's him? Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair. Max looks concerned.
S: INT. BOOTH - LATER
N: Henry and Max sit with the guy -- JOE who's drunk.
C: HENRY
D: Thanks for meeting us.
C: JOE
D: Sure. Joe is looking worse for wear.
C: HENRY
D: How's your pyramid scheme?
C: JOE
D: It wasn't a pyramid scheme.
C: HENRY
D: Okay. Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.
C: JOE
D: It all fell apart.
N: (THEN) We were banking on that money, Henry. And now all I've got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic.
C: MAX
D: What's he talking about?
C: HENRY
D: Kitchenware.
C: MAX
D: Oh.
C: JOE
D: See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?
N: (THEN) It's killing me. Joe drains his beer. The WAITRESS arrives with a bucket of steaming wings.
C: HENRY
D: So how's Debbie?
C: JOE
D: She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months. He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.
C: HENRY
D: She's pregnant?
C: JOE
D: Yeah, she's pregnant.
N: Henry takes it in.
C: HENRY
D: Congratulations.
C: JOE
D: Thanks, Henry.
N: (THEN) It's okay if you want to punch me out. Tonight would be a good night. In fact I could use it.
C: HENRY
D: Come on. This is great news. It's going to be okay.
E: off Joe's hopeless look
C: JOE
D: Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?
C: MAX
D: You want to send your baby to college? Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...
C: JOE
D: Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive. Stuff it deserves.
N: (THEN) These things are hot! I'm on fire.
C: HENRY
D: Listen, Joe, maybe we can help. A beat.
N: JOE (WIPING OFF) How?
C: HENRY
D: We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now.
C: JOE
D: No foolin'?
S: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
N: Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the tunnel.
C: HENRY
D: There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault.
C: JOE
D: That's a lot of dirt, Henry. Max studies Joe.
C: HENRY
D: So what do you think?
C: JOE
D: I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door!
C: HENRY
D: No guns. People could get hurt.
C: JOE
D: What about fake ones?
C: HENRY
D: They're still guns.
C: MAX
D: Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast.
N: (THEN) Are you in or are you in?
C: ON JOE
D: Considering it... He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.
C: JOE
D: I hope we don't get caught.
S: INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
N: Henry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie snaps it off.
C: JULIE
D: I hate that commercial.
C: HENRY
D: I like it. She looks at him.
C: JULIE
D: So what's your plan?
C: HENRY
D: For what?
C: JULIE
D: For when it's done. After. Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something?
E: making light of it
C: HENRY
D: I hope not.
C: JULIE
D: But have you thought about what happens after?
C: HENRY
D: Not really, no. He thinks carefully before he says it :
C: HENRY
D: I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west...
E: CONT'D
C: JULIE
D: Out west?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.
N: JULIE (SHE LAUGHS) When did you think of that?
C: HENRY
D: Just now.
N: (THEN) So what about it?
C: JULIE
D: What about what?
C: HENRY
D: Meeting me --
C: JULIE
D: -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --
C: HENRY
D: You're not?
C: JULIE
D: No.
C: HENRY
D: I thought that was your plan. Do the play
N: AND --
C: JULIE
D: Plans change, Henry. Okay? She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.
C: JULIE
D: I think I ran out of maple syrup.
E: CONT'D
S: INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
N: We follow Henry as he walks through her apartment and finds Julie in the kitchen, standing at the sink, not moving.
C: HENRY
D: Is there a reason you didn't leave before?
C: JULIE
D: Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to. Silence...
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. Well. Maybe...
N: (THEN) But you could still meet me.
C: JULIE
D: Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.
C: HENRY
D: It was just an idea. Why not --
C: JULIE
D: This isn't going to work out, Henry. She turns to face him.
C: JULIE
D: Didn't we both know that? On Henry.
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: I didn't.
C: JULIE
D: I did. Silence.
C: JULIE
D: I think you should leave. Henry just stands there...stunned.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. BUFFALO STREET - NIGHT
N: Henry leaves Julie's apartment. There's snow on the ground. It's freezing out here. He starts to walk.
C: MAX
D: It's going to be incredible. I'm talking, Florida...
E: O.S.
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
N: Max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table.
C: MAX
D: Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your head! Henry sits across from him.
C: HENRY
D: Why couldn't I have met her after?
C: MAX
D: Who?
C: HENRY
D: Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.
C: MAX
D: Oh yeah? What'd she say?
C: HENRY
D: She said no.
C: MAX
D: Of course she said no.
C: HENRY
D: Why of course?
C: MAX
D: Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe.
C: HENRY
D: I paid already, Max.
N: (THEN) I don't want to leave her. Max looks at him. About to say something -- A KNOCK at the door.
C: MAX
D: Who's that?
C: HENRY
D: I'll check. Henry walks to the door.
C: HENRY
D: Who is it?
E: CONT'D
C: JOE
D: It's me. Joe. Henry opens it. JOE stands there. He's drunk. And a little sheepish. Now we see why : EDDIE VIBES is standing right beside him. He walks right on in.
E: O.S.
C: JOE
D: Sorry, Henry.
E: CONT'D
C: EDDIE
D: The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's poetry! I like it.
C: MAX
D: Who is this guy? Eddie beams at Max.
C: EDDIE
D: Your new partner. Max looks at Henry : `huh?'
C: MAX
D: What do you mean?
C: EDDIE
D: I'm in. Or you're out.
C: JOE
D: I screwed up. Sorry, Max. Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.
C: EDDIE
D: Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault. I know the whole story.
E: amused by the whole thing
N: He sits.
C: EDDIE
D: And I don't dig. Dig?
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) Got any cold ones?
C: MAX
D: Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair. Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.
C: EDDIE
D: Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right?
C: HENRY
D: Yeah. I know you.
C: EDDIE
D: Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty.
C: HENRY
D: What do you want, Eddie?
C: EDDIE
D: Nothing. Just the American dream.
T: CUT TO :
C: MAX AND HENRY
D: At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car. He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the thumbs up.
S: INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME
N: Max and Henry watch Eddie leave.
C: MAX
D: I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.
C: HENRY
D: You can't kill him.
C: JOE
D: Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault --
E: slurred, on the floor
C: MAX
D: Shut up, Joe.
N: He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy it would be to just kick him in the head.
C: JOE
D: Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it.
C: MAX
D: Go home. Please. Before it's too late.
T: CUT TO :
S: INT. STAGE - DAY
N: Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal.
C: TROFIMOV

C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: No! No! No! Don't say that!
E: stopping her ears
C: TROFIMOV
D: He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him.
C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades!
C: TROFIMOV
D: Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now :
C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love --
C: DAREK
D: Where are you, Djula? Where?!
C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!
E: with double the fire
C: DAREK
D: Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.
N: (THEN) Carlotta and the girls. (MORE) DAREK (CONT'D) (A CLAP) Let's run the magic scene! Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for her.
C: HENRY
D: What happened last night?
C: JULIE
D: I came to my senses.
N: (THEN) And you should too. She walks on. He follows...
C: HENRY
D: We should talk about it. She turns.
C: JULIE
D: I don't want to, Henry.
S: INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
N: Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up through the open skylight. Henry looks up.
C: MAX
D: Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up...
E: tugging the pulley
S: EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER
N: Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car.
C: JOE
D: What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not?
C: MAX
D: Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.
C: JOE
D: What do you say, Henry? Before he can answer :
C: VOICE
D: I see you guys in the bank. I see you guys in the alley next to the bank. They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right there. He's in his street clothes.
E: O.S.
C: FRANK
D: Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank. Frank sucks his teeth.
C: FRANK
D: I know what you're up to Gentlemen. Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: And I want in.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: In on what? Frank snickers.
C: FRANK
D: We can't talk here. Let's drive. Max looks at Henry.
S: INT. JOE'S CAR - DRIVING
N: Joe's driving. Max is in the passenger seat. Henry in the back next to Frank.
C: HENRY
D: What's on your mind, Frank?
C: FRANK
D: The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange. They exchange glances.
C: FRANK
D: Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home. They're listening...
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: I'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution. Now they're paying attention.
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time. A beat. He leans closer...
E: CONT'D
C: FRANK
D: I can give you that date. I can help with alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank?
C: FRANK
D: I got my reasons.
C: JOE
D: This sounds like a set-up, man -- Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.
C: FRANK
D: I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons.
C: MAX
D: Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. A beat.
C: FRANK
D: The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley.
N: (DARKLY) We had to use all our savings to cover the bills. JOE (GETTING IT) The man gave it to you, huh.
C: FRANK
D: I spent everything we had -- then she died...thirty years I've been at that bank.
C: HENRY
D: What was her name?
C: FRANK
D: Annie. Her name was Annie.
C: HENRY
D: I'm Sorry. The moment just hangs there...
C: FRANK
D: November 23rd. The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight. He turns to Henry.

D: I retire in two weeks. This is it.
E: CONT'D

C: HENRY
D: Opening night.
E: CONT'D
C: MAX
D: And?
C: HENRY
D: That's soon.
C: MAX
D: We're going to have pull some nights. Henry thinks...
C: HENRY
D: Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night.
N: Max turns.
C: MAX
D: We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal.
N: (THEN) I told you there were going to be tests, Henry. Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.
C: MAX
D: You're going to have to leave her.
E: CONT'D

D: Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the far end. The doors open for him...he hesitates
C: HENRY'S POV
D: DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly. Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches through the glass a moment... Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.
C: HENRY
D: Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed...
S: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
N: Max and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the tunnel.
C: MAX
D: There he is!

C: MAX
D: You okay, Henry?
E: CONT'D
C: HENRY
D: No. He turns to Max.
C: HENRY
D: I'm not leaving her.
E: CONT'D
C: JOE
D: Who?
C: MAX
D: The girl -- He throws down his shovel.
C: MAX
D: Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away.
E: CONT'D
N: (THEN) This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand? ON HENRY
C: JOE
D: Hey! I think I got something... Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.
C: MAX
D: We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.
S: INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment. Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky.

C: ON JULIE
D: avoiding Henry's gaze.
C: DAREK
D: Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear! He leaves. The players applaud --

D: Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me.
C: JULIE
D: Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play?
C: HENRY
D: Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it already.
C: JULIE
D: I'm sure he did. He approaches her...
C: HENRY
D: I want us to be together. She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.
C: JULIE
D: We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So what?
C: HENRY
D: You know that's not true --
C: JULIE
D: No, really. A couple of times.
N: (THEN) Don't you get it? I don't want to be with you.

D: Curtain! ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise...
N: THE CURTAIN COMES UP TO REVEAL :
C: THE NURSERY
D: a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may but frosty.
N: Through the windows. CHERRY TREES in full bloom which contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set. They're BIG SCREEN projections on real tree trunks : LOPHAKIN enters with DUNYASHA, holding a candelabra.
C: LOPHAKIN
D: Well, thank god the train is in. What time is it?
C: DUNYASHA
D: Almost two. It's light already. Henry yawns and stretches.

D: Rounds a corner into view...
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: ...pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank. BERNIE and STAN jump out. Bernie knocks on the glass door.
C: BERNIE

C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: I'm still like a little girl... She kisses Gayev and Varya and then Gayev again. She kisses everyone in fact, except Lophakin.
E: CONT'D
C: GAYEV
D: Your train was two hours late. How do you explain that? Is that good management?
S: INT. BANK - SAME TIME
N: Bernie breaks the seal of an envelope, hands it to Stan. Frank unlocks the plastic casing to the VAULT KEYPAD for Stan who punches in the CODES on the slip of paper that was inside the envelope. Frank reaches into his pocket. We glimpse his phone. He presses `SEND'...
S: EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME
N: Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out, reads it.
C: "YOU"
D: He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his hands are trembling and he drops it... Thirty feet to the ground.
N: CRACK!
C: MAX
D: Shit.
S: INT. STAGE - SAME TIME
N: Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from the side of the stage.

S: INT. BANK - SAME TIME
C: ON FRANK
D: Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault.
C: BERNIE
D: You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank?
C: STAN
D: I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place.
C: BERNIE
D: You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons.
C: STAN
D: Perfect. Another chance to lose. Frank laughs nervously.
S: EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME
N: Max picks up the wire cutters off the ground, checks his watch. His heart jumps. He starts up the pole again. Finally reaches the top. Struggles to find the right wire.

C: LOPHAKIN
D: I saw this excellent piece of theatre yesterday. Really very funny.
E: O.S.
S: INT. STAGE - NIGHT -- SAME TIME
C: MADAME RANEVSKY
D: I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples!
C: LOPHAKIN
D: True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life.
S: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BANK - SAME TIME
N: Frank, Stan and Bernie are by the truck.

D: Don't be stupid, Max.
C: MAX
D: You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles.

E: CONT'D
C: EDDIE
D: I'm not playing with you, old man.
C: JOE
D: What are you doing, Eddie? The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene...
C: EDDIE
D: Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.
C: HENRY
D: What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him.
C: EDDIE
D: It's money, Henry. Money.
C: MAX
D: This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Eddie kicks him again.

D: Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man.
C: EDDIE
D: Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry.
