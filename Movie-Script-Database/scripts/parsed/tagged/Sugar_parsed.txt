S: 1 EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY
N: A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in progress. A1 ON THE FIELD Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark- skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised for the next pitch. CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZÚCAR/SUGAR - 19, lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES the ball toward the plate. THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball slams inside.
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike three!
N: The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball. FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS. BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH. As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball. The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely. B1 FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO B1 ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 2. C1 ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and C1 kicks the dirt. Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt. Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin. He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air.
S: INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.
C: MARCOS
D: Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more.
C: MIGUEL
D: All muscle, baby. Rock solid.
E: mouth full of food
N: For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE uniforms by their BLACK "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their last. One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.
C: PEDRO
D: Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.
N: A few of the guys LAUGH.
C: MIGUEL
D: If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too.
E: to Pedro
N: The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel exchange subtle grins. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 3.
S: INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY
N: Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated English instructor, SEÑOR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each.
C: SANCHEZ
D: Fly ball.

D: Hone rone!
N: CLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words.
S: INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT
N: It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner. Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall, and into... THE WEIGHT ROOM ...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer, then leans back onto the bench. TRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses.
T: FADE OUT.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 4.
S: EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DAY
N: The Kansas City Director of Minor League Operations, RUDY HUBBARD (white, 40s), watches a TRYOUT SESSION, where TWO SKINNY TEENS in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. Their AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby. Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids, whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively. Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.
C: RUDY
D: What'd you tell him?
C: ALVAREZ
D: I told him to grip the ball more gently. Like a tit.
N: They both crack up. FROM THE TRYOUT MOUND. The kid looks over to the two men pow- wowing about him. He breathes in, nervous... BATTING CAGE - MINUTES LATER Pedro, sweating hard, takes a few cuts, but only seems to be hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Pedro Berroa. Third year. Hasn't developed like we hoped.
C: RUDY
D: How much he sign for?
C: ALVAREZ
D: Forty-five.
C: RUDY
D: Jesus. These kids keep getting more expensive. How much did you sign for back in the day?
C: ALVAREZ
D: 3000. When I was fifteen.
N: Rudy smiles and moves on. Alvarez follows. Pedro watches the men as they walk away. BULL PEN MOUNDS - MINUTES LATER Alvarez and Rudy approach a PITCHING COACH instructing Salvador. Miguel warms up next to him. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 5.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Salvador Torres. Been practicing with the team for almost a week. Still raw, but he's got a lot of potential.
C: RUDY
D: We gonna sign him?
C: ALVAREZ
D: Soon. Soon. We want to play it low- key, see what his agent says.
C: RUDY
D: How much you think?
C: ALVAREZ
D: They've gotten two offers from other clubs. Agent says they were around a hundred.
N: Rudy raises his eyebrows.
C: ALVAREZ
D: He's good.
E: firm
N: Rudy looks over to Miguel.
C: RUDY
D: What about him?
C: ALVAREZ
D: Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed him two years ago for fifteen.
N: Miguel fires in a pitch. Rudy nods, impressed.
C: RUDY
D: Good deal. He throw any junk?
C: ALVAREZ
D: Sugar!
E: in Spanish
N: Miguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Show us your curve.
N: Miguel nods, nervous, focuses. He pitches. The ball curves very subtly over the plate for a strike.
C: RUDY
D: Not bad. Mind if I try something?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 6. Miguel looks back to the men.
C: RUDY
D: Hey, kid, do you mind? May I?
N: Miguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Give him the ball.
E: in Spanish
N: Miguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the index finger tucked against the baseball.
C: RUDY
D: Spike curve. Gives you more rotation, more movement. You try.
E: hands Miguel the ball
N: Miguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his fingers into the correct position. Alvarez laughs.
C: ALVAREZ
D: Vamos! Let's go! Pitch it!
N: Miguel looks over to his catcher, Jose. Winds up the next pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark. Rudy and Alvarez laugh. Miguel looks back over his shoulder.
C: RUDY
D: It's okay, son, these things take time. You'll figure it out.
N: Rudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez. Miguel stares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher, determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation. Delivers. Misses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until... ...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in Jose's mitt. The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 7.
S: INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY
N: Sr. Sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard, reading off lines of a scripted ENGLISH DIALOGUE for the class to repeat. The class' version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible.
C: SANCHEZ
D: I want to talk to you.
C: CLASS
D: I want talk to you.
C: SANCHEZ
D: Your performance in the mound is not as good as last year. What is the problem?
C: CLASS
D: Your performance in the mound is not good as last year. What is problem?
C: SANCHEZ

C: CLASS
D: I don't know. Maybe mechanic.
C: SANCHEZ
D: I want to give you a chance. It is up to you...
N: CLOSE ON Miguel focused on the baseball in his hand. He practices his knuckle curve grip, not participating in the lesson.
C: CLASS
D: I want to give you a chance. Is up to you...
S: EXT. BASEBALL ACADEMY - MORNING
N: Miguel walks down a dirt road with his duffel bag. He exits past the gate, waving goodbye to the SECURITY GUARD. A10 Beyond the manicured lawns and landscaped gardens of the A10 Academy, Miguel passes through the overgrown, undeveloped land where neighborhood CHILDREN play among grazing goats. He continues down the dirt road towards a paved highway in the distance, as bachata music fuels the sound track, and carries over the following... Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 8.
S: INT. MOVING BUS - DAY
N: Thick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. CLOSE ON Miguel staring out the bus window. On his way home, he passes... A11 --half-clothed children flying a homemade kite. A11 B11 --a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top. B11 C11 --an old man sitting by the street, looking straight at Miguel. C11 D11 --flaming sugarcane alongside the road. D11 E11 --three children wedged between their parents on a motorbike. E11 F11 --the tall, wheezing smokestack of the Cristobal Colon sugar F11 refinery.
S: EXT. STREET - SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS - DAY
N: Miguel hops off the bus with his duffel, climbs the pedestrian walkway passing over dozens of rusty railroad cars used for transporting sugarcane to the refinery. We PAN Miguel across the bridge, revealing burning smokestacks in the distance.
S: EXT. SIDE STREET - MINUTES LATER
N: Modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos to Miguel, who smiles back. Local KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard. They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, SHOUTING his name. As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles. With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the balls, then run off to play. Miguel approaches Erica. She puts down her water bucket, gives Miguel a hug.
C: MIGUEL
D: How are you, sis?
C: ERICA
D: Any news about the States?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 9.
C: MIGUEL
D: Is that all you have to say?
N: Miguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof. On the lot next to their house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block.
S: INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Miguel and Erica enter the house, where their brother LUIS (7) watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. The reception is still crappy, though. Miguel's grandmother, ABUELA, sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room.
C: MIGUEL
D: Hello, Abuela. You're looking beautiful.
N: She smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug. Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open.
C: MIGUEL
D: What's up my people? How's the TV?
C: LUIS
D: Erica won't let me watch baseball.
C: ERICA
D: Not during American Idol, anyway.
N: Miguel's mother, CARMEN (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a "wall" separating two rooms.
C: CARMEN
D: Buenas, Miguelito! Do you have any good news for your mother?
C: MIGUEL
D: As a matter of fact, yes.
C: CARMEN
D: You're going to the United States?!
C: MIGUEL
D: Not yet, ma... But I learned how to throw a knuckle curve.
C: CARMEN
D: A knuckle curve? What's that?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 10. A GROUP of KIDS gather at the window.
C: KIDS
D: Sugar, come out and play!
S: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
N: Gathered under the only functioning street lamp, Miguel rears back and throws in a swooping curve, that causes the BATTER to flinch out of the way, as it breaks perfectly over the plate. Carmen, Luis and the rest of the barrio ONLOOKERS, "oooohh", the impressive curve. Miguel notices a group of GIRLS eyeing him from across the street. His eyes stop on one, SOFIA (17). They exchange grins.
S: INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT
N: Miguel's family - minus Miguel - watches a soap opera. Carmen and Erica are in dialogue with the TV. The CAMERA PANS away from the family, out the back window, where the new home is being constructed. We ZOOM IN on the structure covered in plastic tarp.
S: INT. CONSTRUCTION LOT
N: Amidst tools, dry cement, a half-finished wooden dining table, and other assorted construction materials, Miguel has sex with Sofia on a work table.
S: INT. CONSTRUCTION LOT - LATER
N: Miguel throws on his t-shirt. Sofia looks at the wooden dining table. It's artfully done, with details etched into the legs.
C: SOFIA
D: When will you finish this?
C: MIGUEL
D: Soon. It's just hard to find the time.
C: SOFIA
D: It's pretty.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm trying to match the chairs my dad made, but I can't get it right.
C: SOFIA
D: Well, I think it's perfect.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 11.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'll make you another when I'm done.
N: Sofia smiles, kisses Miguel on the cheek.
C: SOFIA
D: And the rest of the house? How long till it's done?
N: Miguel hesitates.
C: MIGUEL
D: Um, another month, maybe two... You know we just did it where Abuela's room is going to be...
C: SOFIA
D: Don't tell me that!
E: laughing
C: MIGUEL
D: Why not? We can do it in mom's kitchen next. Right over there.
C: SOFIA
D: I hope you make it to the States this year.
E: getting serious
C: MIGUEL
D: You hope? C'mon, there's nobody better, baby.
C: SOFIA
D: Okay, how about: I KNOW you'll make it.
E: smiling big
C: MIGUEL
D: Now you're talkin'. And when I do, I'll buy a Cadillac, drive it through the ocean, and bring you back with me.
C: SOFIA
D: You can't drive a Cadillac on water.
C: MIGUEL
D: Yes! In the States they make cars that drive on water.
C: SOFIA
D: You're crazy.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 12.
C: MIGUEL
D: You'll see who's crazy. Just watch.
C: SOFIA
D: I want to see the snow. Does it snow in Kansas City?
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't know. But I'll take you to New York City. Yankee Stadium. It snows there. You wanta see me play in Yankee Stadium?
C: SOFIA
D: It doesn't snow during baseball season, silly.
C: MIGUEL
D: So we'll go for Christmas.
C: SOFIA
D: Promise?
C: MIGUEL
D: Next Christmas, we'll sail into Yankee Stadium in my Cadillac car-boat. Deal?
C: SOFIA
D: You are crazy!
N: They kiss.
S: EXT. MALECÓN - NIGHT
N: Miguel, Sofia, JAVIER (Black, 22) JAMIE (Black, 26) and ALEXANDRA (one of Sofia's friends) hang out by the malecón (waterside), drinking rum and dancing to merengue that blasts out the open doors of a nearby car. The mood is festive.
C: JAVIER
D: I liked her, but she asked me to cut my hair. I thought about it. She was cute, but... I liked my hair more.
E: mid-story
C: SOFIA
D: I liked it too, Javi.
C: MIGUEL
D: Then why'd you cut it last week?

N: Sofia punches Miguel in the arm.
C: MIGUEL
D: Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with.
C: JAVIER
D: He's right! All hail the golden arm.
N: Javier and the girls drunkenly salute Miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but Jaime doesn't play along. He looks on, a little jealous.
C: JAIME
D: You call that flabby rubberband an arm?
C: JAVIER
D: Oooh...
C: MIGUEL
D: This flabby rubberband can throw 95. What can yours do?
C: JAIME
D: I threw 98 in double-A Portland.
C: MIGUEL
D: 98? Then why you washing windshields now? I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week.
N: Everyone cracks up laughing, including Jaime, as Miguel grabs Sofia, and leads her in a dance. His smile fading, Jaime looks out over the water. Miguel notices this. Hold.

S: EXT. EMPTY LOT FIELD - DAY
N: A makeshift diamond is overrun with weeds, ditches, stones, and trash for bases. Donkeys graze in the outfield, unphased by the LITTLE KIDS (10-14 years old) playing around them. A YOUNG PITCHER fires in a fastball that BEANS the YOUNG HITTER in the back. IN THE BLEACHERS, TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink beer and occasionally heckle the kids. HECKLER #1 You're supposed to aim for the head! Nearby, Miguel sits beside his old coach, FRANK (early 40s), watching the kids play. One of the local SHOE SHINE BOYS cleans Miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as Frank cracks open a beer. Frank points out one of the kids on the field.
C: FRANK
D: I like this one. Good bat speed. Only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. His mom tells me he's missing school. I say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing?
N: They laugh.
C: FRANK
D: I'm showing his older brother to the Yankees on Monday.
N: Miguel nods, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.
C: FRANK
D: They don't know what they missed with you. It's cool though. They'll be knocking on your door, offering millions when you turn into a superstar. You'll see...
E: seeing this
N: Miguel nods, appreciating the vote of confidence.
C: MIGUEL
D: Have you been to New York?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 15.

E: nodding
C: MIGUEL
D: What's the city like?
C: FRANK
D: It's great. But you need to get to Kansas City before you start thinking about New York. Know what I mean?
C: MIGUEL
D: You hear anything about spring training yet?
C: FRANK
D: Yep.
N: Frank sips his beer.
C: MIGUEL
D: And?
N: Frank shrugs, as Miguel's sister calls out from the street--
C: ERICA
D: Miguel, Luis! Dinner is ready!
C: MIGUEL
D: You'd tell me if you knew.
C: FRANK
D: Maybe.
N: Miguel shakes his head, gets up.
C: MIGUEL
D: Wanna join us for dinner?
C: FRANK
D: Not tonight. But give your mom a kiss for me, okay?
N: Miguel gives a coin to the boy who's been cleaning his shoes before heading off with his little brother. Frank sips his beer, calls out to the field--

But, I'm going to tell you something very important, gentlemen... forget it. You've got to think about yourselves. Put all your energy into your game, into your development as a player.

N: Salvador smiles.
C: SALVADOR

N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 19.

E: MORE
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 20. PEDRO (cont'd) No more curfews, nobody tellin' me what to do and how to do it. For real, I'm glad this shit's over. I'm a free man. Awkward silence.

The visiting Detroit Academy HITTER knocks the ball over the left field wall for a homerun, wherein... BLAH! Miguel throws up on the mound. All the players gasp in disgust, but Reyes just laughs. Miguel looks over to Alvarez, sitting under an umbrella with a clipboard, then to Reyes, hoping he'll yank him out of the game, but Reyes just claps.

D: Feel better now? Let's go!
N: Miguel tries to shake off the cobwebs, steps on the rubber, stares down the next hitter. CLOSE on his hand revealing the knuckle curve grip. He tosses in the next pitch, which arcs into Jose's glove for a...
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike!
N: Reyes' smile fades, stunned by the beautiful curve. A SERIES OF JUMPCUTS take us through the next three batters, as Miguel makes quick work of them, mixing up his nasty curve with a blazing fastball.

S: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

S: INT. ALVAREZ'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
N: Miguel and Marcos stare straight ahead, nervously. Alvarez stares at them, icy cold. After a beat...
C: ALVAREZ

C: MARCOS
D: But Alfonso was there too--
C: ALVAREZ
D: --No excuses. This is unacceptable behavior. You guys need to learn discipline.
N: Miguel and Marcos lower their heads.
C: REYES
D: You need to remember that you still have a long way to go, a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it. First, there's getting your shot in the American Minor Leagues: rookie ball, single, double, triple A - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark. So, you better pull it together quick...

D: Fifty bucks you're still an asshole next month.
N: They all LAUGH. ON THE FIELD - LATER Pitching coach, STU SUTTON (white, 40s), addresses the minor league pitching staff in mid-speech.
C: STU

N: While all the players respectfully listen to Stu, it is clear that very few of the Latino players can understand him.

He puts everything he has into a hearty fastball, which... ...sails right over the plate for a STRIKE, as Leonard calmly watches and readies himself for the next one. Feeling confident with his stuff, Miguel fires in the next pitch, and... WHACK! Leonard sails it over the right field wall. Stu Sutton smiles at Miguel.
C: STU
D: Welcome to America, kid.
S: INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON a plate of french toast. Miguel, Marcos, Antonio, and Julio all chow down on french toast again. They eat in silence for a few beats, until...

C: UMPIRE
D: Two!
N: IN THE DUGOUT Marcos gets to his feet, clapping for encouragement. Miguel nods to Orlando, delivers again... CRACK! The ball is smoked toward Brad Johnson at second base. He leaps out, body fully extended, and makes a fantastic catch. But he's not done yet... The runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the sweetest double-plays you'll ever see. Miguel pumps his fist into the air, and the team runs to... THE DUGOUT Marcos and Julio are the first to greet Miguel with high-fives. Orlando, Ed, and Jorge, coming off the field, follow in suit. Miguel awaits Brad's return to the dugout and high-fives him too, but they soon return to their segregated places on opposite ends of the bench.

N: She nods, looks out over the landscape, and for the first time we see... ...an EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the Higgins house, which seems to be situated in the middle of nowhere. The low sun casts a dreamy Days of Heaven glow over the image. A tiny Helen Higgins returns inside the house, while Miguel continues to sway on the porch swing, alone. Hold.
T: FADE TO BLACK.

S: INT. HIGGINS DINING ROOM- DUSK
N: The Higgins' son, MICHAEL (40s), and his wife, HILARY (40s), and their daughter, ANNE (17), join Earl and Helen for Miguel's first dinner in Iowa. Helen leads the table in grace...
C: HELEN
D: Dear Lord... Thank you for the meal we are about to eat. And for blessing us with our new guest. And guiding him safely on his journey from the Dominican Republic to Bridgetown...
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 45. Miguel glances around the table. Everyone's head is bowed and eyes closed. His eyes stop on Anne, seated across from him. She's an attractive all-American girl, but would never dream of flaunting her good looks. After taking her in, Miguel closes his eyes.
C: HELEN
D: ...And finally, Lord... Please look kindly over the Swing this season. May all the players stay healthy and... well, why not?... if there's anything you can do to help us win another championship, we'll take that too... Amen.
N: The table laughs, followed by a chorus of Amens. Miguel opens his eyes, greeted with smiles. He smiles too, as everyone passes dishes around the table.
C: MICHAEL
D: So, Miguel... Do - you - eat - meatloaf - back home?
C: HELEN
D: I already told you, Michael, he doesn't speak any English.
C: MICHAEL
D: I know but... I'm curious to know what he thinks of the meatloaf.
C: EARL
D: What do you care? You didn't cook it.
C: HILARY
D: I doubt they have meatloaf in the Dominican Republic, dear.
E: to Michael
C: ANNE
D: I bet they have something similar. They probably just have another name for it.
N: All eyes are on Miguel as he nervously takes a bite. A suspenseful beat, until... ...he smiles and nods. Everyone sighs, smiles, and nods back. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 46.

N: Miguel enters the room, looking for his locker. The Clubby takes notice.
C: CLUBBY
D: Santos - you're over there.
N: Clubby points Miguel in the right direction, where he finds his locker and several pressed jerseys waiting for him. Miguel takes his practice jersey, sits down in front of the locker, as...

E: O.S. in bad Spanish
N: Brad pats Miguel on the back. Miguel is excited to see a familiar face.
C: MIGUEL

N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 47.

S: INT/EXT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER
N: We follow Miguel through the tunnel, which leads out to the... BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK FIELD A stunning little park that sits at the Mississippi River's edge, underneath the Crescent Bridge.

N: Miguel and Jorge stroll through the mall. Miguel notes the steady barrage of discount signs, plastic jewelry kiosks, and product samples.
S: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MINUTES LATER
N: Miguel follows Jorge through the men's section when a rack of Hanes underwear catches his eye. He turns a package over. INSERT: in a little corner of the package Miguel reads, "MADE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC". He checks the price tag.
C: JORGE
D: C'mon, bro, let's find you a suit.
C: MIGUEL
D: I can't afford a suit.
C: JORGE

D: What about you, man? You try one.
N: Jorge shrugs, smiles.
C: JORGE
D: Me? Nah... I'm all washed up.
C: MIGUEL
D: C'mon...

C: JORGE
D: Dude. You have no idea. Just wait till we go to Big Muddy's.
C: MIGUEL
D: Big Muddy's?

N: Miguel and Jorge each carry a shopping bag for Helen. Miguel also carries a plastic bag of his own. All three of them are licking ice cream cones.
S: INT. MIGUEL'S ROOM - DAY
N: Miguel takes a new calendar out of a plastic shopping bag. It features iconic images of New York City. He peels off the plastic and pins it to the month of April on his wall. CLOSE ON Miguel's hands tearing open a small package from his family back home: we linger on a crudely drawn sketch of a baseball player with a Kansas City jersey from Luis, along with a photo of Carmen, Erica, and Luis posing in front of the frame of the new house. Miguel smiles, reads the enclosed letter.

Great night for Swing baseball... And also a great night to grab a bite and a brew at Harlow's after the game - your local pub and proud sponsor...
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 50.
S: EXT. ON THE FIELD
N: As a YOUNG LADY begins singing the Star-Spangled Banner, Miguel takes off his hat, looks out to the American Flag. Hold on his solemn expression.
S: EXT. IN THE DUGOUT
N: We STAY ON Miguel for the game's highlights, JUMP CUTTING his reactions to the best plays of the game. PLAY 1: he casually spits sunflower seed shells, then CLAPS the final out of the inning, high-fiving players returning to the dugout. PLAY 2: chats to Jorge, when they react to the CRACK of the bat, leap to their feet, eagerly anticipate an umpire's call, and CHEER when the call goes their team's way. PLAY 3: grimaces at the sight of a hit-by-pitch. PLAY 4: leaps to his feet, CLAPS. PLAY 5: leaps to his feet, doesn't clap. Sits back down. PLAY 6: Miguel and Jorge sway to the seventh inning stretch classic "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." PLAY 7: sitting with Brad, they both point to something on the field and crack up laughing. Of course, we don't see what they're laughing at. PLAY 8: standing with Jorge and the rest of the players, the mood is tense. The players react to a hit ball, as their heads jerk toward the outfield, waiting, waiting, waiting, and... A98 CELEBRATION! Whatever happened, the game is over and we follow A98 the players out onto the field to mob Brad, who just scored the winning run.
S: EXT. BIG MUDDY'S FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
N: The BOUNCER examines Miguel's photo ID, which is actually Jorge's. He shoots Miguel a suspicious look, but hands it back and lets him through.
S: INT. BIG MUDDY'S - NIGHT
N: Some of the Swing players celebrate their first victory with beers at the local bar/dance club. A few of the guys dance with LOCAL GIRLS, but Jorge and Miguel stand against the wall, beers in hand, as they watch the MTV-inspired GRINDING and FREAKING unfolding before them. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 51.
C: MIGUEL
D: You think they know how to salsa?
C: JORGE
D: Go for it, bro. But remember, just cause they dance with you, doesn't mean they want anything else.
E: smiling
N: Orlando and Ed approach with a couple brews.
C: ORLANDO
D: Not from you, anyway.
N: Miguel notices Brad stroll by, calls him over.

D: Yo flaco!

N: Everyone laughs, as Jorge eyes TWO WOMEN on the dance floor.
C: JORGE
D: You ready?
C: MIGUEL
D: Let's do it.
S: INT. BIG MUDDY'S DANCE FLOOR
N: Jorge whispers in one of the girls' ears and the two of them begin dancing with him and Miguel. At first cautious, Miguel and his partner ease closer, until Miguel's hands are on her hips, leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam, while mixing in some Latin moves as well. As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork. But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in particular, who... ...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 52.
C: JACKASS
D: Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle.
E: barely audible
N: Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them, and... ...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other, though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific. Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything serious starts. They all hustle out to...
S: EXT. BIG MUDDY'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: The Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS. They all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the club's entrance, watching them go.
S: EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
N: The car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER. The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out with the hum of the engine. An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins' bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window. He tiptoes inside. The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to...
S: INT. CHURCH - DAY
N: With the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices him as she sings. A smile. Miguel perks up.
S: EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
N: CHURCHGOERS flood out of the church after the service. Anne walks alongside Miguel. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 53.
C: ANNE
D: How'd you like the service? Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring for you. Did you go to church in the Dominican Republic?
E: off his blank stare
N: He shakes his head.
C: MIGUEL
D: I am sorry. I do not understand.
C: ANNE
D: S'okay. You understand more than a lot of folks around here I bet.
N: He nods, still unsure.
C: ANNE
D: So listen, me and some friends are hanging out later. You should stop by my house after the game. It's gonna be super chill. Grandma can take you there, but here...
N: She stops a random CHURCHGOER...
C: ANNE
D: Can I borrow a pen real quick?
N: The churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on Miguel's forearm.
C: ANNE
D: After the game. My house... Good luck, tonight.
N: Anne runs off. Miguel looks after her, mystified.
S: INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm. Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 54.
S: EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses himself. Play ball. Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first pitch high for a ball. When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where... ...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to the field in choice box seats. He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch. Ball two. Same for the third. And forth. The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES.
S: INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH
N: Jack Jefferies does his thing on the mic.
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight.
N: ON THE MOUND Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first.
C: JORGE
D: Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay?
N: Miguel nods. Jorge points out the next batter. Another Dominican.
C: JORGE
D: See? Just like home.
N: Jorge runs back to his position at third. Miguel tucks his index finger into his knuckle curve grip. Delivers...
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike!
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 55.
C: JORGE
D: That's it! There it is!
N: And the next pitch... ...is hit sharply to Jorge at third, who fires it over to second for one, and on to first for a double play. The crowd goes WILD and Miguel finally exhales. One, two, three... he mows down the next BATTER on three
T: consecutive strikes. More APPLAUSE.
N: IN THE DUGOUT Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. Miguel takes a seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at Anne's address scribbled on his forearm. SCOREBOARD - LATER THAT NIGHT We PAN RIGHT across six innings of zeroes. The Swing are leading 4 to nothing in the top of the 7th. ON THE FIELD THWACK! The HITTER smokes a double off the left-center wall.
S: INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Nearly unhittable for the first 6 innings, that was only the second hit allowed by Santos tonight.
N: BACK ON THE FIELD. The next BATTER dribbles a spinning groundball at Jorge, but it squirts through his legs into left field, allowing the runner to score an unearned run from second. Stu walks toward the mound, signals for the bullpen. He and Orlando greet Miguel on the mound.
C: STU
D: Good game, kid. Enjoy this...
C: ORLANDO
D: Nice work, Sugar.
E: in Spanish
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 56.
C: MIGUEL
D: But that wasn't my fault. I can go longer.
E: in Spanish, to Orlando
C: ORLANDO
D: Take it easy; it's your first game.
E: in Spanish
N: Though he doesn't speak Spanish, Stu knows exactly what's happening. He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound. As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut...
C: STU
D: You hear that? It's for you, kid.
N: Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates with congratulatory high-fives. AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.
S: EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALLPARK - AFTER THE GAME
N: FIREWORKS EXPLODE in the sky as the kids in the crowd watch excitedly. IN THE DUGOUT Miguel and a few other players hang over the railing, enjoying the awesome display.
S: EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
N: Miguel rings the doorbell, waits. He's holding a baseball. Anne opens the door.
C: ANNE
D: Hey Miguel. C'mon inside.
N: He hands her the ball like it's a rose.
C: MIGUEL
D: My first... strike-out.
E: in rehearsed English
C: ANNE
D: Oh, Miguel... you're so sweet. Congratulations, I heard you pitched awesome.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 57.
S: INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
N: Some kind of casual teenage party is in effect. Pizza boxes are spread around the living room and everyone (12-15 WHITE KIDS) are drinking soda from plastic cups. No booze.
C: ANNE
D: Hey everybody, this is Miguel. He's from the Dominican Republic, and now he pitches for the Swing.
N: Everyone manages to say "Hi Miguel" at the same time. GAME ROOM - A LITTLE LATER Two guys, RANDY and TRAVIS, play a spirited game of foozeball, while Miguel looks on, fascinated.
C: RANDY
D: What's up, man?
C: TRAVIS
D: Wanna play?
C: MIGUEL
D: No. Thank you.
C: TRAVIS
D: It's like soccer. You play soccer?

D: Soccer? No. Baseball.
C: TRAVIS
D: Well this is called fooze-ball. Fooze- ball.
C: MIGUEL
D: Foos-ball?
C: TRAVIS
D: Yeah, you got it.
N: Miguel looks for Anne, sees her going over some papers with another kid. She sees Miguel, waves, then gets back to her conversation.
C: RANDY
D: I used to be a pitcher. In little league. I wasn't very good though.
N: Miguel nods, and another girl, WENDY, chimes in. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 58.
C: WENDY
D: I heard that the beaches in the Dominican Republic are really beautiful.
N: Miguel nods again. They stand in silence for an awkward beat, sipping from their red, plastic cups, until...
C: ANNE
D: Hey guys, let's get started. Everyone grab a seat.
N: The teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. Miguel sits behind the majority of the group, not sure what's going on. Anne stands before them...
C: ANNE
D: I'm so glad you all came. Last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group. So, I think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word. But this year, I want us to work harder. Now, I know a lot of you are studying for SATs or working on college applications. And all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important. What we do in school or for a job... that's just a small part of who we are. We're only here by the grace of God, so let's get out there and share that grace.
N: Miguel watches, still unsure what's going on. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER Anne leads the group in song, while Randy plays the piano. Miguel watches; he's the only person not singing.
C: THE GROUP
D: One there is above all others, Oh, how He loves! His is love beyond a brother's, Oh, how He loves! Earthly friends may fail or leave us, One day soothe, the next day grieve us; But this Friend will ne'er deceive us: Oh, how He loves!
E: singing
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 59. Miguel observes, a little disappointed, as this is not quite the date he was hoping for.
S: EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DAY
N: Miguel and Brad are side by side in neighboring aisle seats, while Jorge and Jeff catch some Zs against the window. Miguel's "English for Baseball Players" workbook is on his lap, but he and Brad discuss language that won't likely be found there...
C: MIGUEL
D: Mamañema. Very bad. Very bad word.
C: BRAD
D: Mama-ñema? What's it mean?

D: Mmm... Like--
N: Miguel mimes fellatio.

C: BRAD
D: Hey, how'd it go with that girl the other night?

C: MIGUEL
D: Oh, she no es my girl.
N: Brad senses Miguel's disappointment in the matter.

C: BRAD
D: You like The White Stripes?
C: MIGUEL
D: I don't know.
C: BRAD
D: Check it out.
N: Miguel grabs his portable CD player, hands it to Brad, trading music with him.

Miguel puts his ear to the door again, but can't hear anything, so he returns to the desk, begins carving again.

S: INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - DUSK
N: He finishes up a birthday card to his sister Erica, encloses it in a padded envelope along with the wooden etching he carved earlier - a pendant with a cornstalk design. The NYC calendar on the wall in the background indicates we are now in JUNE. When he's done, he goes to his duffel, pulls out his English language workbook. Miguel sits on his bed, opens the book. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 65.
S: EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - DAY
N: A batter swings and misses for strike three. The catcher throws the ball around the horn. Miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction, gets the ball back. His next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line, where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play... Miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but... OUCH! ...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground. The runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet. Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate.
C: STU
D: Nice play, kid. How's your foot?
C: JORGE
D: You okay?
N: Miguel nods, but he's limping back to the mound.
C: STU
D: Take it easy. Don't force it. How's it feel?
C: ORLANDO
D: Don't push it. Does it hurt?
E: translating
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm okay.
C: STU
D: Let him toss a few warm-ups.
N: The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches. Visibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle, makes a face. Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 66.
C: STU
D: All right, kid. Give it a rest.
N: As Stu reaches for the ball, Miguel pulls it away.
C: MIGUEL
D: I am okay. Please.
N: Stu and the trainer sense Miguel's anxiety. Stu puts his arm on Miguel's shoulder for comfort.
C: STU
D: You're okay, I know, but let's just be sure... Give me the ball, son.
N: Miguel sizes them up, reluctantly hands the ball over, and limps off the field with Stu and the other players looking after.
S: INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
N: The whole family, with a couple new additions, sit around the table in mid-meal: Earl, Helen, Anne, Michael, Hilary, Jorge, Brad and Miguel. Miguel wears a big blue boot on his injured foot, and a crutch leans against the wall behind him.

D: You've been pitching so well... it's a real shame.
C: EARL
D: Don't worry, Miguel, you'll bounce right back.

E: searching for the word
N: Anne nudges her dad under the table.
C: HELEN

E: thinks for a beat
C: ANNE

C: ANNE
D: What happened there?

D: Uh... When I boy... Um... I don't know--
E: struggling
C: ANNE
D: Tell me in Spanish.
C: MIGUEL
D: Okay... When I was little, I wanted to eat some cherries from a tree. It wasn't our tree, and there was a fence to keep us kids away.
E: in Spanish, no subtitles
N: Anne hangs on his every word as if she understood perfectly.
C: MIGUEL
D: So I climbed up the fence to knock down some cherries with a stick, but I when I took my first swing-- whoosh. I fell. There was a lot of blood.
N: Anne reaches out, lightly touches his scar. Her hand lingers for a beat, until... Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 69. ...Miguel leans in and kisses her. She kisses him back for a beat, but when he puts his hand around her waist, pulling her closer, she resists. They separate. Anne looks down at her feet, uncomfortable.
C: ANNE
D: Sorry, I just... Sorry.
N: Miguel looks on, confused, as she stands. They lock eyes for an awkward beat.
C: ANNE
D: I should help clean up...
N: On her way back inside...
C: ANNE
D: We have another meeting Thursday... If you can come.
N: Miguel nods. Anne leaves him on the porch alone. He looks out over the corn fields.
S: INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY
N: Miguel enters the near-empty room limping on his blue boot, finds Jorge wearing street clothes and packing up personal things from his locker. Miguel knows immediately what's happened. They make eye contact from across the locker room. Nobody moves. After a beat...

C: MIGUEL
D: What happened?

C: MIGUEL
D: You're going to New York?
C: JORGE
D: Where else? There's no work back home. My bonus won't last forever...
N: Miguel looks off. Jorge senses his anxiety.
C: JORGE
D: Relax Sugar, I'll see you at Yankee Stadium someday... when the Knights come to town. I'll be in the front row, getting drunk, and cheering the loudest.
N: Miguel smiles.
C: JORGE
D: Not for you though. Yankee fans are crazy. I can't take the risk... I'll call you.

C: MIGUEL
D: I have a few.
C: SOFIA
D: A few?

C: SOFIA
D: Shut up!
C: MIGUEL
D: He's probably lying though.
C: SOFIA
D: I bet he's lying.
N: A beat, as Miguel shifts gears...
C: MIGUEL
D: Jorge went to New York.
C: SOFIA
D: To the Yankees?
C: MIGUEL
D: No. Our team cut him loose. He's got a cousin there... I don't know what he's going to do...
C: SOFIA
D: Shit... What about his family?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 72.
C: MIGUEL
D: It's not right. He got injured playing for them. They owe him another chance. He's worked too hard for too long... I mean he's not a horse.
E: his mind somewhere else
N: Miguel drifts off, and they sit in silence for a beat.
C: SOFIA
D: But you can't let it get to you. You've got nothing to worry about. Just keep playing well, and things will be okay.
C: MIGUEL
D: Yeah... I know. Things will be okay.
N: Miguel looks off, not so sure.
S: INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY

C: BRAD
D: You signed at sixteen? Wow. So you didn't finish school?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 73. Miguel shakes his head, no. After a beat...
C: MIGUEL
D: If you no play baseball... what you do?
C: BRAD
D: Um... it's hard to say for sure, but I like history, so I'd probably go to grad school... maybe teach someday.
C: VOICE
D: Brad! We're up for B.P. Let's go.
E: O.S.
N: Brad gets up, taps Miguel on the shoulder on his way out. Miguel sits alone on the couch in the empty room, when he looks off, sees...

S: INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - DAY
N: Miguel watches "When the Levees Broke" playing on HBO-Latino. ON THE TV, one image of the hurricane's devastation gives way to another. An AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN stranded on the roof of her house. A YOUNG BOY who's lost his mother. Miguel looks on, moved by the tragedy.
S: INT. WASHER/DRYER ROOM - DAY

S: INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
N: Miguel sits at the kitchen table with the broken drawer and several small tools in front of him. He readjusts the wooden rails on the faulty side of the drawer by sanding them down and re-gluing them into place. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. FRONT DOOR. Miguel hobbles over, opens it to find Anne, carrying a casserole dish and a couple empty platters.
C: ANNE
D: These are grandma's from the other night.
N: Miguel lets her pass into the kitchen, put the dishes on the table. They stand awkwardly for a beat, looking at each other.
C: ANNE
D: We missed you at our meeting, Thursday.
C: MIGUEL
D: Sorry. I forget.
C: ANNE
D: It's okay, maybe next time.
C: MIGUEL
D: You want sit?
C: ANNE
D: I gotta go actually, so--
C: MIGUEL
D: Okay, go.
N: Miguel sits, gets back to work on the drawer. Anne looks at him for a second, then exits. Miguel glances out the window, watches Anne climb into a pickup truck idling in the driveway. Anne and Miguel make brief eye contact before the truck speeds away, a trail of dust following it into the distance.
S: A146 EXT. CORN FIELDS - DUSK A146
N: Miguel walks down a path in the middle of the Higgins' corn field. He finds a cob of corn, removes the leaves, and examines the kernels up close. ZOOM IN to ECU of a single kernel. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 75. Miguel stares at the raw corn with strange fascination.
T: FADE OUT.
S: INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY
N: Miguel walks in without crutches, looking healthy. He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker. Stu approaches Miguel...
C: STU
D: There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder. They called up Brad this morning... He left you this...
N: Stu hands Miguel an old paperback book. INSERT: a Spanish-language version of Roberto Clemente's biography. Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has inscribed a note, "See you in Kansas City, Mamañema!" Miguel smiles, bittersweet, when a familiar VOICE calls out...
C: SALVADOR
D: Yo! Sugar!
N: Miguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny kid from the Academy) running at him. They hug.
C: MIGUEL
D: Holy shit! How'd you get here?
C: SALVADOR
D: On a airplane, motherfucker.
N: Miguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face for being a smartass.
C: STU
D: Great, you guys know each other. Sal's our new middle-relief man. Throws a nasty cutter. You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos...
C: MIGUEL
D: Okay.
N: Stu walks back towards the coaches' office.
C: SALVADOR
D: What he say?
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 76.

S: EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - NIGHT
N: CLOSE ON Miguel swearing at himself, clearly not following his own advice. A RUNNER circles the bases after hitting a homerun.
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Santos allows his second homerun of the game. First night off the DL, and not looking so sharp.
E: V.O.
N: The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th. Miguel glances out of the corner of his eye to... THE DUGOUT ...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard. MIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way out to the mound. Miguel glances back to the bullpen, where Salvador is warming up. Stu signals for Salvador to come in, and we follow Miguel off the field to scattered applause. A148 IN THE RADIO BOOTH Jack Jefferies continues his play-by-play ofA148 the game.
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Sutton makes the call to pull Santos here in the 4th, bringing in rookie reliever, Salvador Torres for his Bridgetown debut.
N: B148 IN THE DUGOUT. Miguel sits on the bench, throws a towel over B148 his head. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 77. ON THE MOUND. Salvador warms up, looking a little freaked. Players and fans marvel over Sal's unorthodox, side-armed delivery. His form is reminiscent of A's legend, Dennis Eckersly, but without the grace. MIGUEL peaks through his towel at the action... ON THE FIELD. Salvador takes a deep breath, delivers his first pitch...
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike!
N: Salvador seems to relax. Winds up his next pitch, and... ...the ball appears to zig-zag across the plate, freezing the hitter in confusion.
C: UMPIRE

N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 78. Salvador laughs, but Miguel is serious. He gets up and heads for the showers.
S: INT. HIGGINS CAR - NIGHT
N: Helen and Earl drive Miguel home after the game. ON THE CAR RADIO, we can hear a news report of a suicide bombing in Iraq. Helen turns it down.
C: HELEN
D: You started dropping your arm in the third. I think that was your problem.
C: EARL
D: He lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be.
C: HELEN
D: Earl...

S: INT. VISITORS' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT
N: Miguel storms into the empty clubhouse, grabs a bat from the wall rack, and smashes a water dispenser unit to the ground, spilling water everywhere. As he observes the mess, his breathing steadies, and... He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager stares at him, disapproving.
S: INT. VISITING COACHES' OFFICE - DAY
N: Miguel sits across from Stu, staring off, embarrassed.
C: STU
D: I know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself. But you need to learn self- control. Can you understand what I'm saying? You need to learn that your actions have consequences. So we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check... That's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of... Is it?
N: Miguel turns his gaze to Stu. Though he doesn't fully understand what he's saying, Stu's intention is clear.
C: STU
D: So you should think real hard next time. Think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field. Into practice. Channel it into working harder--
C: MIGUEL

C: STU
D: So work harder, goddamnit! You think you're the only one on this team works hard?

N: As Miguel glances away in frustration, Stu stops himself. They sit in silence. Hold.
S: EXT. PEORIA CHIEFS' PARK - EVENING

C: JEFF
D: Listen, your first time, take a half. Okay? No more. You gotta ease into it. Half.
N: Miguel nods.
C: JEFF
D: And anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay?

S: EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
N: THE CAMERA eerily floats toward and around Miguel on the mound. He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his cross, whispers a prayer to himself. Winds up, throws, and... THUD! ...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the old days. Miguel's "stuff" is back. And he knows it. A161 IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen settle into their box seats A161 eating caramel corn and cola. B161 RADIO ANNOUNCERS BOOTH. Jack Jefferies at the mic... B161
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Miguel Santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. I don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the Santos we knew earlier this season.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 82. C161 IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in C161 Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could be his last. ON THE MOUND - 2ND INNING CLOSE ON MIGUEL. Sweating more than he should at this point in the game, but... ...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters, striking out two more in the 2nd. A162 IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen CHEER for their Miguel. A162 IN THE DUGOUT - LATER THAT NIGHT Still sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth. The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees... ...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps). Stu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see him mouth the words, "You okay?", but NO SOUND comes out. Miguel nods, yes. BACK ON THE FIELD - 5TH INNING And back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop. Orlando motions for him to calm down. The next pitch is closer, but still high. And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh. Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart is racing. A164 IN THE RADIO BOOTH A164
C: JACK JEFFERIES
D: Top of the fifth and Santos is showing some control issues. Not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself.

C: ORLANDO
D: Don't worry about it. You're all good. Just relax. Throw strikes. They can't touch you. Just throw strikes.
N: Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 83. Miguel nods. Orlando goes back behind the plate. Miguel glances to the runner at first, then delivers...
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike!
N: Orlando nods, encouraging. Throws the ball back. Miguel takes another deep breath. He whispers a prayer to himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and... ...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field. Miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases. STU shakes his head in disappointment. C164 FROM THE BULLPEN, Salvador watches, concerned. C164 D164 FROM THE STANDS, Earl and Helen clap for encouragement. D164 E164 MIGUEL does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering toE164 himself, which makes him look crazy. Another deep breath. Another pitch... UH-OH. This one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt to avoid contact. It's on.
C: UMPIRE
D: You're outta here!
E: ejecting Miguel
N: The batter leaps to his feet, walks out toward the mound, pointing his finger at Miguel, PISSED. Miguel opens his arms, inviting a fight. Orlando steps between them.
C: BATTER
D: Fucking Puerto Rican piece of shit!
C: MIGUEL
D: Fuck you, cocksucker!
E: in English
N: Both benches clear, as players rush out onto the field to restore order. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 84. Miguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the other players swirl around them, creating little sub-conflicts of their own. It's a mess. The sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again. There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence. Miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself... Hold, until... ...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.
S: INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE SHOWERS - A LITTLE LATER
N: Miguel showers alone.
S: INT. HIGGINS KITCHEN - NIGHT
N: Miguel eats a late dinner at the table. Earl sits at the other end, sipping some tea, while Helen does dishes at the sink. The mood is uncomfortably tense. Nobody says a word, until Miguel musters up the courage.

S: INT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - COACHES' OFFICE - EVENING
N: Stu addresses Miguel before the game. Though his words are encouraging, his tone is detached, cold. Miguel senses this, listens, dejected.
C: STU
D: You played with your emotions, and your emotions got the best of you. Happens to everyone. It's just a nasty part of the game. Nobody likes to admit it, but it is. The true test of our character as athletes... is how we come back. It's up to you.

Reminds me of a young Pedro Martinez... Hey there Bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. So pick yours up at the box office today...
N: IN THE BULLPEN Similar to an earlier sequence of JUMPCUTS on Miguel reacting to the game from the dugout, we now HOLD on Miguel, solemn and detached, from the bullpen. NOTE: the frame for the following images contains the first 3-4 rows of FANS seated behind the bullpen, so we can also use them to gauge what might be happening on the field. PLAY 1: Miguel, the FOUR RELIEVERS, and the fans clap for a nice play. PLAY 2: The fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit. PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco. PLAY 4: A new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field, leaving only two others with Miguel. PLAY 5: Miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the "Chicken Dance" behind him. PLAY 6: The fans leap to their feet in applause. The two relievers high-five. Miguel CLAPS, going through the motions. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 86. PLAY 7: Miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the fans sing along to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." PLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only Miguel and one other guy. PLAY 9: Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game, but... ...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out onto the field. As the players and fans head for the exits, Miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a beat. He nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment. Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN with him, as he crosses frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. Hold.

N: Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment. He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles. His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM. Miguel smiles. AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a Metrocard vending machine nearby. AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches and BEEPS, he's got his card. AT THE TURNSTILE He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile won't budge. He studies the message: "SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS TURNSTILE", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again, this time very slowly, but still can't get through. An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly. Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass. After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again.

C: MIGUEL
D: It wasn't a slump.
C: JORGE

N: Jorge looks at Miguel for a tense beat.
C: MIGUEL

C: JORGE
D: They got all kinds in this league, bro. Like fat cats in their forties, kids like you and me, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, even some white boys. I got this fifty year old catcher on my team, used to play for the Dodgers. Can't run for shit, but he's out there every week. Belly out to here. My man can still go deep though... You ever hear from that kid, Brad?
N: Reyna leans close to Miguel, says something in his ear, and he smiles, as she leads him out onto... THE DANCEFLOOR ...where they carve up some fast and fierce moves. Miguel grins wide, having a great time. At this point the sound FADES LOW and the image blends to SLOW-MOTION, their bodies gliding through the frame, soothing and peaceful. Hold, as Jeff Buckley's "Hallelujah" FADES UP and carries over...

C: OSVALDO
D: I did some research and I got a new favorite player now.
C: MIGUEL
D: Okay, good.
C: OSVALDO
D: Vic Power. You know him?
N: Miguel shakes his head, no.
C: OSVALDO
D: You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people."
N: Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next.
C: OSVALDO
D: So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay, I don't eat colored people."
N: After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure. Osvaldo does his best to explain the joke in Spanish. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 109.

C: MIGUEL
D: Okay, mom, but you know it would be a lot easier if you opened an email account.
C: CARMEN
D: Email? I don't even know how to use the TV!
N: Miguel smiles.
C: MIGUEL
D: I'm making a new table for you. It's going to be real nice.
C: CARMEN
D: I'm sure I'll love it. Thank you.
C: MIGUEL
D: How's Erica?
C: CARMEN
D: She's good. Got a job at the factory. Just part-time, though, so she can keep up with school.
N: Miguel removes the phone from his ear for a beat.
C: MIGUEL
D: And Luis?
C: CARMEN
D: He's pitching now. You should see him, Miguel, got an arm like his brother.
C: MIGUEL

The ball is SMACKED toward third, where Jorge makes an awkward lunge for the ball, manages to stop it with his foot. By the time he gets his hand on it, the RUNNER has made it to first. The fans and some of the players laugh at Jorge's ugly mistake.
C: OLD MAN HECKLER
D: This ain't soccer! You can use your hands!
E: from the stands
C: MIGUEL
D: Just like old times.
E: smiling
N: But Jorge shrugs and laughs it off. No pressure here. It's only a game. Miguel buckles down, delivers a monster fastball.
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike!
N: He gets the ball back, looks to the stands, and sees... ...Monica waving to Jorge at third. Miguel's new friend, Osvaldo, is also there with Estella. Miguel smiles to them. Miguel fires in the next pitch, even faster, and the batter swings straight through it.
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike two!
N: He gets the ball back, lowers his head and whispers a prayer to himself. Looks back to the runner on second. Comes to the set position, and... ...floats in a vicious, swooping, knuckle curve, that causes the batter to flinch out of the way, before breaking back over the plate for...
C: UMPIRE
D: Strike three!
N: All the fans and players in attendance go NUTS over the awesome pitch, as we follow Miguel off the field to a mini-standing ovation. He tips his hat to the crowd. Just like old times. Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07 113. IN THE DUGOUT Miguel takes a seat as TEAMMATES pass through the frame and pat him on the back. The SOUND FADES LOW as we start a SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel. He takes in the moment as we get closer, and his smile gives way to a beat of quiet introspection. Hold. He looks out across the field. CLAPS for encouragement.
T: FADE OUT.
