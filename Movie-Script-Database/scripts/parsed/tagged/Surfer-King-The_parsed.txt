M: THE SURFER KING
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
N: JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box. There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker with Down's Syndrome.
C: JAFFA
D: Eddie!
C: EDDIE
D: Jaffa.
E: smiling, nodding
N: They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the CD player. His voice echoes through the park. "Soak up the Sun" begins playing.
C: JAFFA
D: Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be open in twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes.
E: smiling checking his watch
N: GFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN
S: EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY
N: BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay. There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose Page 2 of 81 holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay. He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay. RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance. BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks at RICHARD who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button. They both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out. Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his clipboard.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY SURFS UP AREA
N: We see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles, and cross each other in a timed march to the music.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY FUN HOUSE AREA
N: BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD. After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a bit, indicating it is full. The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY FIRST AID SHACK NEAR FUNHOUSE
N: Two guards are looking down at BIG MIKE below. One guard begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. The other guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever. GUARD ONE is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his hands to indicate "almost there". He closes his hands, and GUARD TWO pulls the lever. Page 3 of 81
S: EXT. LATER THAT MORNING - DAY 2001 VW BUG
N: We are on the road to Water World in Federal Heights, Colorado. ROBBIE ZIRPOLLO is riding with his mother CONNIE ZIRPOLLO.
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah. This is great. I love this plan. Drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in California to some weird place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go camping....
E: sardonically
C: CONNIE
D: Look, I know you're not happy about this. But it wasn't my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to Mexico with our life savings.
C: ROBBIE
D: "Administrative Assistant." There's no such thing as a secretary anymore.
C: CONNIE
D: Fine. Administrative Assistant. We couldn't afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back. I was able to land a good job here. And now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this job at the Water Park...
C: ROBBIE
D: Grounds crew. What kind of job is that? It sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots.
E: shaking his head
C: CONNIE
D: Bernie says you help keep the park clean, sweep up, that sort of thing. I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you'll be going to. You can start the school year with some ready-made friends.
C: ROBBIE
D: I had friends in Oceanside. I had something to do for the summer.
N: They pass the main Water World sign. Hanging below it is a banner that says Opening Tomorrow!.
C: CONNIE
D: Hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something
N: Page 4 of 81 to do. This way you'll make some money and meet people here. You'd best get used to it. This is where we live now. We're staying.
C: ROBBIE
D: All thanks to Dad and his secretary.
C: CONNIE
D: Administrative Assistant.
C: ROBBIE
D: Whatever. Some summer....
N: They have arrived at the front gates of Water World, Kids are in a line leading to a check-in canopy kiosk that has a sign saying Employee Check In.
C: CONNIE
D: Promise me you'll give it a try....please?
C: ROBBIE
D: I will. I promise. See you later
E: giving in to the inevitable
N: He shuts the car door and walks over to the end of the line.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY FRONT GATES OF WATER WORLD
N: There are about 40-50 teenagers in various default street clothes, shorts and tees mostly. Robbie takes his place in line behind an older, taller boy, ALEX, who seems to know almost everyone, and has made it his personal mission to greet them.
C: ALEX
D: ...and so SHE says I'll have the filet AND the lobster". I had to borrow twenty bucks from Fitzgerald just to get out of the restaurant.
E: back still to ROBBIE
N: Two guys in front of Alex are laughing now. Further down the line however, another voice pops up.
C: DOUG
D: By the way. Where is that twenty bucks?
E: waving to ALEX
C: ALEX
D: Ohhh, hey Dougie. I'll catch up with you later... Hey, how you doin'? Haven't seen you before.
E: avoiding turning around to ROBBIE as not to continue the conversation
N: Page 5 of 81 ALEX looks in his wallet, as do we. It is empty.
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm Robbie. Robbie Zirpollo.
E: nodding
C: ALEX
D: I'm Alex. Where you workin'?
C: ROBBIE
D: I believe it's with the Grounds Crew?
C: ALEX
D: What's the matter, can't swim?
C: ROBBIE
D: I can swim. Why?
E: surprised
C: ALEX
D: Well, you look old enough to be a guard.
C: ROBBIE
D: Almost 16. I get my license in September.
C: ALEX
D: It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. Most guys your age that can swim are guards.
C: ROBBIE
D: Well, I just moved here. I guess I missed guard tryouts. You're a guard then?
C: ALEX
D: Oh, no no no. I work concessions...at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack. It's just as well. The guards are mostly stuck up anyway. The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun.
C: ROBBIE
D: Can't swim, huh?
C: ALEX
D: Nope.
E: smiling
C: ROBBIE
D: What is that?
E: listening to speaker on post above
C: ALEX
D: Surf tunes, dude!
E: mimicking his perception of surfers
N: Page 6 of 81 (back to his own voice) You'll get used to it. You'll get to where you miss it. I had to buy two CD's just to get through the winter. They are now at the front of the line. A teenage girl MELISSA is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard.
C: ALEX
D: Ahh. And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire...
E: CONT'D gesturing
C: MELISSA
D: Oh, Alex. Am I going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer?
E: shaking her head no
C: ALEX
D: Dear Melissa. There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay.
E: looking upward toward the sky
C: MELISSA
D: Yeah, well from what I hear, it would be a BRIEF few moments.
C: ROBBIE
D: Ouch.
E: wincing
C: ALEX
D: My dear, you cut me to the quick. Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr. Robbie Zirpollo.
E: not missing a beat
C: MELISSA
D: Fill out these emergency cards, and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms.... over there. And Alex?
E: handing them cards pointing
C: ALEX
D: She wants me. Yeeees?
E: to ROBBIE turning back to MELISSA
C: MELISSA
D: This year, let's clock in only our OWN time card, shall we?
E: finger pointing
N: ALEX Page 7 of 81 (head shaking, to ROBBIE, walking together) Some people have no sense of humor.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - OUTSIDE UNIFORM BUILDING
N: ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens. At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list. As ROBBIE and ALEX reach the back of the line, TIFFANY, a blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front of the line.
C: ROBBIE
D: Whoa....who was that?
E: taken aback, breathing in through his nose
C: ALEX
D: Eeeaasy there, big fella. Not in your lifetime. Or mine.
E: unimpressed, putting his hand on ROBBIE's shoulder as if to hold him back, like a horse that is riled up wistfully, glancing over
C: ROBBIE
D: So who is she?
C: ALEX
D: Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park.
N: WE SEE TIFFANY and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line.
C: ALEX
D: See, Princess Tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park. Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards. Pretty decent guy from what I can tell. But she's a piece of work. Your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: Cowboy, huh. Big guy?
C: ALEX
D: Big. Guy.
C: ROBBIE
E: takes in a deep breath
N: Page 8 of 81 Hmm. They are now at the front of the line.
C: MALE UNIFORM GUY
D: Hey Alex. (calling back to FEMALE UNIFORM
C: PERSON)
D: Aokee's. Large.
E: to ROBBIE
C: MALE UNIFORM GUY
D: Name?
E: CONT'D
N: Female Uniform Person has brought a blue Hawaiian shirt on a hanger.
C: ROBBIE
D: Rob Zirpollo. Uh, Robert Zirpollo
C: MALE UNIFORM GUY
D: Grounds?
E: looks on clipboard looks at FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON
C: MALE UNIFORM GUY
D: Grounds.
E: CONT'D and FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON, together, ominously
N: She disappears to the back.
C: ROBBIE
D: So what is this grounds thing, anyway?
E: to ALEX
C: ALEX
D: Let's just say....you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation... and....flow of things here at the park.
E: he and MALE UNIFORM GUY exchange a knowing glance
C: FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON
D: Here you go, tiger. One grounds. Medium. You have a pair of green shorts at home?
N: ROBBIE shakes his head "no".
C: FEMALE UNIFORM PERSON
D: Buy some. Tonight. Wear them tomorrow along with this shirt. You need to report to the area just south of Surf's Up. Look for a guy wearing Army pants and glasses.
E: CONT'D
C: ALEX
D: I'll show him. I'm going in that
N: Page 9 of 81 direction. (to ROBBIE with feigned excitement) You get to meet The Colonel! They walk off. As they walk off we can hear ALEX in the distance...
C: ALEX
D: Left. Left. Left right left.
E: CONT'D marching
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: Aokee's is a restaurant near Thunder Bay. It seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like. AOKEE is a large 375 pound plus apparently Hawaiian man, late twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple Hawaiian shirt, blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says KISS THE COOK. WE SEE him on a pay phone behind the counter.
C: AOKEE
D: David...how you do this to me? I have full staff with you. I save your spot. I was counting on you. Yes, yes....but The Gap? What you think you do there? Are there girls in swimming suits? Have you forgotten? Tips. Do you get tips? Cash money?
E: to person on the line listens, nods listens, shaking head listens some more
N: ALEX walks up. AOKEE waves to him. He is obviously upset.
C: AOKEE
D: Well, come see us this summer, eh? You're a good kid...a good worker. Yeah, you too.
E: CONT'D resigned
N: AOKEE hangs up the phone.
C: ALEX
D: Who....?
C: AOKEE
D: David. Seems to think there is future in retail. Now what I do? I'm one person short. Park opens tomorrow.
N: AOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter.
C: ALEX
D: You know...I just met a guy that's old
E: thinking
N: Page 10 of 81 enough to work here, but he's stuck in grounds.
C: AOKEE
D: Good guy?
E: perking up
C: ALEX
D: Seemed like our kind of people.
N: AOKEE thinks for a moment. He glances up towards Surf's Up. It hits both he and ALEX at the same time...
C: AOKEE
D: We need to get him before he get his plunger!
N: They take off running.
S: 10 EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - TRAIL FROM AOKEE'S TO SURF'S10
N: UP AOKEE and ALEX are running together. They get about 50 feet before AOKEE, large man that he is, runs out of breath. ALEX, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place, keeping loose, ready for AOKEE to catch his wind. Off they go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens.
C: AOKEE
D: Alex...... ..you got to go ahead... ...stall 'til I get there.
E: out of breath wheeze wheeze
C: ALEX
D: OK.
E: nodding, running in place
N: ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again....
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH
N: WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies. THE COLONEL is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball cap. He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard. Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the beginning of the film. EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there. He is nearest THE COLONEL Page 11 of 81
C: THE COLONEL
D: Well, it looks like we have a good staff here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be an excellent summer. Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work WE do. If we do it well, the people come back. We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which I can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records.
E: looking up from clipboard walking up and down the line
N: THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Let's see, what do we have? Hmm...yes. OK, first up is Eddie Cochran. Your grounds crew nickname will be.....Eddie!
E: CONT'D
N: EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced. Listen to him. Learn from him. Watch what he does. This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had.
E: CONT'D
N: EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle. THE COLONEL walks down the line.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds crew nickname will be....Sparky.
E: CONT'D
N: It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking. SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them. His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose. THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too. SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face. Page 12 of 81
C: SKEETER
D: Sorry, sir. Mosquito.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will be.....Skeeter.
N: THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead. Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard. THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.
E: CONT'D looking at the clipboard
N: SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing. He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out. His worst fears have been realized. His summer is passing before his eyes. There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Melinda Tally. Hmmm... your grounds crew nickname will be...
E: CONT'D thinking
N: Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this point, is somewhat out of breath.
C: ALEX
D: Hello, Colonel!
C: THE COLONEL
D: Alex, isn't it?
E: thinking, staring
C: ALEX
D: Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff you've assembled this year. Have you told them yet about your army background?
C: THE COLONEL
D: Well, no, I didn't think it was..
N: ALEX Page 13 of 81 (interrupting, to the grounds kids) The Colonel here is very modest. Did you know that he reorganized the entire process of cleaning and sanitizing an army barracks and its latrines?
C: THE COLONEL
D: Well, it really wasn't much of a...
C: ALEX
D: Wasn't much? Can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our American soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine? It's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble Army Colonel.
E: interrupting again again, to grounds kids
C: THE COLONEL
D: Well, I suppose when you put it that way...
C: ALEX
D: I, too, came up through the ranks when at age 14, I began my service here at Water World learning from this great man.
E: to the grounds kids
C: THE COLONEL
D: Yes....I remember now.....what was your grounds nickname...?
C: ALEX
D: Not even sure I remember it myself, sir. But I remember much more. Did you tell them about the film?
C: THE COLONEL
D: Film?
C: ALEX
D: "Hygiene Makes You Happy" Every enlisted man in the army has seen it. Some by choice. All from the mind of The Colonel here...
E: to THE COLONEL to the grounds kids
C: THE COLONEL
D: I never forget a grounds nickname....
E: to himself
N: AOKEE has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again. THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Page 14 of 81 (concerned) Aokee, good God, man...are you OK? AOKEE gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks.
C: AOKEE
D: Colonel....terrible mistake...
N: ALEX gets behind AOKEE, deciding he needs some help, feeding him words.
C: ALEX
D: Bureaucratic bumble...
E: quietly behind AOKEE
C: AOKEE
D: Bureaucratic bumble....
C: ALEX
D: Lost paperwork....
C: AOKEE
D: Lost paperwork....
C: ALEX
D: An error in the front office...
C: AOKEE
D: Error in front office....
C: ALEX
D: Spiced applesauce....
C: AOKEE
D: Spiced...
N: AOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and shrugs.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Good God, man, what are you trying to say?
N: ALEX comes around from behind AOKEE.
C: ALEX
D: It's Robbie sir. He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Zirpollo? Well this is highly irregular...
E: looking at clipboard
N: He is flipping though the papers, confused.
C: ALEX
E: can't pass this up
N: Page 15 of 81 Most annoying....
C: THE COLONEL
D: Most annoying....
C: ALEX
D: Never happened before....
C: THE COLONEL
D: Never happened before....
C: ALEX
D: Spaghetti marinara...
C: THE COLONEL
D: Spa....what? Well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go...
E: exasperated
N: ROBBIE has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go.
C: ROBBIE
D: I was confused myself, sir. I had heard I was working for some Hawaiian guy.
E: to THE COLONEL
C: AOKEE
D: I promise, we go straight to personnel, straighten the whole thing out. You won't need to worry.
E: reassuring
C: THE COLONEL
D: Very well. We'll just have to make-do.
N: THE COLONEL goes back to the girl MELINDA he was about to nickname before the interruption, but is staring after ALEX, AOKEE and ROBBIE as they walk off. He looks at MELINDA. He looks back at ALEX & company. It hits him.
C: THE COLONEL
D: Snafu.
E: CONT'D remembering
C: MELINDA
D: Sir?
C: THE COLONEL
D: His grounds crew nickname. I remember it now. Snafu.
S: EXT -DAY - HILL AREA ABOVE THUNDER BAY
N: The entire staff of Water World is assembled for a pre opening pep talk from owner BIG MIKE MAXWELL. He wears a Water World Golf shirt, shorts and a crew-style marine hat. Standing next to him is RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard. The workers are sitting on the hill. Page 16 of 81 AOKEE, THE COLONEL and other "management" types are standing off to the side. TIFFANY and her friends are sitting up front. ALEX and ROBBIE are sitting together towards the back, and ROBBIE's grounds t-shirt is no longer in his hand, but has been replaced by a folded AOKEE'S blue Hawaiian shirt. There is a lot of noise from everyone talking.
C: BIG MIKE
D: Okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a minute. For those who don't know me, my name is Michael Maxwell, and I...sort of run things around here.
E: motioning to get everyone to settle down they do, and he looks down at his clipboard
N: A chant starts up, with affection...
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: Big Mike! Big Mike! Big Mike!
N: BIG MIKE smiles, this has happened before, probably a tradition.
C: BIG MIKE
D: Okay, yeah thanks. Now, I want go over a few basic things. First of all, make sure you've all filled out your paperwork with personnel, cause nobody gets paid unless they do. Come to think of it, I suppose it's better for me that you don't fill out your paperwork, then I don't have to pay you. I'll make it optional. If you want to get paid, fill out your paperwork. Let's remember, the people who come here are our guests, and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here. Let's work together to keep the park clean and safe, and we'll have a great summer together. Now with a few words is our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson.
E: again motioning to settle down looking at clipboard
N: Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which ALEX starts.
C: SMALLER GROUP
D: Big Dick! Big Dick Big Dick!
C: RICHARD
D: (wincing some, but not
N: Page 17 of 81 surprised, motioning to settle down) Yeah, yeah, very funny, we're all very amused. Okay, many of you have been in training for some time, and some of you still have a ways to go... WE SEE a quick shot of some geeky younger guards wearing water wings, sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking less than confident...
C: RICHARD
D: ...a long ways to go...
E: CONT'D glancing at the water wing group wistfully, almost to himself
N: He looks down at his clipboard.
C: RICHARD
D: ...but I'd like to take a moment to speak, mostly to the guards, but certainly everyone has a role in this. We can take everything we've learned and distill it down to two simple rules. Rule number one:
E: CONT'D
N: He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, but building into a near rage for effect to impress on everyone...
C: RICHARD
D: Don't drown!
E: CONT'D loudly, emphatically, angry at the thought that anybody might...
N: He stops, composing himself.
C: RICHARD
D: Rule number two:
E: CONT'D almost quietly
N: Again, thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that this could happen...
C: RICHARD
D: Don't let anyone else drown!
E: CONT'D loudly, emphatically
N: He stops again, and regains his composure.
C: RICHARD
D: Thank you. Have a great summer!
E: CONT'D almost quietly to the stunned crowd
N: There is stunned silence for a moment. They're not sure how to react. ALEX Page 18 of 81 (breaking the silence) Alright! Whoo whoo! ALEX, then everyone begins applauding. ROBBIE looks at ALEX quizzically, ALEX just shrugs. The meeting breaks up.
S: INT - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: Everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day. ROBBIE, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting pineapple. AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking chicken on the grill. ALEX walks in.
C: ALEX
D: Hey, hey lookin' good. Blue is your color. Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh?
E: to ROBBIE
C: AOKEE
D: Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening day!
E: unhappy, stressed
N: ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE, almost spilling it.
C: AOKEE
D: You two start setting tables.
E: CONT'D to ROBBIE and ALEX
N: ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor. At that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground. RAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter. He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly. AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly.
C: AOKEE
D: Alex. Come here a minute.
E: CONT'D to ALEX, gesturing
N: ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk.
C: AOKEE
D: Alex, look. We falling apart. I made you assistant manager this year. Go assistant manage.
E: CONT'D with intensity
N: ALEX Page 19 of 81 (agreeing) No problem. ALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system, and puts it in the CD player, stopping the standard pastoral Hawaiian music that has been playing. He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip.
C: ALEX
D: Sorry, Sarah, but I need to borrow this.
E: CONT'D
C: SARAH
D: Hey! How did you know I wear shorts under that?
E: surprised
C: ALEX
D: Oh, Puh-leeaase.
E: mock surprise, rolling his eyes
N: ALEX walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working.
C: ALEX
D: Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
E: CONT'D to all
N: Everyone stops and looks at ALEX.
C: ALEX
D: In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. And what will they be looking for?
E: CONT'D as if directing a choir
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: The best teriyaki east of the pacific!!!
E: except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better
C: ALEX
D: Annnnnnd?
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: The finest smoothies in the state!!!
E: Again except ROBBIE, who doesn't know any better
C: ALEX
D: Now, everyone's a little tense, except me, of course. So to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax, we need
N: Page 20 of 81 the right soundtrack. (to AOKEE) Maestro? AOKEE hits the play button on the CD player.
C: ALEX
D: This is little tune I like to call the Paradise Slide. One, two, a one two three.
E: CONT'D mouthing with the song as it starts
N: The music starts and ALEX, now wearing SARAH's grass skirt, launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian style. EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the music. AOKEE is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging kitchen tools. RAMON has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga-drum style. ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancing and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables. SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions to the beat.
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho.
E: on the chorus
N: AOKEE has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes out from behind the counter, dancing. The others form a CONGA LINE behind him.
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho.
E: CONT'D on the chorus
N: As they go by the tables they put on any missing items. They get into it more and more, AOKEE especially, swinging his huge, 375 pound guy hips.
C: EVERYONE TOGETHER
D: Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho. Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho.
E: CONT'D on the chorus
N: As the song ends (abruptly), AOKEE bumps a surfboard (part of the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and another one to the ground. Page 21 of 81 There is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at AOKEE, waiting to see if he gets mad. AOKEE looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like "I didn't know my hips were that big...." Everyone claps, laughing. AOKEE takes a bow.
S: INT -LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: ROBBIE and ALEX are carrying bus tubs loaded with dirty dishes back toward the kitchen from the dining area. AOKEE is sipping on a smoothie and leaning back on a counter. There are only a few customers in the eating area. They set the tubs down on a counter that passes to the back area. An unseen person takes them into the dishwashing area.
C: AOKEE
D: You did good work today. Here. I made you some of my special Power Smoothies. More customers later wanting dinner before park closes. I can't have you falling asleep on me.
E: to ALEX and ROBBIE
C: AOKEE
D: Alex, we are completely out of table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots. Take Robbie and go find some. I think some at the first-aid station near Surf's Up pool.
E: CONT'D to ALEX
C: ALEX
D: Right. See you in a little while.
E: nodding knowingly
N: They walk off carrying their smoothies.
S: EXT - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY CONCESSIONS AREA
N: ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past Thunder Bay concessions area toward THE WAVE carrying and drinking their smoothies.
C: ROBBIE
D: So that was a typical lunch crowd?
C: ALEX
D: Well, it's early in the season yet. We'll get busier.
C: ROBBIE
D: Busier?
E: incredulous
C: ALEX
D: Don't worry. You'll get used to it. And tips were good, right?
E: laughing
N: Page 22 of 81
C: ROBBIE
D: There's nothing like cash money in your pocket. What's that over there?
N: They are coming up on THE WAVE area.
C: ALEX
D: Oh, you'll find this ride interesting.
S: EXT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY - THE WAVE AREA
N: The walk up to THE WAVE attraction, where kids are surfing in a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water. Surf music plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks. Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly. We also see SKEETER and SNITCH, the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier. They are cleaning up around the exit area of THE WAVE.
C: ALEX
D: It's a lot harder than it looks.
E: as a rider falls
C: ROBBIE
D: I can't imagine it's that difficult. ...no rudder on the board...
E: to himself
C: ALEX
D: Now this is a place of many wonders. See those guys in line over there?
N: WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other.
C: ALEX
D: We call them "Wave Bums". They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. Some of them get pretty good.
E: CONT'D
N: Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up.
C: ALEX
D: That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. Don't get too close to them.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: No?
C: ALEX
D: Contact high.
E: sniffing
N: ROBBIE nods, understanding. ALEX points back to THE WAVE. Page 23 of 81
C: ALEX
D: And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features.
E: CONT'D
N: WE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride.
C: ALEX
D: We call them "Wave Babes". And there's a special secret to this ride.
E: CONT'D
N: With that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens, wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking off in a different direction.
C: ALEX
D: Hey, Bob....can I borrow your radio a minute?
E: CONT'D
C: BOB
D: Sure.
N: He hands him the radio, and ALEX is back with ROBBIE.
C: ALEX
D: Hey Frank, it's Alex.
E: into radio
N: ALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back.
C: FRANK VO
D: Yo, Alex.
E: heard through the radio
C: ALEX
D: Listen you have a possible code 4. Means a "hottie".
E: into radio to ROBBIE
C: ALEX
D: She's up next. A free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit.
E: CONT'D to radio
C: FRANK VO
D: You got it bud. But two smoothies. "Volcanos".
E: heard through radio
C: ALEX
D: He knows my weak spot. Two Volcanos and a chicken sandwich.
E: to ROBBIE to radio
C: FRANK VO
D: Time to go to ludicrous speed!
E: heard through radio
N: Page 24 of 81 WE SEE FRANK push forward on a handle next to him that seems to resemble the throttle on a speedboat. The ambient noise from the wave is noticeably higher. The WAVE BABE jumps into the water with the board. SKEETER and SNITCH are still cleaning near the exit.
C: ALEX
D: Watch, and wait....
E: to ROBBIE, still holding the radio
N: THEY LOOK intently at the WAVE BABE, who is pretty good, even with the increased water flow. But, after a few deft moves, she falls. ALEX looks, and sees what he is looking for. ROBBIE smiles.
C: ALEX
D: Yesss!
E: CONT'D
N: We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our view. We then see a medium shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view. SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE walking away.
C: SKEETER
D: Excuse me... Miss? Hello...excuse me...?
E: unaffected louder
N: Finally she turns. We see her, but just a flash of her from the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled by this grounds kid.
C: SKEETER
D: Is this yours?
E: CONT'D holding up the bottom to her swimsuit
N: She looks down behind the board and reacts. She bites her lower lip, winces and nods yes. SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby. SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face. No reaction. He's never seen a naked girl before. We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.
C: ROBBIE
D: You were right. I was interested in
E: looking at ALEX
N: Page 25 of 81 this.
C: ALEX
D: Well, sometime bring your swimsuit. We'll come back on break. I'll show you how to do it. Surf's is this way. And keep an eye out for Frank over there. We owe him.
N: ROBBIE nods in agreement, and they walk off.
S: EXT MOMENTS LATER - DAY - NEAR SURF'S UP POOL
N: ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past the SURF'S UP wave pool.
C: ALEX
D: The First Aid station is over there. Just ask the guard. I just want to say hello to this girl I know.
E: pointing
C: ROBBIE
D: OK.
N: ROBBIE walks over to the First Aid Station. DOUG FITZGERALD, the guy we heard in line on the first day is there, he's a guard.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hey. I've been sent to find some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.
E: CONT'D
C: DOUG
D: Oh, you must be the new guy at Aokee's.
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah, how'd you know?
C: DOUG
D: Lucky guess. Saw some at the top of River Country. Just ask one of the guards over there.
C: ROBBIE
D: Thanks.
C: DOUG
D: And hey...tell that wienie Alex he still owes me twenty bucks!
C: ROBBIE
D: Got it.
E: looking back and waving as he walks away
S: EXT - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
N: ALEX and ROBBIE are walking to RIVER COUNTRY and walk past JAFFA in the CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK. Page 26 of 81
C: JAFFA
D: Alex!
E: calling out
N: They turn and walk over.
C: ALEX
D: Jama...I mean...Jaffa the Jamaican...what shakes, it mon?
C: JAFFA
D: Jus' the same old this's and that's, mon.
C: ALEX
D: Jaffa, meet Robbie Zirpollo. Jaffa plays the tunes and talks the talk.
E: to ROBBIE
N: The PHONE RINGS, and Jaffa turns to answer.
C: JAFFA
D: What? No way. (hangs up phone, to ALEX &
E: into phone
C: ROBBIE)
D: Check it out...
N: JAFFA smiles and picks up a radio.
C: JAFFA
D: Attention Lost River guards. We have a report that some huge fat bald guy has abandoned his swimsuit and is slidin' down Lost River with nothin' on but a smile. Be watchin' for a great white whale now.
E: CONT'D into radio
S: EXT - DAY - TOP OF LOST RIVER RIDE
N: WE SEE two female life guards, both with a surprised look on their faces. One has just reached into the water and picks it up to display a HUGE pair of swim trunks. Both girls make an Eeeew face.
S: EXT - DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
C: JAFFA
D: Attention please. Will Mr. John Big Bootay report to Lost River Splashdown. John Big-Bootay to Lost River Splashdown.
E: on PA system now, into mike
C: ALEX
D: He's calling for security.
E: to ROBBIE
N: ALEX wanders off a moment, looking at something going on in the distance. Page 27 of 81
C: ROBBIE
D: Wow. Jamaica. I thought I was far from home.
E: to JAFFA
C: JAFFA
D: I'll let you in on a little secret. Perception is everything...now, Jamal from Aurora, he's probably over with those guys...
E: dropping the accent a bit
N: WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room, looking suspiciously around.
C: JAFFA
D: ...cleaning the rest rooms. But Jaffa from Jamaica, he's in customer service, wearin' the nice shirt and playing the music. Perception and atmosphere. You get it?
E: CONT'D back to the accent
N: ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with ALEX.
S: INT - MOMENTS LATER - IN MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM
N: SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the stall door. SKEETER climbs up on top of the stall. SNITCH is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end of the fishing line, and ties it to the fill end of the balloon. He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to SKEETER, who places it strategically on the beam above the toilet. SKEETER then jumps down, and they head for the door. Eddie Enters. We see EDDIE cautiously checking out the restroom. He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line. He smiles and shakes his head, and heads for the door.
S: EXT -MOMENTS LATER - APPROACHING MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM
N: EDDIE is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the MEN's RESTROOM. He stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. We see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one.
S: EXT - MOMENTS LATER - IN FRONT OF MEN'S CHANGING/REST ROOM
N: SKEETER pops his head out and looks around. He sees Eddie in the distance about 5 minutes away, and putting a plastic liner in a trash can. He nods and disappears into the men's room. SKEETER and SNITCH appear at the door, look out, and see EDDIE finishing his card trick. He presents a card for the Page 28 of 81 girls to see, and the both nod encouragingly, but as they walk off, they look at each other and shrug. SKEETER and SNITCH take off, barely containing their laughter. But EDDIE notices them leaving. All of this has happened under the watchful though distant eye of ALEX. EDDIE goes into the restroom. EDDIE exits the restroom and goes to his cart. At this point ALEX and ROBBIE walk up to him.
C: ALEX
D: Hey Eddie. What have you got?
C: EDDIE
D: Water balloon.
N: EDDIE reached onto his cart and pulls out a pair of scissors, eyeing them.
C: ALEX
D: You got this?
C: EDDIE
D: Yeah. Rookies!
N: ALEX and ROBBIE walk away as EDDIE places a "RESTROOM CLOSED" sandwich board in front of the door. Just then BIG MIKE rushes up.
C: BIG MIKE
D: Oh Eddie. Listen, I know you're working but you hold on for just a minute. I've been so busy, and I really gotta go.
E: big hurry-potty emergency
N: EDDIE motions and tries to find the words....
C: EDDIE
D: But....no....
N: But BIG MIKE is already in. Eddies waits for it, wincing, and there is a loud splash...
C: BIG MIKE
D: Yeahhhah that's cold!
E: O.S. echoing through the door
N: EDDIE just shrugs and puts away his scissors.
S: EXT -MOMENTS LATER - TOP OF RIVER COUNTRY
N: Two young women guards, KATIE and AMY are loading kids into tubes and pushing them onto the slide. AMY is a little older than KATIE.
C: AMY
D: ...so then he just disappeared. I had to call my Dad to come pick me up.
N: Page 29 of 81 KATIE just shakes her head in amazement. ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to them. AMY is out of earshot, loading a kid. ALEX hangs back a bit.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hi. We're looking for some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots.
E: to KATIE
C: KATIE
D: What? Amy, this guy is looking for a table stretcher?
C: AMY
D: Aokee's huh?
E: coming over
C: ROBBIE
D: Uh, yes...
E: surprised
C: AMY
D: They're all down at Big Mike's last I saw. When you gonna tell him?
E: to ROBBIE, seeing ALEX in the background to ALEX
C: ALEX
D: Hi, Amy. Who's this?
C: AMY
D: Katie, this is Alex and...
C: ROBBIE
D: Robbie. Ummm, Rob Zirpollo.
E: taken with KATIE
C: AMY
D: Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they are.
C: ROBBIE
D: Thanks.
N: ALEX and ROBBIE walk off.
C: AMY
D: What a couple of losers.
C: KATIE
D: I don't know...I thought Robbie was kind of cute...
C: AMY
D: Listen, you're new, so let me tell you how things are. First those guys were wearing blue shorts. That means
N: Page 30 of 81 concessions. (uses her fingers to explain) The Water World social structure is organized on three levels. At the bottom are the Trash Rats.
C: KATIE
D: Trash rats?
C: AMY
D: Bottom feeders. Grounds kids. Babies. They clean the toilets and empty the trash. Most are only 14 years old. It's the only job younger kids can do here. Next up is concessions. They're our "middle class". We don't hang with them and they don't much hang with us. At the top of heap are the guards. You are a guard. Girl, if you want to go out with someone, stick with your own kind.
C: KATIE
D: Aw, that's just silly. I think he's cute.
E: looking off at ROBBIE and ALEX walking away
S: EXT -DAY BOTTOM OF RIVER COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO BIG MIKE'S
N: This in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube down the River Country slides. ROBBIE and ALEX are walking past the splashdown area.
C: ROBBIE
D: What did that girl Amy mean?
C: ALEX
D: About what?
C: ROBBIE
D: When she said, when are you going to tell him?
C: ALEX
D: I'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's.
N: ROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame. SUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out. Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH style towards the scene. Page 31 of 81 Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool. One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl. At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops. WE SEE his face in close-up as he says.
C: RESCUE GUARD
D: Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp!
E: slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl
N: The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool.
S: EXT - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S
N: ALEX is standing outside of BIG MIKE's. ROBBIE is walking out of the restaurant.
C: ROBBIE
D: Aokee's not going to be happy. Nobody seems to know where these things are...
E: Shaking his head
C: ALEX
D: Yep.
E: smiling now laughing
C: ROBBIE
D: What?
C: ALEX
D: There's no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.
C: ROBBIE
D: What a dirty trick.
C: ALEX
D: It's just Aokee's way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there. Consider it a rookie initiation.
E: smiling
C: ROBBIE
D: Humph.
E: still mad
C: ALEX
D: Time to make it up to you. Come on.
S: EXT. DAY - BACK OF BIG MIKE'S
N: Page 32 of 81 ALEX knocks loudly on the door. A teenage boy, DAVE in a BIG MIKE's uniform answers.
C: DAVE
D: Alex!
C: ALEX
D: Hey Davey...how 'bout two for two?
C: DAVE
D: Malts?
C: ALEX
D: Chocolate.
E: looks at ROBBIE ROBBIE nods
N: DAVE disappears for moment.
C: ALEX
D: Now, if he ever shows up at our back door, we owe him chicken and smoothies.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: But...don't we get an employee discount? Shouldn't we go in the front?
C: ALEX
D: Well...the discount is larger this way.
N: ROBBIE is getting out money from his pocket, counting through it. DAVE shows up with two burgers and two malts, and hands them to ALEX, disappears and shuts the door quickly. ROBBIE is still staring at his money.
C: ALEX
D: Come on...let's go eat!
E: CONT'D
N: They walk out of frame.
S: INT -DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK
N: ALEX and ROBBIE are cleaning tables after another busy lunch. WE SEE that AOKEE is filling up a bucket, and getting a scrub brush, and heads out the doorway.
C: ALEX
D: Oh boy. Here we go.
C: ROBBIE
D: What now?
C: ALEX
D: Aokee. The pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal. Come on.
N: They exit out the same doorway as AOKEE. Page 33 of 81
S: EXT - DAY - AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK
N: AOKEE is busily cleaning and cursing the pigeons.
C: AOKEE
D: Stupid Pigeons. They should all die!
E: speaking Hawaiian
C: ALEX
D: Happens every week.
E: to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: What is this thing for anyway?
E: to AOKEE
C: AOKEE
D: Someday, Robbie. Someday.
N: He keeps cleaning.
C: ALEX
D: That stand is to display the coveted Surfer King trophy. Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics.
E: to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: And what would this concessions kid have to do?
C: ALEX
D: Nothing, really. Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. No big deal.
C: ROBBIE
D: Has it ever happened?
C: ALEX
D: A guard always wins the surf competition. Know why?
C: TOGETHER
D: Because concessions kids can't swim!
E: ROBBIE and ALEX
C: AOKEE
D: Someday.
E: still cleaning
N: They go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK.
S: INT MOMENTS LATER -DAY- AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK
N: ROBBIE is now behind the counter making smoothies. He puts Page 34 of 81 them up and the two kids waiting take them and walk away. In walk AMY and KATIE.
C: KATIE
D: Hi there.
E: to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: Hello. On break?
E: blinking, smiling
C: KATIE
D: Yeah. Two Blue Crushes please.
C: ROBBIE
D: Coming up.
N: He shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups. He then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple.
C: AMY
D: Oooh. Umbrellas. I've never gotten umbrellas before.
C: ROBBIE
D: These are only for VIP guests.
N: AMY looks over to KATIE and rolls her eyes. ALEX arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction.
C: ALEX
D: Amy. Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-B?
C: AMY
D: I don't think so.
E: shaking her head
N: As he leads her back into the kitchen...
C: ALEX
D: It's incredible. It washes 2000 plates an hour....
C: KATIE
D: So... you're not from around here, huh?
E: to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: California. I just moved here at the beginning of the summer.
C: KATIE
D: I'll bet California's nice. I've never been west of the mountains.
N: Page 35 of 81
C: ROBBIE
D: You'd love the ocean. And the sunsets are incredible. You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean... Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean.
E: daydreaming a bit
C: KATIE
D: No. I'm surprised you're not a guard, coming from the ocean and all.
E: pause
C: ROBBIE
D: Let's just say I missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate. I was very nearly a trash rat.
C: KATIE
D: Oh. Good save.
E: frowns
N: ALEX has distracted AMY all he could and they return from the kitchen.
C: AMY
D: Well. That was exciting. Maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill. Come on, Katie.
N: They leave.
C: ALEX
D: Well...how'd you do?
E: to ROBBIE, interested
C: ROBBIE
D: Mmmm. I told her how beautiful the California sunsets are.
E: thinking
C: ALEX
D: Good job. You work fast. Hey it's time for our break. Bring your swimsuit?
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah. The Wave?
C: ALEX
D: The Wave. I love that water.
N: ROBBIE looks confused.
C: ALEX
D: Can't swim. It's only three inches deep.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: Ah ha! Let's go.
E: grabbing his suit and a towel
N: Page 36 of 81
S: EXT -MOMENTS LATER - THE WAVE AREA
N: ROBBIE and ALEX have their swimsuits on, and are in line to get on THE WAVE. ALEX is coaching ROBBIE.
C: ALEX
D: Now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. When you wipe out, your ride is done.
N: ALEX is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. He is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to the line to watch ROBBIE.
C: ALEX
D: Just ease into it.
E: CONT'D shouting
N: ROBBIE takes the board and looks around. He jumps full force onto the wave. It takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up.
C: ALEX
D: Gees. Where did you learn to do that?
E: CONT'D meeting him at the exit
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm from Oceanside, California. I was born on a surfboard.
N: They start walking back. They stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay. Just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do.
C: ALEX
D: Think you could ride that?
C: ROBBIE
D: In my sleep.
E: looking right into ALEX's eyes
N: ALEX just smiles.
S: INT - LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: AOKEE is cleaning up behind the counter. ALEX is grinning like the cat that ate the canary.
C: AOKEE
D: What you so happy about?
N: ALEX Page 37 of 81 (shaking his head) You're not gonna believe it...
C: AOKEE
D: Listen. Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. Today I believe anything.
C: ALEX
D: I took Robbie to The Wave today.
C: AOKEE
D: What? He drown?
E: looking around
C: ALEX
D: No. It turns out that he's from Oceanside. California. You know, where they always hold those surf competitions?
C: AOKEE
D: Yeah. So?
C: ALEX
D: It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. As a Sophomore.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie. Robbie barely walk without help.
E: laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious
C: ALEX
D: I saw it myself. You wouldn't believe it.
N: We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen. AOKEE winces and gestures toward the kitchen.
C: AOKEE
D: I don' believe it. Our Robbie?
C: ALEX
D: Our Robbie.
C: AOKEE
D: If this true....this could be da year.
E: thinking
C: ALEX
D: That's what I was thinking.
C: AOKEE
D: Well, go get him. We need to make ready. He not just walk in and win this thing.
C: ALEX
D: You heard it. He's in the kitchen...
N: Page 38 of 81 ALEX goes into the back. AOKEE sits at a table. Robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie, sit down. Alex, make up a Volcano. This boy in training.
C: ROBBIE
D: What did I spill now?
E: sitting down, worried
N: WE HEAR the whine of a blender as ALEX is working on the Volcano Smoothie.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. This true?
C: ROBBIE
D: I dunno. Yeah, surfing is usually how I spend my summers.
C: AOKEE
D: You know about Employee Olympics?
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah. Some kind of trophy.
C: AOKEE
D: Surfer King trophy. Very big. Very nice. Concessions never win.
E: looking down
N: ALEX arrives with the Volcano Smoothie. He turns a chair around and sits. They will gang up on him.
C: ROBBIE
D: I dunno...seems kind of silly to me.
C: ALEX
D: It's a big deal. Every girl wants to date you. Every guy wants to BE you. Special privileges...we all wear standard uniforms. The Surfer King gets to be creative. You ever see the cowboy hat Cowboy wears?
C: ROBBIE
D: It shouldn't be that hard...how good could this Cowboy be?
C: AOKEE
D: He very good. His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks. Good surfer. If you do this, you need to see Pipeman.
N: ROBBIE Page 39 of 81 Pipeman?
C: ALEX
D: He's a myth.
C: AOKEE
D: Oh, no. Pipeman very real. Works here in park. Low profile. You must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the Thunder Bay wave. This not the ocean, surf boy.
C: ALEX
D: Pipeman. The Banzai Pipeline. I get it. Some kind of legendary surf champ. Where do we find him?
E: thinking
C: AOKEE
D: I only see him once, maybe twice. Stay behind scenes. But here he is and find him you must. So. You do this?
E: to ROBBIE
N: Robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: WE SEE quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on AOKEE'S wall. The shot widens to reveal AOKEE is dumping quarters and ROBBIE is holding the phone. He puts it up to his ear.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hello, Grandma? No, I'm fine. Listen, Grandma...I need you to send me a few of my things...
E: into phone
N: AOKEE and ALEX are huddled around smiling.
S: INT - DAY - BIG MIKE'S OFFICE
N: BIG MIKE is standing, walking around as he speaks, TIFFANY is sitting. Clearly she is being scolded.
C: BIG MIKE
D: ....why you wouldn't believe the things I've heard. Just stupid things. Cutting in line. Demanding special treatment. Oh, and how about this one: Princesses don't carry trash. I've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here. Maybe I was right.
E: angry mimicking her back to his voice
N: Page 40 of 81
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, daddy. You know how jealous people get.
E: trying to dance out of it
C: BIG MIKE
D: I'd almost believe that. But I was behind the First Aid station when you said the "princess" line. This park exists because the kids here work hard. They need to be treated fairly. They need to see you are just another lifeguard.
C: TIFFANY
D: But I'm not just another lifeguard.
E: protesting
C: BIG MIKE
D: You won't even be that if this continues. If you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours, I need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude.
E: mad again
C: TIFFANY
D: All right. What do you expect me to do?
C: BIG MIKE
D: For one thing, start mingling with "the commoners". You'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are. Make some friends outside that little group of yours. It's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table. Show some gratitude.
C: TIFFANY
D: Fine. I'll work it.
E: thinking a moment
C: BIG MIKE
D: Good. Work on it. Please?
E: softening, but firm
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, Daddy. Don't worry about a thing.
E: nodding, but we don't believe her
S: EXT MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - TIME SHACK
N: ROBBIE and ALEX hook up and grab their time cards. There is a banner hanging that says, "Employee Luau Tonight", and SKEETER and SNITCH have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something. SKEETER is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand. SNITCH hands up the hand-lettered magic marker addition, which Page 41 of 81 SKEETER staples on to the bottom of the banner while SNITCH keeps a lookout. The addition says, "COME GET LEI'D". They scamper off, laughing.
C: ALEX
D: This will be good. Aokee throws a great Luau.
E: looking up at the sign
C: ROBBIE
D: I don't how much fun it will be. With Aokee hosting, we'll be working.
C: ALEX
D: There'll still be time for fun. Most of the work is setting up. Besides, we get paid, too. When was the last time you got paid to party?
N: With that, ALEX punches in, as if to punctuate the line.
S: EXT - NIGHT - OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: It is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, TIKI lights around AOKEE's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music. Buffet tables line the area, and there is SMOOTHIE BAR set up. BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while RICHARD is playing bass in the band. AOKEE is running around making sure all the buffet items are full. Everyone is wearing Leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except AOKEE and his staff, who have real ones flown in from Hawaii.
C: AOKEE
D: OK. You work hard, and we fine now. Your time to party. Here they are. Special Love Smoothies. Be careful!
E: pouring out four smoothies to ROBBIE and ALEX
C: ALEX
D: These never fail.
E: to ROBBIE
N: ALEX picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter. He and Robbie walk over to AMY and KATIE who are standing over near the buffet.
C: ALEX
D: Now this will never do.
E: CONT'D to ROBBIE, but if front of AMY and Katie
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm afraid you're right. Something must
E: agreeing
N: Page 42 of 81 be done. ALEX and ROBBIE set the smoothies on a nearby table. They remove the cheap plastic Leis the girls are wearing. Then they put on the real ones they carried over. ALEX steps back to admire his work.
C: ALEX
D: Oh, yes, yes....
C: ROBBIE
D: Perfect. A work of art.
N: The girls look at each other and smile. ALEX and ROBBIE grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. AMY sips hers right away.
C: AMY
D: I don't remember anything like this on Aokee's menu.
C: ROBBIE
D: They're..
C: ALEX
D: ..special smoothies. Fortunately, you know people on the inside.
E: interrupting
N: Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. Now JAFFA steps up to the mike.
C: JAFFA
D: We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's Luau.
N: Everyone applauds, AOKEE waves. Alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and KATIE clap as well.
C: JAFFA
D: We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing one of his Hawaiian specialties.
E: CONT'D
N: Again, everyone claps and cheers him on. AOKEE goes on stage.
C: ALEX
D: You girls want to dance?
C: KATIE
D: Sure.
E: grabbing ROBBIE's hand and leading out to the dance floor
N: AMY shrugs yes and goes out with ALEX.
C: AOKEE
E: onstage
N: Page 43 of 81 Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. Is called E O'Mai, or, You Are Mine. AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai". Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror. EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them. EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle. We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.
C: KATIE
D: So. How are things working out at Aokee's?
C: ROBBIE
D: Oh, he's great. Alex too. I thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.
C: KATIE
D: Well, of course this isn't California...
C: ROBBIE
D: No, but it looks like I will get a chance to do some surfing anyway.
C: KATIE
D: Really.
C: ROBBIE
D: Apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and Aokee is all over me to enter.
C: KATIE
D: You mean the Surfer King?
C: ROBBIE
D: You've heard of it?
C: KATIE
D: It's all the other girls seem to talk about. This is my first year, but
N: Page 44 of 81 apparently it's a pretty big deal. Being from Oceanside, you should have a good chance.
C: ROBBIE
D: We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to me. A surfing contest in Colorado.
N: (laughing) My friends back home would never believe it. They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music. She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all the while glaring at her father. EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on HER shoulder. BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into him.
C: DOUG
D: Alex. Got my twenty bucks?
E: to ALEX
C: ALEX
D: Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet over in my locker. I'll see you before we leave and get it to you then.
C: DOUG
D: Yeah, sure.
C: ALEX
D: You know, you could always come by Aokee's and I could give it to you in trade.
C: DOUG
D: Cash money, Alex. Cash money.
C: ALEX
D: No problem.
N: ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from DOUG. Page 45 of 81 The song ends, and everybody claps. AOKEE bows.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hey, listen. Alex told me about this great spot on the other side of Thunder Bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet. Want to go for a walk?
E: to KATIE
C: KATIE
D: Sure.
N: They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night.
S: EXT MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - NORTH EDGE OF THUNDER BAY
N: ROBBIE is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area, tightrope style. KATIE walks next to him.
C: KATIE
D: So...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern California and move to Colorado?
C: ROBBIE
D: Not both my folks. Just my Mom.
C: KATIE
D: Aha...trouble in paradise?
C: ROBBIE
D: Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico. Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "Colorady is the place you outta be".
C: KATIE
D: It could be worse.
C: ROBBIE
D: Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.
E: looking down and smiling
C: KATIE
D: I have a theory. Sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. Everything shuts down for a day or so. If your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. Most people here don't just look out for themselves. A lot of times,
N: Page 46 of 81 they're looking out for you, too.
S: EXT. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
N: ALEX and AMY are inside the KIOSK. ALEX is showing her how everything works.
C: ALEX
D: All these switches feed sound throughout the park. Which reminds me.
N: He pulls out a CD and pops it into the CD Player and presses PLAY. He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword.
C: ALEX
D: And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun.
E: CONT'D
N: He begins swishing it around, AMY is giggling.
C: ALEX
D: Oops. There....almost got you.
E: CONT'D
N: AMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier.
S: EXT. NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER GRAND PAVILION
N: They have reached the area to the west of Thunder Bay. It is simply a concrete pad that overlooks the party below. We hear "Paradise is in Your Eyes" by Michael Peace, which begins with a lot of jungle sound effects.
C: KATIE
D: You were right. This is nice. But not necessarily quieter.
E: looking down at the party reacting to the jungle noises
C: ROBBIE
D: Just a sec.
N: He walks away slightly and gets on the radio.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects.
E: CONT'D
S: EXT. NIGHT - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
N: ALEX and AMY are kissing; she is up on the counter of the KIOSK.
C: ALEX
D: Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.
E: interrupting, but to AMY
N: Page 47 of 81 He grabs the radio.
C: ALEX
D: I'm on it.
E: CONT'D into the radio
N: He turns down the volume back to normal. He also flips a switch. They hear the tune now, and AMY jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles. ALEX does an over-the-top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.
S: EXT. NIGHT - GRAND PAVILION
N: ROBBIE has set down the radio, and is walking back to KATIE now, who is swaying to the music. He doesn't get too close to her, and actually stands off to her left. Since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style. ROBBIE has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively, almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner. They proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed. Finally it occurs to them both.
C: ROBBIE
D: So where did you learn to dance like this?
E: quizzically
C: KATIE
D: Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of Dance. What surprises me is you.
E: smiling
C: ROBBIE
D: Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret?
E: somewhat embarrassed, keeps dancing
C: KATIE
D: Of course.
C: ROBBIE
D: When you grow up within spitting distance of Hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next Harrison Ford. So when I was about 12, my Mom started taking me to all these auditions for things.
E: hesitantly
C: KATIE
D: So are you the next Harrison Ford?
C: ROBBIE
D: Some days I'm not even the next Robbie Zirpollo.
N: They continue to dance. After a few moments... Page 48 of 81
C: KATIE
D: ....and?
N: They stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party.
C: ROBBIE
D: Turns out I get this part. They're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything. They lock this girl and I into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial.
C: KATIE
D: Doesn't sound so terrible. You certainly learned how to dance.
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it. I couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off.
C: KATIE
D: I'm not laughing.
E: touched, drawing closer
N: They kiss, then return to dancing.
S: EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - OUTSIDE AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK
N: SHACK - SURF MUSIC BED WE SEE ALEX and ROBBIE discussing something; forming a plan. They are going to look for Pipeman. ALEX gestures in one direction, and ROBBIE takes off. ALEX goes in another.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - DAY FIRST AID SHACK NEAR
N: FUNHOUSE - SURF MUSIC BED ALEX walks up to the Guard, appears to ask a question. The guard shakes his head "no". ALEX walks off.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - GIFT SHOP - SURF MUSIC BED
N: ROBBIE is talking to a cashier in the store. She shakes her head 'no'. Robbie walks out hurriedly.
S: 45 EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK - SURF45
N: MUSIC BED ALEX is talking to Jaffa. JAFFA gestures wildly, as if telling some big mythical story, but at the end throws up his hands as if to say, "I don't know". Page 49 of 81
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SOMEWHERE AT WATER WORLD -
N: SURF MUSIC BED We are in pitch darkness. We hear the sound of heavy scraping metal. Lights shine and we are looking up through a manhole cover being removed. ROBBIE bends over the hole and hollers "PIPEMAN" and peers in. He shakes his head negatively and moves on.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BIG MIKE'S - SURF MUSIC BED
N: We are at the back door to Big Mike's. ALEX knocks, and the same kid as before, DAVE, pops his head out. ALEX appears to ask a question, DAVE goes back in as ALEX waits. DAVE comes out again and gestures, "no one knows". ALEX starts to leave, but turns back and asks something else. DAVE disappears and comes back with a burger. ALEX shrugs, and walks away unwrapping and eating the burger.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING
N: ROBBIE sees a door marked, "EMPLOYEES ONLY". He looks down at his employee ID and shrugs and goes in. As he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force. Out the open door comes "Wally" the Water World mascot, who walks off. Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head. He gets up and walks off.
S: 49 EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - BACK OF SOME BUILDING - SURF49
N: MUSIC BED Now it is ALEX who has separately come upon the same door, not knowing ROBBIE has already been there. He enters, and the door remains open. We hear girls screaming and he exits quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear, swimsuits and towels.
S: 50 INT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY PUMPHOUSE - SURF50
N: MUSIC BED This room is creepy. It is full of loud pumps and large pipes. ROBBIE is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view. Surf music
T: fades.
N: There is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him. He is working to tame a small leak.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hello?
E: quietly
N: No reaction.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hello?
E: CONT'D loudly this time
N: Page 50 of 81 This startles and kind of angers PIPEMAN.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Hey. You're not supposed to be in here.
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah, sorry. Are you Pipeman?
C: PIPEMAN
D: Not on purpose. I guess some people call me Pipeman. 'Spose it's better than Carl.
E: recovering from the startle
C: ROBBIE
D: So you're real name's Carl?
C: PIPEMAN
D: No. I just said Pipeman was a better name than Carl.
C: ROBBIE
D: Oh. Well, my name's Robbie. I work at Aokee's.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Oh. OK. What the hell you doin' down here?
C: ROBBIE
D: I need your help.
C: PIPEMAN
D: That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again? Gees, I knew we shoudda replaced...
C: ROBBIE
D: It's not the scrub sink. I need your help. I'm competing in the Employee Olympics. With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Everybody wants to be the Surfer King. What advanced surfing experience?
E: to himself to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: Well, you know. "Pipeman"? Hawaii's North Shore? Surfing the pipeline?
C: PIPEMAN
D: Ohhh. Bad news, kid. I hate to disappoint you, but this is the reason they call me Pipeman. I'm the plumber around here.
N: PIPEMAN holds up the large wrench. Page 51 of 81
C: ROBBIE
D: Oh, boy. See, I'm from California, and I can surf, I just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay. I...I was just hoping you could help, I really am sorry for bothering you.
N: ROBBIE begins walking out, dejected. PIPEMAN looks at him, and feels sorry for him.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Wait a minute, kid. I do know a little about surfing. I also know a lot about the wave here. What exactly are you looking for from me?
C: ROBBIE
D: I need a mentor; you know like in Karate Kid.
E: perking up
C: PIPEMAN
D: Karate Kid. He works at Big Mike's doesn't he?
C: ROBBIE
D: No, no it's a movie.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Never seen it. Don't know much about this mentor thing. How's it work?
C: ROBBIE
D: Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate, and then later inspire me. What religion are you?
C: PIPEMAN
D: I'm Norman.
E: proudly
C: ROBBIE
D: Ah, Brigham Young and all that.
C: PIPEMAN
D: No, no NNNNORM-AN. We follow the big fat guy on Cheers reruns.
C: ROBBIE
D: Okay...and your belief structure....
C: PIPEMAN
D: Usually involves a lot of beer and corn nuts, but I don't think that's gonna work here. Tell you what. Meet me at Thunder Bay tomorrow morning,
E: thinking
N: Page 52 of 81 eight a.m., bring your board and we'll work something out.
C: ROBBIE
D: Great, perfect. Thanks. I won't let you down. What the heck is a corn-nut?
E: happily walking away, muttering to himself
S: EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - THUNDER BAY
N: WE SEE Thunder Bay looking east. AOKEE and ALEX are setting up lawn chairs. AOKEE is lathering on suntan lotion, and puts on a large straw hat. ALEX puts sun block cream on his nose, and they both sit on the lawn chairs. They both have large smoothies. ROBBIE appears with his surfboard, and lays it up against the east fence at Thunder Bay. PIPEMAN arrives carrying a small device in a plastic ziplock bag. ROBBIE approaches PIPEMAN.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hi! Glad you could make it. What's that?
E: pointing to PIPEMAN's hand
C: PIPEMAN
D: This is how I trigger the wave.
C: ROBBIE
D: With that? A garage door clicker?
C: PIPEMAN
D: What did you think? Waves just happen? This is Colorado, kid. Now get your board and get in the water.
N: Robbie gets his board and jumps into Thunder Bay, paddling over to the narrow side where the wave begins. PIPEMAN goes down the stairs leading to near where ROBBIE has positioned himself.
C: PIPEMAN
D: You sure that's where you want to be?
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: Should be about right. Aren't you getting in? Where's your board?
C: PIPEMAN
D: Mentors don't get wet. I looked it up. Get ready.
E: pressing the clicker
N: A wave comes and ROBBIE begins paddling. He misses it, Page 53 of 81 splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again. AOKEE and ALEX look at each other nervously.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Want to know what you did wrong?
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: Just gimme another wave.
E: mad
C: PIPEMAN
D: Oakey doakey.
N: Another wave comes. ROBBIE paddles furiously and misses it again. Now he's really angry.
C: ROBBIE
D: Okay. Please. Tell me what I did wrong.
E: tersely
C: PIPEMAN
D: You're in the wrong position. The wave doesn't crest that soon. Move ten feet further away from the back wall.
C: ROBBIE
D: The ocean never had a back wall. Thank you.
E: to himself to Pipeman
N: ROBBIE paddles over to the spot suggested by PIPEMAN. AOKEE and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has a good run and kicks out at the end. AOKEE and ALEX high-five.
C: ALEX AND AOKEE
D: Yeee-haww.
E: together
N: They settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun.
S: INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK - DAY
N: AOKEE is behind the counter finishing up making a smoothie. RICHARD, head lifeguard is on the other side; he will get the smoothie.
C: RICHARD
D: So. I hear he's pretty good. Haven't seen him myself yet.
E: grinning
C: AOKEE
D: Good? Good at what? Who you mean?
E: concerned, covering
N: Page 54 of 81
C: RICHARD
D: Come on. Your ringer from California. Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a run for his money.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie? Robbie barely walk without help.
N: We hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.
C: RICHARD
D: Gees!
C: AOKEE
D: Ha!
N: AOKEE gestures back towards the kitchen.
C: AOKEE
D: Your Surfer King. We just make a good show. Your boy have nothing to worry about.
E: CONT'D
C: RICHARD
D: You know I'd feel a lot better if you hadn't taken most of my money in that poker game last Friday night.
C: AOKEE
D: Poker? Not an island game. I no good.
E: dismissive
C: RICHARD
D: Right. Tell you what. Sight unseen even money, twenty dollars on Cowboy.
E: nods
C: AOKEE
D: You want to bet with me? Take my twenty dollars, just like that? Humph. Not worth the trouble, twenty dollars. Now, maybe a hundred...
C: RICHARD
D: A hundred bucks...
N: ANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie!
E: to kitchen
C: RICHARD
D: OK, a hundred bucks.
N: They slap hands to seal the deal. RICHARD leaves, grinning and shaking his head.
C: AOKEE
E: to kitchen
N: Page 55 of 81 Robbie? That you? Come out here.
C: ROBBIE
D: Sorry, dude, that tray was way off balance.
E: entering from kitchen
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie, our secret getting out. You practice too good.
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm really getting the hang of that wave.
E: happy
C: AOKEE
D: Fall more. Make good show.
C: ROBBIE
D: I'll try to remember to look and see who's watching.
E: thinking
C: AOKEE
D: Good. Here, have a smoothie. You too skinny to surf good.
E: pours the rest of RICHARD's smoothie
N: ROBBIE smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen.
S: EXT EARLY MORNING. - THUNDER BAY
N: ROBBIE and PIPEMAN are in the middle of a practice session. PIPEMAN is at the side, ROBBIE is in the water on his board.
C: PIPEMAN
D: OK, now this time, get up on the board more quickly. This is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly. You only have a little time to show your stuff.
E: gesturing
C: ROBBIE
D: How will the judging work?
C: PIPEMAN
D: You get a possible ten points. Three for your surfing, three for your style and four for the judge's overall impression of your ride. No one's ever gotten a ten...I'm not really sure why.
C: ROBBIE
D: You've seen the competition. What does everybody do?
C: PIPEMAN
D: Everybody just surfs, man and tries not to fall. The big reason Cowboy's done so
N: Page 56 of 81 well is he goes to Hawaii for a couple weeks every year. But there he's mostly a longboarder. Your job is to figure out how to make the most outta this little wave.
C: ROBBIE
D: OK. I'm ready.
N: The wave comes and ROBBIE catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - HILL ABOVE THUNDER BAY
N: WE SEE COWBOY and TIFFANY standing overlooking Thunder Bay. COWBOY has binoculars and is looking through them.
C: COWBOY
D: He's pretty good, I'll give him that.
C: TIFFANY
D: How good?
E: concerned
C: COWBOY
D: If I have an off day, he could win.
C: TIFFANY
D: That's terrible. You're the Surfer King.
E: really concerned
C: COWBOY
D: Well, some days you get the wave, and some days the wave gets you.
C: TIFFANY
D: This can't happen. What are we gonna do?
C: COWBOY
D: I don't know what you're going to do, but as me for me, I'm gonna schedule some practice time of my own.
C: TIFFANY
D: This may take a lot more than extra practice.
C: COWBOY
D: Well, I don't know what else you expect. I'll go out and do my best. If that's not enough, it's not enough.
N: TIFFANY grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay. WE SEE gears turning in her head.
S: EXT. MORNING - THE NEXT DAY - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK
N: ROBBIE and Alex are walking by. JAFFA sees them. JAFFA Page 57 of 81 Hey, surfer boy! I got fifty bucks at three to one! Don't let me down, mon.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hey Jaffa. NO worries. People are betting on me?
E: to JAFFA to ALEX, shocked
C: ALEX
D: Just a little friendly pool. No big deal. Helps make this more interesting. Concessions never had a chance before...
C: ROBBIE
D: I've seen this Cowboy practice. His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good. I could lose you know.
N: Two concessions girls are walking by them.
C: CONCESSIONS GIRLS
D: Hi Robbie!
E: together
C: ROBBIE
D: How ya doin' See. How come everyone knows me by sight now?
E: to Alex after they have gone by
C: ALEX
D: Ah, you're the next big thing. You'll survive it. The Employee Olympics are only a week away. What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit. Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills. The next morning it all ends with the surf contest. You ready?
N: Another group of concession girls calls ROBBIE from one of the snack bars. He waves.
C: ROBBIE
D: I suppose. I've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day. It's risky...
N: Just then they both nearly run headlong into TIFFANY.
C: TIFFANY
D: Well, hello Robbie.
C: ROBBIE
D: You know me?
E: surprised
N: Page 58 of 81
C: TIFFANY
D: Of course I know you. It's my father's park, I try get to know everyone.
C: ALEX
D: I'm Alex!
E: interrupting, eager
C: TIFFANY
D: Yes, I'm sure you are. It's been a while since I've been to Aokee's. Do you suppose if I come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it?
E: ignoring ALEX, back to Robbie
C: ROBBIE
D: The best teriyaki east of the Pacific.
C: TIFFANY
D: Yes...and one those smoothies I hear so much about?
C: ROBBIE
D: Well, sure. I'll be working all afternoon.
E: stunned
C: TIFFANY
D: It's a date then. See you later!
N: She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the shoulder.
C: ALEX
D: Come on, we gotta get back.
C: ROBBIE
D: Yes. Yes we do.
E: still shocked
S: INT. DAY AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK
N: AOKEE is wiping the counter alone. HE turns toward the kitchen...
C: AOKEE
D: Alex! We need more large smoothie cups out here!
N: AOKEE continues cleaning up. ALEX shows up with a load of cups, AOKEE takes them and starts placing then.
C: AOKEE
D: Look at that.
E: CONT'D to ALEX
N: WE SEE in a far corner of AOKEE's TIFFANY and ROBBIE in an Page 59 of 81 animated, engaging conversation.
C: AOKEE
D: Second time this week. Our boy Big Man on Campus, huh?
E: CONT'D
C: ALEX
D: Big something. I hope he knows how to work without a net.
C: AOKEE
D: Well. We all grow up sometime. He not drop a tray of dishes in days. Something going right. You think he ready?
C: ALEX
D: I guess we'll both find out on Sunday. I sure hope so.
N: WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made.
S: EXT NEAR SUNSET - TIME SHACK
N: ROBBIE, ALEX, AMY and KATIE are clocking out for the day. ROBBIE clocks out first. TIFFANY drives up in her convertible.
C: TIFFANY
D: Robbie!
E: waving him over
N: ROBBIE goes over to talk to her. WE SEE him go around to the passenger side.
C: ROBBIE
D: Alex! I won't need a ride tonight after all. Tiff's taking me home!
E: shouting
N: ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at what they've seen.
C: ALEX
D: Tiff?
E: disbelief
C: AMY
D: Tiff?
E: grossed out
C: KATIE
D: Tiff.
E: forlorn, stunned
N: WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate. We see KATIE walk slowly out of the park alone. As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and Page 60 of 81 ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite". We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her back and see she is crying.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE
N: We see the rising sun behind AOKEE's head as he raises a conch shell and blows it like a horn. He is dressed like a Hawaiian prince. As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females dressed in Hawaiian native garb. ROBBIE And ALEX are among several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance.
C: AOKEE
D: Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo.
N: The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha". There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison. The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat, gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army. The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout.
C: CONCESSIONS GIRLS AND BOYS
D: Concessions! Concessions! Concessions!
N: Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50 grounds kids sitting in rows. In our foreground there are six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to them, 2 each. To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles. The lead kid shouts:
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Company! Forward, march.
N: THE DRILL team marches into full view. The grounds kids behind clap the march beat. The marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Company! Halt!
E: CONT'D
N: They do.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Present Arms!
E: CONT'D
N: Page 61 of 81 The brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Company!
E: CONT'D
C: MARCHERS
D: Yes sir.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Order arms.
N: They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: What do you do if it's wet and not yours?
E: CONT'D
C: MARCHERS
D: Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
E: in cadence
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: How do you deal with a full can of trash?
C: MARCHERS
D: We empty! We empty!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Sound off!
C: MARCHERS
D: Trash Rats!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Again!
C: MARCHERS
D: Trash Rats!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Sound off, Trash Rats.
C: MARCHERS
D: Trash rats! Trash Rats!
N: They stop. Their brooms are raised over their heads.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Company! Brooms Ho!
N: They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Company! Begin!
E: CONT'D
N: He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans. Page 62 of 81 Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo.
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: What do you do when the table's a mess?
E: CONT'D to the seated GROUNDS KIDS
C: GROUNDS KIDS
D: We wipe it! We wipe it!
E: together
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: What do you do when a toilet's stopped up?
C: GROUNDS KIDS
D: We plunge it! We plunge it!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Sound off!
C: GROUNDS KIDS
D: Trash rats!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Sound off!
C: GROUNDS KIDS
D: Trash rats!
C: LEAD MARCHER
D: Sound off trash rats!
C: GROUNDS KIDS
D: Trash rats! Trash rats!
N: They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit. All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around. Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards. Page 63 of 81 First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching. They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter. Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On the backboard is also the surfer king trophy. They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators. The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay. COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout.
C: LIFEGUARDS
D: Lifeguards! Lifeguards! Lifeguards!
E: together
N: The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone.. COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully. We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE OLYMPIANS". COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks.
C: COWBOY
D: Let the games...begin!
E: to all
N: The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE near them, smiling broadly.
S: EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE
N: We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear. There are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about. Page 64 of 81 We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three legged race. The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom. A JUDGE triggers a starter pistol and they are off. The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out. The two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance. The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash. Concessions has figured out the dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids. Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third. The judges note the finish on their clipboards.
S: EXT. LATER THAT DAY - THUNDER BAY
N: We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit (concessions) and one green suit (grounds) A JUDGE on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air horn to start the race. They all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously. The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far. As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing. As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass him he stops, as he is tired out. Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes.
S: EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH SIDE
N: There are three lines set up with several participants. It is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds. The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead. Page 65 of 81 Everyone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop. There is a small table on which the drinks must be placed. She is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops. All concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on. She does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled. The JUDGES scribble furiously.
S: EXT. LATER THAT DAY - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: Three picnic tables are set up in front of AOKEE's. WE dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four. Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids. A JUDGE blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team. It is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this. They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty. We dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team. We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield. A tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at it's end. We dolly further left to see EDDIE in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water gun in the history of man. The table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed. EDDIE holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western gunfighter. The JUDGES take notes.
S: EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL
N: The three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge. One of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team. ALEX is the one in the sweats for concessions. Slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay Page 66 of 81 down. The grounds kid is the littlest guy of all. A JUDGE blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water. They lie them down on a clear area and begin CPR. The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR. They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained. We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card.. We move again to see the concessions kids, who are in trouble. ALEX is lying there dying, and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth. They form a circle over him, pointing and arguing. Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying on the ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene. The JUDGES take their notes.
S: EXT LATER THAT DAY - IN FRONT OF THE CANNING COMPANY
N: Once again three teams representing the three competing factions. Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession. The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again, color coded. One from each team is stirring the team's chili while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously. Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring to the JUDGES. The JUDGES are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili. They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip. They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost as if throwing up. A concessions kid is there with a tray of waters, which they quickly take advantage of. They move on to the grounds team. They get their portions and taste the chili and nod, not bad. They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team. The portions are proudly scooped. They take a taste, smile and take some more. They huddle for Page 67 of 81 a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot. The lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot.
S: EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE
N: An obstacle course has been set up, and the event provides a background to the dialogue that follows. AOKEE has some papers, and is talking to ALEX and ROBBIE.
C: AOKEE
D: This isn't good. It's the same as every year. Pretty much a dead heat going into the surf championship tomorrow morning.
E: looking through the papers looking at ALEX and ROBBIE
C: ALEX
D: I can't believe those guys screwed up the CPR.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hard to blame them. No one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute. Yuck.
C: ALEX
D: Bunch of babies.
C: AOKEE
D: It's going to be up to you. We slip a little. You have to make up. That trophy need a new home.
E: to ROBBIE
N: They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms ROCKY-style.
C: AOKEE
D: You need to make up. You ready? Tomorrow morning last event. You our last hope.
E: CONT'D
N: ROBBIE just looks at both of them nods and sighs heavily as the other grounds kids surround our winner in the background. AOKEE and ALEX walk off. Suddenly TIFFANY appears.
C: TIFFANY
D: Hi Robbie.
C: ROBBIE
D: Oh. Hey.
E: shy but still very much smitten
C: TIFFANY
D: How's your team doing?
C: ROBBIE
D: Uh. OK, I guess. Kind of a tie.
N: Page 68 of 81
C: TIFFANY
D: Well, I think you're going to take care of that tomorrow morning. In fact, I've planned a little celebration in advance. We're going to this incredible party up in the foothills at some friends of mine.
C: ROBBIE
D: Party, huh? That sounds like fun. I have to work until nine tonight.
E: intrigued
C: TIFFANY
D: That's perfect. I'll come back here and pick you up.
N: She starts to walk off.
C: TIFFANY
D: Oh, and Robbie...call your mom and tell her you're spending the night at Alex's or something. It's going to be a very special night.
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: K...
E: hypnotised
N: She walks away. ROBBIE stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also.
S: INT. EVENING - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: It is dark. We see ALEX and AOKEE cleaning up from the day's food service. ALEX Is wiping down the smoothie area, AOKEE is sweeping on the other side of the counter.
C: ALEX
D: I'm telling you we need to talk him. Something's going on.
E: voice somewhat hushed
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie know the right thing to do. He's a good boy.
E: shaking his head no
C: ALEX
D: So how about this? He tells me I've got to cover for him if his mother calls. He told her he's spending the night at my house.
C: AOKEE
D: He say that?
C: ALEX
D: Yes. Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to
N: Page 69 of 81 notice.
C: AOKEE
D: Spending the night at your house. This very bad. Very bad.
E: reflective
C: AOKEE
D: He should be done with the dishes by now. Tell him we want to talk.
E: CONT'D
N: ALEX disappears back into the kitchen. AOKEE goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down. ALEX comes back and ROBBIE follows.
C: ROBBIE
D: Hey. I'm done with the pots and pans. It's almost nine. Can I take off now?
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie, please, sit.
N: ROBBIE sits down. So does ALEX. Robbie looks at both and gets suspicious.
C: ROBBIE
D: Everything OK?
C: AOKEE
D: That's what we gonna ask you. What you plan tonight?
C: ROBBIE
D: Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie, you athlete. Big day tomorrow. You need sleep, not party.
C: ROBBIE
D: It's no big deal. I'll be fine.
C: AOKEE
D: Is big deal. Robbie. You good boy, smart, everybody like you, but....
C: ROBBIE
D: But...
C: AOKEE
D: Face it. Only one reason Tiffany interested in you. She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow.
C: ROBBIE
D: Aw, come on...
E: disbelief
N: Page 70 of 81
C: ALEX
D: Robbie. She's still going out with Cowboy. I saw them together at the movies two nights ago.
C: ROBBIE
D: Maybe she's just letting him down easy.
C: ALEX
D: Robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be.
C: ROBBIE
D: Like what?
C: AOKEE
D: In this case, she acts like she likes you when really she wants Cowboy to win.
C: ROBBIE
D: Naw. You guys are nuts. She's not like that.
C: ALEX
D: She is like that.
C: ROBBIE
D: Look, I know what to believe and what not to. I'm not that easily fooled.
C: ALEX
D: Aokee?
C: AOKEE
D: Go ahead. Tell him. I trust him.
E: shaking his head
C: ALEX
D: OK. Take Aokee for instance. Gentle, genial Hawaiian guy, right?
C: ROBBIE
D: Sure. He's great. I love working here. Aokee, you've been real good to me...
C: ALEX
D: Then let me introduce you properly. Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez.
N: AOKEE'S head is down in his hands. Robbie looks stunned.
C: ALEX
D: Manuel's family snuck across the border ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico.
E: CONT'D
C: AOKEE
D: My father refused to work for a drug lord who ran our town. They tried to kill
E: accent gone
N: Page 71 of 81 him. We barely got out with our lives.
C: ROBBIE
D: Aokee?
C: AOKEE
D: A name I picked up reading an obituary in the paper. I sent away to Hawaii and got his birth records and social security number. This way, I never have to worry about immigration. I spent weeks watching tapes of Hawaii Five-O just to get the accent right. "Book 'em Danno". Huh. What's that all about?
E: accent now Mexican
C: ROBBIE
D: And you knew?
E: to Alex
N: ALEX nods yes.
C: AOKEE
D: I burnt my hand on the grill one day and started swearing in Spanish...
C: ALEX
D: And I said, boy, you speak Spanish like a native....uh oh. It's been our little secret. Now it's your secret, too.
E: interrupting
C: ROBBIE
D: I need to think about all this.
E: looking at his watch
C: ALEX
D: You do.
E: nodding
C: AOKEE
D: Sleep tonight. Sleep well.
C: ROBBIE
D: Right. Goodnight.
E: gets up, dazed
N: ROBBIE leaves. ALEX and AOKEE just sit, looking at each other.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - THUNDER BAY
N: Hundreds of people are gathering on bleachers to watch the surfing competition. A large highway construction type signboard has been erected and says "Grounds 93", "Concessions 93" and "Lifeguards 94". It is almost a festival atmosphere. The JUDGES are standing Page 72 of 81 in a group, conferring, near a table that has the controls for the sign. The sign can be viewed easily from the bleachers. WE look over to the front of AOKEE's and see AOKEE and ALEX standing outside the restaurant.
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING. - MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK
N: SHACK
C: AOKEE
D: Have you seen him?
E: to Alex
C: ALEX
D: Not yet.
N: They are looking to the north towards the crowd, but ROBBIE appears behind them.
C: ROBBIE
D: What you lookin' at?
E: looking in the same direction
C: AOKEE
D: We looking for you. How you sleep?
C: ROBBIE
D: I slept fine. I decided I'm not my father. I don't run out on the people I care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me.
E: pause as AOKEE and ALEX wait
C: AOKEE
D: We go then.
E: relieved
N: ROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the bleachers. ALEX stops and turns suddenly.
C: ALEX
D: She shook her ta-tas? No one said anything about shaking ta-tas. This puts a whole new light on things!
E: reflectively
N: He is in ROBBIE's way. ROBBIE pushes him with his board.
C: ROBBIE
D: Get going!
S: EXT. EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY
N: ROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the JUDGES. One JUDGE explains the rules. Page 73 of 81
C: HEAD JUDGE
D: Alright, here's the deal. You get three tries; three heats. We judge each run and only your high score counts. If you fall you get no score for the run. Your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the Surfer King Trophy. Any questions?
E: looking down at clipboard
N: They all shake their head no.
C: HEAD JUDGE
D: Then let's begin. Grounds is up first.
E: CONT'D
N: MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now. ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts. Page 74 of 81 COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances. He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8. ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 7. The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "Grounds 98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102". EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to the microphone.
C: BIG MIKE
D: It looks like we have a tie. This has never happened before, but I seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules. Hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do!
E: clearing his throat, flustered
N: The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.
C: HEAD JUDGE
D: Reading from the rules, "...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off. Additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared." The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in five minutes.
E: looking up at the crowd
N: Everybody cheers...they're going to see some more great surfing. The JUDGES signal COWBOY and ROBBIE to come over. The head JUDGE takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to COWBOY to call it. It lands and the JUDGE looks at it. HE points to ROBBIE.
C: HEAD JUDGE
D: You want to go first or second?
E: CONT'D
C: ROBBIE
D: Second.
C: HEAD JUDGE
D: Be ready in five minutes.
S: EXT -MOMENTS LATER - AOKEE'S SURF & SNACK SHACK
N: Page 75 of 81 ROBBIE, ALEX, AOKEE and PIPEMAN have gathered in front of AOKEE's to strategize.
C: AOKEE
D: So what you do? Wait for him to go crazy and fall?
C: ROBBIE
D: Don't want to win with him falling.
C: PIPEMAN
D: You could always go out and do your very best, take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit.
C: ALEX
D: Don't be silly. That only works in the movies.
E: dismissive
C: ROBBIE
D: Actually, that's exactly what I'm thinking. It's the reason we're in a tie. I've been too conservative. I've got to do everything I can, or just forget about it. It's all or nothing. We gotta pull the fin.
E: shakes his head pause
C: AOKEE
D: Pull da fin?
C: PIPEMAN
D: You think you can hold it?
C: ROBBIE
D: One time, these tourists from Japan on the beach at La Jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip. I pulled it off. A friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets.
E: explaining
C: PIPEMAN
D: We gotta pull the fin. What do we do about the foot pockets?
C: ROBBIE
D: You got duct tape?
N: PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll.
C: PIPEMAN
D: What kind of plumber would I be if I didn't have duct tape? Water World
N: Page 76 of 81 Platinum! Where do you want them? They place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board.
C: ROBBIE
D: Here and here.
N: PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. This provides a background to the dialog below.
C: AOKEE
D: So, help me understand. What you do now?
C: ROBBIE
D: Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board.
C: ALEX
D: Flip upside down?
C: ROBBIE
D: A back flip. You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, I'm sure.
C: ALEX
D: Oh yeah, I'm sure I did that last winter. But not on purpose! Dude. You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die.
C: AOKEE
D: It would be better if you won.
E: quickly, eagerly
C: ROBBIE
D: Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister.
C: ALEX
D: You stay away from my sister.
E: mock anger
N: We hear an air horn blast. They are ready to start.
C: PIPEMAN
D: Ready!
C: ROBBIE
D: I'll need the biggest wave you can give me...
E: to PIPEMAN
C: PIPEMAN
D: (imitating Mr. Scott on Star
N: Page 77 of 81 Trek) I'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n! He hands Robbie the board. ALEX heads back to the bleachers area, PIPEMAN goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder Bay. AOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone.
C: AOKEE
D: Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh?
E: dropping his Hawaiian accent
N: AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back. Robbie nods. They head for the bay.
S: EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY
N: COWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave. It comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9.
C: ALEX
D: Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake. You sure you know what you're doing?
E: to ROBBIE
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm just making this up as I go along.
C: ALEX
D: Works for me! Go get 'em.
N: ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly. HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water. He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE! The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to Page 78 of 81 the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water. On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion. We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything. ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave. He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted. The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like this before. AOKEE and ALEX run into the water and help him out. People are still cheering. COWBOY knows he's in trouble. THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner. COWBOY nods in agreement. TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry. We can only hear part of his response, something like:
C: COWBOY
D: You did WHAT?
E: disbelief
N: AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down.
C: COWBOY
D: As last year's Surfer King, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today. Robbie! Congratulations.
E: CONT'D
N: COWBOY shakes ROBBIE's hand, and ROBBIE speaks at the mike.
C: ROBBIE
D: I just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support.
E: holding trophy
N: We see KATIE clapping, crying. AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and smiling.
C: ROBBIE
D: And I have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions. WE DID IT!
E: CONT'D
N: ROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers. Page 79 of 81
T: FADE TO BLACK.
S: EXT. EARLY EVENING SURFS WAVE POOL
N: Grounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing. Tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down. Awnings are being taken down. Chairs and tables are being moved. We see JAFFA packing up his CD's into that cardboard box. HE also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place.
S: EXT. MOMENTS LATER - EVENING TIME OUT SHACK
N: A banner hangs over the time shack, "Thanks for another great year". ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY are clocking out for the final time this summer. They all stop and look around one final time. Suddenly TIFFANY drives up in her convertible.
C: TIFFANY
D: Another summer gone. How about it Robbie? You gonna guard next year? They could use your help.
N: They all walk closer to her car.
C: ROBBIE
D: I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's.
C: TIFFANY
D: You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer.
N: ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time.
C: ROBBIE
D: You wouldn't like it...
C: ALEX
D: That's a bad idea...
C: KATIE
D: And you're such a good guard...
C: AMY
D: You'd be miserable...
C: TIFFANY
D: Maybe you're right. See you around...
N: EDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt. Page 80 of 81
C: EDDIE
D: Tiffany!
E: almost singing
N: He walks up to her driver's side.
C: TIFFANY
D: Hello, Eddie.
E: feeling charitable, warmly
N: EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind TIFFANY's ear pulls a plastic Easter Egg out. He hands it to her, and she opens it. A beautiful butterfly flies out and away. She is momentarily entranced.
C: TIFFANY
D: You know, that's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. Hop in Eddie, let me give you a ride home.
E: CONT'D pause, thinking, what the heck
N: EDDIE waves his hand for HER to scoot over so he can drive. She is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. He gets in and he looks at ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY grinning broadly as he pulls away. ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY just watch in stunned silence as EDDIE and TIFFANY drive off.
C: ALEX
D: Well. Just another summer at Water World.
E: collecting himself
N: The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. They get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue.
C: ROBBIE
D: You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer.
C: KATIE
D: We'll be going to the same high school. You'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming, the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and of course, the prom...
C: ROBBIE
D: Alex?
C: ALEX
D: Yeah?
C: ROBBIE
D: I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.
N: Page 81 of 81
C: ALEX
D: Yep.
N: We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park. THE END
