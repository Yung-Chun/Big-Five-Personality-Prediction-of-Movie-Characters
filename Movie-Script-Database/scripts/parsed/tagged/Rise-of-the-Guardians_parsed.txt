M: SEQ. 125 - ALONE IN THE WORLD
M: DARKNESS
M: JACK (V.O.)
M: Darkness. That's the first thing I
M: remember. It was dark, and it was
M: cold. And I was scared.
N: The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of light, refracted through water, which turns into... A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above begins to spider-web and crack.
S: EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT
N: Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white.
C: JACK
D: But then...then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. And when it did...I wasn't scared anymore.
E: V.O.
N: Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him.
C: JACK
D: Why I was there, and what I was meant to do - that I've never known. And a part of me wonders if I ever will.
E: V.O.
N: Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2. Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. Jack is visibly confused. He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond. Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.
S: EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS
N: A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs. Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands up, still elated, and brushes himself off. As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.
C: JACK
D: Hello. Hello. Good evening, ma'am. Ma'am?
E: to the townsfolk BEAT
N: The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.
C: JACK
D: Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where I am?
N: The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.
C: JACK
D: Hello! Hello!
N: Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
C: JACK
D: My name is Jack Frost -- how do I know that? The moon told me so. But that was all he ever told me. And that was a long, long time ago. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 3.
E: V.O.
N: We pan up as the moon shines down over the snow covered trees.
T: CUT TO:
N: SEQ. 175 - INTRO TO NORTH
S: EXT. NORTH POLE - DUSK
N: FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.
S: INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK
N: We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of ice onto a stone work table-- IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible. Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies, each licking their own tasty morsel.
C: NORTH
D: Still waiting for cookies!
E: O.S.
N: As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear. The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music, delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible-- His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice-- His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed--
C: NORTH
D: Yes!
N: North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two Elves. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4. One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out onto the plate.
C: NORTH
D: Ah, finally!
N: He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track-- Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces.
C: YETI
D: Arghbal...
C: NORTH
D: Ach!
N: The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and takes a moment to collect himself.
C: NORTH
D: How many times have I told you to knock?
C: YETI
D: Warga blarghgha!
C: NORTH
D: What...? The Globe?
N: North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and HEADS OUT--
S: INT. NORTH'S GLOBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
N: A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as North's huge boots stomp through.
C: NORTH
D: Shoo with your pointy heads. Why are you always under boot?
N: He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS -- they're looking up in fear at - Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 5. THE GLOBE OF BELIEF Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents. But North notices that all at once, HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go out.
C: NORTH
D: What is this?
N: Now MORE LIGHTS, in GREATER NUMBERS, as if something is snuffing them out by the thousands. North's concern grows.
C: NORTH
D: Have you checked the axis? Is rotation balanced?
E: TO YETI
C: YETI
D: Wardle bawddrel.
E: SHRUGS SHOULDERS
N: Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE GLOBE in inky DARKNESS-- The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates into the air -- As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER? North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely:
C: NORTH
D: Can it be? Dingle!
E: then calls off
N: A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to themselves, as if they're all "Dingle". The excitement quickly turns to confusion.
C: NORTH
D: Make preparations! We are going to have company.
N: North reaches out for a large EMERGENCY LEVER, TWISTS and
C: PRESSES IT--
D: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 6.
N: The Globe pulses with ENERGY, which lights up and ZOOMS UP the AXIS SHAFT toward the roof--
S: EXT. NORTH POLE - CONTINUOUS
N: From the tallest spire of North's fortress, NORTHERN LIGHT ENERGY radiates outward: for the first time in decades, the GUARDIANS' CALL GOES OUT!

N: SEQ. 225 - GUARDIANS GATHER
S: INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
N: A little fairy, carrying a coin, flies above the head of a sleeping child. She quickly ducks under the pillow and comes out the other side with a tooth in hand.
S: EXT. TOOTH'S PALACE - DAY
N: Hundreds of fairies fly toward a hollowed out mountain, this is Tooth's palace and it's a majestic site.
S: INT. TOOTH'S PALACE
N: Dozens of tiny FAIRIES flit about. Teeth are filed away in tiny wooden drawers. Coins are handed out.
C: TOOTH
D: Chicago, Sector 6 -- 37 molars, 22 bicuspids, 18 central incisors. Moscow, Sector 9 -- 22 incisors, 18 premolars: Uh oh, heavy rain advisory! Des Moines, we've got a cuspid at 23 Maple. Head out!
E: O.S. BEAT
N: A hive of activity, and at the center a winged figure barks out orders like a harried air-traffic controller. This is TOOTH. A Mini Tooth Fairy flies up to Tooth as thousands of tiny MINI TOOTH FAIRIES continue their work behind them.
C: TOOTH
D: Wait!
E: O.S.
N: And suddenly everything stops. Tooth whips around, and we finally see her beautiful FACE. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 7. She's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy adoration. The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement.
C: TOOTH
D: It's her first tooth. Have you ever seen a more adorable lateral incisor in all of your life?! Look how she flossed!
E: CONT'D GASPS
N: The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky. She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies.
C: NORTH
D: My fellow Guardians - It is our job to watch over the children of the world, and keep them safe - to bring wonder, hope and dreams. And so, I've called us all here for one reason, and one reason only - the children are in danger.
E: V.O.
N: Much of this we hear over the following...
S: EXT./INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM
N: We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken the shape of a child playing soccer. We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS... ...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads. The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure, THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned. Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape and flies off into the distance. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 8.
C: NORTH
D: An enemy we have kept at bay for centuries has finally decided to strike back. We alone can stop him.
E: V.O.
N: Much of this we hear over the following...
S: INT. EGG TUNNEL
N: A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object. Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS --
S: EXT. A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE
N: A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out. A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed. The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Ah, it's freezing.
N: He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet!
E: CONT'D
N: In the distance is North's ornately decorated and dimly lit palace built into the side of a mountain of ice.

C: NORTH
D: I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious.

C: BUNNYMUND
D: Not exactly? Can you believe this guy?
N: Bunny turns to Sandy, who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand question mark above his head.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Yeah, you said it, Sandy.
N: Bunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs.
C: NORTH
D: Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly.

E: to her fairies
C: NORTH
D: Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Here we go...
N: North grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off. Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: North, I, I don't have time for this. I've still got two million eggs to finish up.
E: O.S. LAUGHS
N: The moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room.
C: NORTH
D: No matter how much you paint, is still egg! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 11.

C: BUNNYMUND
D: And why are you always such a blowhard!
C: TOOTH
D: Ontario, sector nine: five canines, two molars, and fourteen incisors. Is that all in one house?

N: Sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room.
C: NORTH
D: Tooth! Can't you see we're trying to argue.
E: turning his attention
C: TOOTH
D: Sorry, not all of us get to work one night a year. Am I right, Sandy?
N: Sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow, pointing toward the ceiling, but to no avail as the others continue their bickering. Sandy thinks Tooth has noticed for a split second, but then -

C: TOOTH
D: Hey, I hate to interrupt the, "We work so hard once a year club" but could we concentrate on the matter--
E: O.S.
N: Sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and vigorously shakes it's bell. The other Guardians are finally silenced and all turn to look at Sandy, who points up, a sand crescent moon forming above his head. The dizzy elf staggers away. Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight as it concentrates on the circle between them.
C: NORTH
D: Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why didn't you say something?
N: Sandy gives him a deadpan stare, Dreamsand smoke shoots out his ears.
C: NORTH
D: It's been a long time old friend! What is big news?
E: to Man in Moon
N: Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of moonlight, the light ebbs away, leaving a dark spot -- -- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of PITCH. The Guardians look on, stunned.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: It is Pitch.
N: North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look.
C: NORTH
D: Manny...what must we do? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13.
E: back up to the moon
N: In answer, the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of moonlight intensifies and SHRINKS, concentrating further illuminating an ORNATE SYMBOL on the floor, at the center of their circle. The symbol rises out of the ground revealing a large gem at the head of a pillar.
C: TOOTH
D: Ah, guys, you know what this means?
N: The moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting light all over the chamber.
C: NORTH
D: He's choosing a new Guardian.
E: AWED

D: What?! Why?
C: NORTH
D: Must be big deal! Manny thinks we need help!

N: A Dreamsand Four-Leaf clover forms above Sandy's head.
C: TOOTH
D: Maybe the Leprechaun?
E: CONT'D
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Please not the groundhog, please not the groundhog.
N: Then A BRIGHT FLASH, a rush of WIND - and a FIGURE resolves over the central pillar: slight, hooded, bearing a familiar hooked STAFF.
C: NORTH
D: Jack Frost.
N: The Mini-Teeth all sigh and swoon as the Guardians stand there, stunned.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Ah, I take it back! The Groundhog's fine! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 14.
C: TOOTH
D: Well, ah, as long he helps to ah...to protect the children, right?
E: caught admiring Jack
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Jack Frost!? He doesn't care about children! All he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts. Right? He's an irresponsible, selfish...
C: NORTH
D: Guardian.
N: This stops Bunnymund in his tracks.
C: BUNNYMUND
D: Jack Frost is many things, but he is not a Guardian.
N: As we turn toward the face of the hooded figure.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
N: SEQ. 600 - SNOWBALL FIGHT
S: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT
N: A hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a Post Office box on the opposite end of the street. The man touches the staff to the ground, sending a streak of frost across the street. A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain, turns the handle and moves in for a sip. But as he does, the water freezes magically, and the boy's tongue is stuck to the frozen water. His friends can't help but laugh.
C: RUSSIAN BOY
D: (tongue stuck to frozen
C: ICE)
D: Aahhhhh...!
N: A mail man walks across the street and a PATCH OF ICE magically appears under his feet. He scrambles, and BOOM! - lands on his butt. Just behind the man, we see the TRAIL OF FROST climb up the side of a building. We stay on the frost as it moves up along a rain pipe, and through the windows we see... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 15. A boy try to feed his gold fish, but a layer of ice suddenly forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from reaching its food. We move along the side of the building... A writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers. The window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the pages flying out the window. We move along the building, across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze. We continue to move up, and finally discover the culprit. Jack Frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in the view; the full moon bathes the city in moonlight.
C: JACK
D: Ah, now that, that was fun. Hey wind...
E: AMUSED BEAT
N: Jack chuckles as he calls the wind. The trees begin to sway and leaves fly into the air. Jack grabs hold of the spire, smiling as the wind blows past.
C: JACK
D: Take me home!
N: Jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and through the clouds. Night turns to day as Jack flies from one horizon to the other.
C: JACK
D: Woooooohoooooooooo!
S: EXT. BURGESS - DAY
N: Jack falls through the clouds, smiling, toward the town of Burgess.
C: JACK
D: SNOOOOOWWWW DAAAAYYYYYY!!!
N: Jack continues on down and zooms through the streets. Pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as gusts of wind, snow, and streaks of frost are left in Jack's wake.
S: EXT. FROZEN POND
N: Jack flies in, and with the wind behind him skates across an all too familiar pond. As the wind zips across the pond it knocks a BOOK out of the hands of a little boy walking alone, this is JAMIE. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 16.
C: JAMIE
D: Whoa, whoa.
N: Jamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the cover - "THEY'RE OUT THERE! - MYSTERIES, MYTHICAL CREATURES AND THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA." Jack flies into frame and lands beside Jamie.
C: JACK
D: Huh, that looks interesting. Good book?
N: Suddenly twins CLAUDE and CALEB, come barreling past them, rough-housing and laughing as they slam each other into drifts (all the boys are 8).
C: CLAUDE AND CALEB
D: Alright! Yeah! Waahoo! Snooow daaaay!!!
N: Jack calls after the boys...

S: EXT. JAMIE'S BACKYARD - DAY

D: And the Easter Bunny.
C: JAMIE
D: Wow, the Easter Bunny is real!
E: grabs his sled
C: JACK
D: Oh he's real alright. Real annoying, real grumpy, and really full of himself.

C: JAMIE'S MOM
D: You okay, Soph?
C: CLAUDE
D: Are we sledding or what?
C: JAMIE'S MOM
D: Jamie, hat? We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

E: smile drops - offended
N: Jack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off.
C: JACK
D: Who's Jack Frost?
E: MIFFED
N: Jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground. With his palm open, Jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball. He then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy breath. The snowball turns a light shade of blue. There's something going on here.
S: EXT. SNOWY HILL
N: WHOOSH! - the snowball goes flying through the air and - BOOF! - the snowball hits Jamie smack in the back of the head. Jamie looks up, peeved, and turns. Then we watch as his face changes...a mischievous sparkle comes into his eyes. A big smile. Make no mistake, something magical has just happened.
C: JAMIE
D: Okay, who threw that?
E: LAUGHING
N: Jack flies in and lands amongst the group of kids. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 19.
C: JACK
D: Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo.
N: Jamie scans the horizon for the culprit. His eyes land on a couple kids making snow barricades. MONTY (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking him face first into the ground.
C: MONTY
D: Ow!
N: PIPPA (brainy, pigtails, pink hat) steps forward and - BOOF! A magical snowball from Jack hits her, knocking her back. Pippa's face changes - a mischievous sparkle.
C: PIPPA
D: Jamie Bennett! No fair!
C: JAMIE
D: You struck first!
E: LAUGHS
C: CLAUDE
D: Oh!
N: Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh.
C: JACK
D: Free for all!
N: And just like that we find ourselves in a take-no-prisoners snowball fight, the kids pummeling each other mercilessly.
C: JACK
D: Alright, who needs ammo?
N: Jack supplies the kids with more snowballs. The kids are loving this.
C: JACK
D: Look at that.
E: WALLA
N: The mayhem continues as Jamie, using his sled as a shield, is knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him. A snowball flies overhead and hits CUPCAKE, a tough third grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head. Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints - gunslinger eyes.

C: CLAUDE
D: Oh!
C: CALEB
D: Did you throw that?
C: MONTY
D: No.
C: PIPPA
D: Wasn't me.
N: A moment, and then Cupcake starts laughing as Jack's magic takes hold. Cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of her snowman in her hands. Jack, all the while, runs along side taking pleasure in the excitement.
C: JAMIE
D: Hey, come on. Stop!
E: WALLA
C: CLAUDE
D: You can't catch me.
E: WALLA
C: JACK
D: Ooh, little slippery!

C: JAMIE
D: Whooaaooah!!! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 21.

N: Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars. Jack's path of ice covers the street. As Jamie turns, his speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic. Jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four car pile up.

N: PEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.) Look at that dude! Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible. Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead, carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.
C: JACK
D: Whoa.
N: Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp...
C: JAMIE
D: AAAAHHHHHHHH!
N: Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air. Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy. Jack looks on smiling. Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess.

N: A beat. The Moon shines silently down. Jack turns away in frustration. Jack leaps off the roof, onto a telephone pole, and begins walking across some telephone wires. A stream of Dreamsand suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops around in front of him. Jack turns and looks up, a smile now on his lips.

N: Jack and Baby Tooth land in the middle of a thickly wooded area. It's spooky. Jack scans the forest when again he hears... VOICE FROM A MEMORY (O.S.) Jack... Jack gives chase. He sprints through the thickets and enters a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting frame from a child's bed. Very creepy. What would that be doing in the woods, and how long has it been here?
C: JACK
D: Don't worry, there's still time. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 87.

N: Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at the names on the boxes. In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance to finally get his memory back. The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby column.
C: PITCH
D: Looking for something?
E: O.S.
N: Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber. Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor.

E: CONT'D
N: Panic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal that it's actually the ground. Pitch, unseen now, chuckles. Jack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started.
C: PITCH
D: And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why. Why you? Why were you chosen...to be like this?
E: O.S.
N: Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him.

C: PITCH
D: Do you want them, Jack? Your memories?
N: He holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has disappeared. Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90. Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth cages everywhere.

D: More to the point Jack, what did you do?

He looks back to Tooth and North, both of whom look away, too hurt by Jack. He looks at them with a pained expression. This is exactly what Pitch said would happen. Jack reaches into his pocket, pulls out the tiny Russian nesting doll that North had given him, drops the doll to the ground, and takes off. As Jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny Russian nesting doll laying on the ground.

N: Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches. He looks down. It's a quarter.
C: PITCH
D: A quarter?

N: Pale and faint in the day, but oddly close and welcoming. It can't be, but -- is that the barest hint of a FACE on the Moon? Jack smiles as he looks up at it. He hears Tooth's laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their faces shining with pride. Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off the ground as they embrace.
