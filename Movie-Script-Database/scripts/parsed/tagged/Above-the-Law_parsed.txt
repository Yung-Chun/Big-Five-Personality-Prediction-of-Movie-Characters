N: 1 TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then: in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then: Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters, being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them. Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: 2 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
N: Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER: Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3 "HUEY" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ.
S: 4 EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
N: watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook." 5 HELICOPTER touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before. 6 LEADER OF THREE wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45. 7 NICO AND FOX don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.
C: FOX
D: You ever see chemical interrogation before?
N: Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON, for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
C: NICO
D: These assholes are agency?
N: 8 NICO'S POV FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand. 9 BACK TO FOX AND NICO
C: FOX
D: We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map. 10 EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point, leading Fox and the three CIT men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home in the jungle. 11 TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
E: Chemical Interrogation Team
C: ZAGON
D: How long till we're across the border?
C: NICO
D: We've been over for the past hour. The group continues along the ridge.
T: CUT TO:
S: 12 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
N: The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks. 13 NICO listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
C: ZAGON
D: What are you looking at, hotshot?
C: NICO
D: Why don't you light a bonfire?
E: indicates cigarette glow
N: Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
C: ZAGON
D: Just drive the taxi, ace.
N: As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say, "Don't fuck with these guys."
S: 14 EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT
N: A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts, several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen 100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
C: FOX
D: They're in there.
E: to Zagon
N: The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
C: NICO
D: I don't trust these yo-yo's. 15 FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.
N: 16 DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch. 17 NICO'S POV - HOOCH Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in- coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect. 18 BACK TO NICO He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the hooch.
S: 19 INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
N: on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic, squirt-tests it. 20 TWO ASIAN PRISONERS are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing. Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.
C: ZAGON
D: That's the nice thing about modern technology. You don't have to wait for results.
N: He moves close to the first prisoner.
C: ZAGON
D: Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our shit -- The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all that comes out is a blood-curdling wail -- 21 EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO
E: to first prisoner
N: hears this horrifying cry. He starts swiftly toward the hooch --
S: 22 INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER
N: has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly. Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
C: ZAGON
D: Don't you die on me, fucker --
C: FOX
D: What the hell's wrong?
E: from the side
C: ZAGON
D: This pussy can't hold his liquor.
E: throws the prisoner down
N: The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm. 23 NICO enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico, but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove it to the others, too. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 5. 24 FIRST PRISONER dies in agony on the ground. 25 SECOND PRISONER watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties, scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't back down an inch.
C: ZAGON
D: So my little doctor bag doesn't * scare you, eh? Well I don't need * it to open your yap. * Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light.
E: to second prisoner
N: 26 NICO watches impassively.
C: ZAGON
D: Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? -- 27 ZAGON punches the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes sideways, face bloody --
E: O.S. to prisoner
C: ZAGON
D: I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --
N: 28 FOX AND TWO CIT MEN seem to know exactly what this is about. 29 NICO didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast. Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up. The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting Zagon's with defiance --
C: ZAGON
D: You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner.
E: to prisoner
C: ZAGON
D: -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --
N: Nico takes a step toward Zagon.
C: NICO
D: What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence?
C: ZAGON
D: Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico --
C: FOX
D: Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
E: to Nico
C: ZAGON
D: I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon.
E: to second prisoner
C: NICO
D: Fox --
E: can't take much more
C: FOX
D: Shut up, Nico.
C: ZAGON
D: You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --
N: Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade. Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico. Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico out of the hooch --
S: 30 EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT
N: Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --
C: FOX
D: Are you crazy?!! What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch --
E: as Nico jerks free
C: FOX
D: Nico!
C: NICO
D: I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later.
N: The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway. Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --
C: FOX
D: I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. -- -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment.
E: as Nico resists
C: FOX
D: I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!
E: to Nico
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 8. Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES. Nico disappears into the darkness.
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN ON:
N: 31 CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in, then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if they're late --
S: 32 INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY
N: A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife * -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm around Sara. *
S: 33 EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
N: Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently the party has come here straight from the church. Presents for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara, * and Nico's mother, ROSA. SARA * Mama, look at this -- all done by hand. Sara lifts a cute baby outfit. *
C: ROSA
D: Nico had one just like this. Thank you, Cora. Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.
N: 34 NICO Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped in his pants. He turns for help to Sara. * ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 9.
C: NICO
D: I think we got a little problem here.
N: SARA * (winking at the women) I carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper. Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem.
C: NICO
D: That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian. Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over. *
E: to all
N: SARA * My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants. Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby. 35 ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
C: LUKICH
D: Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.
E: indicates Nico across the patio
N: 36 TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES BRANCA and LUIGI, who look like they have been on the other side of a cop's work, are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson -- plus a cluster of other cops in civvies hovering around the buffet table like vultures.
C: BRANCA
D: Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and they come out like flies. 37 STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
N: An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON ("Jax"), another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters the driveway leading to Nico's back yard -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 10. 38 BACK YARD Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson, Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
C: STROZAH
D: I didn't do nothing, Counselor. I'm clean.
C: JACKSON
D: Eight more days, Lieutenant. You better start preparing your defense.
C: HENDERSON
D: Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.
C: LUKICH
D: You passed the bar? I make it a point never to pass the bar. Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and * starts toward them -- 39 BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI
N: Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
C: LUIGI
D: Now this cop. She can bust me any day. 40 NICK, SARA AND ROSA * Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly. * She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby. 41 VARIOUS SHOTS
E: NICO'S MOTHER
N: Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of varied ages and professions. 42 BACK TO JACKSON Holding the baby.
C: JACKSON
D: Look at this little bundle. What a cupcake!
C: NICO
D: You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 10A. SARA * Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath? 43 JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE) * moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward * Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure. *
C: NICO
D: Watanabe! Say hey, Doc.
N: They begin jabbering in Japanese. We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking * woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and * intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who go back a long way. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 11. *
S: 44 EXT. TOSCANI FRONT PORCH - LATER
N: Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.
C: BRANCA
D: You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
C: NICO
D: I'm happy, Branca. I like what I do. Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek.
C: BRANCA
D: Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop! Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen.
C: BRANCA
D: This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family!
C: NICO
D: We're happy.
C: LUIGI
D: Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run -- a ballet school...?
C: NICO
D: An art gallery.
C: BRANCA
D: Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster. Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes meet Nico's.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 12.
C: BRANCA
D: You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Enough!
C: UNCLE GUISEPPE
D: Let your family help you, Nico.
C: NICO
D: Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know. Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow. For the moment, the tension is dispelled.
E: lightly
S: 45 INT. NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY
N: Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother standing near the head of the stairs, just outside another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
C: NICO
D: What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the party... Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom: the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in. 46 INT. NURSERY - DAY * Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish * grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.
C: NICO
D: Mrs. Z. Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.
E: tries to be light
N: SARA * It's Lucy. She's gone again. Nico glances from Sara to Rosa. * Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara. *
C: NICO
D: It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 13. Sara doesn't know. Nico does. He comforts Mrs. Zingaro * another moment, then stands.
C: NICO
D: Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery?
E: as the woman nods miserably
C: MRS. ZINGARO
D: Si, Nico.
C: NICO
D: We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this.
N: Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye, * starts for the door.
S: 47 EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
N: Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells. Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.
S: 48 INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING
N: Nico is driving. Jackson checks in on the radio.
C: JACKSON
D: Unit Ten Tango X-ray. We're up and clear. 49 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - UNMARKED CAR
E: into mike
N: moves into the central city. 50 POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners.
C: NICO
D: I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson.
E: O.S.
C: JACKSON
D: And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 14.
S: 51 EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY *
N: The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar.
S: 52 INT. UNMARKED CAR
N: as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look: "What are we stopping at this dive for"?
C: NICO
D: I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.
N: He gets out of the car, starts for the bar.
S: 53 INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY *
N: Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar. Nico enters. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 15. His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working- class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head. BAD DUDE * Why the fuck don't you assholes * leave me alone? * He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool, * then another; the same exchange is repeated. 54 FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER * A hulking bruiser with an earring. He watches as -- 55 NICO approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly. Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.
C: NICO
D: Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose.
C: FIRST ARMY JACKET
D: I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl .
E: to others Lucy
C: NICO
D: You seen this girl?
C: SECOND ARMY JACKET
D: I seen the top of her head.
C: NICO
D: That's witty.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 15A. Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a * sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move * ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move * almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash. Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six. Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat- tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --
C: NICO
D: Come on. Show me something. No one moves.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 16. *
C: NICO
D: I get it. It's a gay bar. Is that it?
N: The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his hand. He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap- ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.
C: NICO
D: You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen your mother's -- Or was it yours? Or yours? I couldn't tell, it looked like her ass -- Nico rages like a beast.
E: to another guy to a third slaps him fero- ciously
C: NICO
D: Come on, motherfuckers. Do it. Do it! One man -- Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off --
C: BAD DUDE
D: Upstairs! She's upstairs! 4-D! Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar. Holding him, Nico turns, glowering, to all.
E: in terror
C: NICO
D: You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls. 55A INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAY
N: Nico throws Bad Dude down the hallway in front of him.
S: 56 INT. FOURTH-FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY
N: The door bursts in from a jackhammer kick. Nico stands in the hallway. Bad Dude stands next to him; hurt, shaking.
C: NICO
D: Get outta here. We look in the apartment.
E: to Bad Dude
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 16A. REVERSE - NICO'S POV * A young PIMP -- quite handsome in a boyish way -- stares up in panic from a grimy mattress on the floor. Little LUCY is in bra and panties, strung out, 14 and beautiful. Syringes and free-base paraphernalia are on a table. NICO IN DOORWAY *
C: NICO
D: This ain't your day, kid.
E: to Pimp
N: Nico comes in, eyes taking in everything. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 17.
C: PIMP
D: Wait, man. It ain't like it looks --
N: Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the table --
C: NICO
D: That's two years. He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer. More pills and glacene bags.
C: NICO
D: That's four. She'll get you eight more. And I'm just warming up -- Lucy is crying hysterically. Nico flings the Pimp, face * bloody, toward the open door. *
E: twisting the Pimp's neck toward Lucy
C: PIMP
D: Take it, baby. It's all yours --
E: to Nico, indicat- ing drugs
C: NICO
D: Get your clothes on, Lucy.
C: PIMP
D: There's money. Three grand in the mattress... ... I can get ya more --
E: begging
T: QUICK CUTAWAY TO:
S: 57 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - JACKSON
N: Three young STUDS have ambled to the window of her parked car.
C: STUD
D: Hey, sister, what it be?
N: With infinite boredom, Jackson lifts her badge -- and gun. The Studs shuffle away.
S: 58 INT. HALLWAY - DAY
N: Other tenants stare from doorways as Nico drags the Pimp * to the top of the flight of stairs, threatening to throw * him down. * ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 17A. NICO * Don't you fuckin' move. * Nico steps back into the apartment, hauls out Lucy in * a dressing gown. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 18. 59 TOP OF LANDING * The Pimp is dazed, bloody. Nico comes down with Lucy, hauls the Pimp to his feet --
C: LUCY
D: Let him alone! He's beautiful!
C: NICO
D: Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall.
C: PIMP
D: No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big!
C: LUCY
D: Please, Nico! Don't!
C: PIMP
D: It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday --
C: NICO
D: Shipment, my ass.
C: PIMP
D: This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level.
C: PIMP
D: I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus!
N: Nico relents -- a little.
C: NICO
D: What lawyer?
C: PIMP
D: I don't know. That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows. Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat.
E: sees Nico doesn't believe him
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 19. *
C: PIMP
D: She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes --
S: 60 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BAR - DAY
N: Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired, shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked, wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out of the car, moving to Lucy.
C: JACKSON
D: It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here.
N: She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car.
C: JACKSON
D: That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek.
E: to Nico
C: JACKSON
D: Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner.
C: JACKSON
D: You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in.
C: NICO
D: We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO:
N: 61 OMITTED
S: 63 EXT. ZINGARO BAKERY - DAY
N: From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy, in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico walks her inside. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 20. * The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking. Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson, standing in the doorway, has seen all this.
S: 64 INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY
N: Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery. Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath an out-and-out wild man.
C: JACKSON
D: I don't get you, Toscani. What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing. Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead:
E: beat
C: NICO
D: When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson.
C: NICO
D: You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --
E: smiles a moment
N: ANGLE INCLUDING MEAN STREETS OUTSIDE
C: NICO
D: But maybe here, huh? Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here I can do something.
E: indicates street
N: He turns a corner.
C: NICO
D: That's why I'm a shitheel cop.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 20A. *
S: 64A INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
N: Behind the desk, a few detectives man the phones. A Latin attorney, ABANDANO, is at the counter.
C: COP
D: You can see your client. As soon as she's through eating her dinner.
E: O.S.
S: 65 INT. POLICE LOCKUP - "CAGE" AND HALLWAY - EVENING
N: Hookers, female addicts, etc. in the downtown "cage." Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes (CARLA DECARLO) out in the hallway adjacent to the lock- up. Nico is Mr. Charm, offering her a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
C: NICO
D: Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend --
C: CARLA
D: I got 200 boyfriends. The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Spanish.
C: CARLA
D: Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!
N: Some of the chocolates tumble onto the lockup floor, the detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con- tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench next to a tall black hooker. MOVE IN ON the black hooker. It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street- walker, playing her undercover role to the hilt.
C: JACKSON
D: Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect?
E: to Nico
C: NICO
D: Take it easy, sister.
E: walking away
C: JACKSON
D: I ain't your goddamn sister. We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka. Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted. CUT TO: 66 EXT. DOWNTOWN - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building. She gets into Nico's car.
S: 67 INT. CAR - DAY
N: Jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror. Nico sits behind the wheel. The two are on some kind of stakeout.
C: JACKSON
D: The lawyer's name is Abandano. He's on the third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay.
C: NICO
D: Maybe we can bust him for that. Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 22.
S: 68 EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - DAY
N: A short, slick-looking Latin man in a business suit emerges from the building.
C: JACKSON
D: That's our stud.
N: Nico and Jackson leave their car and follow him on foot.
S: 69 EXT. FINANCIAL DISTRICT - BANK - DAY
N: ABANDANO meets a striking-looking middle-aged woman in front of a stately financial institution. They go in. Jackson remains out on the street, while Nico follows the couple in. 70 LATER Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee. Nico emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow him. Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol- ving doors and immediately jump into a cab. Nico and Jackson look at each other and step in front of another cab. Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then asks the occupant to leave. Jackson gets in the front seat next to the protesting cabbie.
S: 71 EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY
N: Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and Jackson run up the block. Near the entrance to the Federal * Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are * gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus- * trated cabbie watches them in the background. 72 PLAZA Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the * crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson acts * indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something.
T: CUT TO:
S: 73 INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT ("BOGOTA") - DAY *
N: The main dining room. No customers, just busboys readying tables for the evening's business. We notice one of the * busboys is the "pimp" Nico found with Lucy. * 74 BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 23.
C: SALVANO
D: -- I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.
E: pissed off
C: NARDO
D: I'm sorry, boss.
E: scared
C: SALVANO
D: Your English is getting good... You're showing it off. Showing it off on the street --
C: NARDO
D: I keep quiet. I never talk no more --
N: Salvano glowers at Nardo like he's about to punch him. Instead he reaches over, playfully chokes the busboy -- then releases him, as if all is forgiven.
C: SALVANO
D: Make yourself useful. Get downstairs, bring me one of these. Then get back to work. 75 INT. RESTAURANT BASEMENT STOREROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
E: indicates empty wine bottle on table as Nardo stands, starts for back hallway
N: Nardo enters at the top of the stairs, radiating relief. He trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor-to- ceiling wine rack.
C: NARDO
D: I thought I was dead, man. I thought I was fucking dead.
E: to himself whistles with relief
N: He crosses to the wine rack. It's dark, hard to see. He searches for the bottle. Suddenly: a METALLIC sound behind him. Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry, pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small silencer automatic.
C: CHI CHI
D: You were right, cabron. *
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 24. One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly, professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry * down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. * Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.
C: SALVANO
D: Clean up this mess. CHI CHI * Who knows who else is talking -- *
E: to busboys
N: SALVANO * He was a young fool. * 76 BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth.
C: CHI CHI
D: We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now.
N: Salvano puts a hand on Chi Chi's shoulder.
C: SALVANO
D: Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned. CUT TO:
S: 77 EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - NIGHT
N: Rusting cyclone fences surround a mud-lot repair yard in a dingy industrial section. Young Lation and black workers finish up for the night; through the dirty, security-barred office window we can see Chi Chi talking on the phone. The lawyer, Abandano, is also there.
S: 78 EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF SHOP - NIGHT
N: Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has been hastily wired to the entering phone line.
S: 79 INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
N: Nico and Jackson in the shadows down the street from the body shop. Nico wears earphones, a small tape recorder on the seat beside him. Jackson does not look happy. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 25.
C: JACKSON
D: Toscani, you're going to have me doing time.
C: NICO
D: Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court.
C: JACKSON
D: Except against us.
C: NICO
D: I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest.
C: JACKSON
D: I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones. Gestures for silence -- 80 ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81 BACK TO NICO In unmarked car. He's writing it down too.
C: NICO
D: I got the shipment. *

D: What? What's he saying?

S: 82 EXT. BODY SHOP - NIGHT

D: Vehicle registration follows. Leaseholder: Ramon Testamente, registered alien. Nation of origin: Venezuela. Do you wish criminal record search?
E: V.O.
C: NICO
D: I want to know when he wipes his * behind. * 85 SERIES OF SHOTS As Nico and Jackson tail the Lincoln out of the industrial zone into a fancier, non-Latin neighborhood. On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable white couples out on the town. 86 LINCOLN

S: 89 INT. SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
N: Nico and Jackson enter the main dining room, which we recognize from the scene with Nardo the busboy. The place is packed with fashionable people of all races. A band plays salsa; couples dance. Nico and Jackson pass easily as a hip "uptown" couple. A pretty Latin HOSTESS approaches them.
C: HOSTESS
D: Two for dinner?
C: NICO
D: Two for drinks. They elbow up to the packed bar, standing. Nico squints toward the rear dining room.
N: 90 NICO'S POV - DOWN BAR Looking past numerous patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table (the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before.) The waiter hurries off into a back hallway. 91 NICO AND JACKSON - AT BAR Jackson moves to the salsa beat. A BARMAID approaches.
C: JACKSON
D: Gimme something stiff. I need it.
C: BARMAID
D: Who doesn't?
N: Nico's eyes never leave Chi Chi. 92 REAR DINING ROOM From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux, looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket, hands it to Salvano.
C: NICO
D: You'll have your engine block next Tuesday, boss. 93 BACK TO NICO AND JACKSON
E: O.S.
N: As the Barmaid brings their drinks. Jackson sees her peaceful week to retirement flying out the window.
C: JACKSON
D: Why couldn't it be a week from Tuesday? I could read about it in the paper. Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and does a playful twirl.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 28.
C: NICO

C: JACKSON
D: You missed a few spots, boys.
C: LUKICH
D: I'm takin' it home t'a make kilbasa, boss.
N: Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers" keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.
C: LUKICH
D: This ain't a bust -- it's a convention.
C: NICO
D: Don't you like company, Luke? We got all the scouts here -- Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms --
E: sarcastic
C: WALKIE-TALKIE
D: Keep this channel clear, Toscani. We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick- up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley. Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice.
E: V.O.
C: NICO
D: This is our channel, dickhead. And our collar.
E: into mike
C: ANOTHER WALKIE-TALKIE
D: That's enough, all of you! Keep this channel clear.

ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 29. 97 ANOTHER ANGLE Dead as hell. 98 NICO, LUKICH AND JACKSON Bored, pissed off, tired. Suddenly: 99 BATTERED VAN WITH TWO MEN emerges from a corner, two blocks down. It starts slowly this way.
C: 1ST WALKIE-TALKIE
D: All right. Everyone get their heads outa their ass.
E: V.O.
N: The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area.
C: JACKSON
D: '... And so I quit the police department... got myself a steady job -- ' The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes. Silence. LUKICH * They spotted me. I'm too good- looking to be a meat slopper. *
E: sarcastic
C: 1ST WALKIE-TALKIE
D: Will you hot dogs shut up? The van returns. On a cross street. Heading behind the packing plant.
E: V.O.
N: NICO * (to Lukich) * You're too ugly. Now a second car appears. The Lincoln. Behind it is an ancient station wagon. Both vehicles take a different cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant.
C: NICO
D: Here we go, boys and girls -- You stay put. *
E: into hidden mike to Jackson
N: As soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant. The meat truck men START their TRUCK. The pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico and Luke -- but at a safe distance.
S: 100 INT. PACKING PLANT - DAY
N: Nico and Lukich sprint in a crouch past the blood runoffs,
T: meat cutting tables --

D: Police! 105 QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN grab for their weapons --
N: 106 COPS IN MEAT TRUCK AND PICKUP come highballing around both sides of the packing plant -- 107 VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN OPEN FIRE. There is confusion and mayhem; it's not clear who's a cop and who's a criminal. 108 NICO AND LUKICH dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes. MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.
C: LUKICH
D: Nico! The Lincoln!
E: shouts; points
N: 109 LINCOLN starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi in the driver's seat, Salvano on the passenger side. 110 NICO steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45.
S: 111 INT. LINCOLN - DAY

S: 112 EXT. LINCOLN - DAY
N: Nico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall. The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley. 113 NICO brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto the roof.

N: Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof.
S: 115 EXT. LINCOLN - ROOF - DAY
N: Bullet holes appear. Nico narrowly misses being hit. 116 ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN Nico reaches over the side of the car and SMASHES the pas- senger WINDOW with his fist. 117 CLOSEUP - NICO'S HAND Salvano's face is bashed. Nico's huge hand grabs Salvano's throat; he won't let go. 118 CLOSEUP - NICO He hangs on with one hand. 119 CLOSEUP - SALVANO Nico's fingers now dig into Salvano's larynx; he may never talk again. He's gagging. Salvano now points the gun at Chi Chi. Chi Chi makes the decision to stop the car in order to save his boss. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 32. 120 NICO leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass, out of the window. 121 SEVERAL POLICE VEHICLES * SCREECH into the lot. Officers pour out, guns drawn, surrounding the Lincoln and the other vehicles. Jackson joins them, weapon in hand. 122 NICO drags Salvano by the neck across the lot to the van, slamming the drug dealer up against the van's side. Lukich, Jackson and Strozah are there, with the DEA cops, * all covering the other men.
C: NICO
D: How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo? Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo. 123 INT. VAN The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals.
E: to Salvano
N: 124 CLOSEUP - ENGINE BLOCK From the cylinder heads emerges a full load, not of drugs, but of plastique tubes labeled U.S. ARMY C-4 HIGH EXPLOSIVE. 125 LUKICH, JACKSON AND OTHER COPS react with surprise and shock. 126 NICO rips open one of tubes and smells it. 127 CLOSE - NICO Confused; frustrated.

D: Your problem is being handled right now, Mr. Salv --

E: into phone
C: SALVANO
D: That maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge. Salvano knows what the call is about. He straightens the tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged. AGENT NEELEY * -- count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation. Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns * grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano.

C: LIEUTENANT STROZAH
D: -- This is no reflection on the work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels, extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry. That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on the others' faces too.
E: to Nico, DEA & AIF
C: LIEUTENANT STROZAH
D: As all of you are well aware, possession of these explosives is a federal offense and under jurisdiction of the F.B.I. Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain.
C: NICO
D: Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau -- * -- That's no answer. It's no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!

AGENT NEELEY * Mr. Salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies. 134 CLOSE - NICO'S FACE Stunned and furious at this royal fuck-up. AGENT NEELEY (O.S.) * I'm not at liberty to divulge the nature of Mr. Salvano's involvement -- I just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago. But one thing I can tell you -- 135 BACK TO AGENT NEELEY * AGENT NEELEY * Mr. Salvano's role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance, harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden. I must order you gentlemen -- (looking straight at Nico) -- with all respect for your work and your courage, to stand down. Lukich shakes his head; Nico is devastated. Jackson takes it all in.

C: AGENT HALLORAN
D: What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass? Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport.
C: JACKSON
D: He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case.
N: Halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of Nico's drawer.
C: AGENT HALLORAN
D: His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun.
N: This "white" talk gives Jackson a pain. She slips into her jive mode.
C: JACKSON
D: You don't wanna catch him without no gun. Halloran's look asks why not?

N: 143 SERIES OF SHOTS As Nico's car tails Salvano's through various streets. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 37.
S: 144 EXT. OAK STREET
N: Salvano comes out of a fancy flower shop with a bimbo on his arm. He kisses her goodbye and puts her in a cab.
C: NICO
D: And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice to see married couples still in love.
E: O.S.
C: 144A NICO AND JACKSON
D: are hidden, waiting.
C: 144B CHI CHI
D: emerges from a dry cleaner's with a suit on a hanger. *
S: 145 EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S PARISH CHURCH - DAY
N: Salvano's Caddy pulls up outside the same church where we * saw Nico's son get baptized. Salvano and Chi Chi get out, look both ways up and down the street. Salvano, holding * flowers, makes eye contact with a car down the block. *
S: 146 EXT. STREET UP BLOCK FROM CHURCH - DAY
N: Nico's car backs out of sight around the corner. 147 SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.
S: 148 INT. CHURCH - DAY
N: A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the altar, move in, take seats toward the front. 149 BACK OF CHURCH Nico and Jackson slip in the front door, glide silently into the shadows at the rear of the church.
C: JACKSON
D: This is your mother's church, isn't it?
C: NICO
D: Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir. 150 NICO'S POV
N: Salvano's head is bowed, but Chi Chi is looking around quite carefully. Nico and Jackson fade into the shadows behind the huge pillars. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 37A. 151 SALVANO AND CHI CHI After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them- selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they continue to look for something.
S: 152 INT. CHURCH - DAY *
N: Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and look around.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Nicola! That can't be you in church without the family!
E: O.S.
N: Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.
C: NICO
D: Father Genarro. The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: This must be your partner in crime. I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at the baptismal party. What a partner.
E: shakes her hand with a wink to Nico
C: JACKSON
D: Dolores Jackson Nico, we gotta go --
E: smiling, but impatient
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: No, please -- It's good you stopped by. I have to show you something. Please. The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by. 153 INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
E: more serious now
N: This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk. Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk. They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a break-in has taken place.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: The rats are getting bigger.
C: NICO
D: When did this happen?
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 39. * Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like he's from Central America stands in the doorway.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: It's all right, son. These are friends.
E: in Spanish
N: The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --
S: 154 INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY
N: A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up. Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner, various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson. Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: These are friends. This is Father Tomassino.
E: referring to the cops to Nico
C: FATHER TOMASSINO
D: How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave. 155 NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO
N: continue down the hall.
C: JACKSON
D: I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one.
C: NICO
D: How long have they been here?
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Too long. At least the kids can go to our school.
C: NICO
D: Who did it, Father?
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 39A.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Kids, maybe. Maybe worse. It's not the first time.
E: significantly
C: JACKSON
D: We can have a car check by, every hour.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: No... please. Police frighten these people.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 40.
S: 156 INT. CHURCH - MAIN AISLE - DAY *
N: The three are outside, taking their leave. A big smile and a hand on Father Genarro's shoulder. The priest is greatly relieved.
C: NICO
D: Really, I don't mind coming by.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession?
C: NICO
D: I'm a married man, Father. I've got no sins to confess.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess.
C: JACKSON
D: Amen. Nico and Jackson start off.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in church. You don't show, I'm phoning your mother! DISSOLVE TO: 157 SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING
E: calls after Nico calls louder SUNDAY
N: HIGH ANGLE FROM ACROSS the street: neighborhood people dressed in their Sunday best fill the sidewalk, filing in for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church. 158 VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the churchgoers file in, we see families -- women, kids, babies. 159 NICO, SARA, ROSA AND JULIAN * are among the crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors -- in English, Italian and Spanish.
S: 160 INT. CHURCH - SIDE AISLE
N: Sara, holding Julian, slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa * follow, Father Genarro passes, heading for the front. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 41.
C: ROSA
D: Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church!
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: It's amazing what shame can accomplish.
N: Father Genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit.
T: QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
N: 161 VARIOUS SHOTS

C: D) THE CHOIR MASTER

E: Alan Singletary
N: moves into the pulpit, opens his Bible.
C: FATHER GENARRO
D: In nomine patris, filius et spiritu sancti... 162 SARA AND JULIAN *
E: etc
N: The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him. Nico reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING. Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church. He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front of the church and turn, heading down one of the side aisles. SARA * (examines Julian's diaper) Way to go, Julian -- perfect timing. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 42. She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in black pass toward the exit of the church. 163 CLOSEUP - WOMAN It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with Abandano, the lawyer! 164 CLOSEUP - LARGE SHOPPING BAG The woman has left it in front of the votive candles directly before the priest's pulpit. 165 CLOSEUP - NICO His head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway -- 166 NICO'S POV - DOORWAY The woman is hastily sneaking out. 167 BACK TO NICO Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering them with his body. 168 CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER BOOM!!! A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest and his congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and marble come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers in the first rows are blown off their feet by the shock wave of the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere -- 169 CHOIR is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain down on them from the ceiling. 170 CONGREGATION is in total pandemonium. Screams, cries, panic -- 171 PULPIT has been blown to oblivion. Where Father Genarro had been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble. 172 NICO Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping frantically * to protect his mother as well. SARA * (clutching baby) We're okay! We're okay! Nico checks them and his mother swiftly. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 43.

C: NICO
D: Help each other move outside. Be calm. 175 EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH - MORNING From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. 176 INT. CHURCH Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer.
E: forcefully
C: NICO
D: Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got! Sara, get the baby and Mama * outside. Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.
E: turns to his wife
S: 177 EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - MORNING
N: The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray. We see Nico's family -- they're all right. 178 NICO appears from the church, carrying a young choir girl. He hands the child over to two older women, races back into the church. 179 LONG SHOT - STREET OUTSIDE CHURCH The first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner, SIREN BLARING. Police cars appear right behind -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 44.
S: 180 INT. CHURCH
N: Nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He desperately tries to maintain the priest's life.
T: CUT TO:
S: 181 INT. HOSPITAL/ICU WARD - AFTERNOON
N: The aftermath of the blast. Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery.
S: 182 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
N: Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look on his face. A doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father Genarro. A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father. 183 JACKSON arrives. Nico talks to her, aside.
C: NICO
D: I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone.
C: JACKSON
D: Right.
C: NICO
D: Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes.
C: NICO
D: Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them.
N: Jackson flips her notepad shut, ready to go.
C: JACKSON
D: Where are you gonna be?
C: NICO
D: Just stay near a radio. I'll find you.
S: 184 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NICO'S MOTHER (ROSA) - AFTERNOON
N: Sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye. Sara * and Julian are sleeping beside her. Nico kneels beside his mother, deeply concerned. Nico takes his mother's arm, helps her to her feet. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 45. Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro * has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly, Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who * ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah * and two uniformed officers.
C: NICO
D: Sara... go down to the car; I'll * be with you in a minute. He hails Neeley. *
C: NICO
D: I need to talk to you. ... Alone. Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a * fire exit door -- 185 STAIRWELL LANDING The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing. AGENT NEELEY * What the hell is it, Toscani? Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams * him furiously into the wall!
E: a glance to Strozah and others impatient
C: NICO
D: You. That's what the hell it is! AGENT NEELEY * Get your goddam hands off me! Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him. *
C: NICO
D: You let Salvano walk. AGENT NEELEY * Salvano?! Are you crazy? What does he have to do with this?
E: rips himself free
C: NICO
D: That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! I've used that shit.
E: struggles to master his rage MORE
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 46.
C: NICO
D: I know what it smells like, I know what it blows like --
E: CONT'D
N: Neeley glares at Nico. * AGENT NEELEY * Salvano never came near that C-4. It's in federal holding now! Besides, why would he blow up a church?
C: NICO
D: I tailed Salvano. Two days ago. Him and one of his apes were in that church -- and they weren't taking communion. I saw some broad saw who was with his lawyer plant the bomb. Now I want some goddamn answers. AGENT NEELEY * You tailed him? After I ordered you off?
C: NICO
D: Where is he? Where's Salvano? AGENT NEELEY * My orders were release him. Not babysit him. Neeley brushes Nico's fingermarks off his lapels. * AGENT NEELEY * You think you're rough stuff, Toscani -- martial arts hero, chop suey crap. Well I'll tell you something: you're not bullet- proof. You're not even a good cop. You sneak around, playing your street dick games. But all you come up with is conjecture, wild coincidence and bullshit.
E: composes himself; reclaims his dignity
C: NICO
D: I want the agent who signed for the explosives.
N: AGENT NEELEY * I'll do my job. You do yours.
C: NICO
D: Bank on it, pal.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 47. Nico stalks off. The door slams.
T: CUT TO:
N: 186 MONTAGE WITH SCORE
S: A) EXT. "BOGOTA" (SALVANO'S RESTAURANT) - LATE AFTERNOON *
N: Nico's unmarked car whips in front. Nico storms toward the front door of the restaurant.
S: B) INT. RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON *
N: Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's office. The man is gone.
S: C) INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Jackson has her list from the hospital. A coroner and his assitant show her a body on a slab. The body is that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw in the front * row of the church. Jackson takes notes. The dead man * is definitely not the ethnic type you'd expect in St. Mary's congregation.
S: D) EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON
N: The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers. All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano not here. E) CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON takes Polaroids of the dead man's I.D. and personal effects. 187 CLOSEUP OF DEAD MAN'S EFFECTS as Jackson's flash pops. We see clearly a U.S. Senate staff ID, a U.S. Senate office building parking pass and an Illinois driver's license with address.
S: 188 EXT. AFFLUENT BROWNSTONE - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Nico comes storming out. A Maid and a bodyguard follow after him screaming. The door slams. We see it is missing a panel.
C: MAID
D: You gonna be in real trouble, mister, when El Senor Salvano find out about dis.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 48.
S: 189 EXT. ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area off while a TV news crew photographs the damage. Jackson * talks with neighborhood people, asking questions.
S: 190 EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON
N: Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be- fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero; Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga- rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward his car --
C: FIRST LATINO
D: 'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light? Nico slows, eyeing the guy dubiously. As he reaches to his jacket -- The side door of the van flashes open. A .38 is leveled straight at Nico's head. Instantly three other Latino hoods leap to the sidewalk.
E: polite, casual
C: FIRST LATINO
D: Don't even think about it, motherfucker. Machete Man snatches Nico's gun from its shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
E: machete under jacket First Latino
C: MACHETE MAN
D: You come to our streets... fuck with our people. Now our people gonna fuck with you.
E: FIRST LATINO
N: The five advance on Nico.
C: PIPE MAN
D: We ain't gonna shoot you, man. We gonna beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to 'get down.'
T: 191 QUICK CUTS
N: A) Nico is trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a moment of stillness, as if all senses are clicking out of normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi- ness. Then: B) Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away, keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete, slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash- ing, half-unconscious. C) Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc, blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in pain. D) Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow, flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail- ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free. E) Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four, and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu- tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third, machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re- mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at his own groin. F) Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des- perately to regain his senses. He tries to get Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a- way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror, bolts. G) Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the head, then tears off after Machete Man --
S: 192 EXT. STREET - DAY
N: Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past, straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing -- 193 ANGLE DOWN BLOCK An all-out foot face. Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans. TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.
C: FIRST GIRL
D: Fly, baby! 194 NICO
N: tears after this human cannonball. Amazingly, he's gaining --
S: 195 INT. BODEGA - DAY
N: Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --
S: 196 EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY
N: Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side -- 197 BACK TO NICCO pursuing along the same route. 198 MACHETE MAN claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame- work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a- bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico, starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours. Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously. Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad- jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- 199 BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.
C: MACHETE MAN
D: No, hermano. Please --
E: to Nico, in terror
N: Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard from the chase.
C: NICO
D: Who put up the money?
C: MACHETE MAN
D: What money?
N: Nico grabs him by the hair.
C: NICO
D: You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. Who paid you?
E: twists the youth's neck
C: MACHETE MAN
D: I told ya! No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
C: NICO
D: Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
E: shouting
C: NICO
D: Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike.
C: MACHETE MAN
D: Jimmy Constanza! Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.
C: NICO
D: If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen.
N: Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away. Instantly Machete Man changes his tune.
C: MACHETE MAN
D: Salvano! Bautista Salvano!
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 52. Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face. He hits the ground with a thud.

C: SARA
D: Thank God you couldn't find your shoes. We would of have been sitting in the front row. Alright, I know the rules -- I don't ask you don't tell. But could've died today and I deserve to know. Why did we go to church this morning?
E: beat beat
C: NICO
D: I'm willing to break the rules; I'm willing to tell you whatever I know. But I need some time. Could you just give me some time? Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico glance at each other --

C: NICO
D: This better be good, Jax.
E: into phone
C: MAN
D: It's bad, Nico.
E: V.O. filtered

N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 54.

C: NICO

C: VOICE THROUGH DOOR
D: F.B.I., Toscani. Open up. Nico pulls aside a curtained glass panel; he recognizes two uniformed police officers, plus Neeley and Halloran, * the FBI agents who authorized the release of Salvano. He lowers his gun, opens the door. The cops surge in.

C: NICO
D: It's all right, darling.
N: Two agents enter the room carrying Nico's confiscated papers and tapes and begin rummaging through dressers, jewelry boxes and closets. Rosa crosses swiftly to calm Sara. *
C: ROSA
D: Who do you think you are -- coming in here like this, treating my son like a criminal? SARA * Why are you terrifying us? There's an infant here! Nico pulls on a jacket. He looks like he could kill. He restrains himself for his family's sake.

C: AGENT HALLORAN
D: You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.'
N: Nico comes out of his chair, going for Halloran. Strozah tries to block him, but it's useless. LIEUTENANT STROZAH * Nico! You damn fool! You wanna go to prison?! Nico stops. He's speechless with rage. His finger points toward Halloran like a loaded gun. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 58. CROWDER * (indicates more depositions) Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure --
C: NICO
D: You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY * You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you--
E: spits on papers angrily
N: Nico contains his fury. He steps away from Strozah, with a gesture that says "I won't hurt you."
C: NICO
D: Fred. You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table.

N: She shows Nico and Lukich the Polaroids we saw her take in the morgue.
C: JACKSON
D: Alan Singletary. He's an aide to Senator Harrison. Nico is electrified.

D: Stay with 'em. We'll be there.
C: LUKICH
D: What's going on, Nico? What happened?
C: NICO
D: I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger. Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet. But if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy.
C: LUKICH
D: You got a weapon? Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map pocket. Nico pulls out a Sig Saur .45.
C: LUKICH
D: Try this on. Jackson watches Luke slip Nico a clip. * CUT TO:
S: 217 INT. DAY CARE CENTER (BEHIND CHURCH) - MORNING
N: OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees. They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been burned and family members murdered. The refugees have been moved from church basement to a back room in the day care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people. Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear.
C: NICO
D: Sister... you know me. Tell them there's no need for fear.
E: to nun
C: SISTER BONIFACIA
D: There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.
N: (THE REST OF THE SCENE MAY BE IN ENGLISH, OR SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES, AT THE DIRECTOR'S DISCRETION.)
C: NICO
D: I was there... in the church. They tried to kill my family, too. Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but they are terrified.
E: to refugees
C: NICO
D: I know there was a man here, from an American senator's office. Who was he going to speak to? The refugees become increasingly anxious.
C: NICO
D: Was it you, senora? Was it you? More silence. Glances among the people. Finally:
E: to one woman to a man
C: REFUGEE WOMAN
D: The priest. The others shrink. The Woman glances to them.

D: Who? Father Genarro?
E: gently
C: REFUGEE WOMAN
D: The other one.
N: Nico looks to the American priest standing there.
C: REFUGEE WOMAN
D: No. The young one. From Costa Rica.
N: Sister Bonifacia sighs.
C: SISTER BONIFACIA
D: Father Tomassino.
N: Jackson has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows too much has already been revealed; she must speak.
C: SISTER BONIFACIA
D: He came alone... two weeks ago. He had papers. Papers to give to the senator.
N: Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by losing his calm.
C: NICO
D: But the bomb... The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit.
C: SISTER BONIFACIA
D: Father Tomassino was going to give the Mass that day. Father Genarro talked him out of it.
E: shaken
N: The refugees' faces confirm this.
C: NICO
D: It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill.
E: understands
N: Bonifacia starts softly to cry. Nico puts his hand on her shoulder, comforting her.
C: NICO
D: Where is Tomassino? Where is he now? The nun shakes her head. Nico looks to the refugees. They don't know, either.
C: REFUGEE MAN
D: He run, mister. He go --
N: He gestures: "who knows where?"
C: NICO
D: If you know where he is, you've got to tell me. I want to help him. I can help him. The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder -- 218 EXT. CHURCH DAY CARE BUILDING - DAY

N: Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face. Urgency fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought --
S: 220 EXT. INTERSECTION - MORNING
N: Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart * while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street. * 221 ANOTHER CAR ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH- ING to a stop head-on to Nico's door. Its doors spring open -- 222 NICO dives toward his own passenger door -- 223 SECOND CAR - TWO MORE ARMED MEN leap out, OPEN FIRE with pistols and automatic weapons.
T: 224 QUICK CUTS
N: Nico's car riddled with a furious FUSILLADE. WINDOWS BLOW OUT; the driver's door is shredded -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 64. 225 NICO - ON FLOORBOARD crawling frantically; shoving the passenger door open as a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS BLAZES all around him. 226 FOUR MEN FIRING point blank (6 to ten feet) into Nico's car. The men are cool, professional. 227 NICO spills from the passenger door onto the ground, scrambles like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers' cars. 228 PEDESTRIANS AROUND INTERSECTION scream and scatter in terror. 229 FOUR MEN FIRING as shells spew from the ejection ports of their weapons. 230 NICO'S CAR being chewed to pieces -- 231 NICO - UNDER MEN'S CAR * crawling at full speed from the car's front to its back. On the ground, alongside the car, spent CARTRIDGE CASES RAIN like hailstones. 232 FOUR MEN As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free, GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader waves two men forward to check their kill. At that instant: 233 NICO springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45 * clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars to envelop his attackers.)
C: NICO
D: Over here, you sons-a-bitches! Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster- nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon --
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 65.
C: NICO
D: Try it. Be my guest.
E: eyes like an animal
N: The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a corner grocery store. A phone inside.

E: gestures with gun
S: 234 INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - DAY

C: NICO
D: Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow.
C: NICO
D: Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE -- The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re- * ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --
N: 235 POV FROM OUTSIDE STORE It looks like a tornado has hit the interior. Magazine RACKS CRASH, mayo jars fly through the air, the ICE MACHINE seems to EXPLODE as a man's back careens into it -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 66. 236 STREET CORNER UP BLOCK Two police cars heave into view, SIRENS WAILING -- 237 FRONT DOORS OF STORE Nico takes the last man, lifts him up, and drives him like a battering ram straight through the glass. 238 NICO Wild-eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars whipping into the corner.

It's Bonifacia, the nun from the church (though now in civvies). The Middle-Aged Woman with the donation can raises it as if asking for a contribution. Bonificia looks flustered, impatient. She really doesn't want to leave the door open.

They both appear dead. 288 CLOSE - FATHER TOMASSINO He is in a chair, his wrists strapped to the chair arms. He is sweating, fearful but clinging to his courage. 289 ANOTHER ANGLE Behind Father Tomassino, we see Salvano, Chi Chi and two other goons, armed with pistols. Salvano moves toward the priest, sets a small TV table down beside him. The priest glances toward it -- 290 PRIEST'S POV - TV TABLE Atop its rickety surface: a fearsome array of syringes and drug vials. 291 BACK TO FATHER TOMASSINO He glances up from the hypodermics -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 80. 292 PRIEST'S POV INTO FRAME moves Kurt Zagon!

S: 299 EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ROOF OF TENEMENT
N: Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door open -- 300 STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof. Nico opens the door leading to the top (third) floor.

Nico comes back toward the apartment door. Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC CONTINUES from inside. 304 INSIDE APARTMENT Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.
C: ZAGON
D: -- Tell me the truth, Father -- The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell.
E: O.S.

E: close to priest
C: FATHER TOMASSINO

N: The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him. Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed- off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE- BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan- taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs Lukich, dives out the door with him -- 307 HALLWAY Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt. BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER everywhere. Nico shoves Lukich toward the stairwell --

E: in Spanish, from apartment
N: Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs! Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll, down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony, * twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench- man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
C: ZAGON
D: Now! Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, SHOOTING at Nico. 308 INTERCUT - ELEVATED TRAIN THUNDERING along the tracks adjacent to the building.

N: Nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts all around him with GUNFIRE from the floor below! He dives sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate, taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico is trapped -- in the open. 310 ZAGON AND SALVANO pop back out, aiming at Nico -- 311 NICO leaps off the roof! 312 ANGLE - ELEVATED TRAIN - MOVING Nico lands on the roof of the speeding "el" train, his momentum nearly carrying him off the far side -- 313 NICO - ATOP TRAIN catches a railing, claws at it.

N: Passengers file aboard a flight to Toronto. Hugs, goodbyes. Rosa, carrying the baby, is among the crowd moving toward the boarding door. Leaving with them are two of Branca's men. We PICK OUT Branca and two of his bodyguards near the fringes, looking inobtrusive but definitely on guard. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 92A/93. 352 CORNER NEAR BRANCA Hidden by a bank of phones, Sara clings to Nico, holding * him as tight as she can. When she releases him, we can't hear what she says, but it seems like, "Be careful, please be careful." Nico glances to Branca, who motions subtly to hurry. He squeezes Sara's hand, she joins the crowd swelling * toward the boarding door --

C: VOICE
D: Not even you can hit him at this range, Nico. O.S. behind Nico: the unmistakable sound of a .45 SAFETY being CLICKED OFF. Nico freezes, his back to the voice. He raises his hands.
E: O.S.
C: NICO
D: That wasn't the plan, Nelson. 366 NELSON FOX covers Nico from behind with a silencer-fitted .45. He glances to the briefcase and building plans, on the floor.

C: NICO
D: I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.
E: back still turned
C: FOX
D: Roof's wired too. Sensors every fifteen feet. Fox's finger rests ready on the trigger.
C: FOX
D: You can turn now. Slowly. Slooowly... Nico turns. We see Fox clearly now. His boyish features have weathered since his "spook" days in Vietnam. There is grey in his hair now: he wears an expensive suit and is alone.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 96.

N: Fox maintains a slight distance behind Nico as they cross to- ward some escalators under a sign: "TO PARKING LEVEL 8."
C: NICO
D: The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him --

N: They reach a corner and turn. 97A.

D: But the priest found out somehow and ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's number 'till you knew if the priest had talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was in on it -- and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 98. 370 PARKING GARAGE - VALET STATION * Several guests and diners wait by the cashier's booth for their cars to be fetched. Valets hustle with tickets. Fox and Nico come off the escalator.
C: FOX
D: If your name was Joe Smith I never would have caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani's are there?
C: NICO
D: You got it off the arrest sheet.
N: Fox hands his ticket to the cashier, motions Nico to the side, away from the guests, still keeping his distance -- should Nico try to make a move.
C: FOX
D: I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go.
C: NICO
D: Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice. It's all crystal clear to Nico now.
C: NICO
D: So we kill our own senators now.
C: FOX
D: Why not? The Romans did.
N: A Cadillac pulls up; the valet hops out, two particularly florid, well-fed guests get in, tipping the valet.
C: NICO
D: Are we the Romans?
E: to Fox, watching the guests
C: FOX
D: We're an empire too.
N: Fox doesn't like the look Nico gives him.

D: You 'consult.' You 'assist.' You send checks to your family. Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team --
C: NICO
D: Fuck you.
C: FOX
D: In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a GS-15 pension. Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care --
C: NICO
D: You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people. And probably they all deserve it -- He takes a step toward Fox. Fox's hand tightens on his gun.
C: NICO
D: -- but you and I know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what... 60,000 non- military personnel. Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers, doctors... women, children... and that's just a sliver of it. Fox tries to maintain a hard face. But his own guilty conscience is working --
E: emotion rising ticks off the beats

D: 371 A BIG CAR * SCREECHES to a halt in front of them. Five men dismount * swiftly. Salvano, Bad Dude, and two agent types from the * tenement... and Zagon! * Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and Fox, playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns.
C: NICO
D: Well... well. What a team we have here.
C: ZAGON
D: We've been looking for you, Nelson. I see you've found our friend.
E: calls, friendly
N: Fox looks shaky, unnerved: Nico's words have hit too close to home. Now Nico backs away a step, ready for anything. One of Zagon's agents holds their car's rear door open. *
C: NICO
D: Thanks for the help, Fox.
C: FOX
D: I didn't bring him, Nico. I swear it!
C: ZAGON
D: Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?
N: Zagon waves Nico and Fox toward his car. Zagon and * Salvano start forward. Fox glances, torn, to Nico, who has backed away another half-step. Will Nico attack? Run for it? 100A.
C: FOX
D: Stay still! Don't fucking move!!
E: to Nico
N: Fox pulls his .45 from concealment, covering Nico. An EVENING-GOWNED WOMAN, waiting with her husband for their car, hears Fox's shout, sees his gun.
C: EVENING GOWN WOMAN
D: Jack --
E: grabs her husband's arm
N: The husband sees. So do the other guests. Salvano sees their alarm; he swings his jacket open, revealing a snub machine gun. Someone SCREAMS --
C: ZAGON
D: Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --
C: ZAGON
D: Be a good boy -- 372 FOX
N: His moment of truth.
C: FOX
D: Dive, Nico!! He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety.
C: ZAGON
D: Move! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He joins Zagon, rushing forward --
E: to first agent, advancing
N: 373 RAMP TO LOWER LEVELS A valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car. Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 102. 374 ZAGON AND SALVANO tear around the corner at the top of the ramp. Both OPEN FIRE as -- 375 NICO - IN CAR highballs straight toward them! 376 SALVANO hold the trigger down, FULL AUTOMATIC -- 377 NICO'S CAR (MOVING) Nico drops below the dash, driving blind. The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART, both FRONT TIRES EXPLODE, the RADIATOR BLASTS STEAM -- 378 ZAGON Reloading as Salvano FIRES. 379 NICO'S CAR pinwheels out of control, its nose facing away from Salvano and Zagon. The car BRAKES FURIOUSLY -- 380 NICO hits reverse, looking back over the seat -- 381 NICO'S POV - THROUGH REAR CAR WINDOW He sees Salvano, his clip empty now, hurrying to wrestle a fresh magazine in -- 382 ANGLE - NICO'S CAR AND SALVANO Nico floors it in reverse, slamming into Salvano, lifting him off his feet, smashing him with the car into a metal * grate wall. * 383 SALVANO A horrible death.

D: You there --
E: shouts to Zagon
N: Zagon spins, rips both guards with a FIERCE BURST! The Guards drop. Zagon turns to -- 387 NICO - OUT OF CAR on his feet, charging straight at Zagon. Nico grabs him, slams Zagon with incredible force into a concrete column. Zagon's gun goes flying, but miraculously he spins away. Nico dives for him, gets his neck in a grip that is certain to snap it in half a second. But -- 388 ZAGON'S KNIFE appears in the torturer's hand. It slashes Nico, right a- cross his already wounded ribs! Nico cries in agony -- 389 ZAGON scampers free. Nico gets to his feet, bleeding. Nico is between Zagon and Zagon's machine gun on the ground. Zagon bolts for his car. Nico dives for the gun -- * 390 CAR * Zagon floors it into a SCORCHING 360, BLASTS up the exit ramp, out of Nico's line of fire -- 391 NICO leaps into the other, half-destroyed car. Its two front tires are flat, windshield blown out, RADIATOR POURING STEAM. Nico does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the metal in reverse, BLASTS across the ramp divider, takes off after Zagon in reverse -- 392 ON RAMP - ZAGON'S CAR * Another car is coming down. Zagon sideswipes it into a wall, keeps going -- 393 ON RAMP - NICO'S WRECKED CAR Rear TIRES CHURNING smoke, FRONT FLATS SCRAPING on their rims... he pours on the speed -- 394 TOP OF RAMP - HOTEL ACCESS DRIVE Zagon's car whips out into the night-time commotion. Pedestrians, POLICE SIRENS O.S. Zagon looks behind him -- 395 NICO'S CAR - TOP OF RAMP hurtles into view in reverse! ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 104. 396 ZAGON'S CAR * is trapped by the traffic. Zagon looks around wildly, then floors the accelerator. Zagon's car bucks straight up the * pedestrian steps, onto the plaza! Strollers scream and scatter as it fishtails wildly, careening toward the * huge stone fountain -- 397 NICO'S WRECKED CAR Follows, pouring smoke, in reverse! Nico cuts Zagon off, CRASHES into Zagon's car broadside, sending it skittering * sideways into the fountain retaining wall -- 398 ZAGON leaps free, sprints toward the hotel alley. Nico takes off after him on foot --
S: 399 EXT. ALLEY - REAR OF HOTEL - NIGHT
N: Zagon races down the darkest of alleys, rounds a corner -- 400 NICO hurtles after him, gaining. Nico whips around the alley corner, straight into: 401 FOUR ARMED AGENTS waiting beside a plain grey TV remote van. Nico skitters * to a stop as a shotgun, an M-16 and two pistols cover him. Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire --
C: ZAGON

E: O.S.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87 105.
C: ZAGON
D: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
E: O.S.
N: 405 NICO in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him. One agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around Nico's throat. Shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull. 406 ZAGON finishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink. He is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed. When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing to operate.
C: ZAGON
D: We've got an hour before the honorable senator. You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.
E: hands towel to pistol agent
N: Zagon turns to Nico.
C: NICO
D: How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.
C: ZAGON
D: I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.
E: lifts a needle to the light
N: Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted glove.
C: ZAGON
D: Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side, * seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head.
E: to agents
N: Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --
C: ZAGON
D: Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.
C: ZAGON
D: This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico.
N: 407 NICO reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him- self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
C: ZAGON
D: That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently.
C: ZAGON
D: Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart --
N: Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently.
C: ZAGON
D: That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing --
C: ZAGON
D: A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani --
E: moves closer, blade in hand
N: The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor, half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot- gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall. The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon, spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in! Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He yanks the choke cable off his neck -- 408 ZAGON - AGAINST WALL On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.
C: ZAGON
D: Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much longer --
C: NICO
D: Long enough to finish you. Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound.
N: ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 108. As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers toward the door --
