S: 15 EXT. A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH DAY
N: CHORUS (Cont) To the late night double feature Picture Show. The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO WIDE-SCREEN. The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds from the church organ. The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting excitedly. The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill. PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures. BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid- twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH. BRAD and RALPH shake hands.
C: RALPH
D: Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!
C: BRAD
D: Well I don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.
C: RALPH
D: Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.
C: BRAD
D: Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him. We drove over to see him last vacation. It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton.
N: BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet. JANET catches it. She squeals with delight. The GUESTS cheer.
C: RALPH
D: Hey fella. It looks like it could be your turn next.
C: BRAD
D: Who knows...ha ha.
N: RALPH & BETTY drive off. GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great enthusiasm. GUESTS begin to disperse. JANET & BRAD linger outside the church. So do a strange FAMILY : An old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter. They resemble the Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting. The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church doors. Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside. The FAMILY, and the MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place. JANET (who is holding the bouquet) Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful. Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Monroe. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. BRAD (Still looking after the car) Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a lucky guy. (They start to move d.s.)
C: JANET
D: Yes.
C: BRAD
D: Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
C: JANET

S: 18 INT. A STUDY NIGHT
N: Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world. A well-padded armchair has its back to the camera. It swings around revealing the NARRATOR. He is in his smoking jacket. He speaks directly to us.
C: NARRATOR
D: I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey.
N: He crosses to the bookshelf. He selects a dossier. We see the title: "The Denton Affair". He returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand. He puts on his reading glasses.
C: NARRATOR
D: It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving. It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.
E: two young ordinary healthy kids
N: On a night out. He closes the book marking the place. Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.
C: NARRATOR
D: It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time.
N: Lighting cracks on the sound track. WIPE TO
S: 19 EXT. NIGHT
N: A windscreen wiper working under strain. Torrential rain on the windscreen. BRAD concentrating on visibility. JANET eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow. A motorcycle roars past them.

D: Gosh. That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They certainly take their lives in their hands. What with the weather and all.
C: BRAD
D: Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.
N: JANET takes another stick of gum. Offers BRAD some. He declines. The car slows to a halt.
C: JANET
D: What's the matter Brad, darling?
N: Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".
C: BRAD

D: There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are.
N: They have passed a row of trees. A rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky. It has a flag flying from the turret. Lightning strikes.

C: BRAD
D: Just a moment, Janet. They may have a telephone.
N: The door opens. Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there is a party going on in the distance. The figure we have seen at the window emerges. He is a hunch-backed servant, RIFF RAFF.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Hello.
C: BRAD
D: Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?

S: 41 INT. BALLROOM NIGHT
N: BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom. At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium. In the body of the room are GUESTS. They are the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road. They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth. It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom. They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear. They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding. A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.
C: GUESTS

C: MAGENTA
D: It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all.
N: BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm. In another dimension. (she forces them back towards balcony) With voyeuristic intention. BRAD blushes. Well secluded I see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same. They are back at the balcony. You're spaced out on sensation. They are at the edge of the balcony. Like you're under sedation. They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper. The GUESTS turn on them.
C: GUESTS
D: Let's do the Time Warp again.
N: BRAD and JANET are completely dismayed.

S: 53A INT. HALL/LIFT NIGHT
N: BRAD and JANET retreat to the hall. Behind them a lift slowly descends bearing a figure in a black cloak and a diamante stiletto heel - beating time to a rhythm the band has started playing.
C: JANET
D: Brad, please lets get out of here.
C: BRAD
D: For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

C: JANET
D: Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
C: BRAD
D: I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
N: GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift. JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner. JANET faints. GO TO COLOUR AT BEGINNING OF FOLLOWING SCENE
S: 54 INT. LIFT/HALL NIGHT
N: The figure turns and throws open lift cage door. As camera zooms in to the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to colour. However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the mouth of their host. SONG: "SWEET TRANSVESTITE"
C: FRANK
D: How do you do.
N: I see you've met my faithful handyman. He's a little brought down - Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman. RIFF RAFF scowls.
S: 54A INT. BALLROOM NIGHT

N: FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.
C: FRANK
D: Don't judge a book by its cover I'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night I'm one hell of a lover.
N: JANET gives a silent scream. FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire. The GUESTS scream with delight.
C: FRANK
D: I'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.
N: He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks. Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound You look like you're both pretty groovie. He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom. Or if you want something visual not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie. BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK. FRANK meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests.
C: BRAD
D: I'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry.
N: JANET joins BRAD.
C: JANET
D: Right!
C: BRAD
D: We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
N: FRANK turns on them.
C: FRANK
D: You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright I'll get you a satanic mechanic.
N: FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom. Streamers fall.
C: FRANK
D: I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.
N: From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over the next verse.
C: FRANK
D: Why dont'cha stay for the night
N: RIFF & MAGENTA "night" Or maybe a bite RIFF & MAGENTA "bite" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension. We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.

N: On the last chord the lift has disappeared. The GUESTS applaud ecstatically. RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA close in on BRAD and JANET. They remove BRAD and JANET's wet clothes. COLUMBIA moves down from the bandstand and crosses to BRAD and JANET. She witnesses the undressing.
C: COLUMBIA
D: Slowly, slowly. It's too nice a job to rush.
N: The GUESTS moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed. BRAD and JANET stand shivering in their underwear. There is complete silence. The GUESTS and SERVANTS are motionless. BRAD and JANET are the total object of their attention.

C: JANET
D: Oh Brad.
C: BRAD
D: It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
E: confidentially
N: He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.
C: BRAD
D: Ah, hi. My name is Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. You are ...
C: COLUMBIA
D: You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory. Some people would give their right arm for the privilege.
N: RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift. The GUESTS rush for positions.
C: BRAD
D: People like you maybe
C: COLUMBIA
D: I've seen it.
N: COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift. RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them. He slams the cage door. The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under RIFF RAFF's control. BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side. They stare straight ahead.
C: JANET
D: It he - Frank - is he your husband?
E: to Magenta
N: General amusement.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: The Master is not yet married. Nor do I think he ever will be. We are simply his servants.
C: JANET
D: Oh.
N: The lift grinds to a halt. They have arrived at the laboratory.
T: CUT TO
S: 69 INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium. It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator. A chandelier hangs above the tank. On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. Near the podium are some weights. Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents. The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives. FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room. RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK.
C: FRANK
D: Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.
N: As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift. They cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.
C: FRANK
D: I will entertain...ah...
N: BRAD & JANET step out of the lift.
C: BRAD
D: I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
C: JANET
D: Weiss.
C: BRAD
D: Weiss.
N: FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss) Encante....How nice. (he circles them) And what charming underclothes you both have. (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on. They'll make you feel less vulnerable. MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium. FRANK (continues) It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. BRAD (Moving towards Frank) Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore. JANET (Hurring after Brad) Don't be ungrateful Brad. BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank) Ungrateful! The room falls silent. All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction. A smile breaks on his face.
C: FRANK
D: How forceful you are Brad. Such a perfect specimen of manhood. So dominant.
N: MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh. You must be awfully proud of him Janet.
C: JANET
D: Well, yes I am.
N: THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.
C: FRANK
D: Do you have any tattoos Brad.
C: BRAD
D: Certainly not!
C: FRANK
D: Oh well. How about you.
E: He laughs
N: RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Everything is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word.
N: FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass. RIFF RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium
C: FRANK
D: Tonight...One, one, one. Can you hear me at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.
N: MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.
C: FRANK
D: Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research.
N: There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.
C: FRANK
D: And paradise is to be mine.
N: GUESTS and everybody applaud. JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that she shouldn't.
C: FRANK
D: It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. All the pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you'r been. What a fool. The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it happen. An accident!
E: He cracks the bones in his hand
N: MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him. MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly) An accident.
C: FRANK
D: That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life.
N: GUESTS applaud. FRANK (Moving to tank) You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate. For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born. Everybody applauds. FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank. RIFF RAFF is at the control panel.
S: 70 INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: The tank is revealed. There is something inside it is immersed in clear fluid. The GUESTS are astonished.
C: FRANK
D: Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.
N: RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.
C: FRANK
D: And step up the reactor power input three more points.
N: RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel. FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered. It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank. The liquids bubble and change colour. The thing inside begins to look like a human form.
C: JANET
D: Brad...
C: BRAD
D: It's alright Janet.
N: The liquids drain away. The form begins to move. FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other. ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched. RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head. ROCKY looks at RIFF RAFF then at FRANK. With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above. At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle. He winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.
S: 71 INT. THE LABORATORY NIGHT
N: SONG: THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES. ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.
C: ROCKY
D: The Sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head.
N: FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the chandelier. FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down. MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.
C: ROCKY
D: And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread.
N: Oh, woe is me. My life is a misery. Oh, can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer.... As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the tank....because... ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages.
C: ROCKY
D: I woke up this morning With a start When I fell out of bed.
N: GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime.
C: ROCKY
D: And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
C: GUESTS
D: That ain't no crime
C: ROCKY
D: My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
N: And all I know Is I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer. FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck. ROCKY spins away. MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest bandage so that it undoes as he goes. GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA) Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
C: ROCKY
D: Oh, no no, no no.
C: GUESTS
D: Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
C: ROCKY
D: No no no, no no.
C: GUESTS
D: Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
N: ROCKY is now unbandaged. He strikes a pose. During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.
S: 72 INT. STUDY NIGHT
N: NARRATOR reading from book.
C: NARRATOR
D: Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was doing just fine.
N: He was the product Of another time. And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime.
S: 73 INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall. ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS. GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime. ROCKY (To first group of guests) The sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head.

C: GUESTS
D: That ain't no crime.
N: ROCKY (To third group) Oh, woe is me - My life is a mystery. (To fourth group) Oh can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer. ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again. (FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)
C: GUESTS

D: Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
N: At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap below. RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their positions in front of it.
S: 74 INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: FRANK picks himself up. ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.
C: FRANK
D: Well. That's no way to behave on your first day out.
N: ROCKY looks hurt. But as you're such an exceptional beauty I'm prepared to forgive. FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank. I just love success. RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank) He is a credit to your genius, Master.
C: FRANK
D: Yes.
N: MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls) A triumph of your vill.
C: FRANK
D: Yes.
N: COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank) He's o.k.
C: FRANK
D: O.K? I think we can do a little better than that.
E: Moving out behind tank towards Janet and Brad
N: You. (To Janet) What do you think?
C: JANET
D: Well. I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
E: She looks at Brad
C: FRANK
D: I didn't make him for you
N: JANET nods hastily. FRANK moves towards microphone. He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't even take the lessons.
S: 74A INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: SONG: CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1) As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium. COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

E: ROCKY sits on horse

N: GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK. But the wrong man.

N: Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days, GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.
C: FRANK
D: He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk.
N: FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand. FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up. When, in just seven days - Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.) I can make you A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).
S: 75 INT. LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR NIGHT
N: The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a drawbridge. Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar. Several guests are crushed to death.
C: COLUMBIA
D: Eddie!
C: EDDIE
D: Stay cool baby.
C: JANET
D: Who's Eddie?
C: RIFF RAFF
D: The delivery boy.

C: EDDIE
D: Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed up sharp And you felt alright It don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life and I thought I was divine.
N: COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat. I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go And listen to the music on the radio. The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well. A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show And we climbed in the back And we really had a good time COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour. The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase. COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE. Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.
C: ALL
D: Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll
E: four times
N: EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose. FRANK is getting furious. ROCKY is perplexed.
C: EDDIE
D: My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine.
N: Get back in front and put Some hair oil on. Buddy Holly was singing His very last song. With your arms around your girl You tried to - ah - sing along It felt pretty good, whoo. Really had a good ti-i-ime. EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike. He takes off and roars round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.
C: ALL
D: Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll.
N: Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll. Hot patootie Bless my soul. You know I love that rock and roll. Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll. 4 bars instrumental (saxophone) FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, innocently.

THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL! On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a demented fury. THE GUESTS are unbelieving. COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands. EDDIE is dead. FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned. JANET screams and screams.
S: 77 INT. LAB NIGHT
N: DIALOGUE SEQUENCE MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the ice bucket.

D: One from the vaults.
N: RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge. And so perish all those who reject my love! ROCKY cowers in terror. Oh no, my little Adonis - You're much too beautiful to be destroyed. He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle. ROCKY flexes. FRANK is thrilled.

His eyes are full of hate. He looks at MAGENTA. She nods to him. He releases the chains. ROCKY stirs. RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY. ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified. RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face. ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes. RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.

C: NARRATOR
D: "If" and "Only", two small words. Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts. But it was too late to go back now. It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave. It would be folly to fight against it. Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive.
N: WIPE TO

C: FRANK
D: Don't play games, Dr Scott. You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here. It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you. Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans. I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott. I know Brad is.
N: BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated.
C: DR SCOTT
D: I can assure you that Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me. I came to find Eddie.
C: BRAD
D: Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
T: FRANK cuts in quickly.

N: FRANK leads the way to the lift.
S: 118 INT. THE STUDY NIGHT
C: NARRATOR
D: Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals. The breaking of bread - the last meal of the condemned man - and now this meal. However informal it might appear you can be sure there was to be very little 'bonhomie'.
S: 119 INT. DINING ROOM NIGHT
N: At the head of a large coffin shaped table sits FRANK. There is an electric carver on the table in front of him. The table is laid for dinner and present are JANET & BRAD on FRANK's right, DR. SCOTT opposite him, ROCKY HORROR on Dr. Scott's right and between ROCKY and FRANK, COLUMBIA. They sit in silence as the double doors open. RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA enter. RIFF RAFF carries a large joint of meat, MAGENTA the wine, both of which they set down at the head of the table. RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA pour out the wine and return to the side of FRONT who then rises.
C: FRANK
D: A toast to absent friends.
C: ALL

D: Eddie!
N: FRANK (Silencing her with a gesture) It's a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone. Everybody looks at their food carefully. COLUMBIA rises.

D: Oh!
N: FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank. (music under this dialogue)
C: DR. SCOTT
D: You won't find earth people quite the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer - it is, I suppose, some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device....
C: BRAD
D: You mean...
C: DR. SCOTT
D: Yes Brad. It's something we ourselves have been working on. But it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it. A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even time itself!
C: JANET
D: You mean he's gonna send us to another planet?
N: FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor.
C: FRANK

C: BRAD
D: You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.
N: FRANK signals to MAGENTA. BCS MAGENTA's hand on the transducer switch. BRAD is turned into a statute.

S: 147 INT. LABORATORY NIGHT
N: DIALOGUE SEQUENCE.
C: COLUMBIA
D: My God! I can't take any more of this - first you spurn me for Eddie, then you cast him off like an old overcoat for Rocky. You chew people up and then spit them out - I loved you, do you hear me - I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - I'll tell you - a big nothing. You're like a sponge. You take, take, take, take! You drain others of their love and emotions. Well, I've had enough. You've got to choose between me and Rocky - so named because of the rocks in his head.
N: FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.
C: FRANK
D: It's not easy having a good time.
N: He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA Even smiling makes my face ache. RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically. He lies on the operating table. They massage.

C: MAGENTA
D: When will we return to Transylvania? I grow weary of this world.
E: massaging his temples
C: FRANK
D: Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother RIff Raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me I can be quite generous.
N: MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.
C: MAGENTA
D: I ask for nothing, Master.
N: FRANK leaps up from the table.
C: FRANK
D: And you shall receive it - in abundance. Come. We are ready for the floor show. Our guests will be growing restless.
E: he goes to the lift he slams the lift gate
N: The lift moves downwards. Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other. They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway. WIPE TO
S: 148 INT. STUDY NIGHT
C: NARRATOR
D: And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.
N: WIPE TO 149 INT. BALLROOM (including STAGE) NIGHT MUSIC: "THE FLOOR SHOW" We see the stage at the end of the ballroom with red velvet curtains. 150 BACKSTAGE NIGHT FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage.

C: DR. SCOTT
D: Ach, we've got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our wills. I've got to be strong and try to hang on. Or else my mind, may well snap.

N: DR SCOTT switches on wind machine. I've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home. I'm going home.
S: 164 INT. BALLROOM NIGHT
N: MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK who is in an attitude of supplication.
C: MAGENTA
D: How sentimental.
N: RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: And also presumptuous of you. You see when I said "we" were to return to Transylvania, I referred only to Magenta and myself.
N: FRANK looks appalled. The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of the "We".
C: RIFF RAFF
D: You see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway.
N: He produces a ray gun.
C: DR SCOTT
D: Great Heavens, that's a laser.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Yes, Dr Scott. A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
C: BRAD
D: You mean you're going to kill him? What's his crime?
C: DR SCOTT
D: You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be protected.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Exactly, Dr Scott. Now Frank N. Furter, your time has come. Say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.
N: FRANK raises himself to his full height.
C: FRANK
D: Do your worse - inferior one.
N: As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them. She is killed instantly. RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK. FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain. The entire proscenium crashes under the weight. And FRANK is crushed to death among the velvet and glittered facia. ROCKY breaks down completely. Although he despised FRANK, he was all he had in the world. He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms. RIFF RAFF can stand no more. He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway towards the fox skyline. RIFF RAFF fires again and again. With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle. RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam. ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture. RIFF RAFF fires again and again. They crash to their deaths.
C: BRAD
D: Good God.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Yes.
C: JANET
D: You've killed them.

D: You're OK by me.
E: the big sell-out
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
C: DR SCOTT
D: Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible. We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
N: The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door. We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special sign to each other.
T: CUT TO
S: 165 INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS NIGHT
N: We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.
S: 165A INT. BALLROOM NIGHT
N: RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.
C: RIFF RAFF
D: Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
C: MAGENTA
D: Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. To take that step to the right...
C: RIFF RAFF
D: But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
C: MAGENTA
D: And our World will do the Time Warp again.
S: 165B EXT. CASTLE DAWN
N: There is a huge explosion.
S: 166 EXT. CASTLE DAWN
N: We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then vanish into space. During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and white.
T: DISSOLVE TO
S: 167 EXT. THE CRATER DAY
N: SONG: "SUPER-HEROES" BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the castle once was. The scene is arid and deserted. There are remnants of DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory. BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.
C: BRAD
D: I've done a lot God knows I've tried To find the truth I've even lied But all I know is down inside.
N: DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees. BRAD & DR SCOTT I'm bleeding.
C: JANET
D: And super heroes Come to feast To taste the flesh Not yet deceased And al I know Is still the beast
E: revives
C: TRIO
D: Is feeding.
N: The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater. All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun. The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.
T: DISSOLVE TO
S: 168 INT. STUDY NIGHT
N: The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk. The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it. He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher in a pulpit.
C: NARRATOR
D: And crawling on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And meaning.
N: He turns and goes to the door of the study. He switches off the light.
C: VOICES OFF
D: Meaning.
N: He leaves the study, shutting the door. It's almost dark in the study. Only a sinister glow inside the globe of the earth remains. 169 CREDIT SEQUENCE SONG: "SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE" The cast credits roll up.

D: Science Fiction - double-feature Frank has built and lost his creature Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet The servants gone to a distant planet Oh - at the late night double-feature Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh - To the late night double-feature picture show.
N: THE END
C: MICHAEL WHITE PRODUCTIONS LTD
D: THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
N: Script Amendments September 12, 1974 The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions. 1/2 The film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY" format. It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at Sequence 41, while still remaining in black and white. At Sequence 54 the film changes to colour. 15 Now read "Denton Episcopalian Church". 23 Brad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court. This deletes a later reference to gates in 33. From hereon ignore all references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of Oakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the house. 25 Three motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house. 26 This window will be in turret in Oakley Court. Ignore all references to adjoining 'massive lighted window'. 30 This shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade. 32 This will be of some similar detail to the above. 38 "Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of Oakley Court. 40 Delete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity". 47 Columbia now is astride a Juke Box. The band are cut. 54a Red streamers and Black and White balloons fall. Not just streamers. 69 All future references to the operating table in the Lab now should be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse (part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable. 75 Delete references to the Ice-block. Eddie now crashes through a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice. He is also equipped with a saxaphone rather than a guitar. 87a Rocky now escapes through the lift shaft. This may involve a shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift cage and running out of the house. It may also involve the double bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape sequence. 91 It is still raining. 92 Janet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court. 103 This sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta, Columbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians. 106 Will now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab in the lift cage. 108 It is still raining. 116 Dr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory on the area of ramp above the control panel. 117 Magenta will now appear through the broken tile area created by Dr Scott. 122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a photograph album containing a still photograph equivalent of the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence. 143/4 All entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance. Delete all references to the floor lowering. 147 The "secret passage" is now the broken tile entrance. 164 Frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on him with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc. MEMO: SCRIPT ALTERATIONS FROM: JIM SHARMAN 9.12.74 TO: ALL CONCERNED. Sc. 148 INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N> As scripted up to; What further indignities were they to be subjected to? Then please add: And what of the floor show that had been spoken of? In an empty house? In the middle of the night. What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination? What indeed? From what had gone before it was clear that this was to be no picnic. Sc. 97. INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY. N. Is replaced by the following: Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's slave.
