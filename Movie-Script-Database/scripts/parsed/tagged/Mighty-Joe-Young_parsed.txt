S: EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY
N: The lush Pangani Mountains of Africa, mysterious and seemingly untouched.
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY
N: A warm golden light bathes the jungle. Shafts of sunlight filter through the forest floor. The sounds of WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting. As we MOVE IN we FIND a large female mountain gorilla lounging, eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious baby gorilla plays nearby. THROUGH CAMERA LENS A view of the mother gorilla, a few PICTURES SNAPPED. BACK TO SCENE The photographer is RUTH YOUNG, naturalist, researcher, sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks, and sketch pad. Her precocious young daughter, JILL, plays nearby. Jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time they move to a different tree, they go through this peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant. Both children take a last look at each other and then scurry to their waiting mothers.
C: RUTH
D: Jill. What did I tell you?
C: JILL
D: But Joe started it!
C: RUTH
D: It's not good for them to interact with us. Besides, that wasn't Joe. It was Marley.
E: gathering her things
N: Jill helps her mother heft the equipment as they start to head back to camp.
C: JILL
D: No it wasn't. It was Joe.
C: RUTH
D: Joe is just a baby, Jill. He was too big to be Joe.
N: As they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain trail.
C: JILL
D: Check. Check the pictures.
N: Ruth looks down at her daughter, surprised by the confidence in her voice.
S: EXT. EQUATORIAL SKY - NIGHT
N: The Southern Cross above the horizon. The Milky Way a dusty streak of white. A shooting star streaks in an arc down to the -- MOUNTAIN RANGE The dark peaks silhouetted against the stellar glow. POV SHOT Charging THROUGH dense, primeval forest. We hear an eerie metallic JANGLE of what sounds like wind chimes riding right with us. Something is moving quickly up this mountain.
S: EXT. PANGANI JUNGLE - NIGHT
N: Bursting THROUGH FRAME -- a pack of mongrel hunting dogs driven hard by a half dozen African men with rifles. Poachers wielding pangas (machetes). A glint of silver as a panga sweeps ACROSS FRAME, hacking at the wall of thistles and nettles. ON DOGS Eyes yellow. Teeth flared. The RINGING sound made by TIN SQUARES cut from cans, tied by rawhide around their necks. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. One poacher whips his panga again. PUNCH IN to reveal -- impaled in the earth, a three-foot stick figure with a macabre animal skull for a head. The poacher shouts in local dialect until -- A foul-looking man, GARTH, pushes INTO FRAME. Carrying a heavy Weatherby Mark V rifle across his back. Garth yanks the primitive doll from the ground. Looks back as -- A figure approaches in the darkness. A glowing cigar clenched in his stained teeth, STRASSER checks the doll over -- primitive, grotesque; then snaps it in two. Tossing it away contemptuously, he shouts orders in the local dialect. The men continue up the path. Dogs sweeping behind like a wildfire. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. PAN UP OVER TO --
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
N: The RING of the DOG COLLARS floats on a night breeze across a deep valley to the other side of the mountain, down to a... CLEARING A small circle of huts forming a campsite around a night fire. We go inside... one of them --
S: INT. HUT - NIGHT
N: Ruth Young's hut. On one side is a makeshift field laboratory, highlighted by a wall collage of photos -- family shots mixed right in with gorilla shots. RUTH sits on the edge of a cot, tucking Jill into bed. She leans down, kisses Jill gently on her forehead.
C: RUTH
D: Jill, what made you think the gorilla we saw today was Joe?
C: JILL
D: I was right, wasn't I?
C: RUTH
D: My notes say that Joe is only six months old. Either I got confused, or he's a very unusual gorilla.
C: JILL
D: I told you so.
E: sing-song
C: RUTH
D: Yes, you did. And Mommy's going to write it down in her book.
N: She holds up a dog-eared composition book, Ruth's detailed log of her observations.
C: RUTH
D: Right here. '... and my trusted colleague, Dr. Jill Young, showed me the error of my ways.'
N: Jill smiles.
C: RUTH
D: Now go to sleep.
N: Ruth begins singing a lullaby.
C: RUTH
D: 'Sleep till the night ends, the night wind will sing for you. Your song and my song. It goes on forever.'
E: singing
N: As she sings, a man appears in the doorway. This is KWELI, the camp manager. He seems nervous and impatient, but doesn't want to disturb Ruth. Jill sees him.
C: JILL
D: Goodnight, Kweli.
N: Ruth turns.
C: RUTH
D: Kweli? What is it?
C: KWELI
D: You should come. Quickly.
N: As soon as she hears the words, Ruth is up. As she leaves the hut, she grabs her walking stick.
C: JILL
D: Mommy, can I...
C: RUTH
D: Stay here, Jill.
N: Ruth exits, Kweli behind her. Jill follows, despite her mother's orders... but Kweli feels her behind him. He turns around and crouches down, looking Jill seriously in the face:
C: KWELI
D: Stay here, child.
E: fatherly
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HUT
N: A group of Bahatu trackers have gathered in the center of the camp. They stand, silently, listening... The distant CHIMING of the poaching dogs is unmistakable -- ECHOING in the night. Ruth walks into the circle, also listening. She turns to Kweli.
C: RUTH
D: Poachers.
E: grimly
N: Kweli nods. All the men look at Ruth for a sign.
C: RUTH
D: Let's go.
E: in Swahili, subtitled
N: Ruth leads them onto the forest path that goes up the mountain. NEAR HUT Jill has not stayed in bed. She has come out of the hut to watch the commotion. JILL'S POV Her mother, silhouetted by moonlight, in her mind larger- than-life, pushes up the trail. Then she's gone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - NIGHT
N: Strasser leads a breakneck pace through the woods. Garth looks around as the AFRICANS begin to murmur something over and over. These men seem scared...
C: AFRICANS
D: ... n'gai zamu!... n'gai zamu!...
N: Garth steps closer to keep up with Strasser.
C: GARTH
D: They're at it again.
C: STRASSER
D: Mystical nonsense. There's only one thing they should be afraid of on this mountain. And it's staring them right in the face!
E: threatening, to the men
N: The men stare back at Strasser with equal hostility. Suddenly, Garth kneels and picks something from the ground. Rubs it between his fingers. Deposits it in Strasser's hand.
C: GARTH
D: Gorilla. We're close.
S: EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT
N: Jill is pacing by the hut, trying to stay put like her mother said. Finally she can stand it no more. She grabs a long, stainless steel flashlight from a peg hanging on the outside of the hut and runs off...
S: EXT. FOREST - WIDEN ANGLE - NIGHT
N: The African men fan out. It gets quiet fast. Strasser and Garth swing rifles down from their shoulders as they stalk. Proficient hunting machines. EXTREME CLOSEUP - STRASSER His predator's eyes scanning the moonlit green tapestry. One more step -- then a dry POK-POK-POK sound erupts from the bushes. The DOGS BARK madly -- CLAPPERS RINGING. Trees shake furiously. Strasser spins to see several gorillas, darting from the trees, a blur of black shapes trying to escape up the mountain. CLOSE ON ONE FEMALE The same one Ruth watched earlier. Joe clings tightly to her back, his eyes wide with fear. JOE'S POV A nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his rifle with icy precision. THROUGH SCOPE Strasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking. It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a deep stretch of woods. On her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees -- EXTREME CLOSEUP - STRASSER'S TRIGGER FINGER squeezing gently, the EXPLOSION of the SHOT RATTLES the forest. The MOTHER'S SCREAM is CUT OFF sharply. ON JOE We see Joe thrown THROUGH FRAME, tumbling into the high grass. Then, silence. STRASSER AND GARTH crash through the dense foliage to retrieve the body. The DOGS SNAPPING behind. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG.
C: GARTH
D: Get the baby!
E: shouting
C: STRASSER
D: Don't shoot it! They want the babies alive!! Bring the sack!
E: shouting
N: CLOSE ON JOE He SCREAMS wildly, darts back and forth, desperately looking for his mother. JOE'S POV THROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others. BACK TO SCENE And then we see Joe's anguish turn to fury. He GROWLS -- and as the two big hunters come nearer -- Joe springs out at them. Joe is moving so fast, Strasser barely has time to react before the furry black shape is on top of him -- WIDEN as Joe attacks Strasser, knocking him back. Strasser shouts and drops his rifle. Tries to pull Joe off as they tumble down through the trees. Strasser punches and pulls at this ball of sinew and muscle. He reaches for his Match Master side arm with his right hand. PUNCH IN CLOSE as Joe bites down viciously through the hand. Strasser howls... ANGLE ON GARTH He has retrieved his rifle and is charging hard for his downed companion. He looks for a clear shot at Joe. PAN RIGHT and RACK FOCUS as Ruth Young explodes from the trees and flashes past Strasser, snatching Joe away. Joe is not quite sure what has happened, but he hangs on to Ruth for dear life. Strasser staggers forward, holding his mangled hand. Enraged. He rips Garth's gun away from him and with his bloodied hand, finds a way to pull the trigger. SHOTS RIP through BARK but Ruth disappears into the trees like a spirit.
S: EXT. FOREST - ON JILL - NIGHT
N: Running but nearing exhaustion. Hearing a fusillade of GUNSHOTS -- Jill runs faster, panic contorting her face. She runs desperately, swiping at branches, stinging vines. ANOTHER POV Something is running TOWARDS her.
S: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
N: Jill shines her flashlight into the forest. Further up, someone waves a light back and forth. Like a signal. Jill's face lights up. She continues running. Suddenly, Jill is bowled over by Joe who leaps into her arms. They roll on the ground, Jill with the wind knocked out of her. They look into each other's face and both know that the worst is happening. They are both silent with fear. Strasser appears through the darkness. His right hand wrapped in a bloody swath. Denying the pain. Garth follows, gun up. Jill and Joe lie hiding in the undergrowth. Jill's eyes tell Joe not to make a sound. They barely breathe. JILL'S POV of Strasser's and Garth's boots. Jill can hear the sound of their voices, but their words are indistinct. BACK TO SCENE
C: STRASSER
D: She's got to be here somewhere. She's got that damn devil with her.
E: quietly
C: GARTH
D: I think you might've hit the woman.
E: matter-of-fact
C: STRASSER
D: These people want to live like heroes, let them die like heroes.
E: shrugs
N: They are nearly on top of Jill and Joe, and their words are now crystal clear. Strasser looks at his bloody, wrapped hand and stares vindictively into the dark forest around him.
C: STRASSER
D: That little demon took off my damn trigger finger. Monstrule!
E: in Roumanian
C: GARTH
D: Your little 'monster' couldn't have gone far. Want to keep looking or...?
C: STRASSER
D: No. Let's get out of here.
E: in pain
N: Jill and Joe lie still as stone as Strasser and Garth continue past. Once they're gone, Joe and Jill begin to breathe again. Then, Jill sees a light pop on in the darkness. She flashes back.
C: JILL
D: Mom!
C: RUTH
D: Shhh!
E: O.S. whispering
N: Ruth suddenly emerges from the darkness. She collapses next to Jill in the undergrowth.
C: JILL
D: Mom, there were men, they...
E: whispering
C: RUTH
D: I know, I know. Shhh.
N: EXTREME CLOSEUP - RUTH'S HAND We see blood trickle down her fingers. Ruth covers it quickly so Jill can't see. BACK TO SCENE JOE, clinging to Jill, begins to WHIMPER.
C: RUTH
D: Oh, look who it is. Hello, Joe.
C: JILL
D: He's scared.
C: RUTH
D: Poor baby. He lost his mommy tonight.
N: Ruth turns her attention from Joe to her daughter.
C: RUTH
D: He needs someone to protect him. Will you do that for me, Jill?
N: Jill is taken aback by her mother's behavior. She knows something is wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.
C: RUTH
D: Promise me you'll protect him, Jill.
C: JILL
D: I... I promise.
N: Ruth takes Jill into her arms. She rocks her back and forth, humming the lullaby we heard before. HOLD ON -- -- the three of them, huddled together in the dense jungle, the lilting sound of Ruth's lullaby drifting through the night air. CAMERA FLOATS UP THROUGH the trees until it REVEALS and HOLDS ON the star-lit Pangani sky. RUTH'S VOICE EXPANDS INTO a CHORUS of POWERFUL AFRICAN VOICES SINGING the SAME LULLABY, now transformed into an inspirational hymn.
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. GRAVE SITE - DAY
N: MUSIC CUE: RUTH'S VOICE BECOMES a CHORUS of powerful AFRICAN VOICES SINGING the SAME LULLABY in the local dialect. But now it's become a powerful hymn -- sacred and inspirational. From the sky, flower petals of every color begin to fall. As they fall, they land on... A wooden plank that simply reads: "RUTH YOUNG." 11A. PAN ACROSS TO an adjacent marker that reads: "DR. EDWARD YOUNG" -- Jill's parents now reunited on that great mountain. WIDEN TO camp cemetery. Kweli lays Ruth's walking stick across her grave. Steps back -- not even trying to wipe away his tears. Jill stands bravely, singing through her broken heart. Kweli takes her hand in his. POV - FROM WOODS Someone is watching all of this. Staring directly at Jill. BACK TO SCENE Kweli looks down at Jill.
C: KWELI
D: Don't worry, little one. I will take care of you.
N: Jill nods, trying to stifle her tears. But she is now staring into the woods, sensing that she is being watched.
C: KWELI
D: You will love living in the village. There are other children, and...
N: Jill pulls her hand away from Kweli's and starts walking toward the woods.
C: KWELI
D: Jill!
N: But she ignores him, breaking into a run, drawn inexorably toward the jungle. ON KWELI Starting after her at first, but then stopping. He lets her go.
T: CUT TO:
N: 11B.
S: A14 EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY A14
N: Jill pushes her way through the brush, finding Joe, waiting for her. ON JILL Joe in her arms now, running through the woods as fast as she can, and we PULL BACK and...
T: DISSOLVE TO:
S: EXT. AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY
N: Rolling foothills. Farms. Giving way to steeper slopes. The mountains rising just beyond.
S: EXT. AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - DAY
N: SUPERIMPOSE: 12 YEARS LATER. A quickly-moving dust cloud turns out to be -- HUMVEE racing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway. Driven by GREGG O'HARA -- anyone would consider him young, strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's growth of beard. Hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled. Gregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the woods for yet more farmland. Pushing its way up the mountain side. The humvee is packed with EQUIPMENT that RATTLES as Gregg hits every bump in the road.
S: EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
N: A tiny African village, just a main square with a bar, a school, an infirmary and a gas station. Standing smack in the middle of the road is an East Indian with a goatee, wrap-around Black Flys, and a Nike workout suit. Gregg's HUMVEE SKIDS to a sharp stop in front of him.
C: GREGG
D: You must be Pindi.
N: Pindi flashes him a broad smile.
C: PINDI
D: The one and only, bro.
T: CUT TO:
S: 17A EXT. VILLAGE - DAY 17A
N: Pindi is leading Gregg down a row of vehicles: two Land Rovers, one with a strange-looking seat attached to the front hood, and an old, flatbed lorry. A surly-looking group of men lounge around on them. 17A CONTINUED: 17A
C: PINDI
D: Six men, three cars... everything you ask for, Mr. Ohara. All paid for in advance, out of Pindi's pocket...
E: lowering his voice
N: Gregg holds an envelope filled with cash in Pindi's face. He nods towards the nasty-looking men.
C: GREGG
D: Sweet-looking bunch of guys.
N: Pindi snatches the envelope -- but Gregg holds onto his end.
C: GREGG
D: I asked for experienced trackers.
C: PINDI
D: These men are the best -- I assure you. Very best.
N: Gregg allows Pindi to pull the envelope away. He immediately rifles through the cash, checking to make sure it's all there. Gregg eyes Pindi's men suspiciously, then walks around to the back of his humvee and flips open the storage boot, revealing an array of animal-tracking gadgetry. Pindi looks over his shoulder as Gregg loads a menacing-looking rifle.
C: PINDI
D: Nice piece you got there. What are we hunting, elephants?
C: GREGG
D: We're not hunting anything.
N: Pindi sees that Gregg is loading the rifle with tran- quilizer darts. This confuses him, but he pretends to approve.
C: PINDI
D: Ah! Tranquilizer darts. I agree -- much nicer to animals than bullets.
C: GREGG
D: Your men know how to use this, right?
E: indicating tranquilizer gun
N: 17A CONTINUED: (2) 17A
C: PINDI
D: Oh sure, boss. Only professionals here.
N: Gregg carefully puts the rifle back, then grabs a pair of Minolta 10x20 binoculars.
C: PINDI
D: So tell me, boss -- where are we going today?
N: ON Gregg, panning across his field of vision with the binoculars. He stops.
C: GREGG
D: There.
N: POV THROUGH BINOCULARS The highest peak in the range, playing hide and seek with the clouds. BACK TO SCENE Pindi's men see where Gregg is pointing. They murmur, trading grim glances at each other. Pindi jumps with nerves.
C: PINDI
D: There? Uh, boss, that is not such a good mountain. The men don't like it very much at all. You see there is a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there...
N: Gregg's back to checking his equipment.
C: GREGG
D: 'N'Gai Zamu.' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani.
N: Pindi looks at Gregg, surprised he knows this.
C: PINDI
D: You know it? How funny! That's not, by any chance, what you are looking for, is it, boss?
E: with dread
N: Gregg looks from Pindi's nervous face to the serious faces of the trackers. They are all watching him. 14A. 17A CONTINUED: (2A) 17A
C: GREGG
D: Looking for a legend? No. Why would I do that?
N: Gregg takes the car keys from Pindi's hand. 17A CONTINUED: (3) 17A
C: GREGG
D: Gimme those.
N: OFF Pindi -- not particularly thrilled...
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
N: The caravan trundles up a winding dirt road, into the mist-covered mountains.
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN - HIGH MEADOW - DAY
N: The vehicles are circled in a clearing. Three small audio dishes have been positioned to triangulate the location of the slightest sound. An infrared video cam is mounted on a tripod. A geometric, field-assembled cage made of an impact-resistant, high-tensile steel alloy sits off to the side.
S: EXT. MEADOW - DAY (LATER)
N: Gregg has earphones on, plugged into a backpack with a Sony digital recorder, listening. The sound is ambient and mysterious. Pindi stands behind Gregg, watching him carefully.
C: PINDI
D: What are you listening to?
C: GREGG
D: Sounds.
N: Pindi listens to the jungle. It is full of sounds. Something small makes a RUSTLING SOUND a few yards away.
C: PINDI
D: Like that right there?
C: GREGG
D: Yup.
N: Pindi nods.
C: PINDI
D: I understand completely: jungle sounds! Very important. I know a guy, he can get you a C.D. of jungle sounds, cheap. Even cheaper if you buy ten.
N: Gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet. He hears something. He listens intently for a moment, then the WHOOSH of a SPRING TRAP BLASTS his ears, followed by shouts and the sound of an ANIMAL SCREECHING. Gregg throws off the headphones, grabs a strange-looking pole called a DNA plug gun, and crashes with Pindi through the woods. Gregg runs INTO FRAME to see several of Pindi's men closing the cage on a lithe, young leopard.
C: PINDI
D: How do you like that, boss? I told you these men were the best.
E: beaming
N: Gregg kneels to inspect the leopard. He finds it beautiful -- his face softens at the sight of it.
C: GREGG
D: You're a beauty.
E: soothing, to leopard
N: Carefully, he extends the DNA plug gun and pricks the cat, startling it and causing all the men to jump.
C: GREGG
D: Okay, set him free.
E: stands
N: Gregg and Pindi stand over the leopard. Pindi offers his ersatz smile.
C: PINDI
D: Why ask for a cage if you are not keeping the animal?
E: testing the water
N: Gregg releases the vial of blood from the DNA gun.
C: GREGG
D: Because I'm only keeping this.
C: PINDI
D: Yes, but I know a guy, in Botswana, he'd pay you ten thousand American dollars for that leopard. I'd be willing to split with you -- fifty/fifty.
N: Greg ignores Pindi. He's busy transferring the vial to a container. Pindi presses on.
C: PINDI
D: Perhaps you're right. Sixty to you, forty to me. That's a very fair deal!
N: Still no response from Gregg -- he's logging notes into a book.
C: PINDI
D: My goodness -- you're an excellent negotiator. Okay, boss! Seventy/thirty it is. Take him to the truck.
E: to his men
N: The men bend over and hoist the cage up -- but now Gregg blocks their way.
C: GREGG
D: Put the cat down... now.
N: Gregg is one scary-looking bastard. The men drop the cage. Pindi back-pedals.
C: PINDI
D: You heard him... put it down! They never understand me. I don't know what to do...
E: "angry," to his men to Gregg
N: Pindi stops abruptly as his yammering is interrupted by the LEOPARD, GROWLING. SOUND CUE: A LOW RUMBLE. Floating on the wind like DISTANT THUNDER. It seems to come as an answer to the young leopard's cry. Birds fly out of the trees above the cage. The men are spooked. GREGG quickly puts on his headphones and listens to the amplified sound again. HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS -- then the rhythmic rondo of sharp POK-POK-POK-POK CHESTBEATS. Pindi is on the verge of panic. He forces his trademark smile.
C: PINDI
D: Uh, excuse me. Time to flee, right?
N: POV - TREES The top branches suddenly shake violently -- sending a sharp WOODEN RATTLE across the meadow. Is that a shadow from a passing cloud that seems to ripple through the foliage? Gregg steps closer. The trees bend like the wake of a boat -- they bend in a straight line. Something powerful and unseen is moving through the trees. Pindi and his men retreat back in the meadow. Gregg scans the forest. BRANCHES spring with a LOUD WHOOSH! Gregg can't help it -- his fear takes over and he backsteps into the meadow. WIDEN SHOT UP TO the trees. Catapulting DOWN THROUGH FRAME -- landing right in front of them is a gorilla -- nearly 15 feet high. The GROUND TREMBLES from the force. A nearby Land Rover bounces two feet into the air from the impact. His canines are fully exposed. Thick, black hair on his crest stand erect. Deep brown eyes aglow as he gives another DEAFENING CALL. This is JOE. Backlit by the sun he seems to encompass the forest. PUSH IN CLOSE ON Gregg's reaction. In complete awe.
C: GREGG
D: Don't anybody move.
C: PINDI
D: How about... I move... just over here...
E: frightened out of his wits
N: Pindi scurries for cover behind the frozen, awe- stricken trackers. ANGLE - JOE moves to the cage and peers inside. The LEOPARD paces and HISSES. Joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his massive chest with his fist. The hollow POK-POK-POK ECHOES off the mountain. Joe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the cage, as if it were made of matchsticks. The leopard leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest. JOE bares his teeth and ROARS at Gregg, as if to say "stay off my mountain." His mission accomplished, Joe quickly turns and starts back for tree cover. Silence. Everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe what they have just seen... Then Greg snaps out of it. Bursting into action, he runs to the humvee, motions to Pindi.
C: GREGG
D: Come on!! We're going after him!
C: PINDI
D: What is this 'we'? There is no way my men will ever agree to...
N: Gregg yells to the paralyzed trackers:
C: GREGG
D: Three times your price. Triple your fee.
E: in Swahili in English
N: That's what it's all about. The men get a move on, running for the vehicles as fast as they can. ENGINES REV, DOORS SLAM, as the trackers ready for the chase. All four cars pull out. 22A OMITTED 22A
S: EXT. MEADOW
N: All is silent for a moment, then Joe EXPLODES INTO FRAME. Joe hears the DRONE of ENGINES -- turns to see -- JOE'S POV The caravan, looking like the cavalry in a Western, comes charging over the hill. Gregg's humvee comes crashing over a ridge in pursuit of Joe. Gregg yells out to the cars around him:
C: GREGG
D: Herd him towards me! I gotta get close.
N: Gregg grabs his DNA stick and grins at Pindi.
C: GREGG
D: Real close.
N: Pindi realizes with a sickening feeling that Gregg is having a major rush. ANOTHER ANGLE The lead car, a Land Rover, comes right up behind Joe. BACK TO SCENE Joe -- sensing the car next to him, turns and ROARS... LAND ROVER The guy with the tranquilizer RIFLE panics and FIRES! BACK ON JOE The dart hits his arm. Uh oh. That was a mistake.
S: INT. LAND ROVER
N: The tracker has just enough time to get a good look at Joe's furious expression before... WHAM! Joe throws his shoulder into the side of the Land Rover, sending it tumbling end over end into a ravine. ON GREGG Disgusted with the guys' stupidity.
C: GREGG
D: Experienced trackers, my ass!
N: Pindi shrugs. The two of them watch as Joe continues running, then changes directions and starts heading straight for them. The humvee has to swerve out of the way to avoid colliding with Joe. FOLLOW JOE as he books across the meadow in the opposite direction, now. The modified Land Rover with the hot seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases Joe. They catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat, readying a metal clamp attached to a chain... GREGG tries to yell across at him.
C: GREGG
D: No, we don't want to...
N: Too late, the guy's slapped the clamp onto Joe's arm. Joe ROARS, tries to shake off the chain, then speeds up. THE CHAIN unspools rapidly, whipping out from the front of the modified Land Rover. Quickly, it grows taut and now the Rover is being pulled by Joe. The driver slams on the brakes with both feet, but all that does is tilt the front end upwards, digging up clods of dirt as they're dragged along. JOE feels the increased pull, and is starting to get annoyed. He heads right for... STAND OF TREES The guy in the hot seat is battered by branches and leaves as they're dragged through the trees. BACK ON HUMVEE Now circling around the stand of trees, trying to catch up with Joe when he emerges from the opposite side.
C: GREGG
D: Hold the wheel!
C: PINDI
D: Oh, sure.
E: terrified
N: Gregg hands the wheel over to Pindi as he reaches for his DNA gun... THEIR POV Joe has just emerged from the tree stand, dragging the thoroughly-battered, modified Land Rover and its dazed occupants. Joe sees the humvee heading towards him. CLOSE ON JOE His brow furrows. Is he coming up with a plan? He makes a ninety degree turn... BACK ON GREGG Who is intently screwing a telescoping extension on the DNA plug gun. Pindi gapes at what Gregg is doing.
C: PINDI
D: I hope you are planning on throwing that at him, because...
C: GREGG
D: Pindi! Look out!
N: Pindi looks forward again just in time to see... THE CHAIN Pulled taut between Joe and the modified Land Rover, has become a moving clothesline, and the humvee is heading right into its path. Pindi tries to swerve, but they can't avoid it. He ducks and... Gregg leaps out of the car, hurdling the chain, just as... It shears the top right off the vehicle! Gregg tumbles to the ground, as the humvee rolls to a stop nearby. Meanwhile, the -- LAND ROVER is SPINNING OUT, still connected to Joe. Joe is almost curious about the chain. He begins to pull back as the modified Land Rover circles him. The modified Land Rover bucks -- and for a second there is a standstill. Then Joe yanks... And the chain, the winch, the tracker in the hot seat... in fact, the entire axle of the modified Land Rover, are pulled from their moorings. The tracker racks up against a tree, followed closely by his chair and winch... The axle tumbles to a stop... The LAND ROVER COLLAPSES like a stack of cards. JOE stands at the edge of the field, observing his victory. Then he beats his chest and ROARS. IN MEADOW Pindi and his men run to the one remaining car, the flatbed lorry. They all pile in and speed away across the field. Pindi sees something up ahead, yells at the driver.
C: PINDI
D: Stop!
N: The LORRY SCREECHES to a halt, right next to Gregg, who is stumbling towards them.
C: PINDI
D: Hurry up, bro! Get in!
N: Pindi watches as Gregg stumbles around to the back of the truck. But instead of getting in, he grabs a silver case and pulls it off.
C: PINDI
D: Excuse me, boss, but please, I would like to avoid being killed.
N: Gregg flips opens the case, revealing a video camera. He hoists it up, and barely able to walk, takes one last look at Pindi and the bruised and busted-up trackers.
C: GREGG
D: Get those men down the mountain. They need help.
N: Gregg takes off after Joe. Pindi can't believe it.
C: PINDI
D: Crazy Americans!
N: 24A. He slaps the driver on the shoulder.
C: PINDI
D: Get us out of here.
N: They PEEL OUT of there... GREGG'S POV Staring down the path of crushed growth that Joe has left in his wake. He takes a deep breath, then exhales. Then he heads off into the jungle.
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - MOVING - DAY
N: FOLLOW Gregg DOWN a wide trail of broken limbs leading into the densest part of the mountain. Thorns and stingers scratch Gregg as he fights his way through. THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA The green paradise of the mountain rushes right AT us. Bright blossoms and strange insects. The sun diffuses in daggers of light.
T: INTERCUT WITH:
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - BACK WITH GREGG - DAY
N: Gregg climbs over a fallen tree. Ducks under some low branches. Stops to catch his breath. He listens intently. Takes another step forward. Hears a TWIG SNAP. THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA PAN RIGHT. Joe springs out from hiding -- as gorillas love to do to enemies. He charges Gregg and cuffs him onto his back. Joe is in full attack mode -- eyes wide, teeth exposed. He snatches Gregg by the foot. GREGG screams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth, knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him. Joe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree trunk.
C: JILL
D: Joe! Stop!
E: O.S.
N: Joe looks surprised, caught with his hand in the cookie jar. GREGG'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV A beautiful young woman is standing ten feet from him. BACK TO SCENE
C: GREGG
D: Oh, wow.
C: JILL
D: Joe...
N: ON Jill -- she looks at Gregg like he's the lowest form of life on earth.
C: JILL
D: ... drop him.
N: And Joe does, dropping Gregg hard to the ground. On his head.
T: CUT TO BLACK.
S: INT. VILLAGE INFIRMARY - DAY
N: OVER BLACK, we hear the MURMUR of VOICES, speaking in
T: Swahili. PICTURE FADES UP...
N: POV SHOT LOOKING UP AT KWELI, 12 years older than we last saw him. Kweli looks right INTO CAMERA, then says something over his shoulder in Swahili. REVERSE ANGLE Bruised and bandaged, Gregg blinks, trying to bring his eyes into focus.
C: GREGG
D: Where am I?
C: KWELI
D: The infirmary. You've been unconscious for an entire night. You're lucky to be alive.
N: Gregg winces as he slowly raises himself to his elbows.
C: GREGG
D: Strange, I don't feel lucky.
N: He takes in his surroundings; a simple infirmary. THROUGH the open door, he can see the village he started his trip in.
C: KWELI
D: You crashed your vehicle. It is waiting for you outside.
C: GREGG
D: You're an injury behind. The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu.
N: Kweli chuckles.
C: GREGG
D: Think that's funny? You should try it?
C: KWELI
D: N'Gai Zamu is just a legend, my friend.
C: GREGG
D: No, he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand. There was also a woman...
N: Gregg tries to get up. It's an ordeal.
C: KWELI
D: A woman?
C: GREGG
D: Out in the jungle. She saved my life. A beautiful woman.
N: Kweli gives him a patronizing smile.
C: KWELI
D: You were dreaming, Mr. Ohara.
C: GREGG
D: No. I never remember my dreams.
N: Gregg sits up in bed and swings his feet to the floor. Kweli turns and heads for the door.
C: KWELI
D: It would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kimjayo. I took the liberty of calling one for you.
C: GREGG
D: Don't need one.
C: KWELI
D: But he is expecting you. If you can drive, you should leave today.
N: Kweli walks out of the room. Gregg squints after him, sensing that something is up.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. INFIRMARY - LATER
N: Gregg walks gingerly out of the infirmary, looking like crap. He squints in the bright midday sun, then spots... The humvee, a mere shadow of its former self, parked right near the infirmary, covered with a tarp. Gregg pulls the tarp back to find all his expensive equipment, a good deal of it broken, pitchforked into the back. He scowls. He starts rummaging through the stuff, looking for some- thing in particular. Then he finds it -- his video camera, covered with mud, but seemingly in good condi- tion. He pushes the record button. Light goes on. Still works. He pops open the tape slot, and his face falls. The video cassette has been removed.
C: GREGG
D: Damnit.
N: Just then, a group of village schoolchildren dash by Gregg. They are giggling, as if they had dared each other to run up to the stranger. They sing out the one English word they know as they pass:
C: SCHOOL CHILDREN
D: Hello! Hello! Hello!
N: Gregg shakes his head, smiling, and follows them with his eyes as they fly by like a flock of birds. He watches as they dart into the open air market, playfully knocking aside a familiar individual: Kweli. We watch from... GREGG'S POV as Kweli steps into a fruit stall, letting the kids fly by him. Then Gregg's eyes widen as a tall and lovely young woman steps INTO VIEW next to Kweli. BACK TO SCENE He watches as they shop together, realizing that this is, in fact, the beautiful young woman who saved him. 28A 28A
S: EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - THAT MOMENT
N: Kweli and Jill have a familial ease with each other as they pick out their groceries.
C: KWELI
D: Our visitor must be feeling better. He should be leaving the infirmary today.
N: Jill looks up toward the infirmary and sees Gregg leaning against his truck, watching them.
C: JILL
D: Looks like he just has.
N: Jill nods across the street. Kweli looks and sees that Gregg is leaning against his Jeep, arms folded across his chest, staring at them with a mixture of amusement and irritation.
C: JILL
D: He's walking so soon. Joe should have dropped him harder.
C: KWELI
D: He's not a poacher, Jill. He's working for an animal conservancy in California.
C: JILL
D: He can't be trusted. He's an outsider.
E: shrugs
C: KWELI
D: A grateful outsider. He told me he was saved yesterday by a woman. A beautiful woman.
E: teasing Jill
N: Jill looks at Kweli sharply, then back across the street at Gregg, whose eyes continue to assess her. She looks straight back at him, locking into his gaze.
C: JILL
D: And what did you tell him?
C: KWELI
D: What could I tell him? He knows what he saw. He's not a fool.
N: Jill and Gregg are still holding each other's eyes.
C: JILL
D: I'll be the judge of that.
N: Across the street, Gregg is breaking into a big, slow smile. It unnerves Jill. Kweli, always Jill's protector, catches the action between the two of them and bristles a bit -- but Jill has already turned her back and taken off through the back of the market.
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY
N: If Ruth Young was suited to these woods, her daughter was born to them. 29A. CONTINUED: (A1) She hikes through the forest effortlessly, as though it were her own back yard. As she walks near the banks of a river, however, she stops. She listens carefully, sensing something out there, in the jungle. BEHIND TREE (NEARBY) Gregg, his video camera in one hand, stands stock still behind a tree, trying to avoid being discovered. He is absolutely drenched in sweat, the long hike clearly much harder than Jill has made it look. BACK TO JILL Still listening. All she can hear are the familiar SOUNDS of the JUNGLE. A moment passes, then she shakes it off and keeps moving.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Jill comes out into a clearing, bordered by a large pool at the base of a magnificent waterfall. She pulls a flashlight out of her back pack and, in the same motion her mother used to summon her, begins waving it back and forth into the surrounding forest. GREGG watches this bizarre ritual, wondering what Jill could possibly be doing.
T: CUT TO:
N: JOE'S POV - DEEP IN WOODS The beam of light cuts through the deep green darkness of the trees. BACK TO SCENE Jill continues waving the flashlight, waiting for a response. Then, we hear the sound of SOMETHING LARGE APPROACHING. ON GREGG The thunderous sound making him nervous... ON JILL Not so Jill. She waits calmly, at first, as the FOOT- STEPS APPROACH. Then, as the branches begin to bend and break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles. Mighty Joe Young emerges from the brush, not growling, not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming to greet his master.
C: JILL
D: Hey, handsome. How are you?
E: cooing to Joe
N: ON GREGG Absolutely thunderstruck, watching in awe as the giant GORILLA bows his head so Jill can scratch behind his ear. He makes LOW, GUTTURAL SOUNDS that are the gorilla equivalent of a purr. Jill inspects Joe, checking him to see if he's okay. Her voice is full of gentle concern and worry.
C: JILL
D: What were you thinking yesterday, letting those men see you? Don't do that again, okay? Please. Please.
E: praying to herself
N: We see the fear in Jill's face, knowing that Joe can't understand what she's saying. She shakes it off and brightens. She gives Joe a playful tussle, then covers her eyes with her hands.
C: JILL
D: One. Two. Three. Four...
N: It takes only a moment for Joe to respond. His eyes open wide, he looks in every direction then, suddenly, crashes into the woods!
C: JILL
D: ... seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come!!
E: yelling
N: And Jill runs into the woods after Joe.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY
N: Jill walks through the forest, searching for Joe. It should be clear by now that they are playing hide and seek. 31A. CONTINUED: (A1)
C: JILL
D: Oh, my God! I can't find Joe. Where's Joe?
E: theatrically
N: She stomps around, pretending not to see him. Of course, she knows exactly where he is. He's so big, the tree he's standing behind barely hides one leg. CLOSE ON JOE He can't help peeking. He loves this. Jill pokes her head around every tree.
C: JILL
D: Come out, come out... wherever you are!
N: Then, pretending that she just spotted him, she charges right at him.
C: JILL
D: I found you!
N: JOE ROARS, delighted by their game. Jill tussles with him, then gets a mischievous look in her eye.
C: JILL
D: Bye-bye, Joe!
N: Suddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's actually small enough to hide well. Joe passes by her, moving through the foliage. In a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her -- he begins to WHIMPER -- and spins around. He stands up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his head in frustration. He can't bear the idea that she is gone. A beat, then Joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots, hunting for Jill. He sees one BUSH RUSTLING, goes over and rips it out of the ground, revealing... GREGG Standing there, completely exposed, filming all this with his dented video camera. He looks up at Joe towering over him.
C: GREGG
D: Oh boy.
N: JOE ROARS! Gregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree as Joe advances. Remembering what one should do when faced with an enraged gorilla. Gregg averts his eyes and rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position. He's like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his neck with his arms. Joe raises his mighty fist -- it looks like he might smash Gregg anyway... but then he hears Jill's voice.
C: JILL
D: Joe! It's okay.
E: O.S. soothing
N: Joe stops and turns his head to Jill.
C: JILL
D: Now get out of here, Joe. Run.
N: Joe looks at her, not sure why her tone's gotten so stern.
C: JILL
D: Run, Joe. Run!
N: Joe looks back at Gregg, still curled into a tight ball. He gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure before obeying Jill and running into the forest. The "little swat" is powerful enough to send Gregg rolling like a croquet ball into a thicket of bushes. Painfully, he uncurls, plucking nettles out of his legs as Jill approaches.
C: GREGG
D: Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this.
E: pulling out a nettle
N: Jill reaches down to Gregg. He thinks she's offering him a hand up.
C: JILL
D: Anything broken?
C: GREGG
D: No... no. I think I'm... oh.
E: checking himself
N: Gregg's voice trails off as Jill reaches for the video camera, not him. She examines the camera.
C: JILL
D: Hmm -- it looks okay. I think it's still working.
C: GREGG
D: Oh -- good.
E: relieved
C: JILL
D: Well -- I can fix that.
N: Jill smashes the camera into a tree, breaking it for good. She drops the pieces onto the ground and takes off.
C: GREGG
D: Hey -- wait a minute!
E: calling after her
S: 32A EXT. RIVER BANK 32A
N: Jill is making good time down the rough terrain of the river bank. Gregg catches up to her.
C: GREGG
D: Hang on a second -- what's the problem?
C: JILL
D: You. You're the problem. That's the second time I've stopped you from being ripped in two -- and next time I'm just going to watch. Understand?
C: GREGG
D: You saved me. I'm grateful. Now I just want to talk to you -- Miss Young.
E: appeasing
N: Jill stops in her tracks and shoots Gregg a surprised look. He explains gently.
C: GREGG
D: I know who you are. I read all your mother's work. Books... notes... everything I could get a hold of.
C: JILL
D: So?
E: hiding emotion
C: GREGG
D: So it's why I'm here.
N: Jill gives a short nod, accepting this tribute. She turns back around and resumes walking. Gregg follows, bursting with questions. 32A CONTINUED: 32A
C: GREGG
D: She knew about Joe? Did she have a theory on him? How old is he? I can't believe you kept him a secret all these years. How'd you manage that?
C: JILL
D: By keeping people like you off the mountain.
C: GREGG
D: You got this all wrong. I want to help you.
C: JILL
D: You're not helping anybody here. You're just making matters worse.
C: GREGG
D: How's that?
C: JILL
D: This mountain will be crawling with people, thanks to you. You go back to wherever you're from, put the word out...
C: GREGG
D: The word is out. It's done. I'm not the only one who saw him, remember? Rare animals mean big money and Joe's as rare as they come. It's going to be tough to protect him here. Maybe impossible.
N: Jill spins on him.
C: JILL
D: 'Here' is Joe's home. And 'here' is where he must live. He doesn't have a choice.
C: GREGG
D: That's not true. Place that sent me could take care of Joe. They got the facilities...
C: JILL
D: Just what Joe needs. A cage.
N: 35A. 32A CONTINUED: (2) 32A
C: GREGG
D: Not a cage, a preserve. A place where he'll be free from poachers, free from land development...
C: JILL
D: But he won't be free.
C: GREGG
D: How long do you think Joe will stay free here? I'm telling you there's gonna be a hunt starting on this mountain tomorrow. And I don't expect they'll give it up until one of them bags the prize. You should think about it.
N: Jill hates the ring of truth in Gregg's words. She turns and takes off down the mountain alone.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. RAHA PRESERVE AND CONSERVANCY (BOTSWANA) - SUNSET
N: Giraffe roam the grounds of a lush, private preserve, surrounding a large, opulent, main house.
C: ANDERSON
D: Quite an impressive facility you have here, Mr. Strasser.
E: O.S.
S: INT. LODGE - SUNSET
N: STRASSER sits in a leather chair, in an expensively- appointed room. His rough exterior has been polished by money, but his cold eyes have not changed. Sitting across from him is ANDERSON, the button-down director of the Cascade Park Zoo.
C: ANDERSON
D: Tell me, why is it that you keep such a low profile about this wonderful place?
C: STRASSER
D: Our only interest is the well- being of our animals.
C: ANDERSON
D: Well, I think I've come to the right place for Morris.
E: satisfied
N: Anderson puts some photos on the coffee table. CLOSE ON PHOTOS of a full-grown Bengal tiger, looking miserable in a fairly small enclosure. We see insignias for the Cascade Park Zoo on the fences around him.
C: ANDERSON
D: You can see how depressed he is. He's grown out of his habitat, and our zoo doesn't have the budget to do anything about it. That's why he needs a new home.
N: Strasser reaches out to pick up the photos, and as he does... CLOSE ON STRASSER'S HAND A black leather glove-like apparatus with a thumb and forefinger in place that gives the appearance of a whole, if menacing, hand.
C: STRASSER
D: Poor thing. Yes, he will be much happier here on our preserve. Back to the wild. Free again.
N: A door opens behind Anderson. Garth sticks his head in the room.
C: GARTH
D: Phone for you. Urgent.
N: Strasser stands.
C: STRASSER
D: Will you excuse me, Mr. Anderson?
N: Strasser turns and follows Garth through the door, into...
T: CUT TO:
S: 35A INT. BACK ROOM (RAHA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION 35A
N: ... a room that would give dear Mr. Anderson nightmares. A man in a white smock is packaging poached rhino horns into boxes. The boxes, labelled medical supplies, are being sent to addresses in China. On another wall, in front of a bank of telephones, is a dry-erase board covered with animal names, and their respective prices.
C: STRASSER
D: See what our friends in China will give us for a Bengal tiger, Garth.
N: Strasser hands Garth the photo of the tiger.
C: GARTH
D: Looks like a big fellah. I'll set a new record with you.
E: excited, looking at photo
N: Strasser picks up one of the phones. He idly plays with a rhino horn as he talks to Pindi.
C: STRASSER
D: Strasser.
C: PINDI
D: It's about time already! You know how long I am waiting? A man can only carry so much change...
E: O.S.
C: STRASSER
D: What do you want, Pindi?
E: irritated
T: CUT TO:
S: 35B EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET 35B
N: A small street of stores -- all covered in brightly- painted advertisements. Outside one store is a lone pay phone -- manned by Pindi. Pindi speaks furtively, so as not to be overheard. INTERCUT conversation. 35B CONTINUED: 35B
C: PINDI
D: Not what I want, boss, what you want. How about a giant gorilla?
C: STRASSER
D: Talk.
C: PINDI
D: Big as three men, two thousand pounds, at least.
C: STRASSER
D: You've been drinking, haven't you?
C: PINDI
D: Swear to God, boss. Saw him with my own two eyes.
C: STRASSER
D: Don't waste my time again.
N: ON PINDI There is a CLICK on the LINE. 35B CONTINUED: 35B
C: PINDI
D: Hello? Boss...
N: Now a DIAL TONE. Pindi looks at the phone.
C: PINDI
D: I'll catch him and charge you double, madar chode.
N: Pindi smashes the phone down on its cradle.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING
N: In the center of the village, two trucks of rough-looking men are gassing up their vehicles. A third truck arrives from the other direction. It's a POACHER we recognize, one of Pindi's men, accompanied by a half dozen others, all armed with rifles. ANGLE ON JILL She steps out in front of the Poacher's truck. The driver SLAMS on the BRAKES, stopping within an inch of striking her. Alarmed, the Poacher stands in his seat and screams at Jill.
C: POACHER
D: Stupid girl! What do you think you're doing?
N: Jill calmly walks up to the Poacher's side of the vehicle.
C: JILL
D: I found this in the forest this morning. Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back.
N: With that, Jill brazenly steps forward and throws a net over his head. It's a poacher's net. Enraged, the Poacher slowly pulls the net off his head. The other poachers find the scene hilarious. It infuriates Jill.
C: JILL
D: Poaching is illegal! Get off this mountain!
N: The Poacher and his driver exchange a significant look. Nodding to each other, they start to climb out of their truck, eyes glaring at Jill...
C: KWELI
D: Jill! Jill Young!
E: O.S.
N: Everyone turns to see Kweli walking quickly towards them.
C: KWELI
D: Come here immediately! You are needed at the school this moment!
E: to Jill
N: Kweli is trying to give her a way to save face. Jill knows it, but she doesn't want to back down before the poachers. Kweli snatches Jill by the elbow and drags her away. The poachers hiss and cat call. Jill walks away slowly. She wants to make sure they know she's not running. Kweli hisses furiously into her ear:
C: KWELI
D: We have to talk. Now.
S: 36A INT. RUTH'S HUT - DAY 36A
N: This is Jill's mother's hut. It is full of significant mementos -- her mother's old bulletin board, photographs, research, etc. It feels homey. Kweli, distraught with worries over Jill, rips a photo of her mother from the wall and shoves it in front of her face.
C: KWELI
D: Your mother slept in this bed. She worked at this desk. She died in this jungle. Do you plan to do everything just like her?
C: JILL
D: My mother would have been proud of what I did today.
C: KWELI
D: Proud? Of that foolishness out there? Of you risking your life?
E: angry
N: 36A CONTINUED: 36A
C: JILL
D: She risked hers -- why shouldn't I risk mine? I'm just doing what I promised, and I promised to protect Joe. And I'm going to do everything I can to stop the poachers...
C: KWELI
D: You can't stop them. Even she couldn't stop them.
E: more gently
N: Jill holds the photo of her mother tightly in her hands.
C: KWELI
D: Jill, the other gorillas have moved south, to safer lands... but Joe has stayed behind.
C: JILL
D: They don't want him. They won't let him come.
C: KWELI
D: Maybe... or maybe you won't let him go.
C: JILL
D: He needs me.
E: sharply
N: It's only half the truth, and they both know the other half -- that Jill needs Joe, too. Kweli sighs. He puts his hand protectively on Jill's shoulder.
C: KWELI
D: The danger here is building for both of you. I feel it -- and so do you.
N: Jill looks away. She knows he's right.
C: KWELI
D: I know what the American is offering, Jill.
N: Jill looks into Kweli's eyes. He must be very worried, to be checking around like this.
C: KWELI
D: Think about what he has to say. That's all I ask.
N: Kweli leaves Jill to mull it over. 41A.
S: EXT. GAS PUMP - DAY
N: A poacher's truck, carrying six rowdy poachers, speeds down the main street, kicking up a cloud of dust. The dust cloud envelops Gregg, making him cough as he repacks some of the damaged equipment in his truck. He hears more coughing behind him and turns to find Jill at his shoulder. She has a troubled air about her -- clearly she is wrestling with something.
C: JILL
D: Leaving?
N: Gregg nods, continuing packing.
C: GREGG
D: I'm gonna head up the mountain. See if I can throw some of the poachers off the trail.
C: JILL
D: You think it will work?
E: dubious
C: GREGG
D: Not for long. Just trying to buy you a little time, that's all. With more of these bastards arriving every hour, I suggest you get Joe as deep into the jungle as you can -- as fast as you can.
N: Across the street at the bar, a chorus of CACKLES rises from a group of drunken poachers. The mere sound of them makes Jill dig her fingers into her arms with anxiety. She looks across at the poachers -- and then back to Gregg, packing up. If she doesn't say this right now, this second, she never will. She snaps.
C: JILL
D: Okay!
C: GREGG
D: Okay what?
C: JILL
D: Okay we'll go.
N: Gregg turns and looks at her.
C: GREGG
D: We?
C: JILL
D: Me and Joe. To that place of yours in California. What?! You didn't think you could take him without me, did you?
E: off Gregg's look
N: 42A. Gregg stops packing to look squarely at Jill.
C: GREGG
D: You're sure about this?
C: JILL
D: No. I am completely unsure about this. But I'll do it. On one condition.
C: GREGG
D: Name it.
C: JILL
D: I'm in charge of Joe.
C: GREGG
D: Done.
C: JILL
D: Done? Just like that? That was way too easy.
E: suspicious
C: GREGG
D: You're not a very trusting soul are you, Miss Young?
C: JILL
D: No, I'm not.
C: GREGG
D: Tough, isn't it? Trying to measure me up -- decide if I'm a fraud...
E: sarcastic
C: JILL
D: ... or a fool.
N: Gregg smiles, half sour, half amused.
C: GREGG
D: Well, I'd like to know if you're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but -- but I guess we'll have to take our chances and figure it out as we go along.
N: Jill snorts. Gregg looks her straight in the eye. 42B.
C: GREGG
D: Come on, Jill. Trust it. You'll be in charge of Joe. Let's shake on it.
E: extends hand
C: JILL
D: I don't shake. That's not how we make pacts around here.
C: GREGG
D: Alright, how do you make pacts around here?
E: growing impatient
C: JILL
D: You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider.
C: GREGG
D: A what?
C: JILL
D: You'll have a high fever and hallucinations. You'll say things -- lots of things. We'll hear what's in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, the pact is made.
N: Gregg nods to himself, considering.
C: GREGG
D: A spider bite and hallucinations?
C: JILL
D: That's right.
C: GREGG
D: Then you'll trust me and let me have Joe?
C: JILL
D: That's right. Well?
N: Gregg cocks his head.
C: GREGG
D: Well... I think... that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard.
N: Jill smiles. She's satisfied. This is the answer she was looking for. 42C.
C: JILL
D: Good. Maybe you're not a fool after all.
N: Gregg scoffs, realizing she was only testing him. Jill turns and starts walking away. Gregg calls after her.
C: GREGG
D: Get your things together. Fast. We're getting out of here as soon as we can.
N: Gregg watches her go, head held high like a queen. He chuckles to himself. It's hard not to appreciate this girl.
C: GREGG
D: Makiki spider.
E: to himself
S: EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MOVING - DAY
N: Jill bursts INTO FRAME -- racing at full stride, long hair flowing -- so reminiscent of that little girl we saw before -- a wild mixture of fluid grace and strength. The trees seem to fly apart behind her revealing Joe -- running with her. As if speed alone could make their enemies disappear.
S: EXT. MEADOW - DAY
N: Jill watches the clouds rush by the mountaintop. Joe stands next to her, looking out at the mountain valley where they've grown up together. Wind sweeps down from the peak. The trees bow and bend gracefully. To Jill, the mountain has never seemed more beautiful. She looks at Joe -- magnificent against the natural tableau of his world. She looks at him, worry on her face about what is about to happen to him. He looks at her trying to understand.
C: JILL
D: I don't know what else to do.
N: CRANE UP so we can see Joe and Jill against the Edenic mountain vista. 42D.

CONTINUE DOWN PAST a waterfall, as we COME TO a grassy field, then a moat, then, finally, a railing at the edge of an observation area. 40A CONTINUED: 40A NOW REVEAL That what we are looking at is not, in fact, the African landscape, but rather a fabricated habitat, encircled by a sprawling campus of stucco buildings. Workers in matching uniforms with the "CALIFORNIA ANIMAL CONSERVANCY" logo on them, run back and forth, a hive of activity in anticipation of the new arrival. PULL IN ON two of them, walking and talking: DR. HARRY RUBEN, the Conservancy's Director and Chief Zoologist, and DR. CECILY BANKS, an African-American veterinarian with long braids stuffed under a baseball cap.
C: HARRY
D: This is crazy. All I said was, 'Bring back some blood samples.' So what does he bring back? A giant gorilla.
C: CECILY
D: Don't even pretend to be upset, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat? Try half our operating budget.
C: CECILY
D: You'll be on the cover of National Geographic, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: Hey, I just said it was crazy. I didn't say it wasn't worth it.

S: EXT. SAN DIEGO FREEWAY RAMP - MORNING
N: A busy freeway, near Los Angeles. FIND a car with a California Animal Conservancy logo on the side...
S: INT. CAR - MOVING
N: Gregg drives. Jill, almost bouncing with anxiety and excitement, rides shotgun.
C: JILL
D: There are more cars on this road than I've seen in my entire life, total.
C: GREGG
D: Welcome to L.A.
N: Jill whips around in her car seat and peers anxiously through the back window. JILL'S POV We see the cab of a large trailer following their car. BACK TO SCENE
C: JILL
D: Think he's okay back there? I think he's okay back there.
E: anxious
N: Three seconds pass.
C: JILL
D: You think he's okay back there?
C: GREGG
D: Don't worry. He's doing fine.
E: soothing
C: JILL
D: Sorry. I'm a little tense. Yeah. I think he's okay back there.
E: checking behind her again
C: GREGG
D: Good. Thanks for the update.
N: Jill pulls herself away from the back window and faces front again. She stares out at the nondescript sprawl of greater L.A. It looks like non-place. There is no "there" there.
C: JILL
D: So this is L.A. It all looks the same. How do you know where you are?
E: perplexed
C: GREGG
D: Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way. Don't worry about the rest -- you'll never see it through the smog.
N: Gregg glances over at Jill. She is drumming her fingers in her lap with nerves, not listening to a word he's saying. Gregg smiles with empathetic amusement.
C: GREGG
D: Maybe you better check and see if Joe's okay back there.
N: Jill obediently whips around in her seat to check for Joe -- then realizes Gregg was teasing. She settles back down, facing front again.
C: JILL
D: Ha ha.
E: blushing
S: EXT. SAN DIEGO FREEWAY RAMP - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: A livestock truck, same conservancy labels, travels right behind Gregg and Jill's vehicle. Heavy, open air slats obscure the truck's occupant, but we know who it is. JOE'S POV - LOOKING OUT Traffic rushes by, a buffeting rush of air -- the strangeness of it all frightens Joe -- and makes him curious. PUSH IN CLOSE ON the air slats as Joe peers out again. POV SHOT - MINIVAN comes INTO FRAME passing by the trailer. 45A.
S: 47A INT. MINIVAN 47A
N: A mom drives her son home from little league. She listens to an OLDIES station. He looks out the window, bored. Then his eyes go wide. BOY'S POV PUSH IN CLOSE ON the trailer and Joe's two big eyes staring out. They lock eyes momentarily. The boy isn't sure if he's seeing things. Then two enormous fingers extend out from between the slats and wave at him. BOY For the boy it is a beat of pure astonishment. As if a daydream came real for the moment. The trailer pulls past leaving the boy wide-eyed, wondering.

S: EXT. CALIFORNIA ANIMAL CONSERVANCY - DAY
N: Gregg and Jill's car pulls onto the grounds of the California Animal Conservancy. A sprawling campus of stucco buildings and lifelike habitats, the conservancy is a state-of-the-art preserve. The car passes the main gate, where a worker in a conservancy uniform waves Gregg through. As the live- stock truck pulls in behind them, the worker picks up his walkie-talkie.
C: CONSERVANCY WORKER
D: Main gate to Dr. Banks. They're pulling up now.

S: EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - DAY
N: Cecily clicks off her walkie-talkie, turns and yells to anyone in earshot.
C: CECILY
D: Elvis is in the building! I repeat, Elvis is in the building...
N: On her order, workers in matching conservancy uniforms start moving into position around Joe's Habitat. NEAR OBSERVATION AREA A crane is lowering a platform into place that will straddle the moat. Harry scowls, seemingly unable to enjoy the moment.
C: CECILY
D: You hear that, Harry?
N: From around the conservancy, we can hear the sounds of the other ANIMALS, SCREECHING, SNARLING, BELLOWING...
C: CECILY
D: They smell him.
C: HARRY
D: Gregg, or the gorilla?
N: They both turn as... CONSERVANCY CAR pulls up right in front of them. Gregg gets out first.
C: HARRY
D: I'm confused, O'Hara. You phone us to say you're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal...
C: GREGG
D: Hello, Harry. Cecily.
C: CECILY
D: Welcome back, baby.
E: affectionate
C: HARRY
D: ... but security tells me you've requested no firehoses, no restraints of any kind...
C: GREGG
D: Let me introduce you to...
C: HARRY
D: How are we supposed to control the animal? With a giant, rolled-up...
N: Harry trails off as Jill gets out of the car.
C: HARRY
D: ... newspaper?
N: Harry wasn't prepared for somebody this young and beautiful. Neither was Cecily. They raise their eyebrows at Gregg.
C: GREGG
D: Jill Young, Dr. Harry Ruben -- he run the place -- and Dr. Cecily Banks, who makes sure he doesn't screw it up.
C: CECILY
D: Chief veterinarian. Hi.
E: chuckles
N: Jill steps forward, shy and polite. She extends her hand.
C: JILL
D: Hello. It's a privilege to meet you both.
N: Harry is too flustered by Jill to say a word. He just manages a weird little smile and a sound that's not English. Just then, a BANG and a loud GROWL come out of the trailer. Harry and Cecily almost jump out of their skins.
C: JILL
D: Coming, Joe! Hold on! I think he'd like to come out now -- if you don't mind.
E: to Harry
C: HARRY
D: Mind? No, of course I don't mind.
E: stammering, scared
N: Jill and Gregg look at each other, excited. This is the moment they've been waiting for. They grin at each other.
C: GREGG
D: Harry? I think it's time you met Joe.
N: They start moving to the trailer...
C: HARRY
D: Hold it!
N: Harry whirls around and waves over a pair of nerdy, grad- school-geek conservancy workers, JACK and VERN. They run eagerly forward to take orders. They gawk at Jill, each one instantly deciding she is the woman of their dreams. Harry barks at them, bringing them back to attention.
C: HARRY
D: Jack? Vern? Get the sedatives ready.
C: JILL
D: We won't need any of that.
E: quickly
C: HARRY
D: Miss Young, we know what we're doing here, and the best way to...
N: Gregg steps forward.
C: GREGG
D: Harry -- you and I made an agreement. The lady's in charge of Joe.
S: EXT. BACK OF TRAILER
N: Jack and Vern nervously raise the gate to the back of the trailer. The gate lays flat against a retractable plank that creates a bridge to the habitat. JOE GROWLS SOFTLY from inside.
C: JACK
D: Easy, big boy.
C: VERN
D: Don't forget who's gonna feed you.
N: They raise the gate completely. Jill comes up behind them.
C: JILL
D: I'll take it from here.
N: Jack and Vern are only too happy to let Jill take over. JOE'S POV - FROM TRAILER DOOR He can hear Jill but sees only her silhouette at first... and the lush greenery behind her. He GROWLS... The entire staff, other than Gregg, takes one step back- ward. Harry whispers in his ear.
C: HARRY
D: You sure she knows what she's doing?
N: Gregg's watching Jill with quiet admiration.
C: GREGG
D: She knows.
N: BACK BY TRAILER Jill keeps coaxing Joe.
C: JILL
D: Come on, Joe. Come on, big guy.
N: SHADOW passes over the staff of the conservancy. A look of absolute wonderment on every face as Joe emerges from the trailer. Cecily nudges Harry, whose jaw is slack. Gregg sees this reaction, and beams. BY TRAILER Joe takes a step forward. He looks out across the plat- form into the sanctuary -- taking in the familiar trees and flowers the staff has planted for him. ON HARRY AND CECILY Completely overwhelmed by the sight of this massive creature. Cecily manages a few words.
C: CECILY
D: That is one, big gorilla.
N: BACK TO JOE His head turning sideways at the sound of her voice. A tense moment, as Joe glares at the assembled crowd. He is magnificent. Awesome. Staggering. Harry knows a photo-op when he sees one. He whispers loudly to Vern:
C: HARRY
D: Hey! What do I pay you for? Get some shots -- of me, too.
N: Vern picks up a camera and scrambles to get into position -- but he's so nervous that he trips, sprawling on the ground and startling Joe. Joe turns and scampers back into the trailer. Vern gets back on his feet, red-faced. Jill glares at Harry. Gregg just chuckles at the stupidity. Harry blames Vern.
C: HARRY
D: What -- he did it.
N: BY TRAILER Jill walks to the edge of the trailer. She coos into the darkened interior.
C: JILL
D: Come on, ya big baby. Come on back. Do I have to come in there and get you myself?
N: She heads into the trailer after him. Harry and Cecily exchange incredulous looks. INSIDE TRAILER We can hear JOE making PANTING and HOOTING sounds, almost as if he is trying to reason with Jill. Jill coos and makes her own soothing sighs and sounds. Their noises bounce off the metal trailer walls. OUTSIDE TRAILER Everyone exchanges curious glances. Miss Young is one strange girl. Gregg just smiles. A moment passes -- and then the trailer begins to rock as Jill backs out of it, followed by Joe. She leads him, walking backwards, down the platform, then steps off so he can pass.
C: JILL
D: That's it. That-a-boy.
E: soothing
N: Joe hesitantly takes a few steps forward on his own.
C: GREGG
D: Go on, Joe. Go on.
E: under his breath
N: Everyone holds their breath as Joe completes the crossing. Gregg looks over at Jill. Her eyes are glistening. Joe heads up through the back of the habitat, already investigating his new home. Everyone exhales.
C: HARRY
D: Alright. Take the platform away.
N: Jill is instantly alarmed. She turns to Harry.
C: JILL
D: Hold on -- I'm going in with him.
N: Harry shakes his head and motions for the workers to proceed with removing the platform.
C: HARRY
D: No. We can't allow that. We don't have insurance to cover anyone in there who's not an employee.
C: GREGG
D: Harry...
C: JILL
D: But you said -- I'm in charge of Joe.
C: HARRY
D: Yes. And I'm in charge of this facility.
N: Jill looks over at Gregg, distraught. Gregg shakes his head, disgusted -- he sees exactly where this is going.
S: 50A INT. HALLWAY OF CONSERVANCY CONDO - DAY 50A
N: Jill and Gregg are at a door that Gregg is unlocking. Jill paces angrily and storms through the door as Gregg opens it. CAMERA FOLLOWS Gregg in. He's carrying her bags.
C: JILL
D: 'I'm in charge of this facility.' Who is that guy? I bet that man hasn't spent one night outside in his entire life.
E: imitating Harry
C: GREGG
D: Probably not.
C: JILL
D: You said I was going to be in charge of Joe. I should be sleeping down there, with him, not in this... this... cage.
E: taking in the space
N: Gregg is grim and quiet. He thinks what she's saying is true. He sets her bags down, detesting the antiseptic space as much as she does. Feeling claustrophobic, Jill dashes to the window and tries to open it. It's a double-paned window. The top doesn't open at all -- the bottom cranks open three inches, barely letting in air. Jill pushes on the window, horrified?
C: JILL
D: What's wrong with this window? That's all it opens? That's all?
E: pushing on it MORE
N: 50A CONTINUED: 50A
C: JILL
D: This is wrong. This is all wrong... Please, fix it, or do something...
E: CONT'D growing breathless pleading
N: It only takes a second. Gregg grabs a pillow from the couch and lays it against the top portion of the window. He gives it one swift karate chop, breaking out the glass. He methodically breaks out the remaining shards, dusts off the pillow, and carefully replaces it on the couch. Jill just stares at him, open-mouthed. Gregg looks her straight in the eye.
C: GREGG
D: I'll do everything I can for you.
E: quietly
N: They hold each other's eyes.
C: JILL
D: Thank you.
E: small voice
N: Gregg walks out.
S: 50B EXT. CONSERVANCY - NIGHT 50B
N: The conservancy is quiet at night, except for the occasional ANIMAL sound rising into the air.
S: 50C INT. JILL'S CONDO - NIGHT 50C
N: Jill leans on her elbows, staring out her recently-broken window, a lost look on her face.
S: 51A EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - THAT MOMENT 51A
N: The CAMERA LEAVES Jill's window and FINDS Joe, sitting in his man-made grassy field, looking equally lost and lonely. He is unsure of what to do with himself, confused by his surroundings. PAN TO:
S: 51B EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT 51B
N: The CAMERA FINDS Gregg, leaning against the bar at the edge of the moat. His face is soft as he watches Joe. Joe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right corner of his habitat. Gregg follows Joe's eyeline and sees that Joe is looking at a TRANSFORMER. The ELECTRIC BUZZ reaches Gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in a new way. He hears its HUM the way Joe hears it -- strange, menacing. Gregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the designers pay attention to this? He looks back at Joe, almost apologetically, and is startled to find that: Joe is looking back at him. It is the first time these two have had real eye contact, and for Gregg it is almost overwhelming. Man and beast read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to Gregg. Gregg finally feels some of what Jill has been feeling. He connects to Joe. And Joe connects to Gregg. It's just a blink of the eye, a turn of the head -- but it's there. And they both feel it.

C: CECILY
D: Where's Gregg?
C: HARRY
D: Beats me. He collected his pay check. He's probably in some jungle by now, not using deodorant.
C: CECILY
D: I think he should be here. This is his discovery, after all.
C: HARRY
D: Excuse me, Gregg's expertise is pitching tents, not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board.

D: Know what I think, Harry?
E: disgusted
C: HARRY
D: I have a feeling I'm gonna find out.

E: O.S. beat
N: In the distance, we see a Cadillac approaching on the Conservancy roadway.

D: Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species... mollusk, anything. Instead, he makes the zoological discovery of the century.
C: CECILY
D: And he still has a full head of hair.
C: HARRY
D: That's not funny.
N: Cecily nods to the road.
C: CECILY
D: Heads up.
N: The Cadillac comes to a stop in front of them. A distinguished man in a business suit steps out. This is ELLIOT BAKER, the Chairman of the Board.
C: HARRY
D: Elliot. Good to see you again.
C: BAKER
D: Harry. Dr. Banks.
N: He claps his hands together.

D: So? Let's go see him.
C: CECILY
D: Right this way.
S: INT. CONSERVANCY NEAR JOE'S HABITAT - DAY
N: Harry and Cecily walk with a conservative-looking man in his fifties, Elliot Baker, the Chairman of the Board of the conservancy. Harry is working for brownie points, excitedly pointing out his "important role" in discovering Joe.
C: HARRY
D: I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it. It was just a hunch -- sort of a gut feeling -- but I sent my field zoologist to check it out.
N: Cecily shoots a look at Harry. She's not going to let him grab the glory away from Gregg.
C: CECILY
D: That field zoologist, Dr. O'Hara, had a theory -- and Joe's blood work confirms it. The gorillas in the Pangani carry a recessive gene that pops up every four or five generations with this rare form of gigantism.
C: BAKER
D: And that's where the legend comes from! That zoologist of yours -- what's his name, Harry?
E: excited
C: HARRY
D: Gregg O'Hara.
E: begrudging
C: BAKER
D: Pretty damn sharp.
N: This kills Harry. Cecily snickers. They arrive at the fence surrounding Joe's habitat.
C: HARRY
D: Here we are.
N: They walk up to the observation railing. Baker cranes his neck. Joe's nowhere to be seen.
C: BAKER
D: Where is he?
C: HARRY
D: Joe! Here, Joe! I told him the Chairman of the Board was coming and he promised to come say 'hi.'
E: calling apologetic joke to Baker
N: Cecily gaps and mouths "kiss ass" behind Baker's back.
C: BAKER
D: Well I don't see him.
C: HARRY
D: Mmmm. We'll feed him. That'll get him to come out.
C: CECILY

N: Mementos, photos, and fabrics from home are strewn around, already adding Jill's warmth and personality to the place. Jill is standing at the window hanging an African piece of fabric as a makeshift curtain when a piercing ALARM RINGS OUT over the compound. Worried by the urgent sound of the alarm, Jill steps down and hurries out the door.
S: 58C EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - DAY 58C
N: Jill runs out of the building and almost collides with Gregg, who is rushing in..
C: GREGG

D: What is that noise?
C: GREGG
D: Come on!
N: The two of them rush off across the compound. As they do, they pass... JILL'S POV - BUNKER A concrete building that's used to lock down wild animals. Jill watches, nervously, as conservancy workers with tranquilizer rifles stream out of the building and jump into vehicles, heading toward Joe's habitat.

N: Jill and Gregg follow Cecily towards... JOE'S HABITAT Conservancy workers have entered Joe's habitat and have their guns trained on -- JOE who is standing in a clearing, SNARLING and beating his chest. Which is scaring the crap out of... HARRY who, white as a sheet, hides behind a tree, his hands shaking. He doesn't dare move an inch, for fear Joe will spot him. BY GATE The conservancy workers are raising their tranq rifles, about to fire, when...
C: GREGG
D: Stop!
N: Jill and Gregg come running up behind them. Jill yells to Harry.
C: JILL
D: Harry! Jump out from behind the tree!
N: He shakes his head. No way he's gonna jump in front of that gorilla.
C: JILL
D: Jump out and say 'You found me!'
C: GREGG
D: Do it, Harry!
N: Joe grabs a bush and tears it from the ground... The guards aim their rifles, fingers on triggers... And Harry, having nothing to lose but his life, jumps out from behind the tree...
C: HARRY
D: You found me!
N: There is a tense moment, then... Joe stops growling. In the next instant, he starts spinning in a circle, gleefully. Then he dashes off and hides behind a very tiny tree. ON HARRY completely confused. Jill walks up to him.
C: JILL
D: He's playing hide and seek.
N: Jill starts rooting around in the trees, pretending not to see Joe.
C: JILL
D: Okay, where are you? Come out, big guy! Where'd he go? There you are!
E: finding him
N: He screams with delight, and spins in a circle again. As it dawns on everyone that she's actually right, and that he's really playing, the guards start to lower their guns. Then they start laughing. An embarrassed Harry slinks by Gregg, who can't help but chuckle as he leaves.

N: An exhausted Harry catches his breath at the gate around the habitat. Baker has a thoughtful look on his face.
C: BAKER
D: Put that girl in charge of the gorilla, Harry.
C: HARRY
D: What? Elliot, she's got no scientific...
C: BAKER
D: That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has ever seen. He's happy -- I'm happy. Put her on the payroll.
N: Baker turns and walks away.
S: EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Gregg and Cecily watch as Jill plays hide and seek with Joe. Jill dashes away and runs over to Gregg. She is absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness. She grabs both his arms, jumping up and down.
C: JILL
D: He's playing! Did you see?
C: GREGG
D: I saw.
E: laughing
C: JILL
D: He likes it here! Isn't it great?
C: GREGG
D: It's great.
N: Jill surprises Gregg by giving him a hug. Gregg looks over her shoulder and sees that Joe is giving him the evil eye. He's jealous. Gregg stares back, equally challenging. Jill, unaware of the competition, lets go of Gregg and happily runs back to Joe. Gregg and Joe continue to hold each other's eyes. Cecily sighs and shakes her head.
C: CECILY
D: Sorry, babe, but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass.
C: GREGG
D: What are you talking about?
C: CECILY
D: Oh please. I was wondering why you hadn't taken off yet. Normally, you're out the door soon as the animal's in his habitat.
C: GREGG
D: You've got an active imagination, Cecily.
C: CECILY
D: I don't think so. I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.
N: Gregg scoffs. But from the look on his face, it's clear she's hit a nerve.
S: INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
N: A KNOCK at Jill's apartment door. She opens it and lights up to see Gregg standing there. Gregg looks past her into the room. She's made some changes; the bed's on the floor and a few large potted ferns crowd the room.
C: GREGG
D: Like what you've done with the place.
C: JILL
D: Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window.
N: She smiles at him and motions for him to come in. Gregg steps just inside the door and stops.

C: JILL
D: I know! This is working out -- better than I expected.

N: Garth stops abruptly, glancing at Strasser's hand. He knows better than to mention it directly. Strasser looks down... CLOSEUP - STRASSER'S HAND tanned, manicured, and missing the thumb and forefinger. The leather he's been polishing this whole time is his prosthetic hand. He straps it back on.
C: STRASSER
D: I am always amazed how, if you wait long enough, the opportunity for justice finally comes.
E: softly, to himself
N: Garth watches his boss, who seems lost in his private dream of revenge. It's a moment before Strasser looks back at him.
C: STRASSER
D: Book us two tickets to America. We're going to pay a visit to this incredible animal.
N: He looks back at the TV, where Jill is on screen.
C: STRASSER
D: I think I know how to convince his current owners to part with him.
N: And on that foreboding note...
T: CUT TO:
N: thru thru
S: EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON
N: CLOSE ON the sleepy face of a shaggy yak. PULL BACK TO a small group of V.I.P.s being led on a tour by Harry.
C: HARRY
D: This fellow is one of only three hundred wild yaks remaining on the planet. There are those who would ask, why should we care if this sub-species of yak survives?
N: We SPOT a man blending in with the group. We recognize Garth. He looks quite respectable in a suit. The antsy V.I.P. next to Garth interrupts Harry. V.I.P. #1 Excuse me. Can we see Joe? The other V.I.P.s echo this wish. Harry refocuses himself.
C: HARRY
D: You certainly can -- for the mere price of a 'Diamond Circle Benefactor Ticket' to tomorrow night's benefit.
E: charming
N: The V.I.P.s laugh and groan. Garth takes this moment to slip away, unnoticed. Harry twinkles at the V.I.P.s.
C: HARRY
D: It's all for a good cause.
S: 68A EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - ANOTHER AREA - LATER 68A
N: Harry is waving good-bye to the V.I.P.s, who have completed their tour.
C: HARRY
D: Good-bye. Good-bye. Throw money... throw money...
E: under his breath
N: Jill and Cecily drive up in an electric cart. Jill jumps out, wearing a conservancy T-shirt, and from the looks of things she's been working hard in the habitat all day. She's a lovely mess, head to toe. 68A CONTINUED: (A1) 68A She runs up to Harry, all energy and smiles.
C: JILL
D: Harry -- see what's in that cart? That's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe. Did you by any chance place that new order I asked for?
C: HARRY
D: Of course I... actually, perhaps I...
E: guilty
C: JILL
D: I wouldn't be surprised if you forgot, considering you have so much on your mind.
E: sympathetic
N: 68A CONTINUED: 68A
C: HARRY
D: I'll go rush order it for you now.
C: JILL
D: Thank you so much.
E: beaming
N: Cecily rolls her eyes. Jill winks at her conspiratorially.
C: CECILY
D: She's nice. I'm not. If you forget to order something I need, I'll knock you upside the head.
E: to Harry
N: Cecily and Harry walk off grumbling at each other like an old married couple.
C: HARRY
D: I keep telling you -- stop talking to me like that.
C: CECILY
D: Please. You love it.
N: Jill smiles to herself. She turns to get back to her other business, and almost walks right into: Gregg. He's been leaning against a wall, and he's caught the whole thing.
C: GREGG
D: Lobelia leaves. Should have called me in Africa. I would have brought 'em back for ya.
N: Jill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to handle Gregg's sudden reappearnce. His clothes look travelled in, and another month in Africa has put a deeper shade of brown on his face. He's got the ragged look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight.
C: GREGG
D: Nice to see you running the place, Jill.
N: Jill nods and starts walking like someone with urgent business to attend to. Gregg falls in beside her.
C: JILL
D: You're back early. What happened? Run out of humvees to crash?
N: 68A CONTINUED: (2) 68A
C: GREGG
D: No -- just wanted to get back.
C: JILL
D: Really? And why is that?
E: frosty
C: GREGG
D: Guess I missed Harry.
N: Gregg smiles teasingly at Jill but she's in no mood to melt that easily. He continues.
C: GREGG
D: They want me to show my face at the fundraiser tomorrow night... and I guess I got my mind fixed on a good meal in a fine restaurant. Thought you might like to join me.
C: JILL
D: No thanks. I still don't want to leave Joe.
E: cool
C: GREGG
D: 'Still'? Haven't you been out of here yet?
C: JILL
D: What's to see? Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way...
E: flip
N: Gregg reaches out and slows her down. He wants to see her eyes.
C: GREGG
D: Come on. Have dinner with me, Jill. You won't find a better excuse to brush your hair.
E: tenderly
N: Gregg reaches out and pulls a piece of straw from Jill's tossled locks. She can't help herself anymore -- and breaks into a slow smile.
C: JILL
D: I'll brush my hair if you take a shower.
C: GREGG
D: Deal.
E: grins
S: 68B EXT. OUTSIDE JOE'S HABITAT - DAY 68B
N: Garth walks quickly -- but not fast enough to draw attention. He moves along the handrail at the edge of the moat. Takes off his sunglasses and looks for Joe. GARTH'S POV - JOE is moving slowly among saplings. CLOSE ON GARTH'S HAND as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the poaching dog collars. Garth looks around -- then gives the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them back into his pocket. Joe reacts immediately to the JANGLING sound. Imprinted deep in his memory. He rises up quickly and GROWLS furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the danger. It's instinctive and frightening. Joe sees Garth and charges him. Joe's anger takes him into the electrified wire around the habitat. JOE ROARS at the shock and recoils.
C: GARTH
D: You remember, don't you?
S: 69A EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT 69A
N: It's a beautiful and lively night on Venice Beach. A few people have made bonfires along the water's edge, and the MUSIC of a DISTANT bar band wafts through the air. It's a magic night. Gregg and Jill walk away from a funky food shack, festooned with tiny lights. They share a carton of fish and chips.
C: JILL
D: So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant?
C: GREGG
D: Yeah.
E: thinks about it
N: Gregg grins at Jill, all boyish charm. She stiffles a smile, struggling to hold on to her pervious indignation. 69A CONTINUED: 69A
C: JILL
D: Don't point that smile at me. I'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone.
C: GREGG
D: I'm sorry -- I had things I had to do...
E: guilty
C: JILL
D: Uh-huh...
E: doesn't buy it
C: GREGG
D: Besides, you weren't all alone. You had Joe.
N: Jill nods at the truth of this. She continues, almost to herself:
C: JILL
D: That's right. Me and Joe. Just like always.
E: softly
N: There is a lonliness about Jill as she says this. Gregg senses it.
C: GREGG
D: Growing up with him around -- what's it been like for you? I mean -- most guys are afraid of girls' fathers. I can just see a guy telling Joe he'll get you home by midnight...
C: JILL
D: Never had anyone to bring home anyway. All that stuff -- I don't even know what it's like.
E: shrugs
C: GREGG
D: All what 'stuff'?
C: JILL
D: Whatever you want to call it. Being in love.
E: defensive/dismissive
C: GREGG
D: Well -- it's kinda like getting bit by a makiki spider.
E: smiles
N: 69A CONTINUED: (2) 69A Jill looks sharply at Gregg. Not so fast.
C: JILL
D: Oh yeah? How's that?
C: GREGG
D: You'll get a kind of a fever...
E: stepping closer to Jill
C: JILL
D: Fever? Really. How high?
C: GREGG
D: Pretty high.
C: JILL
D: Interesting. Hallucinations with that?
C: GREGG
D: Oh yeah... and you'll, uh -- find yourself saying things. Lots of things.
N: Gregg is very close to Jill. He wants to kiss her right now. Jill smiles. She knows what he's doing. Maybe she'll let Gregg kiss her. Just then:
C: JILL
D: Aaah!
N: She pulls a beeper off her belt and checks the message. INSERT - BEEPER READOUT A message scrolls across that says, "GET BACK HERE! NOW!!!"
C: JILL
D: Come on!
N: Jill and Gregg bolt for the car. 70A OMITTED 70A
S: EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - NIGHT
N: JOE is on a major destructive rampage, pulling up trees, ROARING, beating his chest. PAN TO:
S: EXT. HABITAT - BY GATE - NIGHT
N: Gregg, Jill, Cecily and Harry watching Joe's rampage from outside the gate. Jack and Vern run over, covered in mud and overly exited.
C: VERN
D: He's ripping out saplings like bam-bam-bam!
C: JACK
D: And taking out irrigation pipes. One good yank -- on comes the flood.
C: HARRY
D: He just pulled out another acacia tree. You know what I paid for those?
C: GREGG
D: Do you know what's wrong with him?
E: to Cecily
N: Cecily shakes her head "no."
C: CECILY
D: Do you?
E: to Jill
N: Jill's brow is furrowed with concern.
C: JILL
D: No.
C: HARRY
D: Well could you get in there and calm him down before he pulls out the rest of my landscaping?
S: 72A EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - NIGHT 72A
N: Jill has done her job. Joe is calm but spent, leaning against a tree. Jill sits in his lap, softly singing the same lullaby we heard her mother sing to her 12 years ago. She caresses the palm of Joe's giant leathery paw, her tiny white hand almost disappearing in its black folds. Gregg watches, leaning against a tree not ten feet away. It is the most intimate moment between Jill and Joe that he has seen yet. The tableau invokes myth: the beauty in the service of the beast; the man who has come to free her. 72A CONTINUED: 72A Gregg comes forward... slowly... but Joe suddenly lifts his head and GRUNTS at him, a kind of warning bark for Gregg to stay where he is. Jill doesn't even notice. She lays her soft cheek against Joe's giant palm. He cradles her face. She closes her eyes.
T: FADE OUT. FADE IN:
S: INT. CONSERVANCY CONTROL ROOM - CLOSE ON BAKER - NEXT
N: DAY Looking fairly annoyed.
C: BAKER
D: Impossible.
E: emphatic
N: PULL OUT to find: Baker, facing off with Jill. She looks flushed with emotion as she follows Baker around the room, dogging him.
C: JILL
D: Please, Mr. Baker -- I wouldn't be asking you to postpone the benefit unless I thought there was something really wrong with Joe. And I do.
E: adamant
C: BAKER
D: From what I heard, you sang him to sleep last night like a baby. What's really wrong about that?
C: JILL
D: I swear to you, Joe's still not himself -- he's nervous and agitated. He shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now. If you would only delay the party a few more...
C: BAKER
D: It's too late, Jill.
C: JILL
D: No. It's too soon.
E: adamant
N: Baker gives Jill a hard look.
C: BAKER
D: Miss Young, let me give you some advice. Stop worrying about Joe, and start worrying about what you'll wear tomorrow night.
N: With that, Baker gives Jill his back and starts a phone call. Frustrated, Jill turns and walks out of the room.
S: EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Jill storms out of Baker's office stewing, head down. She's walking so fast that she collides into a man coming the other way.
C: JILL
D: Oh! Excuse me.
N: The man rights himself and smiles politely.
C: STRASSER
D: No, excuse me. My fault.
N: It's Strasser. He's tamed his looks and dressed himself in modest attire. With his damaged hand concealed in his pocket and a pleasant smile arranged on his face, he has re-invented himself. He comes across like a friendly conservationist. He stares openly at Jill. It flusters her.
C: STRASSER
D: I'm so sorry -- it's just -- you must be Jill Young...
E: feigning surprise
C: JILL
D: Yes...?
C: STRASSER
D: And -- you look just like her.
E: "moved"
N: The words electrify Jill. She almost gasps.
C: STRASSER
D: I'm Andre Strasser. An old friend of your mother's. I knew her when she was only a little older than you, and you were just a tiny thing. What an incredible woman she was.
E: warmly
N: Jill is overwhelmed. She immediately melts. She reaches her hand out to him.
C: JILL
D: How wonderful to meet you. What are you doing here?
N: Strasser pretends to look uncomfortable.
C: STRASSER
D: I've come to talk with your Mr. Baker. You see, I am here for Joe. And, in a way, for your mother, too. I believe she would agree with me -- a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space -- like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana.
E: pained passionate
N: Bingo. Jill's face falls. The guilt is working already.
C: JILL
D: Raha? A preserve?
C: STRASSER
D: I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. I would like to offer them to Joe. Here, it's such a shame... to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money...
E: sighs
N: Strasser shakes his head at the inhumanity of it all. His clever words work on Jill like a charm -- she looks absolutely crestfallen. He pretends to comfort her.
C: STRASSER
D: Oh -- I've upset you! Please... I only mean to offer an alternative. I will be attending the event tomorrow night. Maybe we can talk more about this matter then.
C: JILL
D: I'll look forward to it.
C: STRASSER
D: Good-bye.
N: Strasser walks off, leaving Jill deep in thought. He smiles to himself, certain he's landed a direct hit.
S: EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - NIGHT
N: A tent has been set up outside Joe's habitat, the long end flush up against the railing that surrounds the moat.
T: CUT TO:
S: INT. TENT - NIGHT
N: A small, elegant and tasteful party. A collection of fifty VIPs, all dressed to the nines, mingle with the conservancy staff. Tables have been arranged in a wide semi-circle around a podium, which is on the moat edge of the tent. BY BAR Gregg, wearing a tuxedo, walks up to Cecily and Harry, also in black tie. Harry is stuffing his face. Cecily looks admiringly at Gregg.
C: CECILY
D: Don't you clean up nice.
C: GREGG
D: Cecily -- you're ravishing. Harry -- you got shrimp on your shirt.
N: Harry looks down at his shirt smeared with cocktail sauce.
C: HARRY
D: Of course. I look ridiculous.
E: dismayed
C: CECILY
D: No. You look fine. They look ridiculous.
E: pointing at Jack and Vern
N: Jack and Vern are off the dweeb-scale in their ill-fitting tuxes. They crowd the food table, gobbling down appetizers.
C: HARRY
D: Hel-lo. Look what we have here.
N: Gregg and Cecily turn to see what Harry's looking at. BY ENTRANCE Jill has just stepped into the tent, looking absolutely stunning. All heads turn too look at her. Intimidated, she falters at the door, too afraid to enter. BACK ON STAFF Like everyone else in the room, Cecily and Harry admire Jill. Gregg is rendered speechless by her beauty.
C: CECILY
D: I picked out the dress. Aren't I smart?
E: proud
C: GREGG
D: Brilliant.
N: Gregg picks up a glass of champagne for Jill and starts crossing the room to her.
C: CECILY
D: Shut your mouth, Harry -- you're catching flies.
N: ON JILL Feeling terribly insecure, Jill gratefully watches Gregg cross the room towards her. They can't take their eyes off each other. When he reaches her side, she grabs on to him.
C: JILL
D: Tell me the truth -- do I look stupid in this? Everyone is staring at me.
E: self-conscious
C: GREGG
D: They're not staring at you. They're staring at that... uh... banana tower.
E: reassuring looks around
N: Jill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind her. It's the creation of an over-zealous caterer. Jill blushes, realizing Gregg's joking.
C: JILL
D: Very funny.
N: ACROSS ROOM Strasser and Garth observe the crowd.
C: GARTH
D: Quite a turnout they have here.
C: STRASSER
D: All the better.
C: BAKER
D: Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
E: O.S.
N: Strasser puts his drink down, taps Garth.
C: STRASSER
D: Let's go.
N: The two of them head for the exit. AT PODIUM - WITH BAKER
C: BAKER
D: When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique, so spectacular, that it literally took your breath away? Well, prepare yourselves, for tonight you will have such an experience.
N: WITH STRASSER AND GARTH Heading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will be more of an "experience" than Baker is bargaining for. Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the dog collar... Just as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his feet.
C: JACK
D: There's nothing in this punch, man. I could drink twelve of these and not feel a thing.
E: to Vern
N: Smack! Jack collides with Garth, causing Garth to drop the dog collar. Vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on the collar).
C: VERN
D: Sorry! Here's your... uh... key chain.
N: Garth grabs it back. Strasser nods coolly to Vern and Jack.
C: STRASSER
D: Thank you.
N: Vern and Jack stumble on, none the wiser. Strasser and Garth slip out.
S: EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Joe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat when something abruptly catches his ear. A slight JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating through the air. It GROWS LOUDER. Joe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat. JOE'S POV Garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat, rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him, from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL and then he sees something that really drives him nuts. Strasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now... ZOOM IN ON JOE His eyes, locking with Strasser's. His pupils narrow, his nostrils flare, and Joe FREAKS OUT! He starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then he ROARS and charges straight for them, stopping at the water's edge. ON STRASSER locking eyes with Joe. This is the first time he has seen Joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago. A smile creeps across his face.
C: STRASSER
D: So you haven't forgotten me. Good. Have you forgotten this?
E: to himself holding up his dead hand
N: Garth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying Joe's display of rage.
C: GARTH
D: What do you think the big guy is worth? A couple million?
C: STRASSER
D: I will get that for the paws alone. After we sell him off piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make?
N: Garth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe rush at them again.
C: GARTH
D: Got you going now! That should rattle the jewelry off the ladies.
C: STRASSER
D: Hang it there -- where he can see it. And come back for it -- after.
E: indicating dog collar warning
N: Garth hangs the dog collar on the fence. Joe can hear it clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state.
C: STRASSER
D: Come, we've done our job here.
N: As Strasser and Garth leave, Joe looks after them, beside himself with fury. Outraged, he turns this way and that way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat.
S: INT. TENT - NIGHT
N: At the podium, Baker is making his presentation to the tony crowd.
C: BAKER
D: ... and now to introduce our remarkable new acquisition, I would like to bring up to the podium the director of the conservancy...
N: A sudden ROAR coming from behind the curtain drowns out Baker's voice. The audience members jump in their seats, frightened. Baker is rattled, too, then regains his composure.
C: BAKER
D: Well! I suppose there's no need to add to that introduction.
N: The audience laughs and relaxes.
C: BAKER
D: Here's Dr. Harry Ruben.
N: Baker motions to Harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of stage fright. Cecily gives him a discreet push on the back and he stumbles forward. JOE can still be heard GROWLING and beating his chest in the background. Jill and Gregg look at each other with mounting anxiety. Harry reaches the mic.
C: HARRY
D: In the time it took you to drive here tonight, three species have disappeared from the Earth. Extinct. Never to return. We here at the conservancy say this is a tragedy...
E: into mic
N: Another O.S. ROAR from JOE. It is spine-tingling. Harry almost jumps out of his loafers.
C: HARRY
D: Obviously Joe agrees.
E: nervous joke
N: Everybody laughs. The audience doesn't know enough to be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering. Jill is feeling increasingly nervous. She glances around the room and meets eyes with Strasser. He nods at her, his eyes indicating that he is "worried" for Joe as well. Jill nods back. We continue to hear uncanny SOUNDS from behind the curtain. It's all Harry can do to stick to his speech. He keeps glancing nervously over his shoulder.
C: HARRY
D: But tonight, rather than focusing on what we've lost, I'm going to introduce you to something we've found.
N: There is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill grabs Gregg's hand tightly.
C: HARRY
D: Ladies and gentlemen, the California Animal Conservancy proudly introduces our newest member, Mighty Joe...
N: CRASH! Before Harry can say "Young," a TREE comes CRASHING through the curtain. Gregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just as the tree crushes the podium into kindling. Joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain. He has joined the party. Joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear, literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously, wondering if this is really just part of the show. But Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances -- what the hell is going on? Jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She wants to get his attention.
C: JILL
D: Hey, Joe. I'm right here. You hear me? Good boy. Take it easy, Joe. We don't want to scare anybody, do we?
E: soothing
N: Jill is within arm's reach of Joe -- it looks like he might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile... But that's when he spots Strasser. Joe's face registers towering rage as Strasser stares back, provoking Joe further. Joe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into Jill and sends her flying backwards into a wall. She hits the wall and sinks down, stunned. JOE heads through the people towards Strasser. The party erupts with screams. Joe makes his way towards Strasser, swatting people out of the way. ON STRASSER Frozen, in horror, as Joe plows through the party, heading straight for him. Tables are broken like match sticks, GLASS SHATTERS. Joe catches up to Strasser, grabs his tuxedo jacket and hoists him into the air. CLOSE ON MAN It's not Strasser. Frustrated, Joe flings him aside. The man flies through the air, slamming into the tent wall, and then falling on the catering table. ON GREGG AND JILL As they watch Joe's rampage in horror.
C: JILL
D: My God. What's wrong with him?
C: GREGG
D: We've got to bring him down. I'm going for the tranq guns.
C: JILL
D: No -- let me stop him.
N: But Gregg's already taken off. MEANWHILE Mighty Joe is still looking for Strasser, as he heads back across the room. A glamorous couple, (TERRY and RAY), crawls frantically on all fours, trying to stay ahead of Joe.
C: TERRY
D: Faster! Faster!
E: frantic
C: RAY
D: I'm trying!
N: JILL is pushing against the tide of people to get to Joe. Somebody shoves against her hard: it's Baker, in a panic to get away. JOE continues to make his way towards Strasser. As he rushes towards him... A security guard runs into the tent, raising his TRANQ gun and FIRES... The dart misses, hitting a fleeing guest, who, we see as he crumples to the ground, is actually Baker. STRASSER is fleeing for the exit. JOE chases him through the tent. A guest falls in Joe's path and Joe heedlessly steps on his leg, crushing it. The man screams in agony. 84A. JILL is scrambling over broken tables and chairs to get to Joe, when he turns sharply away from her. BACK TO SCENE Strasser is trapped behind a table. JOE throws the table out of his way, ROARS and is about to crush a cowering Strasser into poacher mulch, when... SFX: the EXPLOSION of a RIFLE. Joe looks surprised at first. Joe drops to all fours, revealing Gregg holding a tranq gun. Other Animal Control Officers are with him, also holding tranq rifles. Gregg lowers his gun, a pained expression on his face. But one tranq dart is not enough to stop Mighty Joe. He rises again, ready to smash Strasser... And a HAIL of TRANQ DARTS sail through the air as the conservancy workers pepper Joe with SHOTS. Joe swipes several darts from his flank -- but the accumulation is too much even for him. He stumbles backward and falls. Jill screams. Gregg looks sick at the sight of Joe falling. Joe hits the ground hard. His eyes close.
T: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN:
S: A81 EXT. CONSERVANCY - DAY A81
N: A grim-faced FEMALE REPORTER faces the camera. The tent is sprawled on the ground in the b.g. As she starts to speak we PAN PAST a line of other TV news reporters delivering essentially the same report TO CAMERA. 84B. A81 CONTINUED: (A1) A81 NEWS ANCHOR #1 Officials here are saying they don't know what caused the animal's rampage, which injured over a dozen people, eight of which are currently hospitalized. Three of those have already filed law suits, and word has it that the City Attorney is calling for the animal to be put to sleep. Standing with me is the chairman of the Conservancy board, Elliot Baker. A81 CONTINUED: A81 She turns to her left and INTO FRAME we see Mr. Baker, steeling himself for the consequences of last night. NEWS ANCHOR #1 Mr. Baker, what is the Conservancy doing to assure the public Joe won't attack again?
C: BAKER
D: Joe has been transferred to a special steel reinforced concrete bunker.
N: NEWS ANCHOR #1 And what about after you let him out?
C: BAKER
D: That won't be happening anytime soon. In the meantime, we will do anything necessary to ensure the safety of the public.
S: EXT. BUNKER - DAY
N: A animal control officer has been posted outside the bunker, the conservancy's lockdown building for animals that get out of control. He stands next to his squad car, a rifle at his side.
S: INT. BUNKER - DAY
N: A holding room. A cage criss-crossed by six-inch steel bars. Joe stares out through one narrow window. He sees a bar-striped slice of blue sky. He reaches up one hand towards the window -- he can't even fit it through the bars. He still looks drugged and despondent. Hunched over. His head almost scrapes the ceiling. His breathing raspy. On the other side of the bars, Jill and Gregg hover like distraught parents. Jill pets Joe's fur through the bars.
C: JILL
D: Joe... look at me. Over here, big guy.
N: Joe barely reacts. Jill is near tears.
C: JILL
D: I knew something was wrong with him.
E: to Gregg
C: GREGG
D: What do you think happened out there?
C: JILL
D: Joe never would have hurt all those people unprovoked... something must have got to him.
E: shaking her head
C: GREGG
D: Something. Or someone.
N: Jill looks at Gregg, considering this for the first time.
C: HARRY
D: Jill?
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see Harry, poking his head in the room. He still looks freaked out from the events of the night.
C: HARRY
D: Can I talk to you for a second?
N: Jill nods. She takes one last look at Joe, then walks out of the room, leaving... Gregg, alone with Joe for the first time since Joe held him upside down in the jungle. Gregg leans against the cage next to Joe. They have never been in such close proximity before. The expressive-ness in Joe's eyes is uncanny -- Gregg feels almost as if he could understand what he's saying.
C: GREGG
D: Well this wasn't in the brochure, was it?
E: deeply sorry
N: Gregg looks around at the claustrophobic space.
C: GREGG
D: I promised you wouldn't be put in a cage. I'm sorry, Joe. I helped put you here. And now I'm going to do everything I can to get you out.
N: Gregg reaches out for Joe's paw and lays his hand in it. Joe gently curls his fingers around Gregg's hand.
S: EXT. OBSERVATION AREA - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Jill and Harry are in the observation area, a glassed-off room that looks into the holding cell. Harry is still extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before. He's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sure who he's worried about more -- Joe or himself.
C: HARRY
D: The City Attorney talked to Baker. It wasn't my decision, and there's nothing I can do about it.
C: JILL
D: About what?
C: HARRY
D: Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him.
C: JILL
D: In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days.
E: freaking out
C: HARRY
D: So sue me. Everybody else is.
C: JILL
D: Listen, Harry, either you tell them you're getting Joe out of there or I will!
C: HARRY
D: Don't you get it? This is way beyond you, and me. Joe freaked out on some very influential people. He's a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla...
C: JILL
D: He's not a killer!
E: interrupting
C: HARRY
D: ... and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to buy him a big back yard somewhere, Joe's got nowhere to go.
C: JILL
D: That's it? You're not going to do anything?
N: Harry looks at Jill's angry face -- he knows he's just lost her respect and it bugs him more than he'd like to admit. But there's nothing more he can say. He leaves the room, brushing shoulders with Gregg, entering. Judging from the expression on Gregg's face, he's overheard the whole thing. Jill and Gregg look at each other with determination in their eyes. There's no question in either of their minds about what needs to be done next.
C: JILL
D: I need your help.
C: GREGG
D: You got it.
S: EXT. BUNKER - NIGHT
N: An ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER stands guard outside the bunker. Gregg, Cecily, and Jill walk casually towards the Officer. The Officer straightens up and looks tough. He comes forward halfway to meet them.
C: CECILY
D: Good evening.
E: big smile
C: A.C. OFFICER
D: 'Evening.
N: Our three just breeze on by the Officer into the bunker.
C: A.C. OFFICER
D: Hey, wait a minute!
N: Gregg hangs back with the A.C. Officer as Cecily and Jill disappear inside. To buy time for Cecily and Jill, Gregg pretends to take the big lug into his confidences.
C: GREGG
D: We're conservancy doctors. Do me a favor -- stay here and guard the door.
E: confidential
N: The guard nods and looks confused. Gregg disappears inside.
S: INT. BUNKER - AT CAGE
N: Cecily takes a key from her pocket and opens the door to Joe's cage.
C: JILL
D: Come on, Joe. We're leaving. Let's get you out of here.
N: The open door has a stronger effect on Joe than the sedatives in his system. He clambers to his feet and follows Jill out of the cage.
C: A.C. OFFICER
D: What the hell are you doing?
E: O.S.
N: They turn to see the Officer has a rifle aimed at Joe. He's terrified. JOE GROWLS ominously.
C: CECILY
D: I'm Dr. Banks, the head vet. And I'm taking Joe for a CAT Scan.
C: A.C. OFFICER
D: I take my orders from Mr. Baker. Put him back in the cage. Now.
N: The Officer trains his gun on Joe. Joe looks at the Officer menacingly and bares his huge fangs.
C: GREGG
D: Officer, you don't want to point that gun at him, believe me.
E: friendly voice
N: The Officer suddenly grabs his neck, which now has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of it. Jill lowers a tranq gun.
C: JILL
D: He didn't believe you.
E: simply
N: The Officer slumps to the ground.
S: EXT. BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Cecily steps out of the bunker and blinks a flashlight into the dark. The red taillights of a trailer suddenly appear as a huge tractor trailer backs up towards the bunker. Cecily calls out towards the bunker:
C: CECILY
D: Bring him out.
N: Now Jill and Gregg lead Joe outside as Cecily opens the doors to the trailer. Joe climbs inside.
S: EXT. TRAILER
N: Now someone steps out of the passenger side of the cab. It's Strasser. Avoiding the back of the trailer (where he would encounter Joe), Strasser stays where he is and calls out to Jill in hushed tones.
C: STRASSER
D: Jill, I got the plane. It's waiting at the airport. We must hurry.
N: Strasser holds his hand up in salute to Gregg and Cecily -- that's about as close as he wants to get to them. Using urgency as an excuse, he jumps back into the trailer before anyone can engage him in further conversation. It's time to say good-bye. Cecily looks into the back of the trailer.
C: CECILY
D: I'm going to miss your ugly face. Be good, Joe.
C: HARRY
D: Yeah. Don't start a fight with anyone bigger than you.
E: O.S.
N: Harry steps out of the shadows. Everyone turns and looks at him. He feels their eyes on him and shuffles a little.
C: HARRY
D: You'd better leave out of the west gate. The guard there got called away. Urgent business.
N: Jill puts her arms around Harry. He's antsy and embarrassed.
C: JILL
D: You're not such a big coward after all.
C: HARRY
D: Okay, okay, let go.
E: as she keeps hugging
N: Harry disengages from Jill and disappears back where he came from. Now Cecily turns to Jill. She hugs her with great emotion.
C: CECILY
D: Write me when Joe gets settled.
N: 91A.
C: JILL
D: I promise.
N: Cecily moves off, leaving Gregg and Jill alone to say good-bye. They look into each other's eyes, hating to part, everything they have to say to each other still unsaid.
C: JILL
D: You coming to the airport, or...?
E: yearning
C: GREGG
D: I think I better stay here and keep people away from that bunker. Give you a head start before they realize he's gone.
E: strained
N: Jill is crumbling. For her, it's awful to leave him, but he's not acting heart-broken at all. Confused, she tries desperately to stay light. She chatters like a nervous schoolgirl.
C: JILL
D: Well -- if you're ever in Botswana, come by and take me out to a good meal in a fine restaurant. That is, if you're not afraid to tell Joe that you'll get me home by...
E: stammering
N: She doesn't get the rest of her sentence out because Gregg is kissing her mouth. It's the kiss he's been wanting to give her since the day he first laid eyes on her. He lets go of her again, leaving her breathlessly looking after him. He walks to the back of the trailer. Gregg and Joe make serious eyes contact.
C: GREGG
D: Take care of her for me, will ya?
E: pointedly, to Joe
N: Gregg shuts the trailer door and walks off, not daring to look back. Jill is about to call after him when Strasser steps back out of the passenger's side of the trailer. He whispers urgently:
C: STRASSER
D: Jill! We must go!
N: Jill runs to the passenger side of the trailer. 91B.
S: 87A INT. TRAILER CAB - THAT MOMENT 87A
N: Hopping into the trailer, Jill comes face to face with Garth, who is sitting behind the steering wheel. He nods to her, all business.
C: GARTH
D: Hello.
N: Strasser gets in on the other side of Jill, closing the door behind him. She's sandwiched.
S: EXT. TRAILER - THAT MOMENT
N: Gregg stops and turns around for one last look at the trailer as it drives off. Cecily exhales -- this love stuff is too hot to handle -- and follows Gregg.
S: 88A EXT./INT. TRUCK/STREET - NIGHT 88A
N: Jill sits nervously between Strasser and Garth as the trailer leaves the gate of the conservancy.
C: STRASSER
D: Don't worry, Jill. Soon Joe will be back home again.
N: Jill looks straight ahead.
S: 88B EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - NIGHT 88B
N: Gregg and Cecily walk back through the conservancy.
C: CECILY
D: How many minutes do you give it before the whole world knows he's missing?
E: wry
C: GREGG
D: Five. How many minutes do you give it before we're both lookin' through the want ads?
C: CECILY
D: Six.
N: They smile warmly at each other, respecting the sacrifice they've both just made. 91C. 88B CONTINUED: 88B Just then, Vern and Jack drive up in a Blazer. They stop next to Gregg and Cecily.
C: GREGG
D: What're you guys doing here so late?
N: Jack and Vern hop out of the car. Vern is carrying a cardboard box.
C: JACK
D: Baker wants the tent cleaned up A.S.A.P.
N: Vern holds out the box.
C: VERN
D: Check out the loot we plundered in the wake of mass party panic! This is some weird lost and found, man.
N: Vern pulls a single high-heeled shoe out of the box and hands it to Cecily.
C: JACK
D: Yeah, and we've got the fun job of getting this stuff back to everybody. Somebody's head is cold!
E: pulls out a toupee
N: Digging in the box again, Vern innocently pulls out the poacher's dog collar. It means nothing to him, but Gregg instantly grabs for it.
C: GREGG
D: Where did you find this?
E: alarmed
C: VERN
D: Oh -- that was by the habitat. Guess we've got to find those two guys again.
E: to Jack
C: GREGG
D: What two guys?
E: urgent
N: 91D. 88B CONTINUED: (2) 88B
C: JACK
D: That, uh... What do you think that one guy is? Russian? Lithuanian?
E: to Vern
N: It takes less than a second. Gregg springs into action, grabbing the keys to the Blazer out of Jack's hand. He sprints to the car. Jack and Vern watch him go.
C: CECILY
D: Be careful!
E: calling after him
N: They watch him go.
S: INT. CAB OF CONSERVANCY TRUCK - NIGHT
N: Jill glances nervously back as they drive down surface streets. She looks over at Strasser. In the passing light of the street lamps, he is regaining his sinister sheen. Garth is driving the trailer very fast. They hit a bump, making them lurch in their seat. Jill hears JOE go THUD in the trailer.
C: JILL
D: Please! Be careful...
C: STRASSER
D: Always worrying, eh? Your mother was a worrier, too. Always worrying about the gorillas. It made her a lot of enemies. It led to tragedy.
N: His tone has something vaguely malevolent in it. It rankles Jill.
C: JILL
D: My mother was brave.
C: STRASSER
D: So are you, my dear.
N: Jill looks at Strasser sharply. For the first time, she really notices his strange, leather hand. For reasons she's not yet conscious of, it scares her. Strasser notices that Jill is staring at his hand.
C: STRASSER
D: It's not so pretty, I know.
C: JILL
D: I'm sorry. What happened?
E: looking away beat
N: Strasser and Garth exchange amused glances.
C: STRASSER
D: Well... you could say I had an encounter with a monster. Monstrule.
E: in Roumanian
N: Strasser and Garth chuckle -- they think they're just sharing a private joke. But Jill has a troubled look in her eyes -- the foreign epithet has struck a chord from long ago... she struggles to remember... Then she gets it. She sees herself crouching in the forest with Joe over 12 years ago, overhearing Strasser's curses, and her blood runs cold. She glances at Strasser, everything dawning on her at once. The hand... the face... it all comes together for Jill. Strasser catches the look on Jill's face and knows some- thing is wrong. Adrenaline is pumping through her. Unsure of how to make her next move, Jill tries to hide the realization that is crashing down on her... She glances in the side view mirror of the truck and sees: Gregg, driving up behind them in the Conservancy vehicle. Jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but Strasser catches it. He follows her eye line, looking where she looked, and as he also spots Gregg, Jill knows the game is up. She loses it and screams:
C: JILL
D: Murdering bastard!
N: Jill slams her elbow into Strasser's nose. Strasser's face reflexively goes down in his hands. Stunned, Garth swerves at the wheel. Fast as lightning, Jill grabs his hair and slams his face into the dash. Before the men can recover, Jill kicks and claws her way over Strasser's back, fighting toward the open window... She reaches through the window and grabs onto the side view mirror. The truck door swings open and Jill sails out the door, dangling from her hold on the side view. The speeding truck swerves wildly, banging Jill again and again against the door. Gregg sees her and is horrified at the danger. He speeds up, trying to reach her... Strasser grabs for Jill, trying to pull her back into the truck... she kicks at him and loses her grasp on the side view mirror.
S: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
N: Jill falls, hitting the running board and bouncing hard onto the concrete roadway. Two CARS swerve and CRASH around her.
S: INT. TRAILER HOLD
N: JOE'S POV THROUGH the slats in the trailer, Joe sees Jill almost being hit by the cars. He goes crazy, trying to get out, rocking the trailer back and forth...
S: 91A EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT 91A
N: Jill lifts her head off the concrete and screams futilely after Joe:
C: JILL
D: Joe! Get out!
S: 91B INT. CAB OF CONSERVANCY TRUCK - THAT MOMENT 91B
N: Strasser looks back at Jill lying on the road and slams the truck door closed.
C: STRASSER
D: Drive!
E: to Garth
N: Garth FLOORS it. The truck speeds away.
S: 91C EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 91C
N: Gregg sees Jill up ahead and SLAMS on the BRAKES. He jumps out of his car and races to her side. He reaches her and scoops her away, narrowly saving her from being hit by another passing car.
S: 91D EXT. STREET/INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION 91D
N: The wheel flies through Garth's hand as he tries to control it. Strasser's face is covered in blood. The trailer rights itself. Continues on. thru thru
S: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Gregg checks Jill over. She is bruised and bloody, but she doesn't seem to notice. She just stares after the trailer and moans...
C: JILL
D: What have I done? Mother, oh, God, what have I done... Do you know who they are?
E: to herself to Gregg
C: GREGG
D: I know.
N: Gregg half-carries her to the truck.
C: GREGG
D: Come on. Let's go get him back.
N: They see the trailer disappear around the corner...
S: INT. CONSERVANCY TRUCK - CAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Garth tries desperately to steer the truck as the steering wheel burns through his hands.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIDER SHOT - NIGHT
N: The picture postcard version. Lots of neon. Tourists. Movie theaters flashing elaborate marquees. Gleaming Harleys parked in a row. INTO FRAME -- trailer -- -- weaves wildly. It clips a car coming the other way and begins to skid sideways through traffic. It enters the intersection kicking off sparks, sending cars swerving away. WIDEN as the truck jackknifes -- and -- skids to a stop -- the back at an acute angle to the cab. A second of eerie silence as -- Out of the stores and theaters, people run towards the accident. They encircle the truck. People press closer trying to get a look. A loud GROWL stops them cold. TILT UP -- top of trailer. -- Joe's fist punches through. WIDEN as Joe tears away the top and pulls himself free -- climbing up atop the truck. Its effect on the crowd is like Pandora opening her box. They all surge backwards. JOE'S POV Looking down at the horrified faces simply shouting at him. Confused by the blinding headlights and BLARING HORNS. People stampeded trying to get away -- some stumble on top of each other. LOW ANGLE - CAB Garth helps Strasser from the wreckage. Neither of them are that badly hurt.
C: STRASSER
D: Wait.
N: Strasser reaches back into the truck cab. Garth looks around, nervously.
C: GARTH
D: Police'll be here any minute.
N: Strasser pulls a leather case from the truck. Then he reaches back in for his hunter's hat -- and sets it firmly on his head. We haven't seen Strasser like this since twelve years earlier: the hunter is back. The sound of SIRENS reaches their ears. Garth is nervous as hell.
C: GARTH
D: We better go.
N: Strasser has the thousand yard stare. Garth has to drag him away.
C: GARTH
D: Come on! We need to get out of here!
N: The two of them leave the site of the accident, just as...
S: EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
N: Joe drops down from the truck. People on the street run up, take his picture, and run away.
C: TOURIST
D: Hey! It's that gorilla that was on TV!
N: BACK TO JOE FOLLOW Joe DOWN the boulevard, as he moves in a four- point walk through the intersection and along the boulevard. Two women coming out of a shop see Joe and scream -- that frightens Joe and makes him bare his fangs. Which only makes matters worse. He feints a charge -- and one woman collapses. JOE'S POV It is indeed an urban jungle -- made up of neon and steel. ANGLE Joe walks down the street and bumps into: PARKED MERCEDES Whose ALARM GOES OFF immediately. Joe wheels and smashes the car until the sound STOPS. CLOSE ON JOE The lights and loud VOICES blend into one single tumult -- dangerous and threatening. The sounds of SIRENS tell us the police are coming fast -- a block away we see two BLACK & WHITES SCREECH INTO VIEW. THROUGH the crowd we see a street kid, RAY, 13, come face- to-face with Joe. His eyes go wide with the wonder of Joe.
C: RAY
D: Whoa... Hey, Joe!
N: It's as if he's seeing a completely different animal than everyone else around him. It's a look we've seen in young Jill's eyes. Ray looks down the street at the approaching cop cars and back at Joe. He understands the danger. Ray points the right way for Joe to go, away from the police cars. Joe watches Ray closely, as if he were studying the boy's face. Then he moves off in the direction Ray was pointing, towards:
S: EXT. MANN'S CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT
N: Where patrons hang fearfully by the doors. Theatergoers rush back inside. CLOSE ON IMPRINTS for John Travolta and Donald Duck -- As an enormous gorilla foot descends on them. They split down the middle, then crumble into dust. INSIDE TICKET KIOSK A Mexican-American female ticket-taker hyperventilates, boxed in her tiny glass booth. From HER POV, Joe ducks down and stares at her, bringing his giant face close to the glass. She is speechless with fright. Joe moves on. Now the sounds of POLICE SIRENS can be heard APPROACHING. FIND Joe -- boxed in by the movie theater. Angry. He starts searching for a way out... ANGLE - STREET Just then -- two LAPD cars pull up. COPS jump out. They spot Joe...
C: COP
D: Up there!
N: The Cop points up to...
S: EXT. TOP OF MANN'S CHINESE
N: Joe uses his powerful muscles to scale the theater. He makes it to the top -- high over Hollywood. Behind him are hills and trees. Something familiar. BACK ON COPS They've got their guns aimed, but Joe disappears over the top of the theater.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. BOULEVARD - GREGG'S CAR
N: Gregg and Jill pull up to the overturned trailer, see the wreckage... but no sign of Joe. Stunned, they whirl around, hoping he'll still be somewhere in sight...
C: GREGG
D: He couldn't have gotten far.
N: Jill is overwhelmed with frustration. In seconds, she climbs on top of the overturned can and screams at the top of her lungs:
C: JILL
D: Joe! Joe!
E: screaming
N: Gregg sees a group of EXCITED NEIGHBORS run down the street towards Mann's Chinese screaming to each other:
C: EXCITED NEIGHBORS
D: This way!
N: Jill hops down and she and Gregg tear off down the street towards the gathered crowd at the Chinese Theater.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN
N: The world famous icon -- starkly white against the hill.
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN
N: PUSH IN CLOSE ON the "O." A shadow moves across the opening. CLOSER beat -- then Joe steps through. He's at the apex of the urban mountain range. JOE'S POV - WEST A beam of light is sweeping back and forth across the night sky. JOE PUSH IN CLOSE ON JOE -- he GROWLS as if he recognizes it. From this distance it looks like a flashlight beam. In Joe's mind it means only one thing -- Jill. He ROARS -- and moves off across the hill.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT
N: As Jill and Gregg run up, Cops are interviewing witnesses to Joe's flight. One CREW-CUT COP speaks into his walkie- talkie.
T: CREW-CUT COP
N: Orders are shoot to kill. He's extremely dangerous. Jill hears this and flips out. She almost attacks the Cop.
C: JILL
D: No! He's not dangerous! You're dangerous! You're dangerous!
E: screaming at Cop
N: The Cop gives Jill a look that says she's two seconds away from handcuffs.
C: GREGG
D: She didn't mean that.
E: to Officer
N: Gregg drags Jill away before she gets arrested.
C: JILL
D: Yes I did.
E: shouting back at Cop
C: GREGG
D: Better cool it, baby.
C: JILL
D: They're going to shoot him.
N: Gregg looks up over the facade of the theater to the hills beyond.
C: GREGG
D: Not if we find him first.
N: POLICE HELICOPTERS BUZZ by overhead.
C: GREGG
D: Let's follow them.
N: They run back towards their car.
S: EXT. ALLEY NEAR HOLLYWOOD BLVD.
N: Garth and Strasser watch as Jill and Gregg head off after Joe. Strasser opens the case he retrieved from the truck, starts assembling a hunting rifle. Garth looks at it in surprise.
C: GARTH
D: What are you doing? You don't think we can get the gorilla now, do you?
N: Strasser doesn't even bother to answer the question. He finishes loading his rifle.
C: STRASSER
D: We need a car. Now.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - NIGHT
N: A RUBBERNECKER sits in his car, a Range Rover, gawking at the police all over Hollywood Blvd. Then a hunting rifle ENTERS FRAME, pressing right against his cheek. The Rubbernecker doesn't even seem scared. He just shakes his head, annoyed.
C: RUBBERNECKER
D: Fifth goddamn time this year.
N: He grabs his soda from the cupholder, his garage door opener (Guy's been through this before) but before he can reach for his Thomas Guide... Garth hauls him out of the car and throws him on the ground.
C: RUBBERNECKER
D: Hey! I was going! No need to be so pushy about it.
N: Strasser and Garth jump in the car and drive away.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
N: Homes built into the dark green hills. FOLLOW a wooden fence -- a long wooden barrier that's been blown out of its mooring. A MAN in BOXER SHORTS runs out of his kitchen door. His wife behind him. Their DOG is WHINING at something from underneath their deck. POV SHOT - LOOKING THROUGH BACK YARD The couple can see all the way down back. Every fence has been knocked over. We TRACK THROUGH the back yards, PAST overturned lawn furniture and downed clotheslines. People stepping out of the doors -- confused. BACK TO MAN on cordless phone, surveying the damage.
C: BOXER SHORTS MAN
D: Is this L.A. County Animal Control...? You're not gonna believe this...
E: into phone
S: EXT. SEPULVEDA PASS - NIGHT
N: FIND Joe -- emerging from the thick growth. He can hear the NOISE like a rushing river O.S. He moves to the top of the crest. JOE'S POV - SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - NIGHT Where the hills are split by the river of light. Joe looks out over the freeway.
S: EXT. NIGHT-SCAPE
N: Joe can see the searchlights in the distance. The rushing river of light is an image Joe can't quite assimilate. But somehow Joe knows he must cross this "thing" to get to the hills on the other side.
S: EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
N: Joe steps into the first eight lanes of freeway traffic. We hear some SCREECHING and SKIDDING as the first four drivers of the first four CARS in each northbound lane spot Joe and slam on the BRAKES. Miraculously, nobody crashes. Bumpers remain uncrushed. Almost ceremoniously, the oncoming traffic comes to a respectful halt as Joe hesitantly lumbers past. It's almost like church. The freeway becomes quiet. Nobody honks. Nobody screams. Overcome with awe, a woman steps out of her car and just stands there in the middle of the freeway, watching Joe pass. Others follow suit. Joe climbs the center divider. The same thing happens in the southbound lane. As Joe disappears up the hill on the other side, the stunned drivers simply stare in disbelief. L.A. is in awe.
S: INT. CONSERVANCY VEHICLE (FREEWAY OVERPASS)
N: Gregg and Jill arrive on the scene. They look down from the overpass and see cops swarming around the area where Joe was, shining their flashlights into the brush and talking to motorists.
C: GREGG
D: Any idea where he might've headed?
N: ON JILL -- drifting off, as something O.S. catches her attention.
C: JILL
D: Look.
N: She points out THROUGH the windshield. LONG SHOT - JILL'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD Shining over the horizon, coming from somewhere near the ocean, is a searchlight, piercing the night sky. The image is as familiar to Jill as it was to Joe. BACK TO SCENE
C: JILL
D: That's where he'll go. He'll think that's me calling him.
N: Gregg steps on the accelerator. As their car pulls away, PAN TO Strasser and Garth following a few car lengths behind. HELICOPTER SHOT - MOVING ACROSS BAY - NIGHT The moon-striped water surges and ebbs as we SKIM the waves, RUSHING TOWARDS --
S: EXT. PALISADES OCEAN PARK - NIGHT
N: A festival of lights. Rides, arcades, lots of people. CLOSE ON SEARCHLIGHT A kettle light rotating on its base. CAMERA CRANES UP THROUGH the klieg beams REVEALING the park -- CONTINUE TO CRANE UP 'til we see, towering over everything, the new Ferris wheel -- a neon blur spinning grandly against the moon-bright sky.
S: EXT. PALISADES OCEAN PARK - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
N: Quintessentially American images of beach-side amusement park. A carnival-like atmosphere. ANGLE - ARCHWAY ENTRANCE Some couples stop to take their photos, kissing under the iconic neon arch that welcomes people to the park. YOUNG COUPLE stops to share the view -- and a kiss. Until a LOUD GROWL makes them jump back. Joe has appeared under the arch. The young girl screams -- her boyfriend pulls her back. JOE'S POV It's like a slow-motion panic. The noise and tumult of the crowded park keeps people from hearing the screams right away. One toddler smiles and waves at Joe until his mother snatches him and runs for dear life. AT FERRIS WHEEL A crowd of kids waits in line. One of them, a particularly appealing little boy named JASON, is having a conversation with his MOTHER. She has the aura of a single mom about her, and she clearly adores her sweet-faced kid.
C: JASON
D: Mom, I don't think I can let you go on the ferris wheel.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Why not?
C: JASON
D: Because the last time after you ate two hot dogs, you threw up, remember?
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: What if I promised to throw up over the side?
N: They both giggle at her joke.
C: JASON
D: Mom, I think I should do this ride by myself.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Okay... I'll watch you.
E: reluctant
N: TILT UP TO the wheel turning majestically -- filled with kids. Some wave from the chairs as they crest -- it feels like they're flying over the ocean below. We NOTICE two girls (JENNY, seven, and EMMA, nine) as they come over the top. On the way down, they can see the crowd parting below as Joe ENTERS FRAME. At the base of the great wheel -- parents are finally hearing the commotion. BY LIGHT Joe arrives at his destination -- the bright light that drew him here. He's confused by the fact that Jill's nowhere to be found. Desperately, he scans the park... People scream and panic around Joe. The noise drives him deeper into the park, searching for Jill. Meanwhile -- AT ARCADE - BIG SAFARI BOOTH Three college guys shoot replica AIR GUNS at cardboard lions and elephants, setting off fake explosions in a "Big Safari" booth. JOE feels threatened and recoils. Then he continues past them. The rush of people away from him gets more frenzied.
S: EXT. PARK ENTRANCE - SAME TIME
N: Jill and Gregg run under the archway. People rush past them. They fight their way through the crowd.
C: JILL
D: He's gotta be here. Do you see him?
N: Gregg and Jill scan the amusement park, looking for the source of all the commotion.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: Garth and Strasser have parked at the edge of the amusement park. Strasser has the rifle out and propped up on one knee. He uses the scope as a viewfinder. STRASSER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE - JILL AND GREGG running towards the carnival games. BACK TO SCENE Garth puts his hand on the barrel of the gun and pulls it away from Strasser's eye. He's so nervous he's almost chuckling.
C: GARTH
D: Hold on, now -- just who are you aiming at?
E: very nervous
N: Strasser looks at Garth with deadly focus. His eyes tell the story. Garth realizes his boss's intentions with horror.
C: GARTH
D: No. You can't do that.
C: STRASSER
D: If that girl starts telling people who we really are, our whole cover operation will be blown.
N: Strasser aims his rifle again.
C: GARTH
D: She's not an animal. That's a human being you're about to kill.
N: Strasser fixes Garth with an icy stare.
C: STRASSER
D: Go wait in the car.
N: He raises the gun again, gets the sight lined up just as Gregg and Jill pass near the klieg light. Garth grabs the gun, just as Strasser is about to pull the trigger.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARK - NIGHT
N: BLAM! Strasser's SHOT, altered by Garth, hits the klieg light behind Jill and Gregg. The LIGHT EXPLODES -- GLASS SHATTERS. Gregg pulls Jill to the ground, as... Sparks shoot out of the klieg light, a few of them hitting the ubiquitous sawdust and straw that buffers the floors of many rides. It takes only one second before there is a flame that begins to spread in a SIZZLING POOL of OIL right at the base of the Ferris wheel. ANGLE - IN BACK OF FERRIS WHEEL The FLAME dances over an oil slick and engulfs several sacks of sawdust. It smolders -- then ERUPTS in a much larger conflagration. FIND one parent (Jenny and Emma's MOTHER) who is nervously waiting for her children near the bottom of the Ferris wheel. She hears the HISS of the FIRE and sees the shadows cast by the flames. She moves away from the other parents -- into -- POV SHOT -- as she now sees the fire attacking the Ferris wheel.
C: JENNY'S MOTHER
D: Oh God...
N: The Ferris wheel operator sprays an industrial extinguisher on the flames. He crawls underneath the machine where the fire is worst.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARKING LOT
N: Strasser, extremely pissed off, turns to look at Garth.
C: STRASSER
D: That was very stupid, Garth.
C: GARTH
D: You're not a hunter, you're a murderer, and I won't be a part of this...
N: Strasser flips the gun and cracks Garth squarely in the head with the rifle butt. Garth hits the ground like a bag of sand.
C: STRASSER
D: Anything else on your mind?
N: Strasser turns to look back at the park. He no longer has a clear shot at Jill. He realizes he's going to have to move in close. From his jacket he takes a .45 caliber semi-automatic Match Master and a barrel extension which he screws on with great concentration using his gloved hand. Strasser begins to work his way into the park.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARK - NIGHT
N: Jill and Gregg pick themselves up off the ground.
C: JILL
D: What was that?
N: Then they spot the fire, spreading to the Ferris wheel. Gregg turns to Jill.
C: GREGG
D: Go find Joe, get him out of here. I'm gonna see if I can help.
E: looking towards the wheel
N: Gregg moves off towards the Ferris wheel. JILL heads over to the carnival games.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Strasser, calm and totally committed to his course of action moves through the pandemonium of the crowd, gun by his side.
T: CUT TO:
N: AT FERRIS WHEEL Parents are shouting, crowding the Ferris wheel. Two operators are unloading children as quickly as they can. They look like they are about to be overwhelmed but then... Gregg ENTERS FRAME. He vaults the guard rail, starts unloading children right from their moving cars. There is utter chaos, children screaming, fire and smoke. CRANE UP PAST the terrified faces of the children who have to wait, 'til we GET TO Jenny and Emma. Jenny turns to see the fire beneath them. FIRE is really starting to burn out of control now. It has spread to the engine of the FERRIS WHEEL, which, heated to the bursting point, suddenly EXPLODES. The ride operator with the fire extinguisher is blown through the air, and the Ferris wheel lurches to a halt. JENNY AND EMMA grip their safety bar as their bucket swings back and forth. Emma nearly falls out -- until Jenny grabs her and holds her tight.
C: JENNY
D: Mo-om!!
C: JENNY'S MOTHER
D: Oh my God! Somebody help!
N: Gregg -- sees the girls, their bucket having come to a stop about fifteen feet off the ground. Thinking quickly, he jumps up on the guard railing, then leaps across to their bucket. He just grabs onto the bottom. The bucket shakes back and forth violently, causing the two girls to scream. Gregg looks up at them.
C: GREGG
D: Don't be scared. Climb down my back.
N: The girls look at Gregg, too nervous to move.
C: GREGG
D: Come on.
N: Tentatively, Jenny and Emma climb out of their bucket and onto Gregg's back, using him like a human ladder. They shimmy down to his feet, then drop off, one by one, into the waiting arms of their mother. Gregg lets go of the bucket, drops a good fifteen feet, landing roughly. The girls' mother looks down at Gregg, thankfully.
C: JENNY'S MOTHER
D: Thank you! Oh God, thank you!
N: Gregg, winded, just nods.
T: CUT TO:
S: EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
N: A phalanx of cop cars races up to the park.
S: EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR CARNIVAL GAMES
N: Jill moves through the maze of carnival games. She spots Joe, moving through the small buildings, clearly disoriented. She yells out...
C: JILL
D: Joe! Joe!!
N: But above the tumult, he can't hear her. Jill pushes her way towards him, when she comes face to face with... Strasser. Just yards away. He flashes his sickening smile, raises his gun... ON JILL -- a look of terror crossing her face as she realizes she's about to die. Then, as a shadow passes over her, her expression of terror melts away. ON STRASSER -- seeing Jill's expression, his smile fades. Why's she so calm all of a sudden? He doesn't even need to turn around to know that: Joe is behind him. As Strasser turns slowly around, Joe reaches down swiftly and hoists Strasser off the ground. The GUN GOES OFF, barely missing Joe. JOE ROARS and crushes Strasser's left hand in his paw, a bone-crunching, slow squeeze that makes Strasser scream in agony. Then Joe swings Strasser around and grabs him around the chest with his right paw. He pulls him close to his face and blasts a DEAFENING ROAR into his face. Joe cocks his arm and heaves Strasser with mighty force into the air. Screaming, Strasser hurtles through space with incredible speed, CRASHING right through the flaming signage of the "Big Safari" booth, sending out a SHOWER OF SPARKS... ... and continues flying through the air until WHACK! He hangs up on a power line. Strasser slips down, catching his fall with his fake hand. This section of the LINE is safe, but directly below it is a cluster of electrical junction boxes. Cracked and blistered by the heat of the nearby fire, they are sparking dangerously -- to fall on to them would mean certain
T: electrocution.
N: Strasser's bad hand begins to slip from the wire. Desperate, he reaches up with his left hand to grab on -- only to remember that this hand has just been crushed by Joe, and is useless to him now. Strasser helplessly watches as his prosthetic comes unclasped from his hand and he slips the last, fatal fraction of an inch. Strasser falls onto the junction boxes, which explode in a shower of sparks. Strasser sizzles and dies, while above him, the prosthesis still swings on the wire.
S: EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS ACTION
N: Jill stands where she is, frozen at the horrible sight of what has just happened. A dozen people scream and recoil. A swarm of policemen, led by Commander Gorman, watch Joe's violent action in stunned silence. Gorman motions to his men.
C: COMMANDER GORMAN
D: Get the marksmen up here! Now!
N: Jill knows what's coming. Convincing Gorman is hopeless. She runs to Joe. Fearing for his life, she calls for him to follow her deeper into the park.
C: JILL
D: Come on, Joe. Come on.
N: FERRIS WHEEL Gregg is catching his breath on the ground near the Ferris wheel. Jill runs up to him, Joe close behind.
C: JILL
D: Joe got Strasser. He was trying to kill me.
E: breathlessly
C: GREGG
D: I know. I just hope they do.
N: He motions to the cops, who have set up at the park's edge. CLOSE ON JOE He's not looking at the cops. He's focused on the Ferris wheel. The fire is burning near the metal supports that hold it upright. With each passing minute, the wheel's moorings are getting looser. PAN UP TO a bucket at the very top of the wheel. Two small hands hold on for dear life. He starts moving towards it.
C: JILL
D: Joe?
N: In the next instant, Joe has started running for the wheel.
C: JILL
D: Joe!
N: COPS are getting into firing squad position. A SHARPSHOOTER follows Joe through his scope.
C: SHARPSHOOTER
D: Talk about an easy target.
E: to fellow cop
N: SHARPSHOOTER'S POV He's got Joe right in his crosshairs, when...
C: GREGG
D: Stop!
E: O.S.
N: Gregg and Jill run into the crosshairs, waving their arms.
C: GREGG
D: Don't shoot him.
N: Commander Gorman comes forward, yelling at Gregg.
C: COMMANDER GORMAN
D: Get out of the way. Get back. Ready...
E: to Gregg to cops
C: JILL
D: Stop! He's not dangerous, please...
N: The Commander is furious at these two civilians keeping him from his job. He barks orders to two cops:
C: COMMANDER GORMAN
D: Get them out of here! Now!
E: to two cops
N: The cops are about to move on Gregg and Jill when Jason's Mother, panic-stricken, runs up to Gorman.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Officer, help! I can't find my son! I think he's still on the Ferris wheel.
C: JILL
D: Look!
N: Everyone turns to look at the Ferris wheel... SHARPSHOOTER follows Joe's ascent through his viewfinder. HIS POV - TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL A frightened six-year-old boy pops his head up from a bucket. Everyone is stunned as they see this lone child -- trapped at the top.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Oh my God! Jason!
E: in agony
N: PAN DOWN to reveal -- Joe is heading straight for Jason. Massive muscles pulling him up higher, towards the endangered boy. ON GORMAN ready to shoot Joe. Jill turns to Jason's Mother, quietly pleading.
C: JILL
D: He'll save your boy.
N: 114A. Jason's Mother looks at Jill, panicking. She swallows hard and turns to Gorman.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Don't shoot. Let him try.
E: beat
N: Gorman looks at Jason's Mother, then at Joe. Then at the boy at the top of the Ferris wheel. He motions to his men.
C: GORMAN
D: Hold your fire.
S: EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NEAR TOP
N: Joe climbing with all his strength, comes to the top of the Ferris wheel. ON JASON -- staring, wide-eyed, at this miraculous animal. He watches, in awe, as Joe extends a massive hand and lifts him out of his seat. ON GROUND All eyes watch, in awe, as Joe presses Jason to his massive chest. ON JILL -- smiling through tears. Gregg puts an arm around her. BEHIND THEM Camera crews from local TV news stations have poured into the park. They film all of this. AT BASE OF WHEEL The wood attached to the metal supports has completely burned through. With a terrible CRACKING sound, the SUPPORTS begin to tear away. Another EXPLOSION rocks the WHEEL. It SHUDDERS.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Oh, please, no...
N: WIDEN SHOT -- The Ferris wheel begins to tip over. ON JILL -- a look of horror passes over her face as well.
C: GREGG
D: It's going to tip! Everyone back up!
N: Everyone starts backing away from the wheel. The wheel seems to fall slowly -- like in a dream -- sending debris and flames spilling across the park. ON JOE As he cradles Jason tight in his arms. The wheel begins to fall towards the ground. Joe jumps away from the burning wheel -- POV SHOT As the ground comes rushing up at him. JOE hits hard, just clearing the falling wheel by inches. He doesn't move. PAN the crowd -- an eerie silence falls over everyone. The only sound the CRACKLING of the FIRE. JILL breaks free from Gregg and runs toward Joe. Jason's Mother races with her. ON JOE Motionless on his back. Still cupping the boy, nestled and protected against his massive chest. A beat -- then Jason looks up from Joe --
C: JASON
D: Mom?
N: Jason's Mother bursts into joyous sobs as her son climbs into her arms. A general sense of relief passes through the crowd, except for... JILL She kneels by Joe stroking his great chest. Joe doesn't respond. Jill bows her head and cries deeply. People back away to give her room. How strange to see this huge, powerful animal stilled. Gregg comes and kneels by Joe's side. He checks for a heart beat. For wounds. Joe doesn't stir. Gregg is devastated, too. PAN CROWD... Firemen, paramedics and television reporters run through the park. The paramedics lead off the wounded. Still holding her boy, Jason's Mother comes forward. She recognizes what Jill is going through her own version of mother's grief. She approaches respectfully...
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: I'm so sorry...
N: Jill is beyond comfort. She's in another world. Humming their lullaby, she rests her soft cheek in Joe's giant paw for the last time. Her blonde hair spills on his fingers... And then, SLOWLY ENTERING FRAME, a giant finger reaches for Jill's cheek and strokes it gently... It takes Jill a moment to realize she hasn't imagined this... she opens her eyes, sees the moving fingers, turns to look into Joe's face, just as his eyes open... Elated, Jill moves up to Joe's head and kisses his face a thousand times. Gregg takes a deep breath, privately thanking God. Jason's Mother is tearful -- Jason is all smiles. Jill tearfully blathers soothing words...
C: JILL
D: That's right, Joe -- that's right, big guy. That was a big fall but you're okay, aren't you? You're tough. You're so tough. Yes you are. Yes you are.
E: kissing Joe's head
C: GREGG
D: We've got to get him checked out. And get him somewhere safe.
E: checking Joe over looking around at crowd
N: Jill looks at Gregg with a heavy heart.
C: JILL
D: Somewhere safe? Where is that?
E: bitter/rhetorical
N: Jason's Mother breaks in timidly.
C: JASON'S MOTHER
D: Perhaps... I mean, maybe... isn't there anything we can do?
E: stammering
N: Jason pushes in front of his mother. He reaches out his little hand and pets Joe. He looks up at Jill and Gregg with a shining face and smiles hopefully. (ALTERNATE END OF SCENE) Jill shakes her head at the mother and continues to pet Joe softly.
C: JILL
D: No. I don't think so. Not unless you have a few million dollars on you to buy him a home somewhere.
E: kindly
N: Jason's mother nods hopelessly, comprehending the difficulty of the situation. But Jason has also heard Jill's words. He pushes in front of his mother, reaches into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled dollar bill. He hands it to Jill and Gregg with a shining face and smiles hopefully.
C: JASON
D: Here. For Joe.
N: Gregg and Jill are moved by the gesture. Gregg respect- fully takes the dollar from the little boy while everyone looks on.
C: GREGG
D: Thanks.
N: Gorman and his men exchange glances, also touched by the little boy's deed. Now Gorman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ten. He comes forward and hands it to Gregg.
C: GORMAN
D: For Joe.
N: Now the other cops are reaching into their pockets. They come forward with dollars in their hands.
C: COPS
D: Here. For Joe.
N: Gregg's hands and pockets are being stuffed with money as dozens of people begin to come forward with whatever they can afford. Gregg looks at Jill, overwhelmed by what's happening, and her face echoes his emotions...

N: The blue sky above Africa. CRANE DOWN to see: An entry gate with the words "Joe Young Wildlife Park" printed across the top. Beneath the gate: Kweli, standing with Jill and Gregg, is blowing a ceremonial horn, sending an ancient blessing into the air. As he finishes, we hear applause. PULL BACK to reveal 35 people -- locals, villagers, friends -- applauding the opening of the park. Voiceover begins:
C: JILL
D: Dear Cecily: I promised to write you when Joe was settled and now I finally can. We finally dedicated the Joe Young Wildlife Park last week and it was one of the happiest days of my life. At last I have kept my promise to my mother.

N: Joe swats Gregg to the ground and takes his place next to Jill.
C: JILL
D: Well... almost all gone.
E: V.O.
N: Not completely amused, Gregg picks himself up and raises a warning finger at Joe. Joe looks over at him, and purses his lips at Gregg, as if laughing at his own rough play. Joe turns and walks away up the hillside. Jill helps Gregg up. He puts his arm around her and kisses her hair. They watch Joe go.
C: JILL
D: It's been a long journey getting to this place, but Joe is finally home. I think we all are.
